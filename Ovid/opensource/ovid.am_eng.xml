<head>Life of Ovid</head>
<p>After  a lapse of more than eighteen centuries little can be expected to be added that is new to former accounts of a Poet so well known and so highly esteemed as Ovid. The reader of this slight sketch, therefore, must not look for any novelty of information in it, for such has long ago been unattainable, but must be satisfied if the facts which it contains are taken with due fidelity and diligence from the accounts of preceding writers. This all that has been attempted in the present case;  and as the best authorities on the subject have been consulted, it is presumed the Life of Ovid which follows will be as full and correct as any that have gone before it.
</p>
<p>Publius Ovidius Naso, one of the finest poets of the Augustan age, was descended from the ancient family of Nasones, who had preserved the dignity of Roman Knights from the original institution of that order. He was born at <placeName key="perseus,Sulmo">Sulmo</placeName>, a city of the Peligni, <date value="-43-03-20">on the 14th of the Calends of April, in the consulship of Hirtius and Pansa, who were both slain at the battle of Mutina, against Antony, being the year of Rome 710, and forty-three years before the birth of our Saviour</date>. From his earliest youth he was much addicted to poetry, in which he soon evinced an excellent fancy and great natural powers; but being continually reproved by his father for following so unprofitable a study, he, though with an unwilling mind, forsook the pleasant walks of the Muses to travel in the rugged paths of the law. For this purpose he became the pupil of Aurelius Fuscus and Portius Latro, of whose learning and eloquence he was a great admirer. <placeName key="tgn,2652379">Seneca</placeName> records the improvements he made under these eminent masters, Ovid being named by him among the principal orators of those times.  His speeches were witty, brief, and full of persuasion; yet still the poet so predominated over the orator, they might be called rather poetic prose than rhetorical declamations. He passed through the minor forms of the forum with credit, and was advanced to be one of the triumviri, a post of great dignity and importance, having cognizance of capital causes.
</p>
<p>At this period he was noticed by Augustus, who honoured him with permission to wear the laticlave, a distinction peculiar to senators and persons of consular dignity. Had he continued at the bar, the favour of the emperor might probably have been further instrumental in promoting his welfare; but inheriting an easy fortune by the death of his father and elder brother, he grew impatient of the toil of legal studies and the clamours of litigious assemblies. He therefore retired from all public affairs, and in that leisure in which he so much delighted pursued those beloved studies which he had with such reluctance abandoned.  Yet so great was the mutual affection between him and Varro, that in a short time after he accepted of a command under him, and served in the wars of <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, from whence, returning by the way of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, he remained at that celebrated city until he had attained the Greek language in its utmost perfection.
</p>
<p>Returning from <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, his fine parts were soon distinguished by the Roman wits, and introduced him to Horace, Tibullus, Macer, Severus, Gallus, and other eminent poets and wits of the day. He himself enumerates these writers among the number of his friends, and says, that some of them communicated their writings to him, but tells us that he had only seen Virgil, Ovid being only twenty-four years old when that great poet died. His conversation was affable and agreeable, and his manners so polished that he was said to be the most accomplished gentleman in the Augustan court, where he was so well received, that not a few of consular dignity, and ladies of the highest rank, honoured him with their friendship, and, to show their estimation of his genius, wore his picture in rings cut in precious stones.
</p>
<p>Ovid had an ample patrimony in the territories of <placeName key="perseus,Sulmo">Sulmo</placeName>, but he resided mostly at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, or retired to his pleasant gardens in the <placeName key="tgn,6006324">Appian Way</placeName>, where he was accustomed to recreate himself with the Muses. He was three times married: his first wife probably was not his own choice, he having married her while he was yet a youth, and therefore he soon afterwards repudiated her; nor was he more fortunate in his second wife, for, as was frequently the custom among the Romans, he divorced her also soon after their marriage, although she was a lady of noble birth and unexceptionable conduct. His third wife, Perilla, he has often celebrated for her beauty and virtue; he instructed her in poetry, and, till his death, held her in the highest esteem and regard: nor was her affection in the least inferior to his, for during the time of his banishment she lived like a sorrowful widow, and continued an exemplary faithfulness to him to the end.
</p>
<p>The best part of our poet's life was passed in the enjoyment of his friends and the Muses; but, in his declining years, by some indiscretion, or the accidental discovery of some passages at court, he incurred the displeasure of Augustus and by him was banished, at fifty years of age, to Tomos (now Tomeswar), a maritime town in Lower Moesia, on the coast of the Euxine or <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Black Sea</placeName>, about thirty-six miles from the most southern mouth of the <placeName key="tgn,7012913">Danube</placeName>. The cause of his banishment is not precisely known, and various conjectures have been started on the subject. By some it has been asserted, that he was banished for the too great freedom of his Elegies and his Art of Love; but this seems an improbable conjecture for neither the age in which he lived, nor the court which he adorned, were very remarkable for severity of manners or correctness of morals. Another conjecture is, that he was banished for some favors which he received from Julia, the daughter of Augustus, whom he is supposed to have celebrated under the name of <placeName key="tgn,2044648">Corinna</placeName> in his Elegies. But that this conjecture is unfounded, is proved (as Aldus Manutius has shown) by Ovid's saying, that his exile was owing to two causes, his writing amorous verses, and to his having been an undesigned spectator of the guilt of others. His banishment not having taken place till he was fifty years old, although his acquaintance with <placeName key="tgn,2044648">Corinna</placeName> commenced when he was about twenty; and his avowed attachment to Corinna, even in those verses where he deplores his misfortune and disgrace, are circumstances utterly inconsistent with the suggestion that he had a criminal intercourse with <placeName key="tgn,2428631">Julia</placeName>, or that <placeName key="tgn,2428631">Julia</placeName> was shadowed under the name of <placeName key="tgn,2044648">Corinna</placeName>. It may be gathered, also, from the whole contexture of the verses that are made to that mistress, that <placeName key="tgn,2044648">Corinna</placeName> was not a woman of the highest quality.
</p>
<p>Whatever his fault was, Augustus continued inexorable, nor could the most submissive importunities and flattering addresses of our poet, though often repeated, get him recalled, or even so much as removed to a better place of banishment. He praised the Emperor with such an extravagance as bordered upon idolatry, and made an idol of him literally, as soon as he heard of his death, for he not only composed his elegy, but consecrated a chapel to him, where he went every morning to invocate him.  The successor, no doubt, had his share in this adoration, and was probably the real motive to it; but all proved ineffectual. The court continued as inexorable under <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName> as it had been under Augustus, and the unhappy <placeName key="tgn,2562923">Ovid</placeName> died in exile at near sixty years of age. His death, according to Apuleius, happened the same day with that of the historian Livy. He was, as he has described himself, of a pale complexion, middle stature, slender, and not large-limbed, yet strong and nervous. The barbarians among whom he died so greatly honoured and respected him, that they made a general mourning at his death, and buried him in a stately monument before the gates of their city. The territory of Tomeswar now forms part of the vast empire of <placeName key="tgn,7002435">Russia</placeName>, and a few years ago the remains of our Poet's monument were discovered. It was then designed by the Empress Catherine (a princess of magnificent intentions), to have built a city on the spot, which was to have borne the name of the bard; but as it is easier to design than to perform, to intend than to execute, the imperial suggestion of building a town in honnor of the poet, like a romantic vision fell to the ground.
</p>
<p>It now only remains for us to say something of our author as a writer. If the imitation of nature be the business of a poet, <placeName key="tgn,2071526">Ovid</placeName> is unrivalled, especially in the descriptions of the passions. His thoughts, which are the pictures of those passions, are such as naturally arise from those disorderly emotions of our spirits. It is not speaking of his wit too partially, to observe, that such was the copiousness of it, and such its exuberance, that he often writes too pointedly for his subject, that he often makes his personages speak more eloquently than propriety of character will admit of. Yet this is only the fault of a great and polished genius, and he seems to have discovered this imperfection in his riper years, for his later productions are free from it  But this alloy in <placeName key="tgn,2071526">Ovid</placeName>'s writing is sufficiently recompensed by his other excellencies; and, indeed, the fault itself is not without its beauties, for the most severe critic can scarcely but be pleased with the prodigality of his wit, though, at the same time, he could have wished that the master of it had been a better manager. "Every thing he does," to quote the language of a great poet of our own country, Dryden, who studied and translated <placeName key="tgn,2071526">Ovid</placeName> with equal care and elegance, "becomes him; and if sometimes he appears too gay, yet there is a secret gracefulness of youth which accompanies his writings, though the staidness and sobriety of age be wanting. In the most material part, which is the conduct, it is certain that he seldom has miscarried."
</p>
<p>The Art of Love has been generally admitted to be one of the most perfect pieces of Ovid. Indeed it was a subject to which the whole business of his life was devoted, and therefore it was scarcely possible he could fail of treating it in a masterly manner.
</p>
<p>So gentle was our poet's Muse, that he was never known to write but one severe poem, and that was against Cornificus, (under the feigned name of Ibis,) who solicited his wife in his absence, and laboured against the repeal of his banishment.
</p>
<p>The works of Ovid are well known, and his poetical talents have justly ranked him among the first of Roman poets. But it is not necessary here to speak at length of any except such as compose the present volume. With regard to the "Art of Love," it may justly be styled a correct and finished poem, abounding in graceful thoughts and happy allusions, and the whole exquisitely polished. It is recorded of the Emperor Aelius Verus, that he was so delighted with this work that he often read it in bed, and laid it under his pillow when he went to sleep. Latter critics are equally profuse in their praises of the same work; and Ciofanus says, that Ovid was so excellently skilled in the Latin tongue, that if the Roman language was utterly lost, and nothing left but his works, they alone would be sufficient to retrieve it. Some over-scrupulous persons have affected to perceive danger in some of the maxims inculcated in the Art of Love, but their greatest offence seems to have been in the title of that work; and they have overlooked the circumstance, that our author has prescribed a Remedy for Love, which may serve to correct any of the mischiefs that are likely to spring from the first named treatise. Indeed, some ingenious commentators have supposed, that Ovid designed, under the allegory of physical and sensual love, to recommend to his disciples excellent rules to acquire the virtues and science represented under the name of the Muses, or ladies of various beauty, who were to be met with everywhere, especially in great academies, in the schools, in courts, in walks, and in holy places, figured by the theatres, galleries, porticos, and temples of the Roman deities, where great assemblies were held. By putting this interpretation upon the Art of Love, it will then be easy to make the reading of it not only agreeable and innocent, but profitable.
</p>
<p>Of his Elegies it may be observed, that some of them are tender and delicate, others witty and sprightly, and a few more free and unreserved in their expression. The best are those which have a pathetic character, for as they were composed, for the most, to alleviate the melancholy hours of our poet's banishment, it was natural to suppose that his Muse would find more relief in tender and soothing strains than when employed on gayer subjects, which would only serve to remind him of his former condition, and aggravate his unhappiness, by fruitless comparisons of his present with his past situation. The style of them varies according to the rank of the person to whom they are addressed, or the subjects on which they are composed. The style of those addressed to his mistress is tenderly passionate and courtly; that of the Elegies to Nape and <placeName key="tgn,1121604">Bagoe</placeName>, his mistress's waiting-women, is in a lower style, and more suitable to the conditions of the persons to whom they are addressed. When Ovid treats of the immortality of the Muses, as he does in the last elegy of the first book, or pours out a mournful strain to the memory of Tibullus, we are equally delighted with the grandeur of his ideas, and melted with the tenderness of his sentiments. In a word, Ovid is, throughout, a perfect poet, and, as such, will always give delight to readers of sensibility and taste.  His views of nature are so clear, his delineations of the passions are so just, and his reflections upon them so correct, that he must be a reader frigid, even to indifference, whose fancy is not delighted, whose heart is not warmed, or whose judgment is not improved, by his writings.
</p>
<p>We shall conclude this brief sketch of a man whose name will endure as long as poetry exists, with the following epitaph, which he composed for himself, and which is exquisitely beautiful for its simplicity:

<quote lang="en"><lg type="heroic"><l>Here Ovid lies, who sung of tender love,</l>
<l>Yet liv'd the danger of his wit to prove;</l>
<l>To you, true lovers, he makes one request,</l>
<l>As you pass by, to say, - May Ovid rest.</l></lg></quote>

</list>
</p>
<p>The <title>Court of Love</title>, here called "A Tale from Chaucer," is adapted from a poem preserved in only one manuscript (Library of Trinity College, <placeName key="tgn,7011980">Cambridge</placeName>, R.3.19).  It was attributed to Chaucer by Stowe in his <date value="1561">1561</date> edition, and accepted by other editors thereafter, but it is not actually Chaucer's work.  Skeat prints it with other apocryphal works in the Supplement (<date value="1897">1897</date>)to his 6-volume edition of Chaucer (<placeName key="tgn,7011931">Oxford</placeName>, <date value="1894">1894</date>).  Based on its language, he dates it to the <dateRange from="1500" to="1550">early 16th century</dateRange>. The pseudo-Chaucerian <title>Court of Love</title> is 1442 lines long, in rhyme royal stanzas (7 lines rhymed <hi rend="ital">abbaacc</hi>).  The adaptation, only a bit over 300 lines and in heroic couplets, omits the detailed recounting of the Laws of Love which makes up the bulk of the earlier poem;  it also omits the "Birds' Matins" that closes the poem.
</p>
<p>The combination of Chaucer and Ovid is not as arbitrary as it might appear, since Ovid was one of the major influences on Chaucer.  Chaucer's <title>Legends of Good Women</title>, in particular, uses Ovid's <bibl n="Ov. Ep.">Heroides</bibl> as a significant source.

<l>You, who in Cupid's roll inscribe your name,</l>
<l>First seek an object worthy of your flame;<note anchored="yes" place="foot" resp="ed">The poet here gives his advice as to three things: to seek after an amiable object: to win it by respect and complacency, and not to lose it after once gotten.</note></l>
<l>Then strive, with art, your lady's mind to gain;</l>
<l>And last, provide your love may long remain.</l>
<l>On these three precepts all my work shall move:</l>
<l>These are the rules and principles of love.</l>
<l>Before your youth with marriage is oppress't,<note anchored="yes" place="foot" resp="ed">That is, while you are a freeman, unmarried, and not engaged to any other mistress. The truest meaning that can be given, is, that while you are young, and are not yet troubled with the infirmities of age (for an old man in love is ridiculous) choose where you please.</note></l>
<l>Make choice of one who suits your humour best</l>
<l>And such a damsel drops not from the sky;</l>
<l>She must be sought for with a curious eye.</l>
<l>The wary angler, in the winding brook,</l>
<l>Knows what the fish, and where to bait his hook.</l>
<l>The fowler and the huntsman know by name</l>
<l>The certain haunts and harbour of their game.</l>
<l>So must the lover beat the likeliest grounds;</l>
<l>Th' Assemblies where his quarries most abound:</l>
<l>Nor shall my novice wander far astray;</l>
<l>These rules shall put him in the ready way.</l>
<l>Thou shalt not fail around the continent,</l>
<l>As far as Perseus or as <placeName key="tgn,7008038">Paris</placeName> went:</l>
<l>For <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> alone affords thee such a store,</l>
<l>As all the world can hardly shew thee more.</l>
<l>The face of heav'n with fewer stars is crown'd,</l>
<l>Than beauties in the Roman sphere are found.</l>
<l>Whether thy love is bent on blooming youth,</l>
<l>On dawning sweetness, in unartful truth;</l>
<l>Or courts the juicy joys of riper growth;</l>
<l>Here may'st thou find thy full desires in both:</l>
<l>Or if autumnal beauties please thy sight</l>
<l>(An age that knows to give and take delight;)</l>
<l>Millions of matrons, of the graver sort,</l>
<l>In common prudence, will not balk the sport.</l>
<l>In summer's heats thou need'st but only go</l>
<l>To Pompey's cool and shady portico;<note anchored="yes" place="foot" resp="ed">This was a shady walk which Pompey built for the people; and there were several in <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> of the same sort; but the most admirable one of all the porticos, was the Corinthian, near the Flaminian cirque, built by Cneius Octavius.</note></l>
<l>Or Concord's fane; or that proud edifice</l>
<l>Whose turrets near the bawdy suburbs rise;</l>
<l>Or to that other portico, where stands</l>
<l>The cruel father urging his commands.</l>
<l>And fifty daughters wait the time of rest,</l>
<l>To plunge their poniards in the bridegroom's breast.</l>
<l>Or <placeName key="tgn,2094077">Venus</placeName>' temple; where, on annual nights,</l>
<l>They mourn Adonis with Assyrian rites.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" resp="ed">It was the custom among the Romans, to meet in the temples of <placeName key="tgn,2094077">Venus</placeName> to mourn Adonis; of which the prophet Ezekiel speaks, (<bibl n="Ezekiel 8.14">Ezek. viii. 14.</bibl>); and infamous acts of lewdness were there committed, if we may believe Juvenal in his <bibl n="Juv. 6">sixth satire</bibl>.</note></l>
<l>Nor shun the Jewish walk, where the foul drove</l>
<l>On sabbaths rest from everything but love.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" resp="ed">There were great numbers of the Jews at <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> in Augustus's reign, who were allowed full liberty to exercise their ceremonies, according to the law of <placeName key="tgn,2525806">Moses</placeName>.

<l>There gain another's cause, but lose their own.</l>
<l>Their eloquence is nonpluss'd in the suit;</l>

<l>But above all, the Playhouse is the place;<note anchored="yes" place="foot" resp="ed">It must be owned, the theatres, amphitheatres, cirques, hippodromes, and all places where the public feasts and rejoicings were kept, were very fatal to the chastity of the women of old.</note></l>

<l>There take thy stand, and sharply looking out,</l>
<l>Soon may'st thou find a mistress in the rout,</l>
<l>For length of time or for a single bout.</l>
<l>The Theatres are berries for the fair;</l>
<l>Like ants or mole-hills thither they repair;</l>
<l>Like bees to hives so numerously they throng,</l>
<l>It may be said they to that place belong:</l>

<l>To see, and to be seen, in heaps they run;</l>
<l>Some to undo, and some to be undone.

<l>Providing <placeName key="tgn,7021127">Sabine</placeName> women for his braves,</l>
<l>Like a true king, to get a race of slaves.</l>
<l>His playhouse, not of Parian marble made,</l>
<l>Nor was it spread with purple sails for shade;</l>
<l>The stage with rushes or with leaves they strew'd;<note anchored="yes" place="foot" resp="ed">This idea of the Roman theatres in their infancy, may put us in mind of our own which we read of in the old poets, in Black-friars, the Bull-and-mouth, and Barbican, not much better than the strollers at a country-fair. Yet this must be said for them: that the audience were much better treated; their fare was good, though the house was homely.  Which cannot be said of the Roman infant-stage, their wit and their theatres were alike rude; and the Shakspeares and Jonsons of <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> did not appear till the stage was pompous, and the scene magnificent.</note></l>
<l>No scenes in prospect, no machining god.</l>
<l>On rows of homely turf they sat to see,</l>
<l>Crown'd with the wreaths of ev'ry common tree.</l>
<l>There, while they sit in rustic majesty,</l>
<l>Each lover had his mistress in his eye;</l>
<l>And whom he saw most suiting to his mind,</l>
<l>For joys of matrimonial rape design'd.</l>
<l>Scarce could they wait the plaudit in their haste;</l>
<l>But ere the dances and the song were past,</l>
<l>The monarch gave the signal from his throne,<note anchored="yes" place="foot" resp="ed">At which the soldiers were to fall on the women. The poet and his translators make an agreeable description of this rape. Some say there were thirty of these Sabines ravished: others, as Valerius Antius, make the number to be four hundred and twenty-seven: and Jubas, as Plutarch writes in the life of <placeName key="tgn,2005143">Romulus</placeName>, swells it to six hundred.</note></l>
<l>And rising, bade his merry men fall on.</l>
<l>The martial crew, like soldiers, ready press'd,</l>
<l>Just at the word (the word too was the best),</l>
<l>With joyful cries each other animate;</l>
<l>Some choose, and some at hazard seize their mate.</l>
<l>As doves from eagles, or from wolves the lambs,</l>
<l>So from their lawless lovers fly the dames.</l>
<l>Their fear was one, but not one face of fear:</l>
<l>Some rend the lovely tresses of the hair:</l>
<l>Some shriek, and some are struck with dumb despair.</l>
<l>Her absent mother one invokes in vain;</l>
<l>One stands amaz'd, not daring to complain;</l>
<l>The nimbler trust their feet, the slow remain.</l>
<l>But nought availing, all are captives led,</l>
<l>Trembling and blushing, to the genial bed.</l>
<l>She who too long resisted or denied,</l>
<l>The lusty lover made by force a bride,</l>
<l>And with superior strength compell'd her to his side,</l>
<l>Then sooth'd her thus!    "My soul's far better part,</l>
<l>Cease weeping, nor afflict thy tender heart;</l>
<l>For what thy father to thy mother was,</l>
<l>That faith to thee, that solemn vow I pass !</l>
<l>Thus <placeName key="tgn,2005143">Romulus</placeName> became so popular;</l>
<l>This was the way to thrive in peace and war;</l>
<l>To pay his army, and fresh whores to bring:</l>
<l>Who wouldn't fight for such a gracious king!</l>
<l>Thus love in theatres did first improve,</l>
<l>And theatres are still the scene of love.

<l>Nor shun the chariots and the courser's race;</l>
<l>The circus is no inconvenient place.</l>
<l>No need is there of talking on the hands;</l>
<l>Nor nods, nor signs, which lovers understand.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" resp="ed">It is plain by this, the ancient Romans used to make love by signs on their fingers like the modern Spaniards and Portuguese; and this talking on the fingers is very common among us ever since Dr. Holder and Dr. Wallis taught by Mr. Popham, who was born deaf and dumb, with whom I have, however, myself held a conversation of many hours, and that many hundred times, by the help of our fingers. But the poet says there was no occasion of this dumb language at the cirque; for there was so much noise, that lovers might entertain one another as they pleased, without fear of being overheard.</note></l>
<l>But boldly next the fair your seat provide,<note anchored="yes" place="foot" resp="ed">Young men are apt enough to do this of themselves, and need no advice; yet Juvenal, like <placeName key="tgn,2071526">Ovid</placeName>, puts them in mind of it.</note></l>

<l>Pleas'd or unpleas'd, no matter, crowding sit;</l>
<l>For so the laws of public shows permit.</l>
<l>Then find occasion to begin discourse;</l>
<l>Enquire whose chariot this, and whose that horse?</l>
<l>To whatsoever side she is inclin'd,</l>
<l>Suit all her inclinations to her mind;</l>
<l>Like what she likes, from thence your court begin.</l>
<l>And whom she favours, wish that he may win.</l>
<l>But when the statues of the deities</l>
<l>In chariots roll'd, appear before the prize;</l>
<l>When <placeName key="tgn,2021646">Venus</placeName> comes, with deep devotion rise.</l>
<l>If dust be on her lap, or grains of sand,</l>
<l>Brush both away with your officious hand.</l>
<l>If none there be, yet brush that nothing thence,</l>
<l>And still to touch her lap make some pretence.</l>
<l>Touch any thing of hers, and if her train</l>
<l>Sweep on the ground, let it not sweep in vain;</l>
<l>But gently take it up and wipe it clean;</l>
<l>And while you wipe it, with observing eyes,</l>
<l>Who knows but you may see her naked thighs!</l>
<l>Observe who sits behind her, and beware,</l>
<l>Lest his encroaching knees should press the fair</l>
<l>Light service takes light minds, for some can tell</l>
<l>Of favours won by laying cushions well;</l>
<l>By fanning faces some their fortunes meet,</l>
<l>And some by laying footstools for their feet.</l>
<l>These overtures of love the circus gives,</l>
<l>Nor at the sword play less the lover thrives;</l>
<l>For there the son of <placeName key="tgn,2021646">Venus</placeName> fights his prize,</l>
<l>And deepest wounds are oft receiv'd from eyes.</l>
<l>One, while the crowd their acclamations make,</l>

<l>When servants merry make, and feast, and play,<note anchored="yes" place="foot" resp="ed">This has allusion to a festival celebrated at <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> by the servants, in remembrance of a great piece of service their predecessors had done the Romans, soon after the invasion of the Gauls; the time of celebrating it was in July. It was done in honour of <placeName key="tgn,2075297">Juno</placeName> Caprotina according to Macrobius, in his Saturnalia, book i. chap. 2. The free maidens and servants, says the same author, sacrificed on that day to Juno, under a wild fig-tree, called in Latin Caprilicus, in memory of that complaisant virtue which inspired the servant maids to expose themselves to the lust and revenge of the enemy for the preservation of the public honour. For after the Gauls had taken the city, and were driven out again, when things were restored to their former order, the neighbouring nations believing the Romans were very much weakened by the late invasion, siege, and sack, took hold of that opportunity to invade them, choosing Posthumius Livius of Fidenes for their chief, and demanded of the senate, that if they would preserve their city and authority, they should send them their wives and daughters. The senators taking the matter into consideration, could not tell what answer to return. They knew their own weakness and the strength of their enemies; and in this uncertainty a servant-maid called Tutelar, or Philotis. offered to go with some other maids of the same condition to the enemy.  This proposal was generally liked, and accordingly the maids were dressed like the wives of the senators, and the daughters of free citizens, and went weeping to put themselves into the hands of the invaders. Livius ordered them  to be dispersed into several quarters; and, as they had agreed among themselves, they tempted their new husbands to drink, pretending that day ought to be celebrated as a festival; and when they were almost dead drunk they gave the Romans a signal from the top of a fig-tree to fall on. The latter were encamped not far off; and at this signal they assautled and easily mastered the enemy's camp. putting most of them to the sword. The senate, to reward this important service, ordered that the servants should be made free, that they should have portions paid to them out of the public treasury, and allowed them  to wear the ornaments they had taken.  The day on which this happy expedition was executed, was called the Caprotine nones, from the wild fig-tree Caprificus, from whence the signa was given to the Romans to sally out and gain so glorious a victory; in remembrance of which action the servants sacrificed every year under this or some other fig-tree.  Plutarch relates the same story in the life of <placeName key="tgn,2068320">Camillus</placeName>.</note></l>

<l>Why do I light and vulgar precepts use?</l>
<l>A nobler subject now inspires my muse;</l>
<l>Approaching joys I sing; ye youths, draw near;</l>
<l>Listen ye happy lovers and give ear;</l>
<l>The labor's great, and daring is my song.</l>
<l>Labors and great attempts to love belong.</l>
<l>As from the sacred oracles of Jove</l>
<l>Receive these grand mysterious truths in love.</l>
<l>Look down when she the ogling spark invites,</l>
<l>Nor touch the conscious tablets when she writes.</l>
<l>Appear not jealous tho' she's much from home,</l>
<l>Let her at pleasure go, unquestion'd come.</l>
<l>This crafty husbands to their wives permit,</l>
<l>And learn, when she's engag'd, to wink at it.</l>
<l>I own my frailties modestly confess;</l>

<l>Expose not, tho' you find her guilty flame,</l>
<l>Lest she abandon modesty and shame;</l>
<l>Conceal her faults, no secret crimes upbraid;</l>
<l>Nothing's so fond as a suspected maid.</l>

<l>Amongst th' immortal drolls a standing jest.</l>
<l>How, <placeName key="tgn,1050339">Vulcan</placeName> two transgressing lovers caught</l>
<l>And ev'ry god a pleas'd spectator brought.</l>
<l>Great Mars for Venus felt a guilty flame,</l>
<l>Neglected war, and own'd a lover's name,</l>
<l>To his desires the queen of love inclin'd;</l>
<l>No nymph in heav'n's so willing, none so kind.</l>
<l>Oft the lascivious fair, with scornful pride,</l>
<l>Would <placeName key="tgn,1050339">Vulcan</placeName>'s foot and sooty hands deride;</l>
<l>Yet both with decency their passion bore,</l>
<l>And modestly conceal'd the close amour,</l>
<l>But by the sun betray'd in their embrace,</l>
<l>(For what escapes the sun's observing rays?<note anchored="yes" place="foot" resp="ed">The sun sees all things, and nothing can avoid being seen by it, any more than it can dispense with being warmed by it.</note>)</l>
<l>He told th' affronted god of his disgrace.</l>
<l>Ah foolish sun! and much unskill'd in love,</l>
<l>Thou hast an ill example set above!</l>
<l>Never a fair offending nymph betray,</l>
<l>She'll gratefully oblige you ev'ry way:</l>
<l>The crafty spouse around his bed prepares</l>
<l>Nets that deceive the eye, and secret snares:</l>
<l>A journey feigns, the impatient lovers met,</l>
<l>And naked were expos'd in <placeName key="tgn,1050339">Vulcan</placeName>'s net.</l>
<l>The gods deride the criminals in chains,</l>
<l>And scarce from tears the queen of love refrains;</l>
<l>Nor could her hands conceal her guilty face,</l>
<l>She wants that cover for another place.</l>
<l>To burly Mars a gay spectator said,</l>
<l>" Why so uneasy in that envied bed?</l>
<l>On me transfer your chains; I'll freely come</l>
<l>For your release, and suffer in your room."</l>
<l>At length, kind Neptune, freed by thy desires,</l>
<l>Mars goes for <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>, to <placeName key="tgn,7002373">Paphos</placeName> she retires,</l>
<l>Their loves augmented with revengeful fires;</l>
<l>Now conversant with infamy and shame,</l>
<l>They set no bounds to their licentious flame.</l>
<l>But honest <placeName key="tgn,1050339">Vulcan</placeName>, what was thy pretence,</l>
<l>To act so much unlike a god of sense?</l>
<l>They sin in public, you the shame repent,</l>

<l>Tho' in your pow'r, a rival ne'er expose,</l>
<l>Never his intercepted joys disclose:<note anchored="yes" place="foot" resp="ed">He means intercepting a rival's letter, and discovering the contents.

<l>His witty torments Tantalus deserves,<note anchored="yes" place="foot" resp="ed">He proves by the example of Tantalus, that no man should reveal secrets. Tantalus, so Diodorus tells us, was the son of <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName> and the nymph Plota, equally rich and renowned. He dwelt in <placeName key="tgn,7016760">Paphlagonia</placeName>, and was favoured by the gods for the dignity of his birth ; but having been told some of their secrets, and divulging them to mortals, he was thrown into hell for his crime, where his punishment was what Ovid tells us.</note></l>
<l>That thirsts in waves and viewing banquets starves.</l>
<l>But Venus most in secresy delights:</l>
<l>Away, ye babblers, from her silent rites!</l>
<l>No pomp her mysteries attend, no noise!</l>
<l>No sounding brass proclaims the latent joys!</l>
<l>With folded arms the happy pair possess,</l>
<l>Nor should the fond betraying tongue confess</l>
<l>Those raptures, which no language can express.</l>
<l>When naked Venus casts her robes aside,</l>
<l>The parts obscene her hands extended hide;</l>
<l>No girl on propagating beasts will gaze,</l>
<l>But hangs her head, and turns away her face.</l>
<l>We darken'd beds and doors for love provide;</l>
<l>What nature cannot, decent habit hide.</l>
<l>Love darkens courts, at most a glimm'ring light,</l>

<l>Ere happy men beneath the roof were laid,</l>
<l>When oaks provided them with food and shade,</l>
<l>Some gloomy cave receiv'd the wanton pair;</l>
<l>For light too modest, and unshaded air!</l>
<l>From public view they decently retir'd,</l>

<l>Andromache was tall,<note anchored="yes" place="foot" resp="ed">The poet means she was very tall;  so much so, that it was rather a disadvantage than a beauty, yet Hector thought she was of a moderate height. This princess was the daughtor of Aetion king of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, and Hector's wife.  <placeName key="tgn,2071526">Ovid</placeName> is not the only author who takes notice of her tallness.

<l>Call it a graceful brown, and that complexion praise.</l>
<l>The ruddy lass must be like Venus fair,</l>
<l>Or like Minerva that has yellow hair.</l>
<l>If pale and meagre, praise her shape and youth,</l>
<l>Active when small, when gross she's plump and smooth.</l>
<l>Ev'ry excess by soft'ning terms disguise,</l>
<l>And in some neighb'ring virtue hide each vibe.</l>
<l>Nor ask her age, consult no register,</l>
<l>Under whose reign she's born, or what's the year!</l>
<l>If fading youth chequers her hair with white,</l>
<l>Experience makes her perfect in delight;</l>
<l>In her embrace sublimer joys are found,</l>
<l>A fruitful soil, and cultivated ground!</l>
<l>The hours enjoy whilst youth and pleasures last,</l>
<l>Age hurries on, and death pursues too fast.</l>

<l>Pleasure and wealth reward thy pleasing pains,</l>
<l>The labour's great, but greater far the gains.</l>
<l>Add their experience in affairs of love,</l>
<l>For years and practice do alike improve,</l>
<l>Their arts repair the injuries of time,</l>

<l>In varied ways they act the pleasure o'er,</l>
<l>Not pictur'd postures can instruct you more.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" resp="ed">He speaks of obscene pictures representing nudities, and different postures, such as Carraccio's and Aretin's in latter days. For there was as bad in old times composed by Elephantis, from  which Tiberius took the figures that were painted in his bed-chamber and closet.</note></l>
<l>They want no courtship to provoke delight,</l>
<l>But meet your warmth with eager appetite;</l>
<l>Give me enjoyment, when the willing dame</l>
<l>Glows with desires, and burns with equal flame.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" resp="ed">From this we may perceive our poet abhorred the gallantry too much practiced among the Romans then, and Italians now, as well as in the eastern countries.  Indeed, we can find nothing like it in all his writings, which can hardly be said of any of his contemporary poets, or scarcely in one of their authors at all, before or after him, until the Romans embraced Christianity.  He says it is true, he is only less touched with that beastly passion; and by that is to be understood he was not touched at all.</note></l>
<l>I love to hear the soft transporting joys,</l>
<l>The frequent sighs, the tender murm'ring voice;</l>

<l>And all the nymph confess the pow'r of love.</l>
<l>Nature's not thus indulgent to the young,</l>

It is certain, he ought to have stopped here: but he could not forbear telling what he had in his head. He, however, says but a little, and it is not necessary to explain it: the subject is too well known already.  If our moralizing was convenient at any time, it must be now, for fear our imagination should out-run the poet's. As Ovid tells his muse here, so every man should tell himself, even in the most excellent things: when we are arrived at a certain point, we should abstain from saying any more, we should enioy the charms of philosophy retired. and by ourselves : for as the way of the world is now. it is scandalous in some companies to talk of it: and there are men even so stupid, as a ways  to turn it in into ridicule.

<l>And hear my precepts, while she prompts my mind.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" resp="ed">It is certain that none can make too much haste to acquire the good graces of philosophy and fine learning; for which, youth, genius, and the strength of maturity are necessary.</note></l>
<l>E'en now, in bloom of youth, and beauty's prime,</l>
<l>Beware of coming age, nor waste your time;</l>
<l>Now, while you may, and rip'ning years invite,</l>
<l>Enjoy the seasonable, sweet delight;</l>
<l>For rolling years, like stealing waters, glide,</l>
<l>For hope to stop their ever ebbing tide;</l>
<l>Think not hereafter will the loss repay;</l>
<l>For ev'ry morrow will the taste decay,</l>
<l>And leave less relish than the former day</l>
<l>I've seen the time, when, on that wither'd thorn,</l>
<l>The blooming rose vied with the blushing morn.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" resp="ed">Though <placeName key="tgn,2562923">Ovid</placeName> has gone very far out of the way for this simile, yet in this place it has a good effect.</note></l>
<l>With fragrant wreaths I thence have decked my head,</l>
<l>And see how leafless now, and how decay'd!</l>
<l>And you, who now the love-sick youth reject,</l>
<l>Will prove in age, what pains attend neglect.</l>
<l>None, then will press upon your midnight hours,</l>
<l>Nor wake to strew your street with morning flow'rs.</l>
<l>Then nightly knockings at your doors will cease,</l>
<l>Whose noiseless hammer, then, may rest in peace.</l>
<l>Alas, how soon a clear complexion fades!</l>
<l>How soon a wrinkled skin plump flesh invades!</l>
<l>And what avails it, tho' the fair one swears</l>
<l>She from her infancy had some grey hairs ?</l>
<l>She grows all hoary in a few more years,</l>
<l>And then the venerable truth appears.</l>
<l>The snake his skin, the deer his horns may cast,</l>
<l>And both renew their youth and vigor past;</l>
<l>But no receipt can human-kind relieve,</l>
<l>Doom'd to decrepit age, without reprieve.</l>
<l>Then crop the flow'r which yet invites your eye,</l>
<l>And which, ungather'd, on its stalk must die.</l>
<l>Besides, the tender sex is form'd to bear,</l>
<l>And frequent births too soon will youth impair;</l>
<l>Continual harvest wears the fruitful field,</l>
<l>And earth itself decays, too often till'd.</l>
<l>Thou didst not, <placeName key="tgn,2273155">Cynthia</placeName>, scorn the Latmian swain;</l>
<l>Nor thou, Aurora, Cephalus disdain;</l>
<l>The Paphian Queen, who, for Adonis' fate</l>
<l>So deeply mourn'd, and who laments him yet,</l>
<l>Has not been found inexorable since;</l>
<l>Witness Harmonia, and the Dardan prince.</l>
<l>Then take example, mortals, from above,</l>
<l>And like immortals live, and like 'em love.</l>
<l>Refuse not those delights, which men require,</l>
<l>Nor let your lovers languish with desire.</l>
<l>False tho' they prove, what loss can you sustain?</l>
<l>Thence let a thousand take, 'twill all remain.</l>
<l>Tho' constant use, e'en flint and steel impairs,</l>
<l>What you employ no diminution fears,</l>
<l>Who would, to light a torch, their torch deny?</l>
<l>Or who can dread drinking an ocean dry?</l>
<l>Still women lose, you cry, if men obtain;</l>
<l>What do they lose, that's worthy to retain?</l>
<l>Think not this said to prostrate the sex,</l>
<l>But undeceive whom needless fears perplex.</l>
<l>Thus far the gentle breeze supplies our sail,</l>
<l>Now launch'd to sea we ask a brisker gale.
<milestone ed="p" n="101" unit="carte"/></l>
<l>And, first, we treat of dress. The well-dress'd vine</l>
<l>Produces plumpest grapes, and richest wine;</l>
<l>And plenteous crops of golden grain are found,</l>
<l>Alone, to grace uncultivated ground.</l>
<l>Beauty's the gift of gods, the sex's pride!</l>
<l>Yet to how many is that gift deny'd?</l>
<l>Art helps a face; a face, tho' heav'nly fair,</l>
<l>May quickly fade for want of needful care.</l>
<l>In ancient days, if women slighted dress,</l>
<l>Then men were ruder too, and lik'd it less.</l>
<l>If <placeName key="tgn,2069653">Hector</placeName>'s spouse was clad in stubborn stuff,</l>
<l>A soldier's wife became it well enough.</l>
<l>Ajax, to shield his ample breast, provides</l>
<l>Seven lusty bulls, and tans their sturdy hides;</l>
<l>And might not he, d'ye think, be well caress'd,</l>
<l>And yet his wife not elegantly dress'd?</l>
<l>With rude simplicity <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> first was built,</l>
<l>Which now we see adorned, and gilt.</l>
<l>This capitol with that of old compare;<note anchored="yes" place="foot" resp="ed">The capitol was a hill in <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, so called from a man's head which was found there as the Romans were digging the foundation of the temple of <placeName key="tgn,2019952">Jupiter</placeName>. So Livy and Dionysius write. It first went by the name of Saturnian, and afterwards by that of Tarpeian, from the name of the vestal Tarpeia, who was crushed to death by the weight of the arms of the Sabines that were thrown upon her, after she had delivered the place to them on condition those arms should be given to her. Tarquin built a temple there, which was dedicated by the consul Horatius. This edifice being, as Appius writes, destroyed in the civil wars, Scylla rebuilt it, and Catullus dedicated it. Vespasian restored it after he had put an end to the war against the Vitellians, or the party of Vitellius.  It was not many years before it was burnt : and Domitian rebuilt it again, as Tacitus reports in his 10th book.</note></l>
<l>Some other Jove you'd think was worship'd there.</l>
<l>That lofty pile where senates dictate law,<note anchored="yes" place="foot" resp="ed">Varro writes that there were two sorts of courts in the capitol; one for the delivering of sacred matters, and the other for affairs of state. Both the one and the other were called Curia, a cunando, from the care that was taken there: one went by the name of Hostilia. from Hostilius. the fourth king of <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>: and before this were the Rostra; which took their names from the heads of ships that were hung up there, as may be seen by the eighth book of Livy.</note></l>
<l>When Tatius reign'd, was poorly thatch'd with straw;</l>
<l>And where Apollo's fane refulgent stands,</l>
<l>Was heretofore a tract of pasture lands.</l>
<l>Let ancient manners other men delight;</l>
<l>But me the modern please, as more polite.</l>
<l>Not that materials now in gold are wrought,</l>
<l>And distant shores for orient pearls are sought;</l>
<l>Not for, that hills exhaust their marble veins,</l>
<l>And structures rise whose bulks the sea retains;</l>
<l>But that the world is civilis'd of late,</l>
<l>And polish'd from the rust of former date.</l>
<l>Let not the nymph with pendants load her ear,</l>
<l>Nor in embroid'ry, or brocade, appear;</l>
<l>Too rich a dress may sometimes check desire,</l>
<l>And cleanliness more animate love's fire,</l>
<l>The hair dispos'd, may gain or lose a grace,</l>
<l>And much become or misbecome the face.</l>
<l>What suits your features of your glass enquire;</l>
<l>For no one rule is fixed for head attire,</l>
<l>A face too long should part and flat the hair.</l>
<l>Lest upward comb'd, the length too much appear:</l>
<l>So Laodamia dress'd. A face too round</l>
<l>Should show the ears, and with a tour be crown'd.</l>
<l>On either shoulder, one, her locks displays;</l>
<l>Adorn'd like Phoebus, when he sings his lays;</l>
<l>Another, all her tresses tie behind;</l>
<l>So dressed, <placeName key="tgn,2118015">Diana</placeName> hunts the fearful hind.</l>
<l>Dishevelled locks most graceful are to some;</l>
<l>Others, the binding fillets more become:</l>
<l>Some plait, like spiral shells, their braided hair,</l>
<l>Others, the loose and waving curl prefer.</l>
<l>But to recount the several dresses worn,<note anchored="yes" place="foot" resp="ed">By this we perceive the Roman ladies were as fond of fashions as the French, or the English, too much their imitators.</note></l>
<l>Which artfully each several face adorn,</l>
<l>Were endless as to tell the leaves on trees,</l>
<l>The beasts on Alpine hills, or Hybla bees.</l>
<l>Many there are who seem to slight all care,</l>
<l>And with a pleasing negligence ensnare:</l>
<l>Whole mornings, oft in such a dress are spent,</l>
<l>And all is art, that looks like accident.</l>
<l>With such disorder Iole was grac'd,</l>
<l>When great Alcides first the nymph embrac'd.</l>
<l>So Ariadne came to <placeName key="tgn,2097807">Bacchus</placeName>' bed,</l>
<l>When with the conqueror from <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> she fled.

<l>Nature indulgent to the sex, repays</l>
<l>The losses they sustain by various ways.</l>
<l>Men ill supply those hairs they shed in age,<note anchored="yes" place="foot" resp="ed">Women rarely shed their hair; eunuchs not at all. And no animal, with the exception of man, becomes bald about the temples and ears.</note></l>
<l>Lost like autumnal leaves when north winds rage.</l>
<l>Women with juice of herbs gray locks disguise,<note anchored="yes" place="foot" resp="ed">They dyed their hair with the juice of herbs. according to the fashion of the Germans, who make use of certain herbs to darken their hair, or dye it any other colour to disguise their age, and appear young. The Gauls made use of an herb which is called guesde, or woad, as Caesar reports in the third book of his commentaries.</note></l>
<l>And art gives colour which with nature vies;</l>
<l>The well-wove tours they wear, their own art thought,</l>
<l>But only are their own, as what they've bought.</l>
<l>Nor need they blush to buy heads ready dress'd,</l>
<l>And choose at public shops what suits 'em best.</l>
<l>Costly apparel let the fair one fly,</l>
<l>Enrich'd with gold, or with the Tyrian dye,<note anchored="yes" place="foot" resp="ed">The Tyrian scarlet was the finest dye in the world; preferable to that of Amyclea near <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Sparta</placeName>, though that was also excellent. This scarlet is often confounded with purple, of which there were two sorts, one of a pomegranate colour, as the African, and the other of a reddish scarlet, as the Tyrian. Tibullus speaks of them distinctly.</note></l>
<l>What folly must in such expense appear,</l>
<l>When more becoming colors are less dear!</l>
<l>One with a die is ting'd of lovely blue,</l>
<l>Such as through air serene the sky we view,</l>
<l>With yellow lustre see another spread,</l>
<l>As if the golden fleece compos'd the thread.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" resp="ed">The colour like that of Phryxus's ram. He was the son of Athamas king of <placeName key="tgn,7011071">Thebes</placeName>, and to avoid the anger of Ino, his mother-in-law, fled with his sister Helle upon a ram with a golden fleece. His sister tumbling into the sea gave it the name of <placeName key="tgn,7002638">Hellespont</placeName>, but he arriving at Colchos sacrificed the rain to Mars, who placed it in the zodiac. The golden fleece was hung in a temple, consecrated to Mars, and under the keeping of a dragon.</note></l>
<l>Some of the sea green wave the cast display;</l>
<l>With this the nymphs their beauteous forms array;</l>
<l>And some the saffron hue will well adorn;</l>
<l>Such is the mantle of the blushing morn.</l>
<l>Of myrtle-berries, one, the tincture shows,</l>
<l>In this, of amethysts, the purple glows,</l>
<l>And that more imitates the paler rose.</l>
<l>Nor Thracian cranes forget, whose silv'ry plumes</l>
<l>Give patterns which employ the mimic looms.</l>
<l>Nor almond nor the chesnut dye disclaim,</l>
<l>Nor others which from wax derive their name.</l>
<l>As fields you find, with various flowers o'erspread,</l>
<l>When vineyards bud, and winter's frost is fled;</l>
<l>So various are the colours you may try,</l>
<l>Of which the thirsty wool imbibes the dye.</l>
<l>Try ev'ry one; what best becomes you wear,</l>
<l>For no complexion all alike can bear.</l>
<l>If fair the skin, black may become it best,</l>
<l>In black the lovely fair Briseis dress'd;</l>
<l>If brown the nymph, let her be cloth'd in white,</l>
<l>Andromeda so charm'd the wond'ring sight.</l>
<l>I need not warn you of too powerful smells,</l>
<l>Which sometimes health or kindly heat expels;</l>
<l>Nor from your tender legs to pluck with care</l>
<l>The casual growth of all unseemly hair.</l>
<l>Tho' not to nymphs of <placeName key="tgn,1108814">Caucasus</placeName> I sing,</l>
<l>Nor such who taste remote the Mysian spring,</l>
<l>Yet let me warn you that thro' no neglect</l>
<l>You let your teeth disclose the least defect.</l>
<l>You know the use of white to make you fair,</l>
<l>And how with red lost colour to repair;</l>
<l>Imperfect eyebrows you by art can mend,</l>
<l>And skin, when wanting, o'er a scar extend;</l>
<l>Nor need the fair one be asham'd, who tries</l>
<l>By art to add new lustre to her eyes.

<l>A little book I've made, but with great care,</l>
<l>How to preserve the face, and how repair.</l>
<l>In that, the nymphs by time or chance annoy'd,</l>
<l>May see what pains to please 'em I've employ'd,</l>
<l>But still beware that from your lover's eye</l>
<l>You keep conceal'd the med'cines you apply:</l>
<l>Tho' art assists, yet must that art be hid,</l>
<l>Lest whom it would invite it should forbid.</l>
<l>Who would not take offence to see a face</l>
<l>All daub'd and dripping with the melted grease?</l>
<l>And tho' your unguents bear th' Athenian name,</l>
<l>The wool's unsav'ry scent is still the same.</l>
<l>Marrow of stags, nor your pomatums try,</l>
<l>Nor clean your furry teeth when men are by;</l>
<l>For many things, when done, afford delight,</l>
<l>Which yet, while doing, may offend the sight.</l>
<l>E'en Myro's statues, which for art surpass</l>
<l>All others, once were but a shapeless mass;</l>
<l>Rude was that gold which now in rings is worn,</l>
<l>As once the robe you wear was wool unshorn;</l>
<l>Think, how that stone rough in the quarry grew,</l>
<l>Which now a perfect Venus shews to view.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" resp="ed">It is thought he means that Venus of which Pliny speaks, and which was in Octavia's portico in the temple of <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName>. She is described as rising out of the sea with her hair still wet; such as Apelles painted her.</note></l>
<l>While we suppose you sleep, repair your face,</l>
<l>Lock'd from observers, in some secret place;</l>
<l>Add the last hand before yourselves you show,</l>
<l>Your need of art why should your lover know?</l>
<l>For many things when most conceal'd are best,</l>
<l>And few of strict enquiry bear the test.</l>
<l>Those figures which in theatres are seen,</l>
<l>Gilded without, are common wood within.</l>
<l>But no spectators are allow'd to pry</l>
<l>Till all is finished which allures the eye.</l>
<l>Yet, I must own, it oft affords delight</l>
<l>To have the fair one comb her hair in sight;</l>
<l>To view the flowing honours of her head</l>
<l>Fall on her neck, and o'er her shoulders spread.</l>
<l>But let her look that she with care avoid</l>
<l>All fretful humours while she's so employ'd;</l>
<l>Let her not still undo, with peevish haste,</l>
<l>All that her woman does, who does her best.</l>
<l>I hate a vixen that her maid assails,</l>
<l>And scratches with her bodkin or her nails;</l>
<l>While the poor girl in blood and tears must mourn,</l>
<l>And her heart curses what her hands adorn,</l>
<l>Let her who has no hair, or has but some,</l>
<l>Plant sentinels before her dressing-room;</l>
<l>Or in the fane of the good goddess dress,</l>
<l>Where all the male kind are debarr'd access.</l>
<l>'Tis said that I (but 'tis a tale devis'd)</l>

<l>Faults in your person or your face correct;</l>

<l>Nor fasting, nor too near another, speak.</l>
<l>Let not the nymph with laughter much abound,</l>
<l>Whose teeth are black, uneven, or unsound.</l>
<l>You'd hardly think how much on this depends,</l>
<l>And how a laugh or spoils a face or mends.</l>
<l>Gape not too wide, lest you disclose your gums,</l>
<l>And lose the dimple which the cheek becomes.</l>
<l>Nor let your sides too long concussions shake,</l>
<l>Lest you the softness of the sex forsake:</l>

<l>Neglect no means which may promote your end;</l>

<l>Between extremes, in this, a mean adjust,</l>
<l>Nor show too nice a gait, nor too robust.</l>
<l>If snowy white your neck, you still should wear</l>

She was born at Mytelene in the Isle of <placeName key="tgn,7002672">Lesbos</placeName>, and was contemporary with Alceus.  She wrote nine books of elegy, and several epigrams and satires. The Sapphic verges took their name from her.  There is nothing of her compositions extant, besides a hymn to Venus, and an ode to a young girl whom she loved.  According to some authors, she flung herself into the sea because Phaon neglected her. Her sentiments were very tender in her verses, wherefore Ovid advises lovers to read them.</note></l>

Merula's explanation is very obscure; nor is Mycillus's much clearer. The latronum proelia is with more certainty interpreted to be chess.  There is another game mentioned by the poet Reticuloque, etc., which none of the commentators have explained clearly; but the tunos lapillos is by all of them agreed to be what we call merills, a boyish game which Ovid describes so well, there is no doubt but it is the same. The dye spoken of here is supposed to refer to a game like the modern trick-track.</note></l>

<l>Had not Appelles drawn the sea-born queen,<note anchored="yes" place="foot" resp="ed">Every one has heard of Apelles, the famous painter.

For his great skill in his art he was called the prince of painters;  and so industrious, that <foreign lang="la">Nulla dies sine linea</foreign> is his known motto.  Alexander forbad any painter but him to draw his portrait.  His master-piece was reckoned the <placeName key="tgn,2094077">Venus</placeName> rising out of the sea, of which Ovid speaks, and which the Emperor Augustus dedicated in the temple of his father Julius Caesar.  This piece was at last ruined by time, and Nero put another in its place, drawn by Dorotheus.  Apelles had begun another Venus for the inhabitants of Cos, which would have excelled the first, but he was hindered by death from finishing it;  and after him none had the boldness to put the last hand to it, as <placeName key="tgn,2588096">Pliny</placeName> informs us.</note></l>

<l>Still there's a pleasure that proceeds from praise:</l>
<l>What could the high renown of Homer raise,</l>
<l>But that he sung his Iliad's deathless lays?<note anchored="yes" place="foot" resp="ed">Homer's name, and the contention of seven cities for him, are so well known, that there is no need of saying much about it;  he was so called from his blindness.  He was the most famous of all the Greek poets, but poor to the extermity of begging.  His Iliads and Odyssey are to this day in the first rank of heroic poems, and the Aeneids only dispute with them the pre-eminence.</note>

Cupid seems frightened at the title of it, apprehending he is declaring war against him.</note></l>
<l>"Treason! a plot against our state," he cried.</l>
<l>Why should you thus your loyal poet wrong,<note anchored="yes" place="foot" resp="ed">No man understood the affairs of gallantry better than Ovid.</note></l>
<l>Who in your war has serv'd so well and long?</l>
<l>So savage and ill-bred I ne'er can prove,</l>
<l>Like Diomede, to wound the queen of love.</l>
<l>Others by fits have felt your am'rous flame,</l>
<l>I still have been, and still your martyr am;</l>
<l>Rules for your vot'ries I did late impart.</l>
<l>Refining passion, and made love an art.</l>
<l>Nor do I now of that or thee take leave,</l>
<l>Nor does the muse her former web unweave.</l>
<l>Let him who loves, where love success may find,</l>
<l>Spread all his sails before the prosp'rous wind;</l>
<l>But let poor youths who female scorn endure,</l>
<l>And hopeless burn, repair to me for cure:</l>
<l>For why should any worthy youth destroy</l>
<l>Himself, because some worthless nymph is coy?</l>
<l>Love should be nature's friend; let hemp and steel</l>
<l>Hangmen and heroes use, whose trade's to kill.</l>
<l>Where fatal it would prove, let passion cease;</l>
<l>Nor love destroy, who should our race increase.</l>
<l>A child you are, and like a child should play;</l>
<l>And gentle as your years should be your sway.</l>
<l>Keen arrows, and to wound the hardest hearts,</l>

<l>The crimson stains of cruel conquest wear;</l>
<l>You should your mother's milder laws observe,</l>
<l>Who ne'er did childless parent's curse deserve;</l>
<l>Or if you must employ your wanton pow'r,</l>
<l>Teach youths by night to force their mistress' door:</l>
<l>How lovers safe and secretly may meet,</l>

<l>And to some doleful tune weep out the night.</l>
<l>For tears, not blood, love's altar should require:</l>

<l>Such was the cure the Arcadian hero found;<note anchored="yes" place="foot" resp="ed">Telephys king of <placeName key="tgn,7016748">Mysia</placeName>, sun of Hercules and Auge, daughter of the king of <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName>.  He was called Telephus from his having been nursed by a doe in a wild place, where he was found by shepherds, who carried him to Corytus, king of <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>, by whom he was adopted for a son.  When he had grown up to man's estate, he went to Delphos to enquire out his parents by the oracle, which bid him go to Theutras, kingn of <placeName key="tgn,7016748">Mysia</placeName>, where he should be informed of what he desired;  he then found his mother Auge, and when his birth was known, great was the joy of the Mysian court.  Theytras, who had no male issue, gave him his daughter Argiope in marriage and left him his successor in the kingdom at his death.  The Trojan war happening nsome time after, the Greeks who did not know very well their way to <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, landed in <placeName key="tgn,7016748">Mysia</placeName>, where Telephus gave them battle, and wounded Ulysses;  but was himself dangerously wounded by Achilles.  Consulting the oracle about his cure, he was told he could never be cured, unless he was wounded again in the same place with the same lance;  upon which he went to <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, whither the Greeks were returned, and promised Achilles to be his guide to <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> if he would cure him;  accordingly the Grecian hero did cure him with the same lance that gave the wound.  Diodorus Siculus tells this story in his fifth book.</note></l>

<l>And when beyond your sphere my methods go,</l>
<l>You may, at least, infer what you should do.</l>
<l>When flames beyond their useful bounds aspire,</l>
<l>'Tis charity to quench the threat'ning fire.</l>

<l>Nor had that mother dire revenge pursu'd,</l>

<l>From scornful beauty's chains I'll set you free,</l>
<l>Consent but you to your own liberty.</l>

<l>While yet in breath, ere yet your nerves are broke,</l>
<l>Cast from your gen'rous neck the shameful yoke!</l>
<l>Check love's first symptoms, the weak foe surprise,</l>

<l>What certain toil, for an uncertain cure.</l>

<l>To-morrow will be harden'd in delay.</l>

<l>We day by day indulge the fond desire,</l>
<l>Till like a serpent it has eat its way,</l>
<l>And uncontroll'd does on our entrails prey.</l>
<l>Yet if the proper season you have pass'd,</l>
<l>Tho' hard the task, I'll use my skill at last;</l>
<l>Nor see my patient perish by his grief,</l>
<l>Because no sooner call'd to his relief.</l>
<l>When Philoctetes first receiv'd his wound,<note anchored="yes" place="foot" resp="ed">He was born of Paean, and Hercules' faithful companion, who made him swear he would never discover where he lay buried, and gave him his arrows dipped in hydra's blood.  The Greeks being told by the oracle that thsy should never conquer <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> until they found the fatal arrows, importuned Philoctetes to tell them where they were hid, which was in Hercules' tomb;  and he discovered it by stamping on it with his foot, to keep himself from perjury.  But he was wounded in the foot for his prevarication, by one of those arrows, when he went to the Trojan war.  However, Marchaon cured him.  Ulysses brought him to <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> and boasted of it in the speech he made to the Grecian princes, when he demanded Achilles's arms.</note></l>
<l>The venom'd part cut off, had sav'd the sound;</l>

<l>But counterfeit; you'll prove in the event,</l>
<l>That careless lover whom you represent.</l>
<l>Oft when the merry round I would not keep,</l>
<l>I've seem'd to nod, and, seeming, fall'n asleep.</l>

<l>Dissembling passion, till he felt the smart.</l>
<l>Love comes by use; disuse will love expel;</l>
<l>Learn to feign health, and you will soon be well</l>
<l>If she has bid you come, and fix'd the night,</l>
<l>Tho' sure that she to mock you did invite,</l>
<l>Yet go; and if you find the door fast lock'd,</l>
<l>Endure the disappointment; be not shock'd;</l>
<l>Nor curse the gate, nor fond entreaties make,</l>
<l>Nor on the threshold a hard lodging take:</l>
<l>And when you see her next, complaints forbear,</l>
<l>Nor in your looks the least resentment wear.</l>
<l>Her pride will stoop, and give your feign'd neglect</l>
<l>What she denied to your sincere respect.</l>
<l>Nor is't enough your mistress thus to cheat,</l>
<l>You on yourself must put the same deceit:</l>
<l>Acquaint not your own thoughts with the design,</l>
<l>Till the work's done and you have sprung the mire.</l>
<l>For else 'tis odd, but nature in your heart</l>
<l>Will faction raise, and take your mistress' part.</l>
<l>What you propose will soon effected be,</l>
<l>Your progress sure, if made with secrecy.</l>
<l>Conceal your nets; if they are spread in sight,</l>
<l>The bird you meant to take you'll only fright.</l>
<l>Nor suffer her you love, so much to prize</l>
<l>Her charming self, that she may you despise.</l>
<l>Take courage; conscious of your merit seem,</l>
<l>And worthy you'll appear of her esteem.</l>
<l>E'en then when you her door wide open spy,</l>
<l>Nay, tho' called in, yet pass regardless by.</l>

Pliny says the Lotos came from the country of the Nazomonians near the Syrtes, rocks, or rather shelves, upon the coast of Africa.

<head>Ovid's Art of Beauty.</head>
<div1 type="poem" n="Med.">
<l>Once more, ye fair, attend your master's song,</l>
<l>And learn what method will your charms prolong;</l>
<l>What happy heart best recommends a face;</l>
<l>What heightens beauty; what preserves a grace.</l>
<l>Art improves nature; 'twas by art we found</l>
<l>The vast advantages of furrow'd ground:</l>
<l>The soil manur'd, a fruitful harvest bore,</l>
<l>Where thorns and hungry brambles grew before.</l>
<l>By art the gard'ner grafts his trees, to bear</l>
<l>A kinder fruit, and recompense his care.</l>
<l>A gilded roof delights our captive eyes,</l>
<l>And stately monuments the sight surprise,</l>
<l>Tho' sordid earth beneath the polish'd marble lies.</l>
<l>The fleece may be with royal purple died,</l>
<l>And <placeName key="tgn,7000198">India</placeName> precious ivory provide,</l>
<l>To please your fancies and supply your pride.</l>
<l>When Tatius rul'd the ancient <placeName key="tgn,7021127">Sabine</placeName> race,</l>
<l>Then, rough and careless of a handsome face,</l>
<l>The women took more pains to earn their bread</l>
<l>At plough and cart, than how to dress the head;</l>
<l>All day their task the busy matrons plied,</l>
<l>Or spinning sat, as to their distaffs tied.</l>
<l>The mother then at night would fold the sheep</l>
<l>Her little daughter us'd by day to keep;</l>
<l>And when at home, would cleave out logs of wood,</l>
<l>Or kindle up a fire to boil their food.</l>
<l>But you, by nature form'd in finer moulds,</l>
<l>Must wrap your tender limbs in silken folds;</l>
<l>Wear lawns and tissue, sleep in damask beds,</l>
<l>And with gay knots and wires adorn your heads:</l>
<l>Your ears with pendants, lockets on your arms,</l>
<l>Besides a thousand other nameless charms.</l>
<l>Nor needs this care to please a blush create;</l>
<l>The men themselves have learned to dress of late.</l>
<l>You are not now particular in clothes,</l>
<l>The husband and the bridegroom both are beaux;</l>
<l>Dress then, and 'tis no sin to dress with art,</l>
<l>For that's the way to wound the lover's heart.</l>
<l>E'en those that live remote in country towns,</l>
<l>Will dress their hair with flowers and daisy crowns,</l>
<l>And deck and prank themselves, to please the clowns.</l>
<l>Besides, all women take a secret pride</l>
<l>In being fine, or else they are belied;</l>
<l>For when the conscious maid her glass explores,</l>
<l>And finds she's handsome, she herself adores.</l>
<l>Thus Juno's bird with silent pride will raise</l>
<l>And spread his starry plumes, whene'er he meets with praise.</l>
<l>This method will oblige our sex to love,</l>
<l>And more than magic herbs their passions move.</l>
<l>Trust not to philtres; all such stuff forbear;</l>
<l>Nor try the venom of the lustful mare.</l>
<l>'Tis all a jest; no snakes by such a force</l>
<l>Enchanted burst, no rivers change their course;</l>
<l>Nor can they make the moon from heaven descent</l>
<l>Whate'er some superstitious fools pretend.</l>
<l>First learn good breeding; that I first advise;</l>
<l>Good carriage oft the other wants supplies.</l>
<l>For when ill-natur'd age shall rudely plough</l>
<l>Injurious furrows on your wrinkled brow,</l>
<l>You then perhaps may chide the tell-tale glass,</l>
<l>That shews the frightful ruins of your face;</l>
<l>But if good humour to the last remain,</l>
<l>E'en age may please, and love his force retain.
<milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="carte"/></l>
<l>Now on, my muse, and tell 'em, when they rise,</l>
<l>When downy sleep forsakes their tender eyes,</l>
<l>How they may look as fair as morning skies.</l>
<l>Vetches, and beaten barley, let 'em take,</l>
<l>And with the whites of eggs a mixture make;</l>
<l>Then dry the precious paste with sun and wind</l>
<l>And into powder very gently grind.</l>
<l>Get hart's-horn next (but let it be the first</l>
<l>That creature sheds), and beat it well to dust.</l>
<l>Six pound in all; then mix and sift 'em well,</l>
<l>And think the while how fond Narcissus fell;</l>
<l>Six roots to you that pensive flower must yield</l>
<l>To mingle with the rest, well bruis'd and cleanly pill'd.</l>
<l>Two ounces next of gum, and thural seed,</l>
<l>That for the gracious gods does incense breed,</l>
<l>And let a double share of honey last succeed.</l>
<l>With this whatever damsel paints her face,</l>
<l>Will need no flattering glass to show a grace.</l></div1>

<head>The Court of Love, a tale from Chaucer.</head>
<milestone n="0" unit="carte" />
<l>Once as I lay, by heavy sleep oppress'd,</l>
<l>With this strange whim my fancy was possess'd:</l>
<l>I dreamt that Cupid call'd me to his court</l>
<l>On Mount Cithera, where his slaves resort;</l>
<l>Where Venus, queen and goddess, fills the throne,</l>
<l>Her kingdom sharing with her darling son;</l>
<l>There was I straight commanded to appear,</l>
<l>By Mercury, the winged messenger.</l>
<l>Away I went, through strange and distant lands,</l>
<l>The coast enquiring where love's palace stands</l>
<l>At last a crowd of travellers I found,</l>
<l>And ask'd them whither they so fast were bound.</l>
<l>One, looking like a maid, cried, "Gentle friend,</l>
<l>To Cupid's court our willing steps we bend."</l>
<l>"Oh, where's his court?" said I. The nymph replied,</l>
<l>"High on Cithera stands, with tow'ring pride,</l>
<l>A stately castle, his imperial seat,</l>
<l>In which he lives magnificently great."</l>
<l>Her steps I follow'd, till my eager sight,</l>
<l>Reaching the hill, found her description right;</l>
<l>Amaz'd I saw the building large and strong,</l>
<l>Vast were the domes, the marble turrets long;</l>
<l>But gold and jewels hid the massy stone</l>
<l>And stretching to the skies, with lustre shone:</l>
<l>Sapphires and rubies mingled various lights,</l>
<l>More sparkling than the stars in winter nights:</l>
<l>And Phoebus darted on tnis happy place</l>
<l>His lustre, to regain the queen's good grace;</l>
<l>For chancing once unluckily to find</l>
<l>Mars in her arms, he had enrag'd her mind;</l>
<l>But now to please th' offended queen he strove,</l>
<l>Which shew'd his longing for the sweets of love:</l>
<l>For all the gods that on <placeName key="tgn,2109778">Olympus</placeName> dwell,</l>
<l>E'en Jove and <placeName key="tgn,2119611">Pluto</placeName>, kings of heaven and hell,</l>
<l>All things that live on earth, or breathe above,</l>
<l>The mighty joys of this best realm approve.
<milestone n="1" unit="carte"/></l>
<l>Arriv'd at court, I found the palace rooms</l>
<l>Adorn'd with hangings made in costly looms;</l>
<l>Fair maids I met, that mov'd with heavenly grace,</l>
<l>And young men, walking with a lusty pace;</l>
<l>Old men I saw, too, but I could not dream</l>
<l>What service <placeName key="tgn,2094077">Venus</placeName> could receive from them.</l>
<l>Pensive I stood, and fearful to be seen,</l>
<l>Till one I spied belonging to the queen,</l>
<l>Call'd Philomel; I knew her once a maid,</l>
<l>But all her life she lov'd. "My friend (she said)</l>
<l>Welcome to Cupid's court; but you, I fear,</l>
<l>Receiv'd from Mercury a summons here."</l>
<l>I answered, "Yes."  She said, " Your negligence</l>
<l>Will then be thought a wilful dire offence;</l>
<l>For all that live in luxury and ease,</l>
<l>By nature form'd the charming sex to please,</l>
<l>To this fam'd palace early should repair,</l>
<l>And hasten to the service of the fair;</l>
<l>But you that absent durst so long remain,</l>
<l>Without a boat had better cross the main,</l>
<l>Than hear the curse that disobedience draws</l>
<l>On bold contemners of love's sacred laws;</l>
<l>For no unhappy men such torments bear,</l>
<l>As wretches doom'd to feel affliction here.</l>
<l>Soon they perceive their appetite's decay'd,</l>
<l>Love makes their health decrease, their color fade.</l>
<l>Long since, I tempted you to Cupid's court;</l>
<l>Now he'll receive you with a sullen port.</l>
<l>Perhaps repentance may the god assuage;</l>
<l>But why should you so long provoke his rage?"</l>
<l>I answer'd thus: "With sorrow I repent,</l>
<l>Wretch that I am, a life so vainly spent."</l>
<l>And having spoke, by her I straight was led</l>
<l>To a vast hall, with various carpets spread,</l>
<l>And cloth of gold; on which I wondering found</l>
<l>A throne of state, erected from the ground,</l>
<l>Where <placeName key="tgn,2094077">Venus</placeName> sat, with her imperial son;</l>
<l>Each had a sceptre and a radiant crown.</l>
<l>To see their pomp, I could till now have stood</l>
<l>Thoughtless of drink, and destitute of food;</l>
<l>The pleasures of the fam'd <placeName key="tgn,2054380">Elysian</placeName> field</l>
<l>Can no such rapture to a stranger yield.</l>
<l>No wonder <placeName key="tgn,2081683">Venus</placeName>, bless'd with such a mien,</l>
<l>And such a person, reigns of beauty queen;</l>
<l>Her golden hair dishevell'd, crisp and long,</l>
<l>In easy curls around her shoulders hung;</l>
<l>And ev'ry beam that's darted from her eyes,</l>
<l>Piercing and sharp, like pointed arrow flies.</l>
<l>The king of love had danger by his side,</l>
<l>The queen, despair; and looking further wide,</l>
<l>Attendance, fear, and flattery I view'd,</l>
<l>And hope, with strength above the rest endu'd;</l>
<l>And wrinkled jealousy; with young delight,</l>
<l>Open and free, and cheerful to the sight;</l>
<l>And envy, lurking in a secret place;</l>
<l>Lean was her body, leering was her face;</l>
<l>Repining at the fortunate she sat,</l>
<l>And at that distance one night see her fret.</l>
<l>Below the throne, a humble sighing crowd</l>
<l>With pressing suits and warm petitions bow'd.
<milestone n="2" unit="carte"/></l>
<l>Then Philomel I ask'd whence came the tide</l>
<l>Of all those thronging suppliants? she replied,</l>
<l>"From divers realms they come: those dress'd in blue</l>
<l>Shew by that colour they have still been true;</l>
<l>The men in black lament that those they love</l>
<l>Are sick, or dead, or that they cruel prove."</l>
<l>"What makes the priests (said I) in court appear?</l>
<l>Have they the privilege of serving here?"</l>
<l>The dame replied, "Full many maids can tell,</l>
<l>None are so welcome, and none serve so well."</l>
<l>While thus I view'd, with Philomel, the crowd,</l>
<l>A herald from the king cried out aloud,</l>
<l>"Come, all ye strangers, to the throne draw near</l>
<l>And instantly before the king appear."</l>
<l>In haste I ran, and kneel'd before the throne,</l>
<l>All pale and trembling, as a wretch undone;</l>
<l>The king look'd sternly, and demanded why</l>
<l>I came so late, and what I could reply?</l>
<l>Weeping, I answer'd, "Oh, my sov'reign lord,</l>
<l>One act of mercy to your slave afford;</l>
<l>If yet, a rebel both in word and thought,</l>
<l>I never lov'd so truly as I ought,</l>
<l>I will henceforth endeavour to fulfil</l>
<l>The just decrees of your almighty will."</l>
<l>"Well, all is pardon'd (he replied), if now</l>
<l>To me allegiance and true faith you'll vow."</l>
<l>Then straight he call'd an officer of state,</l>
<l>His name is Rigour; solemn was his gait,</l>
<l>And grim his look; unmov'd with gold or pray'r;</l>
<l>A statute book he brought, and said, "You swear</l>
<l>True to remain, in deed, in thought, and word,</l>
<l>To <placeName key="tgn,2081683">Venus</placeName> and her son, your sovereign lord;</l>
<l>To love one fair unchangeably till death,</l>
<l>And own your passion with your latest breath;</l>
<l>To bear the various temper of her mind,</l>
<l>And let her will your just obedience find;</l>
<l>To give the honour to her virtue due,</l>
<l>And think all tales that blast her fame, untrue;</l>
<l>To swear her conduct was exactly right,</l>
<l>And in defence of that opinion fight;</l>
<l>To find what present or device she loves,</l>
<l>And oft to send her what she most approves;</l>
<l>To write, to dress, and practise ev'ry art</l>
<l>Yourself to recommend, and gain her heart;</l>
<l>To take no pleasure, absent from her sight,</l>
<l>But by reflecting on your past delight;</l>
<l>Nor absence long endure, but justly choose,</l>
<l>Rather than live from her, your life to lose."</l>
<l>All this I swore, and as I turn'd the book,</l>
<l>On other statutes of the realm to look,</l>
<l>Rigour cried out, "Hold, traitor to the queen,</l>
<l>Those sacred statutes are not to be seen;</l>
<l>Those are the laws for womankind ordain'd,</l>
<l>That with men's eyes were never yet profan'd;</l>
<l>Not e'en with mine, tho' I on <placeName key="tgn,2081683">Venus</placeName> wait,</l>
<l>Long trusted with her deep affairs of state.</l>
<l>Believe me, friend, mankind must still despair</l>
<l>To know the rules and maxims of the fair;</l>
<l>And when you see 'em change with ev'ry wind,</l>
<l>Themselves indulging, to their slaves unkind,</l>
<l>Conclude their duty to these laws they pay,</l>
<l>Which, tho' unwillingly, they must obey.-</l>
<l>Now seek the temple of the queen of love,</l>
<l>And may her son yourjust desires approve;</l>
<l>All you whose choice is made, her grace implore,</l>
<l>To serve and please the ladies you adore;</l>
<l>And each that wants a mistress, pray to find</l>
<l>By her propitious aid, some beauty kind."
<milestone n="3" unit="carte"/></l>
<l>We all obey'd the words that Rigour spoke;</l>
<l>Devoutly, slow and easy steps we took;</l>
<l>Entring the temple, which fam'd artists built,</l>
<l>Soft was the front, the lovely roof was gilt;</l>
<l>The cheerful quire with well carv'd work was lin'd,</l>
<l>And am'rous painting on the pillars shin'd.</l>
<l>There <placeName key="tgn,2290326">Dido</placeName>, that unhappy dying queen,</l>
<l>With false Aeneas, in one piece was seen;</l>
<l>And other pictures round the walls were spread,</l>
<l>Of men and minds, for love untimely dead.</l>
<l>Rais'd in the middle aisle, fond souls to awe,</l>
<l>A golden image of the queen we saw;</l>
<l>This all adorn'd; some looking fresh and fair,</l>
<l>Some worn with grief, or blasted by despair;</l>
<l>Some in new mantles dress'd, and some in old,</l>
<l>Like half starv'd beggars, ugly to behold.</l>
<l>Some pale as death appear'd, some glow'd like fire,</l>
<l>Confessing to their inward fierce desire:</l>
<l>These with their loud complaints the queen besought</l>
<l>To cure those ills that cruel love had wrought;</l>
<l>And punish all such authors of their woes,</l>
<l>As mock'd their sufferings, or had broke their vows.</l>
<l>But all the happy there, whose envied lives</l>
<l>Were bless'd with joys which bounteous <placeName key="tgn,2081683">Venus</placeName> gives,</l>
<l>Cried, "Goddess, hail! propitious to redress</l>
<l>The cares of mortals, and their hearts to bless,</l>
<l>May no divisions in your realms be found,</l>
<l>Since the whole world in love's soft chains is bound;</l>
<l>This is the life of joy our vot'ries know,</l>
<l>Who feel their bliss of paradise below;</l>
<l>Love cures our vices and refines our hearts;</l>
<l>The source of manners, industry, and parts;</l>
<l>Honour to you, celestial queen, we pay,</l>
<l>Whose minds are lighted with your beauty's ray."</l>
<l>Taught by the pray'r these happy lovers made,</l>
<l>I tried my wit, and thus devoutly said.</l>
<l>"Fairest of all that e'er in nature shin'd,</l>
<l>Light of the world, and comfort of mankind,</l>
<l>To you, 0 goddess, I my heart bequeath,</l>
<l>Freely bestow a thing that's yours till death;</l>
<l>Yours be the choice; I only wish to find</l>
<l>A faithful mistress, beautiful and kind;</l>
<l>No woman yet my settled passion moves,</l>
<l>One I have seen whom most my soul approves;</l>
<l>Of stature low, cast in a lovely mould,</l>
<l>Healthful and young, with hair more bright than gold;</l>
<l>Her looks are fresh, her countenance demure,</l>
<l>Her eyes, tho' killing, look like crystal pure:</l>
<l>Her could I serve; but if your high decree</l>
<l>That fair denies, some other find for me,</l>
<l>With whom in pleasure I may spend my life,</l>
<l>My mistress, empress, anything but wife.</l>
<l>So will I always sacrifice to you,</l>
<l>And with <placeName key="tgn,2118015">Diana</placeName> constant war pursue.</l>
<l>A fig for her, and all her chastity;</l>
<l>Let monks and friars her disciples be."
<milestone n="4" unit="carte"/></l>
<l>Thus in the temple having said my pray'r,</l>
<l>Another image I discover'd there;</l>
<l>"A tender maid (said Philomel) does claim</l>
<l>That sacred shrine, and Pity is her name;</l>
<l>In all the court none knows so well the art</l>
<l>To help a lover, or to save a heart:</l>
<l>Her all-commanding int'rest cannot fail;</l>
<l>Gain but her friendship, and you must prevail</l>
<l>Now you shall see the fairest thing alive;</l>
<l>Come on with me, and by your carriage strive</l>
<l>To please a lady of the nicest taste,</l>
<l>Whose air is prudent as her life is chaste,</l>
<l>Call'd Rosalinda; could you gain her grace,</l>
<l>Well might you bless the goddess of this piace;</l>
<l>Take care your sense and modesty to show,</l>
<l>She hates a pert, insipid, prating beau."</l>
<l>Then straight she led me to a spacious room,</l>
<l>Where Rosalinda sat in beauty's gloom;</l>
<l>At the first sight a shiv'ring pain I found</l>
<l>In all my veins; my heart receiv'd a wound.</l>
<l>I dreaded much to speak, my voice was broke,</l>
<l>Yet when my sighs permitted, thus I spoke;</l>
<l>"Accept my service, thou celestial fair,</l>
<l>And oh! relieve a dying lover's care;</l>
<l>To your commands my painful heart I bind,</l>
<l>And have for ever liberty resign'd."</l>
<l>She made no answer, and I soon retired,</l>
<l>To press not daring, tho' by love inspir'd;</l>
<l>But still herimage dwelt within my breast,</l>
<l>Too excellent to be in verse expressed.</l>
<l>Her head is round, and flaxen is her hair,</l>
<l>Her eye-brows darker, but her forehead fair;</l>
<l>Straight is her nose; her eyes like emeralds bright;</l>
<l>Her well-made cheeks are lovely red and white;</l>
<l>Short is her mouth, her lips are made to kiss,</l>
<l>Rosy and full, and prodigal of bliss;</l>
<l>Her teeth like ivory are, well-sized and even,</l>
<l>And to her breath ethereal sweets are given;</l>
<l>Her hands are snowy white, and small her waist,</l>
<l>And what is yet untold is sure the best.</l>
<l>Had Jove himself beheld this heavenly fair,</l>
<l>Calisto never had been made a star;</l>
<l>He ne'er had borne Europa on his back,</l>
<l>Nor turn'd a mortal for Alcmena's sake;</l>
<l>Nor tried the virtue of a golden shower,</l>
<l>To enter Danae's well defended tower:</l>
<l>For all their beauties had too mean appear'd,</l>
<l>With Rosalinda's matchless charms compar'd.</l>
<l>Soon I return'd her heavenly form to view,</l>
<l>For still my wound's impression deeper grew;</l>
<l>And thus I spoke. "0 nature's boasted pride,</l>
<l>For torments caus'd by you some cure provide;</l>
<l>Prais'd be thy fate, and ever bless'd the hour,</l>
<l>That made me subject to your lawful pow'r;</l>
<l>Not Anthony could greater passion boast,</l>
<l>Tho' for one woman the whole world was lost."
<milestone n="5" unit="carte"/></l>
<l>She answer'd, " Friend, your service I disclaim;</l>
<l>Who are you, pray? whence come you? what's your name?"</l>
<l>"Men call me Celadon, in verse I write,</l>
<l>And songs at home with some applause indite;</l>
<l>Oh, why is every flower and pleasing root</l>
<l>That in the Muses' happy garden shoot,</l>
<l>Denied me now? and why must I despair,</l>
<l>With sweets of verse to charm the brightest fair?</l>
<l>Thou gentle muse, my humble breast inspire</l>
<l>With sacred numbers and celestial fire;</l>
<l>And, <placeName key="tgn,2565867">Pallas</placeName>, thy propitious light convey,</l>
<l>To chase the mist of ignorance away!"</l>
<l>"Peace, rhyming fool, and learn henceforth to make</l>
<l>A fitter choice; your woman you mistake."</l>
<l>"0 mercy, <placeName key="tgn,2094077">Venus</placeName>! mercy from above!</l>
<l>Why would you curse me with such hopeless love?</l>
<l>Behold the most abandon'd soul on earth;</l>
<l>Ill was I got, and woful was my birth.</l>
<l>Unless some pity on my pains you shed,</l>
<l>The frosty grave will quickly be my bed."</l>
<l>Thus having spoke, my breath began to fail,</l>
<l>My colour sunk, and turned like ashes pale;</l>
<l>I swoon'd, and down I fell. " Thou slave arise</l>
<l>(Cried Rosalinda), now thy love I prize;</l>
<l>I only tried thy heart, and since I find</l>
<l>'Tis soft and tender, know that mine is kind.</l>
<l>Swear but to keep the oath you lately took,</l>
<l>And I'll not be so cruel as I look."</l>
<l>Her eyes then languish'd, and her face grew red,</l>
<l>And squeezing fast my hand, she laughing said,</l>
<l>"I know a way thy passion to appease,</l>
<l>And soon will set thy simple heart at ease."</l>
<l>But ere she brought me to her promis'd bed,</l>
<l>The rapture wak'd me, and the vision fled.</l>

<div1 type="section" n="1">
<l>Ye woods and wilds, serene and blest retreats,</l>
<l>Atone the lovers' and the muses' seats;</l>
<l>To you I fly, to you, ye sacred groves,</l>
<l>To tell my wond'rous tales of wond'rous loves.</l>
<l>Thee, <placeName key="tgn,1013136">Delia</placeName>, thee shall ev'ry shepherd sing,</l>
<l>With thy dear name the neighb'ring woods shall ring;</l>
<l>No name but thine shall on their barks be found,</l>
<l>With none but thine shall echoing hills resound.</l>
<l>My verse thy matchless beauties shall proclaim,</l>
<l>Till thine outrivals Sacharissa's fame;</l>
<l>My verse shall make thee live while woods shall grow,</l>
<l>While stars shall shine, and while the seas shall flow;</l>
<l>While there remains alive a tender maid,</l>
<l>Or am'rous youth, or love-sick swain to read.</l>
<l>Others may artfully the passions move,</l>
<l>In me alone 'tis natural to love;</l>
<l>While the world sees me write in such a strain,</l>
<l>As shews I only feel what others feign.</l>
<l>Thou darling of my youth, my life's delight.</l>
<l>By day my vision, and my dream by night,</l>
<l>Thou, who alone dost all my thoughts infuse,</l>
<l>And art at once my mistress and my muse;</l>
<l>Inspir'd from thee, flows ev'ry sacred line,</l>
<l>Thine is the poetry, the poet thine.</l>
<l>Thy service shall my only bus'ness be,</l>
<l>And all my life employ'd in pleasing thee. </l>
<l>Crown'd with my songs of thee, each day shall move,</l>
<l>And ev'ry list'ning son hear nought but love;</l>
<l>With flowing numbers ev'ry page shall roll,</l>
<l>Where, as you read my verse, receive my soul.</l>
<l>Should sense, and wit, and art refuse to join</l>
<l>In all I write, and fail my great design,</l>
<l>Yet with such passion shall my lines be crown'd,</l>
<l>And so much softness in my poem found,</l>
<l>Such moving tenderness, the world shall see,</l>
<l>Love could have been describ'd by none but me.</l>
<l>Let <placeName key="tgn,1014723">Dryden</placeName> from his works with justice claim</l>
<l>Immortal praise! I from my sacred flame</l>
<l>Draw all my glory, challenge all my fame.</l>
<l>Believe me, <placeName key="tgn,1013136">Delia</placeName>, lovers have their wars,</l>
<l>And Cupid has his camp as well as <placeName key="tgn,2090583">Mars</placeName>.</l>
<l>That age which suits a soldier best, will prove</l>
<l>The fittest for the sharp fatigues of love;</l>
<l>None but young men the toils of war can bear,</l>
<l>None but young men can serve and please the fair;</l>
<l>Youth with the foe maintains the vig'rous fight,</l>
<l>Youth gives the longing maid the full delight.</l>
<l>On either hand like hardship it sustains,</l>
<l>Great are the soldier's, great the lover's pains.</l>
<l>Th' event of war no gen'ral can foreknow,</l>
<l>And that, alas! of love is doubtful too.</l>
<l>In various fields, whatever chance shall fall,</l>
<l>The soldier must resolve to bear it all;</l>
<l>With the like constancy must lovers wait,</l>
<l>Enduring bad, and hoping better fate;</l>
<l>Thro' doubts and fears, desires and wishes tost,</l>
<l>Undaunted, they must strain to reach the coast;</l>
<l>All will awhile look hideous to their eye,</l>
<l>The threat'ning storm still thickening in the sky,</l>
<l>No sight of land, no friendly harbour nigh.</l>
<l>Yet thro' all this the vent'rous lover steers,</l>
<l>To reap the golden crop that beauty bears;</l>
<l>So the bold mariners the seas explore,</l>
<l>Tho' winds blow hard, and waves like thunder roast</l>
<l>Rather than live in poverty on shore.</l>
<l>Embolden'd thus, let ev'ry youth set sail,</l>
<l>And trust to fortune for a prosp'rous gale;</l>
<l>Let them launch boldly from the lazy shore,</l>
<l>Nor fear a storm which will at last blow o'er.</l>
<l>Set all their reins to all their passions free,</l>
<l>Give wings to their desires, and love like me.</l>
<l>Happy that youth who, when his stars incline</l>
<l>His soul to love, can make a choice like mine.

<div1 type="section" n="2">
<head>Admiration</head>
<l>Thee, <placeName key="tgn,1013136">Delia</placeName>, all that see thee must admire,</l>
<l>And mankind in its own despite desire.</l>
<l>As a blind man, restor'd to sudden sight,</l>
<l>Starts in amaze at the first flash of light,</l>
<l>So was I struck, such sudden wonder knew,</l>
<l>When my eyes dazzl'd with the sight of you.</l>
<l>I saw whatever could inflame desire,</l>
<l>Parch up the veins, and set the blood on fire;</l>
<l>From ev'ry charm the pointed lightning came,</l>
<l>And fast as they dispers'd, I caught the flame;</l>
<l>Like stars your glittering eyes were seen to shine,</l>
<l>And roll with motions that are all divine,</l>
<l>Where majesty and softness mingled meet,</l>
<l>And shew a soul at once sublime and sweet;</l>
<l>I gaz'd; and, as I gaz'd, from ev'ry view</l>
<l>New wonders I descried, new passions drew.</l>
<l>Nor were the charms less pow'rful of your tongue,</l>
<l>My ravished soul on ev'ry accent hung,</l>
<l>Glow'd when you spoke, and melted when you sung.</l>
<l>Those lips unopen'd cannot fail to move,</l>
<l>But silently are eloquent in love;</l>
<l>That face and neck, those shoulders, hands, and arms,</l>
<l>Each limb, each feature, has peculiar charms;</l>
<l>Each of itself might singly win a soul,</l>
<l>And never need th' assistance of the whole;</l>
<l>On this one part a poet's praise might dwell,</l>
<l>Did not this other part deserve as well.</l>
<l>Beauty is surely near allied to wit,</l>
<l>Of which none can the just description hit;</l>
<l>By their own selves they may be shewn the best,</l>
<l>And only are, in being seen, exprest.</l>
<l>Beauty's true charms no poem can present,</l>
<l>Which but imperfectly are done in paint;</l>
<l>That, too, comes short of life, and only takes</l>
<l>Faint images of those which nature makes.
</l></div1>
<div1 type="section" n="3">
<head>Perseus and Andromeda</head>
<l>Propitious chance led Perseus once to view</l>
<l>The fairest piece that ever nature drew:</l>
<l>Chain'd on a rocky shore the virgin stood,</l>
<l>Naked, and whiter than the foaming flood;</l>
<l>Whom, as he cours'd the confines of the sky,</l>
<l>Amaz'd he saw, and kept his wond'ring eye</l>
<l>So fix'd, he had almost forgot to fly.</l>
<l>Had not the winds dispers'd her flowing hair,</l>
<l>And held it waving in the liquid air;</l>
<l>Or had not streams of tears apace roll'd down</l>
<l>Her lovely cheeks, he would have thought her stone.</l>
<l>Straight he precipitates his hasty flight,</l>
<l>Impatient to obtain a nearer sight.</l>
<l>Now all at once he feels the raging fires,</l>
<l>Sees all the maid, and all he sees, admires.</l>
<l>With awe and wonder, mix'd with love and fear,</l>
<l>He stands as motionless as shame made her;</l>
<l>Urg'd on at last, but still by slow degrees,</l>
<l>Loth to offend, he draws to what he sees.</l>
<l>"Oh! why (he cries), most matchless fair one, why</l>
<l>Are you thus us'd?  can you be doom'd to die?</l>
<l>Have you done any guilt? that guilt relate.</l>
<l>How can such beauty merit such a fate?</l>
<l>I am thy champion, and espouse thy cause;</l>
<l>In thy defence the Thund'rer's offspring draws.</l>
<l>Say, if thou'rt rescu'd by the son of Jove,</l>
<l>Say, for thy life wilt thou return my love?"</l>
<l>The bashful virgin no return affords,</l>
<l>But sends ten thousand sighs instead of words;</l>
<l>With grief, redoubled with her shame, she mourns</l>
<l>She weeps, he joys, she blushes, and he burns.</l>
<l>In chains, extended at her length she lay,</l>
<l>While he with transport took a full survey.</l>
<l>Fain would her hands her consciousblushes hide,</l>
<l>But that the fetters which they wore denied.</l>
<l>What could she do ? all that she could she did,</l>
<l>For drown'd in floods of tears, her eyes she hid.</l>
<l>Much urg'd to speak, she turn'd her bashful look</l>
<l>Far as she could aside, and trembling spoke:</l>
<l>"My mother, conscious of her beauty, strove</l>
<l>(Alas, too conscious!) with the wife of Jove,</l>
<l>Who, by a cruel and unjust decree,</l>
<l>To punish her, takes this revenge on me</l>
<l>Here I am doom'd a dreadful monster's prey,</l>
<l>Who now, now, now, is issuing from the sea;</l>
<l>Haste, gen'rous youth, our common foe subdue,</l>
<l>And if you save my life, I live for you."</l>
<l>Thus spoke the maid, half dying with her fears,</l>
<l>When, lo! the monster from the sea appears.</l>
<l>The dauntless hero mounts his flying horse,</l>
<l>And o'er the waves directs his airy course;</l>
<l>Let him alone his victory pursue,</l>
<l>For dreadful war has nothing here to do.</l>
<l>This short account will love-sick swains suffice,-</l>
<l>He slew his foe, and straight receiv'd his prize.</l>
<l>Thrice happy youth, too fortunately bless'd,</l>
<l>Who only came, and conquer'd, and possess'd;</l>
<l>None of the pangs of love your bliss annoy'd,-</l>
<l>You but beheld, admir'd, and so enjoy'd.

<l>All other lovers longer toils sustain;</l>
<l>Desires, hopes,jealousies, an endless train.

<div1 type="section" n="5">
<head>Pygmalion</head>
<l>How thou art envied let Pygmalion prove,</l>
<l>Who by a miracle obtained his love;</l>
<l>Who, living in an age when women led</l>
<l>The lewdest lives, all shame and honour fled,</l>
<l>For a long time declin'd the nuptial bed;</l>
<l>He saw them all debauch'd with monstrous crimes;</l>
<l>No virtuous maid, no <placeName key="tgn,1013136">Delia</placeName> bless'd the times.</l>
<l>Had she liv'd then, his skill had ne'er been shown,</l>
<l>Nor the strange miracle that crown'd it, known.</l>
<l>There had lie fix'd, not form'd, his fancied maid,</l>
<l>Nor fondly been by his own art betray'd.</l>
<l>The nymph in polish'd iv'ry glitter'd bright;</l>
<l>So smooth, she seem'd too slippery for his sight.</l>
<l>So curious was her shape, so just her frame,</l>
<l>So quick her eyes appear'd, so full of flame,</l>
<l>They would have roll'd if not restrained by shame.</l>
<l>From his strange art the statue had received</l>
<l>Such lively strokes, one would have thought it liv'd;</l>
<l>E'en he himself could hardly, hardly know,</l>
<l>But doubted long, whether it liv'd or no.</l>
<l>Yet from her, as she was, he gather'd fires,</l>
<l>And fierce and boundless were his mad desires.</l>
<l>He felt her flesh, (his fancy thought it such,)</l>
<l>And fear'd to hurt her with too rude a touch;</l>
<l>He kiss'd her with belief so strong and vain,</l>
<l>That he imagin'd how she kiss'd again.</l>
<l>Now makes his court, his fond addresses moves,</l>
<l>And tells a long fond tale how well he loves.</l>
<l>Presents her now with all he thought might please,</l>
<l>With precious gums distill'd from weeping trees.</l>
<l>Small singing birds, who strain their tuneful throats,</l>
<l>Covering round, repeat their pretty notes.</l>
<l>With sweetest flowers he crowns her lovely head,</l>
<l>And lays her on the softest downy bed.</l>
<l>In richest robes his charming idol drest,</l>
<l>Bright sparkling gems adorn her neck and breast,</l>
<l>And she look'd well in all, but looked, when naked, best.</l>
<l>Now <placeName key="tgn,2094077">Venus</placeName> kept her feast; and goodly train</l>
<l>For love-sick youths frequent, and fill her fane.</l>
<l>The snow-white heifers fall by sacred strokes,</l>
<l>While with rich gums the loaded altar smokes.</l>
<l>Among the rest the hopeless lover stands,</l>
<l>Tears in his eyes, his offerings in his hands;</l>
<l>More furious than before he feels his fires,</l>
<l>E'en his despair redoubles his desires.</l>
<l>A long, long time in orations deferr'd,</l>
<l>He durst not pray, lest he should not be heard;</l>
<l>Till urg'd by love, his tim'rous silence broke,</l>
<l>Thus, but still tim'rously, at last he spoke-</l>
<l>"If you, ye sacred powers that rule above,</l>
<l>And you, great goddess of propitious love;</l>
<l>If all we want is plac'd within your power,</l>
<l>And you can give whatever we implore;</l>
<l>Exert your godhead now, now lend your aid,</l>
<l>Give me the wife I wish, one like," he said,</l>
<l>But durst not say, "Give me the ivory maid."</l>
<l>This finish'd, thrice auspicious flashes rise,</l>
<l>And wreaths of curling smoke ascended thrice.</l>
<l>Half hoping now, and yet still half afraid,</l>
<l>With doubtful joy he seeks his ivory maid;</l>
<l>Doats more than ever on her fancied charms,</l>
<l>And closely clasps her in his longing arms;</l>
<l>When all at once, with joy and wonder fill'd,</l>
<l>He feels her stubborn sides begin to yield;</l>
<l>Soft was her bosom grown; her throbbing breast</l>
<l>Heav'd with her breath, swell'd greatly to be prest.</l>
<l>Surpriz'd and glad, he feels her oft and oft,</l>
<l>And more and more perceives her warm and soft.</l>
<l>Warm were her lips, and ev'ry pointed kiss</l>
<l>With melting touches met and moisten'd his.</l>
<l>Her blood now circled, and her pulses beat,</l>
<l>And life at last enjoy'd a settled seat.</l>
<l>Slowly she lifts her new and fearful sight</l>
<l>And sees at once her lover and the light;</l>
<l>An unborn maid both life and lover found,</l>
<l>And he too had his desp'rate wishes crown'd.</l>
<l>Desperate indeed; what prospect could he see,</l>
<l>Or how at first hope any more than me?
</l></div1>
<div1 type="section" n="6">
<head>Hippomenes and Atalanta</head>
<l>Hippomenes alone with hope inspir'd,</l>
<l>Might well rejoice to find his wishes fir'd,</l>
<l>Since well assur'd of all his wish desired.</l>
<l>His passion was of life, and soul, and flame,</l>
<l>He dauntless to the fatal barriers came:</l>
<l>With joy his vanquished rivals he beheld,</l>
<l><placeName key="tgn,6000442">Assur</placeName>'d to win, when all besides had failed.</l>
<l>He saw the lovely nymph outfly the wind,</l>
<l>And leave her breathless suitors far behind;</l>
<l>Saw Atalanta swift as lightning pass,</l>
<l>Yet soft as Zephyrs, sweep along the grass.</l>
<l>He knew the law, whose cruelty decreed,</l>
<l>That ev'ry youth who lost the race should bleed.</l>
<l>Yet if, like them, he could not run so fast,</l>
<l>He saw her worth the dying for at last.</l>
<l>Her ev'ry charm his praise and wonder mov'd,</l>
<l>And still the more he praised, the more he lov'd,</l>
<l>Now had he viewed the last unhappy strife,</l>
<l>And seen the vanquished youth resign his life;</l>
<l>When with his love transported, from his place,</l>
<l>Lest any other first should claim the race,</l>
<l>Rising he runs, regardless of their fate,</l>
<l>And presses where the panting maiden sat,</l>
<l>With eyes all sparkling with his hope and love,</l>
<l>And such a look, as could not fail to move;</l>
<l>"Tell me (he cries) why, barb'rous beauty, why</l>
<l>Are you so pleased to see these wretches die ?</l>
<l>Why have you with my feeble rivals strove,</l>
<l>Betray'd to death by their too daring love?</l>
<l>With me a less unequal race begin,</l>
<l>With me exert your utmost speed to win;</l>
<l>By my defeat you will your conquest crown,</l>
<l>And in my fall establish your renown:</l>
<l>Then undisturb'd you may your conquests boast,</l>
<l>For none will dare to strive when I have lost."</l>
<l>Thus while the prince his bold defiance spoke,</l>
<l>She eyes him with a soft relenting look.</l>
<l>Already does his distant fate deplore,</l>
<l>Concern'd for him, though ne'er concern'd before.</l>
<l>Doubtful she stands, and knows not what to choose,</l>
<l>And cannot wish to win, nor yet to lose,</l>
<l>But murmurs to herself; " Ye powers divine,</l>
<l>How hard, alas! a destiny is mine!</l>
<l>Why must I longer such a law obey,</l>
<l>And daily throw so many lives away?</l>
<l>Why must I by their deaths my nuptials shun!</l>
<l>Or else by marrying be myself undone?</l>
<l>Why must I still my cruelty pursue?</l>
<l>Why must a prince, so charming, perish too?</l>
<l>Such is his youth, his beauty, valour such,</l>
<l>E'en to myself I seem not worth so much.</l>
<l>Fly, lovely stranger, 'ere 'tis yet too late.</l>
<l>Fly from thy too, ah! too, too certain fate.</l>
<l>I would not send thee hence, I would not give</l>
<l>Such a command; couldst thou but stay, and live.</l>
<l>Thou with some fairer maid wilt happier be:</l>
<l>The fairest maid might be in love with thee.</l>
<l>So many suitors have already bled,</l>
<l>Who rashly ventured for my nuptial bed,</l>
<l>I fear lest thou shouldst run like them in vain,</l>
<l>Shouldst lose like them, and, ah! like them be slain.</l>
<l>Yet why should he alone my pity move?</l>
<l>It is but pity sure; it is not love.</l>
<l>I wish, bold youth, thou wouldst the race decline,</l>
<l>Or rather wish thy speed could equal mine.</l>
<l>Would thou hadst never seen this fatal place,</l>
<l>Nor I, alas! thy too, too charming face.</l>
<l>Were I by rig'rous fate allow'd to wed,</l>
<l>Thou shouldst alone enjoy, and bless my bed.</l>
<l>Were it but left to my own partial choice,</l>
<l>Of all mankind thou shouldst obtain my voice."</l>
<l>Twas here she paus'd; when urg'd with long delay,</l>
<l>The trumpets sound to hasten them away.</l>
<l>Straight at the summons is the race begun,</l>
<l>And side by side for some short time they run.</l>
<l>While the spectators from the barriers cry,</l>
<l>"Fly, prosp'rous youth, with all thy vigour fly:</l>
<l>Make haste, make haste, thy utmost speed enforce,</l>
<l>Love gives the wings to win the noble course.</l>
<l>See how unwillingly the virgin flies,</l>
<l>Pursue, and save thy life, and seize the prize."</l>
<l>'Tis doubtful yet, whether the general voice</l>
<l>Made the glad youth or virgin most rejoice.</l>
<l>Oft, in the swiftest fury of the race,</l>
<l>The nymph would slacken her impetuous pace,</l>
<l>And halt, and gaze, and almost fasten on his face.</l>
<l>Then fleet away again, as swift as wind,</l>
<l>Not without sighs to leave him so behind.</l>
<l>By this he saw his strength would ne'er prevail,</l>
<l>But still he had a charm that could not fail.</l>
<l>From his loose robe a golden apple drawn,</l>
<l>With force he hurl'd along the flowery lawn.</l>
<l>Straight at the sight the virgin could not hold,</l>
<l>But starts aside to catch the shining gold.</l>
<l>He takes the wished occasion, passes by,</l>
<l>While all the field resounded shouts of joy.</l>
<l>This she recovers with redoubled haste,</l>
<l>Till he far off the second apple cast.</l>
<l>Again the nymph diverts her near pursuit,</l>
<l>And running back secures the tempting fruit:</l>
<l>But her strange speed recovers her again,</l>
<l>Again the foremost in the flowery plain.</l>
<l>Now near the goal he summons all his might,</l>
<l>And prays to <placeName key="tgn,2094077">Venus</placeName> to direct him right,</l>
<l>With his last apple to retard her flight.</l>
<l>Though sure to lose if she the race declin'd,</l>
<l>For such a bribe the vict'ry she resigned.</l>
<l>Pleas'd that she'd lost, to the glad victor's arms</l>
<l>She gives the prize, and yields her dear-bought charms.</l>
<l>He by resistless gold the conquest gain'd,</l>
<l>In vain he ran, till that the race obtain'd.</l>
<l>Possess'd of that, he could not but subdue,</l>
<l>For gold, alas! would conquer <placeName key="tgn,2038501">Delia</placeName> too.</l>
<l>Yet oh ! thou best belov'd, thou loveliest maid,</l>
<l>Be not by too much avarice betray'd.</l>
<l>Prize thyself high, no easy purchase prove,</l>
<l>Nor let a fool with fortune be thy love.</l>
<l>Like Atalanta's conqueror let him be,</l>
<l>Brave, generous, young. from every failing free,</l>
<l>And to complete him let him love like me.</l>
<l>What pains against my wretched self I take</l>
<l>E'en I myself my jealousies awake.</l>
<l>Such men there are, bless'd with such gifts divine,</l>
<l>Who if they knew thee, would be surely thine.

<l>And some few months roll'd on in full delights.</l>
<l>Joys crowded to appear, and pleasures ran</l>
<l>Awhile in circles, ere our woe began.</l>
<l>Till I one fatal morn the chase pursu'd</l>
<l>Of a wild boar, through an adjacent wood.</l>
<l>Where,  as I hunted eager on my prey,</l>
<l>Aurora stopp'd me in my hasty way.</l>
<l>You may believe I do not dare to feign,</l>
<l>For mis'ry never made a man so vain;</l>
<l>She, though a goddess, straight began to move</l>
<l>A fruitless suit, and vainly talk'd of love.</l>
<l>Tho' she look'd bright as when she shines on high,</l>
<l>In all the glories of a morning sky;</l>
<l>Though earlier than the sun's, her beams display,</l>
<l>And shows the first approaches of the day;</l>
<l>I told her Procris all my soul possess'd;</l>
<l>That she alone reign'd sovereign of my breast,</l>
<l>Which never would admit another guest.</l>
<l>'Enjoy thy Procris then,' the goddess cried,</l>
<l>'Whom thou shalt one day wishthou'dst ne'er enjoy'd.'</l>
<l>Stung with her words, with doubts and fears oppress'd,</l>
<l>A sudden jealousy destroys my rest,</l>
<l>Mads all my brain, and poisons all my breast.</l>
<l>I thought the sex all false, e'en Procris too,</l>
<l>Again I thought she could not but be true.</l>
<l>Her youth and beauty kindled anxious cares,</l>
<l>But her known chastity condemn'd my fears.</l>
<l>But then my absence does again revive,</l>
<l>And keep the torturing fancy still alive.</l>
<l>I thought her faith too firmly fix'd to fall,</l>
<l>Yet a true lover is afraid of all.</l>
<l>I knew not what to think, but straight I go,</l>
<l>Resolv'd to cure, or to complete my woe.</l>
<l>A habit different from my own I took,</l>
<l>While with curs'd aid Aurora chang'd my look.</l>
<l>To <placeName key="tgn,7001393">Athens</placeName> straight, unknown by all, I came,</l>
<l>E'en to myself I scarce could seem the same.</l>
<l>Hardly I got admission to my house,</l>
<l>But far, far harder to my weeping spouse.</l>
<l>The house itself from aught of blame was free,</l>
<l>And every place express'd its grief for me.</l>
<l>A dismal silence reign'd through ev'ry room,</l>
<l>To mourn my loss, already safe at home.</l>
<l>E'en that sad pomp of woe, some charms could boast,</l>
<l>But when my Procris came, she charm'd me most.</l>
<l>Black were her robes, her solemn pace was slow,</l>
<l>Her dress was careless, yet becoming too.</l>
<l>A virtuous grief dwelt deeply on her face,</l>
<l>But matchless beauty gave that grief a grace.</l>
<l>Whole showers of tears her streaming eyes let fall.</l>
<l>Yet something wondrous lovely shone through all</l>
<l>Scarce could I at the charming sight forbear</l>
<l>From running to embrace my mournful fair,</l>
<l>Scarce hold from telling whom  she saw, though</l>
<l>alter'd, there.</l>
<l>But yet at length, my first design pursu'd,</l>
<l>With words I flattered, and with gifts I woo'd;</l>
<l>All the most moving arguments I used,</l>
<l>Oft pray'd and press'd, but was as oft refus'd.</l>
<l>She said another had before engross'd</l>
<l>All her affection, and my suit was lost,</l>
<l>Would any but a madman further try?</l>
<l>But ah! that mad, that desp'rate fool was I.</l>
<l>I grew the more industrious to destroy</l>
<l>Her matchless truth, and ruin all my joy.</l>
<l>Redoubled presents, and redoubled vows,</l>
<l>I made and offer'd, to betray my spouse.</l>
<l>At last her stagg'ring faith began to yield,</l>
<l>And I'd just won the long disputed field.</l>
<l>'Thy falsehood,' straight I cried, 'too late I see.</l>
<l>False to thy Cephalus, for I am he;</l>
<l>Since you are perjur'd, since my Procris grew</l>
<l>Forsworn and false, what woman can be true?'</l>
<l>She, at these words, almost of sense bereav'd,</l>
<l>With sad confusion found herself deceiv'd,</l>
<l>Fix'd on the ground she kept her downcast eye,</l>
<l>And silent with her shame, made no reply,</l>
<l>But to the mountains like a huntress hies,</l>
<l>And for my sake from all mankind she flies.</l>
<l>Which when I found, abandon'd and alone,</l>
<l>My dear half through my own folly gone;</l>
<l>Love fiercer than before began to burn,</l>
<l>Till I was raging for my wife's return.</l>
<l>My prayers dispatch'd with eagerness and haste,</l>
<l>That she would pardon all offences past;</l>
<l>Found her as kind, as she was truly chaste.</l>
<l>She came and crown'd my joys a second time;</l>
<l>Forgot my jealousy, forgave my crime.</l>
<l>'Twas then I thought my greatest mis'ries o'er,</l>
<l>But fate it seems had worse, far worse in store.</l>
<l>Soon as each early sun began to rise,</l>
<l>To glad the enlighten'd earth, and gild the skies,</l>
<l>I with his first appearance rise, and trace</l>
<l>The woods, and hills, that yielding game to chase</l>
<l>Alone I hunt, a long and tedious way,</l>
<l>And seldom fail to kill sufficient prey.</l>
<l>Then spent with toil, to cooler shades retreat,</l>
<l>And seek a refuge from a scorching heat.</l>
<l>Where pleasant valleys breathe a freer air,</l>
<l>For my refreshment I address this prayer.</l>
<l>'Come, air, I cry, joy of o'er-labour'd swains,</l>
<l>Come, and diffuse thyself through all my veins;</l>
<l>Breathe on my burning lips, and fev'rish breast,</l>
<l>And reign at large an ever-grateful guest.</l>
<l>Glide to my soul, and ev'ry vital part,</l>
<l>Distil thyself upon my panting heart.</l>
<l>By chance I other blandishments bestow</l>
<l>Or destiny decreed it should be so.</l>
<l>As 0, thou greatest pleasure of the plains,</l>
<l>Thou who assuagest all my raging pains;</l>
<l>Thou, who dost nature's richest sweets excite,</l>
<l>And mak'st me in these desert woods delight:</l>
<l>'Breathless and dead without thee should I be,</l>
<l>For all the life I have I draw from thee.'</l>
<l>While this I sung, some one who chanc'd to hear,</l>
<l>Thought her a nymph to whom I made my prayer,</l>
<l>And told my Procris of her rival, air.</l>
<l>She, kind, good soul, half-dying at the news,</l>
<l>Would now condemn me, now again excuse.</l>
<l>Now hopes 'tis all a falsehood, now she fears;</l>
<l>Suspects my faith as I suspected hers.</l>
<l>Resolv'd, at last, to trust no busy tongue,</l>
<l>But be herself the witness of her wrong;</l>
<l>When the next day with fatal haste came on,</l>
<l>And I was to my lov'd diversion gone,</l>
<l>She rose, and sought the solitary shade,</l>
<l>Where after hunting I was daily laid;</l>
<l>Close in a thicket undiscern'd she stood,</l>
<l>When I took shelter in the shady wood.</l>
<l>Then stretching on the grass my fainting weight,</l>
<l>'Come, much-lov'd air,' I cry, 'oh! come, abate</l>
<l>With thy sweet breath this most immoderate hate.'</l>
<l>At this a sudden noise invades my ear,</l>
<l>And rustling boughs shew'd something living there.</l>
<l>I rashly thinking it some savage beast,</l>
<l>Threw my unerring dart with heedless haste,</l>
<l>Which pierc'd, 0 gods! my Procris thro' the breast,</l>
<l>She, at the wound, with fearful shrieking fell,</l>
<l>And I, alas! knew the dear voice too well.</l>
<l>Thither, distracted with my grief, I flew,</l>
<l>To give my dying love a sad adieu.</l>
<l>All bloody was her lately snowy breast,</l>
<l>Her soul was hast'ning to eternal rest.</l>
<l>With rage I tore my robe, which close I bound,</l>
<l>To stop the blood, about the gaping wound.</l>
<l>What pardons did I beg? what curses frame,</l>
<l>For my damn'd fate, that was alone in blame?</l>
<l>When weakly raising up her dying head,</l>
<l>With a faint voice, these few sad words she said,</l>
<l>'Draw nearer yet, dear author of my death,</l>
<l>lear my last sighs, and snatch my parting breath.</l>
<l>But ere I die, by all that's sacred swear,</l>
<l>That you will never let my rival, air,</l>
<l>Profane my bed, or find reception there.</l>
<l>This I conjure you by your nuptial vow;</l>
<l>The faith you gave me then renew me now.</l>
<l>By all your love, if any love remain,</l>
<l>And by that love, which dying I retain;</l>
<l>Assure me but of this before I go,</l>
<l>And I shall bless thee for the fatal blow.'</l>
<l>" To her sad speech abruptly I replied,</l>
<l>In haste to shew her error ere she died.</l>
<l>Quickly I ran the tragic story o'er,</l>
<l>Which made herpleas'd amidst the pangs she bore.</l>
<l>This done, she rolls in death her dizzy eyes,</l>
<l>And with a sigh, which I receiv'd, she dies."</l>
<l>Here did the youth his doleful tale conclude,</l>
<l>A tale too doleful to be long pursu'd.</l>
<l>But this ill chosen instance will not do,</l>
<l>Unless my <placeName key="tgn,1123364">Delia</placeName> could bejealous too.</l>
<l>But she, whene'er I woo some other fair,</l>
<l>Shows no resentment and betrays no care.</l>
<l>She sees me court another, as unmov'd</l>
<l>As she has always seen herself belov'd.</l>
<l>That dreadful thought redoubles all my fear,</l>
<l>That drowns my hopes and drives me to despair.
</l></div1>
<div1 type="section" n="9">
<head>Despair</head>
<l>No foreign instance need of this be shown,</l>
<l>To draw it best, I must describe my own.</l>
<l>Though of this kind all ages can produce</l>
<l>Examples proper for the mourning muse;</l>
<l>Yet all to me must the first place resign,</l>
<l>None ever was so just, so deep as mine;</l>
<l>All day and night I sing, and all day long,</l>
<l>I love, and I despair, makes all my song.</l>
<l>Revolving days the same sad music hear,</l>
<l>Unchang'd those notes, I love, and I despair.</l>
<l>To me, as to the echo, fate affords</l>
<l>No power of speech but for those doleful words.</l>
<l>Some glimpse of sun, some cheerful beams appear</l>
<l>E'en through the gloomiest season of the year.</l>
<l>My clouded life admits no dawn of light,</l>
<l>No ray can pierce through my eternal night</l>
<l>All there is dismal as the shades beneath,</l>
<l>And all is dark as hell, as sad as death.</l>
<l>My anxious hours roll heavily away,</l>
<l>Depriv'd of sleep by night, and peace by day.</l>
<l>My soul no respite from her sufferings knows,</l>
<l>And sees no end of her eternal woes.</l>
<l>In a long line they run for ever on,</l>
<l>And still increase, and lengthen as they run.</l>
<l>By flight to lose my ills in vain I try,</l>
<l>From my despairing self I cannot fly.</l>
<l>Where'er I go, I bear about my flame,</l>
<l>In cities, countries, seas, 'tis still the same.</l>
<l>Scorch'd with my burning pains, I shun my house,</l>
<l>And strive in open air to seek repose.</l>
<l>My flames like torches shook in open air,</l>
<l>Grow with dilated heat more furious there.</l>
<l>Now to the most retir'd remotest place,</l>
<l>E'en to obscurity I fly to ease.</l>
<l>Retirement still foments the raging fire,</l>
<l>And trees, and fields, and floods, and verse conspire</l>
<l>To spread the flame and heighten the desire.</l>
<l>Wildly I range the woods and trace the groves,</l>
<l>To ev'ry oak I tell my hopeless loves.</l>
<l>Torn by my passion, to the earth I fall,</l>
<l>I kneel to all the gods, I pray to all;</l>
<l>Nothing but echo answers to my prayer,</l>
<l>And she speaks nothing but despair, despair.</l>
<l>From woods and wilds I no relief receive,</l>
<l>But wander on to try what seas can give</l>
<l>Deep thru' the tide, not knowing where I walk,</l>
<l>To the deaf winds, not knowing what, I talk.</l>
<l>Mad as the foaming main, aloud I rave,</l>
<l>While ev'ry tear keeps tine with ev'ry wave.

<head>Orpheus and Eurydice</head>
<l>So in old times the mournful Orpheus stood,</l>
<l>Drowning his sorrows in the Stygian flood,</l>
<l>Whose lamentable story seems to be</l>
<l>The nearest instance of a wretch like me.</l>
<l>Already had he pass'd the courts of death,</l>
<l>And charm'd with sacred verse the powers beneath;</l>
<l>While hell with silent admiration hung</l>
<l>On the soft music of his harp and tongue,</l>
<l>And the black roofs restored the wond'rous song.</l>
<l>No longer Tantalus essay'd to sip</l>
<l>The springs that fled from his deluded lip.</l>
<l>Their urn the fifty maids no longer fill;</l>
<l>Ixion lean'd and listen'd on his wheel,</l>
<l>And Sisyphus's stone for once stood still.</l>
<l>The ravenous vulture had forsook his meal,</l>
<l>And Tityus felt his growing liver heal;</l>
<l>Relenting fields to torture souls forbore,</l>
<l>And furies wept who never wept before;</l>
<l>All hell in harmony was heard to move</l>
<l>With equal sweetness as the spheres above.</l>
<l>Nor longer was his charming prayer denied;</l>
<l>All hell consented to release his bride.</l>
<l>Yet could the youth but short possession boast,</l>
<l>For what his poem gain'd, his passion lost;</l>
<l>Ere they restor'd her back to him and life,</l>
<l>They made him on these terms receive his wife:</l>
<l>If till he quite had pass'd the shades of night,</l>
<l>And reach'd the confines of ethereal light,</l>
<l>lie turn'd to view his prize, his wretched prize</l>
<l>Again was doom'd to vanish from his eyes.</l>
<l>Long had he wander'd on, and long forborne</l>
<l>To look, but was at last compelled to turn.</l>
<l>And now arriv'd where the sun's piercing ray</l>
<l>Struck thro' the gloom, and made a doubtful day,</l>
<l>Backwards his eyes the impatient lover cast</l>
<l>For one dear look, and that one look his last.</l>
<l>Straight from his sight flies his unhappy wife,</l>
<l>Who now liv'd twice, and twice was robb'd of life.</l>
<l>In vain to catch the fleeting shade he sought,</l>
<l>She too in vain bent backwards to be caught.</l>
<l>Gods ! what tumultuous raging passions toss'd</l>
<l>His anxious heart, when he perceiv'd her lost!</l>
<l>How wildly did his dreadful eye-balls roll!</l>
<l>How did all hell at once oppress his soul!</l>
<l>To what sad height was his direction grown!</l>
<l>How deep his just despair! how near my own!</l>
<l>In vain with her he labour'd to return,</l>
<l>All he could do was to sit down and mourn.</l>
<l>In vain, but ne'er before in vain, lie sings</l>
<l>At once the saddest and the sweetest things.</l>
<l>Stay, dear Eurydice, (he cries) ah! stay;</l>
<l>Why fleets the lovely shade so fast away?</l>
<l>Why am not I permitted to pursue?</l>
<l>Why will not rig'rous hell receive me too?</l>
<l>Already had she  reach'd the farther shore,</l>
<l>And I, alas! allow'd to pass no more;</l>
<l>Imprison'd closer in the dismal coast</l>
<l>She's now for ever, ever, ever lost.</l>
<l>No charms a second time can set her fiee,</l>
<l>Hell has her now again: would hell had me!</l>
<l>From all his pains let Tityus be releas'd.</l>
<l>And in his stead unhappier Orpheus plac'd.</l>
<l>He feels no torture I'll refuse to bear,</l>
<l>Her loss is worse than all he suffers there.</l>
<l>Is this your bounty then? ye powers below!</l>
<l>And these the short-lived blessings you bestow?</l>
<l>Why did you such a cruel cov'nant make !</l>
<l>Which you but too well knew I needs must break.</l>
<l>Ah! by this artifice, too late I find</l>
<l>Your envious nature never was inclin'd</l>
<l>To be entirely good, or thoroughly kind.</l>
<l>Had you persisted to refuse the grant,</l>
<l>I should not then have known the double want.</l>
<l>This was contrived by some malicious power,</l>
<l>To swell my woes and make my miseries more.</l>
<l>Plung'd in despair far deeper than at first,</l>
<l>And blest, a short, short while, to be for ever curst.</l>
<l>Al ! yet again relent, again restore</l>
<l>My wretched bride, be bounteous as before.</l>
<l>Ah ! let the force of verse as powerful be</l>
<l>O'er you, as was the force of love o'er me:</l>
<l>And the dear forfeit once again resign,</l>
<l>Which but for too much love had still been mine.</l>
<l>By that immense and awful sway you bear,</l>
<l>That silent horror that inhabits here;</l>
<l>By these vast realms, and that unquestion'd right,</l>
<l>By which you rule this everlasting night;</l>
<l>By these my tears and pray'rs, which once could move,</l>
<l>Once more I beg you to release my love.</l>
<l>Let her a little while with me remain,</l>
<l>A little while, and she is yours again.</l>
<l>The date of mortal life is finish'd soon,</l>
<l>Swift is the race, and short the time to run.</l>
<l>Inevitable fate your night secures,</l>
<l>And she, and I, and all at last are yours."</l>
<l>So sung the charming youth, in such a strain;</l>
<l>But sung, and charm'd the second time in vain,</l>
<l>No longer could he move the powers below,</l>
<l>Lost were his numbers then, as mine are now.</l>
<l>Torn with despair, he leaves the Stygian lakes;</l>
<l>And back to light a loathsome journey takes.</l>
<l>No light could cheer him in his cruel woes,</l>
<l>Who bears about his grief where'er he goes.</l>
<l>In sacred verse his sad complaints he vents,</l>
<l>And all the day, and all the night laments.</l>
<l>Incessantly he sings, whose moving song</l>
<l>Draws trees, and stones, and list'ning herds along.</l>
<l>The Sylvan gods, and wood-nymphs stood around,</l>
<l>And melting maids were ravish'd at the sound.</l>
<l>All hear the wondrous notes, and all that heard,</l>
<l>With utmost art address'd the mournful bard.</l>
<l>Not all their charms his constancy could move,</l>
<l>Who fled the thoughts of any second love.</l>
<l>When mad to see him slight their raging fire,</l>
<l>To mortal hate converting fierce desire,</l>
<l>With their own hands they made the youth expire.</l>
<l>Such proofs, my Delia, would I gladly give;</l>
<l>For thee I'd die, without thee will not live.</l>
<l>I've felt already the severest smart</l>
<l>Death can inflict, for it was death to part.

<l>Fix'd on that face where I could ever dwell,</l>
<l>Charm'd into silence by some magic spell,</l>
<l>I sigh'd and shook, and could not say farewell.</l>

<l>And death's cold damp sat heavy on my soul.</l>

<l>All signs of desp'rate grief possess'd the face,</l>

<head>The Parting of Achilles and Deidamia</head>
<l>Thus young Achilles, in <placeName key="tgn,7016608">Bithynia</placeName>'s court,</l>
<l>Had made a private, and a long resort;</l>
<l>Dress'd like a maid, the better to improve,</l>

<l>Where hours and days, he might secure receive</l>

<l>All <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> was now with Helen's rape alarm'd,</l>
<l>And all its princes to revenge her arm'd.</l>
<l>When spiteful pow'rs foretold them, their descent</l>

<l>She to her late discover'd lover flew.</l>
<l>On his dear neck her snowy arms she hung,</l>
<l>And streaming tears awhile restrained her tongue.</l>
<l>But at the last, her dismal silence broke,</l>
<l>These mournful words the weeping princess spoke.</l>
<l>"Whither, ah! whither would Achilles flee?</l>
<l>From all he's dearest to, from love and me?</l>
<l>Are not my charms the same? the same their pow'r?</l>
<l>Have I lost mine? or has Bellona more?</l>
<l>Oh! let me not so poorly be forsook</l>
<l>But view me, view me with your usual look.</l>
<l>Would you, unkind, from these embraces break?</l>
<l>Is glory grown so strong, or I so weak?</l>
<l>Glory is not your only call, I fear;</l>
<l>You go to meet some other mistress there.</l>

<l>All this and more, the lovely mournful maid</l>
<l>Told the sad youth, who sigh'd at all she said;</l>

<l>Of tears, which nothing else but love could force,</l>
<l>To the dear maid he turns his wat'ry eyes,</l>
<l>And to her sad discourse as sad replies:</l>
<l>"Thou late best blessing of my joyful heart,</l>
<l>Now grown my grief, since I must now depart,</l>
<l>Behold the pangs I bear; look up and see</l>
<l>How much I grieve to go, and comfort me.</l>
<l>Curse on that cunning traitor's smooth deceit,</l>
<l>Whose craft has made me, to my ruin, great;</l>
<l>Curse on that artifice by which I fell;</l>
<l>Curse on these hands for wielding swords so well</l>
<l>Though I should ne'er so fit for battle prove,</l>
<l>All my ambition's to be fit for love:</l>
<l>In his soft wars I would my life beguile,</l>
<l>With thee contend in the transporting toil,</l>
<l>Ravish'd to read my triumph in thy smile.</l>
<l>Boldly I'd strive, yet e'en when conquering yield</l>
<l>To thee the glory of the bloodless field;</l>
<l>With liquid fires melt the rich beauties down,</l>
<l>Rifle thy wealth, yet give thee all my own;</l>
<l>So should our wars be rapture and delight,-</l>
<l>But now I'm summon'd to another fight.</l>
<l>'Tis not my fault that I am forc'd away,</l>
<l>But when my honour calls, I must obey.</l>
<l>Durst I not death and every danger brave,</l>
<l>I were not worthy of the bliss I have;</l>
<l>More hazards than another would I meet,</l>
<l>Only to lay more laurels at your feet.</l>
<l>Oh ! do not fear that I should faithless prove,</l>
<l>For you, my only life, have all my love;</l>
<l>The thought of you shall help me to subdue,</l>
<l>I'll conquer faster, to return to you.</l>
<l>But if my honours should be laid in dust,</l>
<l>And I must fall, as heaven has said I must,</l>
<l>E'en in my death my only grief will be</l>
<l>That I for ever shall be snatch'd from thee;</l>
<l>That, that alone occasions all my fears,</l>
<l>Shakes my resolve, and melts me into tears.</l>
<l>My beating heart pants to thee as I speak,</l>
<l>And wishes, rather than depart, to break.</l>
<l>Feel how it trembles with a panic fright</l>
<l>Sure it will never fail me thus in fight.</l>
<l>I cannot longer hold this fond discourse,</l>
<l>For now the trumpets sound our sad divorce;</l>
<l>Sound ev'ry trumpet there, beat ev'ry drum,</l>
<l>Use all your charms to make Achilles come.</l>
<l>Farewell!-Alas ! I have not time to tell</l>
<l>How wondrous loath I part! -Once more, farewell!</l>
<l>Remember me as I'll remember you;</l>
<l>Like me be constant, and like me be true:</l>
<l>Gods! I shall ne'er be gone; adieu, adieu, adieu!'

<head>Absence</head>
<l>Happy that am'rous youth whose mistress hears</l>
<l>His swelling sighs, and sees his falling tears.</l>
<l>What savage maid her pity can deny</l>
<l>A breaking heart and a still streaming eye?</l>
<l>Absent, alas! he spends them all in vain,</l>
<l>While the dear cause is ign'rant of his pain.</l>
<l>Yet wretched as he is, he might be blest,</l>
<l>Could he himself contribute to his rest;</l>
<l>Would he resolve to struggle through the net,</l>
<l>And but a while endeavour to forget.</l>
<l>But his mad thoughts run ev'ry passage o'er,</l>
<l>And anxious mem'ry makes his passion more;</l>
<l>Perplexing mem'ry, that renews the scene</l>
<l>Of his past cares, and keeps him still in pain;</l>
<l>Keeps a poor wretch perpetually oppress'd,</l>
<l>And never lets unhappy lovers rest;</l>
<l>Lets them no pangs, no cruel suffrings lose,</l>
<l>But heaps their past upon their present woes.</l>
<l>Such was Leander's mem'ry when remov'd,</l>
<l>And sunder'd by the seas from all he lov'd.</l>
<l>The gather'd winds had wrought the tempest high,</l>
<l>Toss'd up the ocean, and obscur'd the sky;</l>
<l>And at this time, with an impetuous sway,</l>
<l>Pour'd forth their forces and possess'd the sea.</l>
<l>When the bold youth stood raging on the beach,</l>
<l>To view the much-lov'd coast he could not reach</l>
<l>His restless eyes ran all the distance o'er,</l>
<l>And from afar discern'd his Hero's tow'r.</l>
<l>Thrice, naked, in the waves his skill he tried,</l>
<l>And strove, as he was us'd, to stem the tide;</l>
<l>But tumbling billows threaten'd present wreck,</l>
<l>And rising up against him, dashed him back.</l>
<l>Then like a gallant soldier, forc'd to go,</l>
<l>Full of brave wrath, from a prevailing foe,</l>
<l>Again to town he makes his sad resort,</l>
<l>To see what ships would loosen from the port;</l>
<l>Finding but one durst launch into the seas,</l>
<l>He writes a letter fill'd with words like these.-
</l></div1>
<div1 type="section" n="14">
<head>Leander's Epistle to Hero</head>
<l>"Read this; yet be not troubled when you read,</l>
<l>Your lover comes not in his letter's stead.</l>
<l>On you all health, all happiness attend,</l>
<l>Which I would much, much rather bring than send.</l>
<l>But now these envious storms obstruct my way,</l>
<l>And only this bold bark durst put to sea.</l>
<l>I too had come, had not my parents' spies</l>
<l>Stood by to watch me with suspicious eyes.</l>
<l>How many tedious days and nights are past,</l>
<l>Since I was suffer'd to behold you last?</l>
<l>Ye spiteful gods and goddesses, who keep</l>
<l>Your wat'ry courts within the spacious deep,</l>
<l>Whys at this time, are all the winds broke forth,</l>
<l>Why swells the seas beneath the furious north?</l>
<l>'Tis summer now, when all should be serene;</l>
<l>The skies unclouded, undisturb'd the main:</l>
<l>Winter is yet unwilling to appear,</l>
<l>But you invert the seasons of the year.</l>
<l>Yet let me once attain the wish'd for beach,</l>
<l>Out of the now malicious Neptune's reach;</l>
<l>Then blow, ye winds; ye troubled billows roar;</l>
<l>Roll on ye angry waves, and lash the shore;</l>
<l>Ruffle the seas, drive the tempestuous air;</l>
<l>Be one continu'd storm, to keep me there.</l>
<l>Ah  Hero, when to you my course is bent,</l>
<l>I seem to slide along a smooth descent.</l>
<l>But in returning thence, I clamber up,</l>
<l>And scale, methinks, some lofty mountain's top.</l>
<l>Why, when our souls by mutual love are join'd,</l>
<l>Why are we sunder'd by the sea and wind?</l>
<l>Either make my <placeName key="tgn,6000030">Abydos</placeName> your retreat,</l>
<l>Or let your <placeName key="perseus,Sestos">Sestos</placeName> be my much  lov'd seat.</l>
<l>This plague of absence I can bear no more,</l>
<l>Come what can come, I'll shortly venture o'er;</l>
<l>Not all the rage of seas, nor force of storms,</l>
<l>Nothing but death, shall keep me from your arms:</l>
<l>Yet may that death at least so friendly prove,</l>
<l>To float me to the coast of her I love.</l>
<l>Let not the thought occasion any fear;</l>
<l>Doubt not, I will be soon and safely there:</l>
<l>But till that time, let this employ your hours,</l>
<l>And show ou that I can be none but yours."</l>
<l>Meanwhile, the vessel from the land withdrew,</l>
<l>When heaven took pity on a love so true;</l>
<l>The winds to blow, the waves to toss forbore,</l>
<l>In leaps the ravish'd youth, and ventures o'er,</l>
<l>With a smooth passage to the farther shore.</l>
<l>Now to the port the prosp'rous lover drives,</l>
<l>And safely after all his toils arrives.</l>
<l>Dissolved in bliss, he lies the live-long night,</l>
<l>Melts, languishes, and dies in vast delight.</l>
<l>But that delight my muse forbears to sing,</l>
<l>She knows the weakness of her infant wing.</l>
<l>As when the painter strove to draw the chief</l>
<l>Of all the Grecians, in his height of grief;</l>
<l>In ev'ry limb the well-shap'd piece excell'd,</l>
<l>But coming to the face, his pencil fail'd.</l>
<l>There modestly he staid, and held, for fear</l>
<l>He should not reach the woe he fancied there;</l>
<l>But round the mournful head a veil he threw</l>
<l>That man might guess at what he could not show.</l>
<l>So when our pleasures rise to excess,</l>
<l>No tongue can tell it, and no pen express.</l>
<l>Love will not have his mysteries revealed,</l>
<l>And beauty keeps the joys it gives concealed.</l>
<l>And till those joys my <placeName key="tgn,7003804">Delia</placeName> lets me know,</l>
<l>To me they shall continue ever so.</l>
<l>Ah! <placeName key="tgn,7003804">Delia</placeName>, would indulgent love decree,</l>
<l>Thy faithful slave that heaven of bliss with thee:</l>
<l>What then should be my verse? what darling flights</l>
<l>Should my muse take? reach  what celestial heights?</l>
<l>Now in despair, with drooping notes she sings,</l>
<l>No dawn of hope to raise her on her wings.</l>
<l>In the warm spring the warbling birds rejoice,</l>
<l>And in the smiling sunshine tune their voice.</l>
<l>Bask'd in the beams, they  strain  their tender throats,</l>
<l>Where cheerful light inspires the charming notes.</l>
<l>Such, and so charming, should my numbers be,</l>
<l>If you, my only light, would smile on me.</l>
<l>Your influence would inspire as moving airs,</l>
<l>And make my song as soft and sweet as theirs.</l>
<l>Would you but once auspiciously incline</l>
<l>To raise his fame, who only writes for thine;</l>
<l>I'd sing such notes as none but you could teach,</l>
<l>And none but one who loves like me can reach.</l>
<l>Secure of you, what raptures could I boast?</l>
<l>How wretched shall I be when you are lost?</l>
<l>Ah ! think what pangs despairing lovers prove,</l>
<l>And what a blest estate were mutual love.</l>
<l>How might my soul be with your favour rais'd?</l>
<l>And how in pleasing you, myself be pleas'd?</l>
<l>With what delight, what transport, could I burn?</l>
<l>Did but my flames receive the least return.</l>
<l>How would one tender look, one pitying smile,</l>
<l>Or one kind word from you, reward my toil?</l>
<l>It must, and would your tend'rest pity move,</l>
<l>Were you but once convince'd how well I love.</l>
<l>By ev'ry power that reigns and rules on high,</l>
<l>By love, the mightiest power of all the sky;</l>
<l>By your dear self, the last great oath, I swear,</l>
<l>That neither life, nor soul, are half so dear.</l>
<l>What need I these superfluous vows repeat?</l>
<l>Already sigh'd so often at your feet.</l>
<l>You know my passion is sincere and true,</l>
<l>I love you to excess; you know I do.</l>
<l>No tongue, no pen, can what I feel express,</l>
<l>E'en poetry itself must make it less.</l>
<l>You haunt me still, wherever I remove,</l>
<l>There's no retreat secure from fate, or love.</l>
<l>My soul from yours no distance can divide,</l>
<l>No rocks, nor caves, can from your presence hide.</l>
<l>By day, your lovely form fills all my sight,</l>
<l>Nor do I lose you, when I lose the light,</l>
<l>You are the charming phantom of the night.</l>
<l>Still your dear image dances in my view,</l>
<l>And all my restless thoughts run still on you;</l>
<l>You only are the sleeping poet's dream,</l>
<l>And when awake, you only are his theme.</l>
<l>Were I, by some yet harder fortune hurl'd</l>
<l>To the remotest parts of all the world;</l>
<l>The coldest northern clime, the torrid zone,</l>
<l>Should hear me sing of you, and you alone.</l>
<l>That pleasing task should all my hours employ,</l>
<l>Spent in a charming melancholy joy.</l>
<l>The chorus of the birds, the whisp'ring boughs,</l>
<l>And murm'ring streams, should join to sooth my woes:</l>
<l>My thoughts of you should yield a sad delight,</l>
<l>While joy and grief contend like day and night.</l>
<l>With smiles and tears, resembling sun and rain,</l>
<l>To keep the pleasure, I'd endure the pain;</l>
<l>If such content my troubled soul could know,</l>
<l>Such satisfaction, mix'd with so much woe;</l>
<l>If but my thoughts could keep my wishes warm,</l>
<l>Ah! how would your transporting presence charm</l>
<l>How pleasant would these pathless wilds appear,</l>
<l>Were you alone my kind companion here!</l>
<l>What should I then have left me to deplore ?</l>
<l>Oh! what society to wish for more?</l>
<l>No country thou art in can desert be,</l>
<l>And towns are desolate depriv'd of thee.</l>
<l>Banish'd with thee, I could an exile bear;</l>
<l>Banish'd from thee, the banishment lies there.</l>
<l>I to some lonely isle with thee could fly,</l>
<l>Where not a creature dwells but thou and I;</l>
<l>Where a wide-spreading main around us roars,</l>
<l>Besprinkling with its foam our desert shores;</l>
<l>Where winds and waves in endless wars engage,</l>
<l>And high-wrought tides roll with eternal rage;</l>
<l>Where ships far off their fearful courses steer,</l>
<l>And no bold vessel ever ventures near.</l>
<l>Should rising seas swell over ev'ry coast,</l>
<l>Were mankind in a second deluge lost,</l>
<l>Did only two of all the world survive,</l>
<l>Only one man, one woman left alive,</l>
<l>And should the gods that lot to us allow,</l>
<l>Were I Deucalion, and my <placeName key="perseus,Pyrrha">Pyrrha</placeName> thou,</l>
<l>Contentedly I should my fate embrace,</l>
<l>And would not beg them to renew our race;</l>
<l>All my most ardent wishes should implore,</l>
<l>All I should ask from each indulgent pow'r,</l>
<l>Would be to keep thee safe, and have no more.</l>
<l>Your cruelty occasions all my smart,</l>
<l>Your kindness could restore my bleeding heart.</l>
<l>You work me to a storm, you make me calm;</l>
<l>You give the wound, and can infuse the balm.</l>
<l>Of you I boast, of you alone complain,</l>
<l>My greatest pleasure and my greatest pain.</l>
<l>Whene'er you grieve I can no comfort know,</l>
<l>And when you first are pleas'd, I must be so;</l>
<l>While you are well, there's no disease I feel,</l>
<l>And I enjoy no health when you are ill.</l>
<l>Whate'er you do my actions does direct;</l>
<l>Your smile can raise me, and your frown deject.</l>
<l>Whome'er you love, I by the self same fate,</l>
<l>Love too; and hate,  whatever wretch you hate;</l>
<l>With yours, my wishes and my passions join,</l>
<l>Your humor and your int'rest, all is mine.</l>
<l>I share in all; nor can my fortunes be</l>
<l>Unhappy, let but fortune smile on thee.</l>
<l>You can preserve, you only can destroy,</l>
<l>Increase my sorrow, or create my joy.</l>
<l>From you, and you alone, my doom I wait,</l>
<l>You are the star whose influence rules my fate.</l>
<l>On yours my being, and my life depend,</l>
<l>And mine shall last no more, when yours must end.</l>
<l>No toil would be too great, no task too hard,</l>
<l>Were you at last to be my rich reward.</l>
<l>In serving you I'd spend my latest breath,</l>
<l>Brave any danger, run on any death.</l>
<l>I live but for your sake, and when I die,</l>
<l>All I shall pray for is, may you be by.</l>
<l>No life, like living with thee, can delight;</l>
<l>No death can please, like dying in thy sight.</l>
<l>Oh! when I must, by heaven's severe decree,</l>
<l>Be snatch'd from all that's dear, be snatch'd from thee,</l>
<l>Mayst thou be present to dispel my fear,</l>
<l>And soften with thy charms the pangs I bear.</l>
<l>While on thy lips I pour my parting breath;</l>
<l>Look thee all o'er, and clasp thee close in death;</l>
<l>Sigh out my soul upon thy panting breast,</l>
<l>And with a passion not to be expressed,</l>
<l>Sink at thy feet into eternal rest.

<head>Narcissus and Echo</head>
<l>The vocal nymph this lovely huntsman view'd,</l>
<l>As he into the toils his prey pursu'd,</l>
<l>Though of the power of speaking first debarr'd,</l>
<l>She could not hold from answering what she heard.</l>
<l>The jealous Juno by her wiles betray'd,</l>
<l>Took this revenge on the deceitful maid,</l>
<l>For when she might have seiz'd her faithless Jove,</l>
<l>Often in am'rous thefts of lawless love;</l>
<l>Her tedious talk would make the goddess stay,</l>
<l>And give her rivals time to run away:</l>
<l>Which when she found, she cried, "For such a wrong,</l>
<l>Small be the power of that deluding tongue."</l>
<l>Immediately the deed confirm'd the threats,</l>
<l>For Echo only what she hears repeats.</l>
<l>Now at the sight of the fair youth she glows,</l>
<l>And follows silently where'er he goes.</l>
<l>The nearer she pursu'd, the more she mov'd</l>
<l>Thro' the dear track he trode, the more she lov'd.</l>
<l>Still her approach inflamed her fierce desire,</l>
<l>As sulph'rous torches catch the neighb'ring fire.</l>
<l>How often would she strive, but strove in vain,</l>
<l>To tell the passion and confess her pain?</l>
<l>A thousand tender things her thoughts suggest,</l>
<l>With which she would have woo'd; but they suppress'd</l>
<l>For want of speech, lay buried in her breast.</l>
<l>Begin she could not, but she staid to wait</l>
<l>Till he should speak, and she his speech repeat.</l>
<l>Now several ways his young companions gone,</l>
<l>And for some time Narcissus left alone;</l>
<l>Where are you all?" at last she hears him call;</l>
<l>And she straight answers him, "Where are you all?"</l>
<l>Around he lets his wandering eye-sight roam,</l>
<l>But sees no creature whence the voice should come.</l>
<l>"Speak yet again," he cries, "is any nigh?"</l>
<l>Again the mournful Echo answers, "I."</l>
<l>"Why come not you!" says he, "appear in view:"</l>
<l>She hastily returns, " Why come not you ?"</l>
<l>Once more the voice th' astonish'd huntsman tried,</l>
<l>Louder he called, and louder she replied.</l>
<l>Then let us join," at last Narcissus said;</l>
<l>"Then let us join," replied the ravish'd maid.</l>
<l>Scarce had she spoke, when from  the woods she sprung,</l>
<l>And on his neck with close embraces hung.</l>
<l>But he with all his strength unlocks her fold,</l>
<l>And breaks unkindly from her feeble hold:</l>
<l>Then proudly cries, "Life shall this breast forsake</l>
<l>Ere you, loose nymph, on me your pleasure take."</l>
<l>"On me your pleasure take," the nymph replies,</l>
<l>While from her the disdainful huntsman flies.</l>
<l>Repuls'd, with  speed she seeks the gloomiest groves,</l>
<l>And pines to think on her rejected loves.</l>
<l>Alone laments her ill-requited flame,</l>
<l>And in the closest thickets shrouds her shame.</l>
<l>Her rage to be refus'd yields no relief,</l>
<l>But her fond passion is encreas'd by grief.</l>
<l>The thoughts of such a slight all sleep suppress'd,</l>
<l>And kept her languishing for want of rest:</l>
<l>Now pines she quite away with anxious care,</l>
<l>Her skin contracts, her blood dissolves to air,</l>
<l>Nothing but voice and bones she now retains,</l>
<l>These turn to stones, but still the voice remains:</l>
<l>In woods, caves, hills, for ever hid she lies,</l>
<l>Heard by all ears, but never seen by eyes.</l>
<l>Thus her and other nymphs his proud disdain</l>
<l>With an unheard of cruelty had slain;</l>
<l>Many on mountains and in rivers born,</l>
<l>Thus perish'd underneath his haughty scorn;</l>
<l>When one who in their suffrings bore a share,</l>
<l>With suppliant hands address'd this humble pray'r,</l>
<l>Thus may he love himself, and thus despair!"</l>
<l>Nor were her pray'rs at an ill hour preferr'd;</l>
<l>Rhamnusia, the revengeful goddess, heard.</l>
<l>Nature had plac'd a crystal fountain near,</l>
<l>The water deep, but to the bottom clear;</l>
<l>Whose silver spring ascended gently up,</l>
<l>And bubbled softly to the silent top.</l>
<l>The surface smooth as icy lakes appear'd,</l>
<l>Unknown by herdsman, undisturb'd by herd.</l>
<l>No bending tree above its surface grows,</l>
<l>Or scatters thence its leaves or broken boughs;</l>
<l>Yet at a just convenient distance stood,</l>
<l>All round the peaceful spring, a stately wood,</l>
<l>Thro' whose thick tops no sun could shoot his beams,</l>
<l>Nor view his image in the silver streams.</l>
<l>Thither from hunting, and the scorching heat,</l>
<l>The wearied youth was one day led by fate:</l>
<l>Down on his face to drink the spring he lies,</l>
<l>But as his image in that glass he spies,</l>
<l>He drinks in passion deeper at his eyes.</l>
<l>His own reflection works his wild desire,</l>
<l>And he himself sets his own self on fire:</l>
<l>Fix'd as some statue, he preserves his place,</l>
<l>Intent his looks, and motionless his face;</l>
<l>Deep thro' the spring his eye-balls dart their beams,</l>
<l>Like midnight stars that twinkle in the streams.</l>
<l>His iv'ry neck the crystal mirrow shows,</l>
<l>His waving hair above the surface flows,</l>
<l>His cheeks reflect the lily and the rose.</l>
<l>His own perfection all his passions mov'd,</l>
<l>He loves himself who for himself was lov'd;</l>
<l>Who seeks, is sought; who kindles the desires,</l>
<l>Is scorch'd himself;  who is admir'd,  admires.</l>
<l>Oft would he the deceitful spring embrace,</l>
<l>And seek to fasten on that lovely face</l>
<l>Oft with his down-thrust arms he thought to fold</l>
<l>About that neck that still deludes his hold,</l>
<l>He gets no kisses from those coz'n'ng lips;</l>
<l>His arms grasp nothing; from himself he slips;</l>
<l>He knows not what he views, and yet pursues</l>
<l>His desp'rate love, and burns for what he views.</l>
<l>"Catch not so fondly at a fleeting shade,</l>
<l>And be no longer by yourself betray'd;</l>
<l>It borrows all it has from you alone,</l>
<l>And it can boast of nothing of its own:</l>
<l>With you it comes, with you it stays, and so</l>
<l>Would go away, had you the power to go."</l>
<l>Neither for sleep nor hunger would he move,</l>
<l>But gazing still augments his hopeless love;</l>
<l>Still o'er the spring lie keeps his bending head,</l>
<l>Still with that flatt'ring form his eyes lie fed,</l>
<l>And silently surveys the treacherous shade.</l>
<l>To the deaf woods at length his grief he vents,</l>
<l>And in these words the wretched youth laments:</l>
<l>Tell me, ye hills, and dales, and neighboring groves,</l>
<l>You that are conscious of so many loves;</l>
<l>Say, have you ever seen a lover pine</l>
<l>Like me, or ever knew a love like mine ?</l>
<l>I know not whence this sudden flame should come,</l>
<l>I like and see, but see I know not whom;</l>
<l>What grieves me more, no rocks, nor rolling seas,</l>
<l>Nor strong-wall'd cities, nor untrodden ways,</l>
<l>Only a slender silver stream destroys,</l>
<l>And casts the bar between our sundred joys;</l>
<l>E'en he too seems to feel an equal flame,</l>
<l>The same his passion, his desires the same;</l>
<l>As oft as I my longing lips incline</l>
<l>To join with his, his mouth to meet with mine.</l>
<l>So near our faces and our mouths approach,</l>
<l>That almost to ourselves we seem to touch.</l>
<l>Come forth, whoe'er thou art, and do not fly</l>
<l>From one so passionately fond as I;</l>
<l>I've nothing to deserve your just disdain,</l>
<l>But have been lov'd, as I love you, in vain.</l>
<l>Yet all the signs of mutual love you give,</l>
<l>And my poor hopes in all your actions live;</l>
<l>When in the stream our hands I strive to join,</l>
<l>Yours straight ascend, and half way grasp at mine.</l>
<l>You smile my smiles; when I a tear let fall,</l>
<l>You shed another, and consent in all;</l>
<l>And when I speak, your lovely lips appear</l>
<l>To utter something which I cannot hear.</l>
<l>Alas! 'tis I myself; too late I see,</l>
<l>My own deceitful shade has ruin'd me;</l>
<l>With a mad passion for myself I'm curs'd,</l>
<l>And bear about those flames I kindled first.</l>
<l>In so perplex'd a case, what can I do ?</l>
<l>Ask, or be ask'd? shall I be woo'd, or woo?</l>
<l>All that I wish, I have ; what would I more?</l>
<l>Ah ! 'tis my too great plenty makes me poor.</l>
<l>Divide me from myself, ye powers divine,</l>
<l>Nor let his being intermix with mine!</l>
<l>All that I love and wish for, now retake;</l>
<l>A strange request for one in love to make!</l>
<l>I feel my strength decay with inward grief,</l>
<l>And hope to lose my sorrows with my life;</l>
<l>Nor would I mourn my own untimely fate,</l>
<l>Were he I love allow'd a longer date:</l>
<l>This makes me at my cruel stars repine,</l>
<l>That his much dearer life must end with mine.'</l>
<l>This said, again he turns his wat'ry face,</l>
<l>And gazes wildly in the crystal glass,</l>
<l>While streaming tears from his full eye-lids fell,</l>
<l>And drop by drop rais'd circles in the well;</l>
<l>The several rings larger and larger spread,</l>
<l>And by degrees dispers'd the fleeting shade,</l>
<l>Which when perceiv'd, "Oh, whither would you go?</l>
<l>(He cries,) ah! whither, whither fly you now?</l>
<l>Stay, lovely shade, do not so cruel prove,</l>
<l>In leaving me, who to distraction love;</l>
<l>Let me still see what ne'er can be possess'd,</l>
<l>And with the sight alone my phrensy feast."</l>
<l>Now frantic with his grief, his robe he tears,</l>
<l>And tokens of his rage his bosom bears;</l>
<l>The cruel wounds on his pure body show,</l>
<l>Like crimson mingling with the whitest snow;</l>
<l>Like apples with vermilion-circle's stripe,</l>
<l>Or a fair bunch of grapes not fully ripe.</l>
<l>But when he looks and sees the wounds he made,</l>
<l>Writ on the bosom of the charming shade,</l>
<l>His sorrows would admit of no relief,</l>
<l>But all his sense was swallow'd in his grief.</l>
<l>As wax, near any kindled fuel plac'd,</l>
<l>Melts, and is sensibly perceiv'd to waste;</l>
<l>As morning frosts are found to thaw away,</l>
<l>When once the sun begins to warm the day;</l>
<l>So the fond youth dissolves in hopeless fires,</l>
<l>And by degrees consumes in vain desires.</l>
<l>His lovely cheeks now lost their white and red,</l>
<l>Diminish'd was his strength, his beauty fled;</l>
<l>His body from its just proportions fell,</l>
<l>Which the scorn'd Echo lately lov'd so well</l>
<l>Yet though her first resentments she retaind,</l>
<l>And still remember'd how she was disdain'd,</l>
<l>She sigh'd, and when the wretched lover cried,</l>
<l>"Alas! alas!" the woful nymph replied.</l>
<l>Then when, with cruel blows his hands would wound</l>
<l>His tender breast, she still restor'd the sound.</l>
<l>Now hanging o'er the spring his drooping head,</l>
<l>With a sad sigh these lying words lie said:</l>
<l>"Ah! boy, belov'd in vain!" through all the plain</l>
<l>Echo resounds, " Ah! boy, belov'd in vain!"</l>
<l>"Farewell," he cries, and with that word he died;</l>
<l>"Farewell!" the miserable nymph replied.</l>
<l>Now pale and breathless on the grass he lies,</l>
<l>For death had shut his self-admiring eyes;</l>
<l>Now wafted over to the Stygian coast,</l>
<l>The waters there reflect his wandering ghost;</l>
<l>In loud laments his weeping sisters mourn,</l>
<l>Which Echo makes the neighb'ring hills return.</l>
<l>All signs of desp'rate grief the nymphs express,</l>
<l>Great is the moan, yet is not Echo's less.

<head>Salmacis and Hermaphroditus</head>
<l>The lovely Salmacis the fountain own'd,</l>
<l>A nymph with ev'ry blooming beauty crown'd.</l>
<l>Unpractis'd in the chase, untaught to throw</l>
<l>The thrilling dart, or bend the stubborn bow.</l>
<l>Never engaged in races on the plain,</l>
<l>Nor ever mingling with Diana's train.</l>
<l>Oft would her sister say, "Rise, rise, for shame,</l>
<l>And join with us in some laborious game.</l>
<l>Seize on a quiver, or a pointed spear,</l>
<l>Hunt the wild boar, or chase the tim'rous deer;"</l>
<l>No quiver would she seize, no jav'lin shake,</l>
<l>No toil endure, in no fatigue partake.</l>
<l>But in her fountain is her sole delight,</l>
<l>For there she bathes by day, and rests by night;</l>
<l>Still in that liquid glass herself she dress'd,</l>
<l>And learn'd from thence what looks became her best.</l>
<l>Now in this lawn, her lovely limbs array'd,</l>
<l>Stretch'd at her length, on the soft moss were laid,</l>
<l>Through the transparent robes, to the full view display'd.</l>
<l>Now languishing she lies, and gathers flowers,</l>
<l>Pluck'd from the blooming sides of neighb'ring bow'rs:</l>
<l>Thus was she busied, when she chanced to spy</l>
<l>The lovely son of Hermes passing by.</l>
<l>At the first sight she found her wishes fired,</l>
<l>And the fair youth, as soon as seen, desired.</l>
<l>Yet would she not approach, though mad to meet,</l>
<l>Though she could scarce hold back her eager feet,</l>
<l>Till she might first her utmost skill bestow,</l>
<l>To make her beauties to advantage show :</l>
<l>Use all her art to let her charms appear,</l>
<l>Who, without art, might well be reckon'd fair.</l>
<l>At last attir'd she comes, at once she breaks</l>
<l>Into these moving words, and meltingly she speaks.</l>
<l>"Such charms, dear youth, dwell in your lovely face,</l>
<l>I cannot think you born of human race.</l>
<l>If then a god descended from above,</l>
<l>You are not, sure, less than the god of love.</l>
<l>But if you spring not from the race divine,</l>
<l>If come from any of a mortal line;</l>
<l>Happy, thrice happy, must thy parents be,</l>
<l>And all thy kindred bless'd, and proud of thee.</l>
<l>Blest were that woman's breasts who fed thee first</l>
<l>In whose fond arms thy infancy was nurs'd.</l>
<l>But more, -- Oh! infinitely more than all the rest,</l>
<l>Must the fair partner of thy bed be bless'd!</l>
<l>If there be such, let us the bliss divide,</l>
<l>Too great to be by any one enjoy'd.</l>
<l>If not already bound by nuptial vows,</l>
<l>Seal them with me, make me the joyful spouse."</l>
<l>Here stopt the love-sick nymph; whose boldness made</l>
<l>The bashful youth blush for the things she said.</l>
<l>Still lovelier in his blushes look'd the boy,</l>
<l>Still her desires grew fiercer to enjoy.</l>
<l>So blushes fruit upon the sunny-side,</l>
<l>So iv'ry shows with deep vermilion died.</l>
<l>So in eclipses looks the lab'ring moon,</l>
<l>When stain'd with red, her struggling face is shown.</l>
<l>Nearer and nearer now the virgin moved,</l>
<l>Ready to seize upon the swain she loved.</l>
<l>Disdainfully he flies her fond embrace,</l>
<l>And cries, with bashful anger in his face,</l>
<l>"Forbear, loose nyrmph, or I'll forsake the place."</l>
<l>She at that menace from the man she loved,</l>
<l>Replied, "'Tis yours, fair youth," and so removed.</l>
<l>Yet at some distance, in a thicket hid,</l>
<l>The maid observ'd whate'er the charmer did.</l>
<l>Who now believing that he was not seen,</l>
<l>With bolder steps trips o'er the flow'ry green.</l>
<l>Now to the banks of that delightful stream,</l>
<l>Which the fair nymph that loved him own'd, he came,</l>
<l>Dipt in his feet, and thence by small degrees,</l>
<l>Pleased with the warmth he waded to the knees:</l>
<l>Then back unto the banks again he goes,</l>
<l>Down on the ground his silken garments throws,</l>
<l>And to the ravish'd maid, all, all the man he shows.</l>
<l>His naked charms her wondering sight amaz'd</l>
<l>Who now with more impatient longings gaz'd.</l>
<l>Her eyes shoot fires, and shine with sparkling flames,</l>
<l>As when the sun plays on the silver streams,</l>
<l>Or when a crystal glass reflects the beams.</l>
<l>Mad to possess her bliss, about to fly,</l>
<l>To seize and fasten on the lovely boy,</l>
<l>She burns with the delay of the transporting joy.</l>
<l>Now from the flow'ry bank on which he stood,</l>
<l>The lovely youth leap'd down into the flood.</l>
<l>His skillful arms support his snowy limbs,</l>
<l>Still glittering thro' the streams in which he swims</l>
<l>Like iv'ry statues which the life surpass,</l>
<l>Or lilies cover'd with a crystal glass.</l>
<l>"He's mine, he's mine," the ravish'd virgin cries;</l>
<l>And straight disrob'd of all, impatient flies,</l>
<l>And plunging in the flood, pursues her joys.</l>
<l>Now o'er his neck her circling arms she cast,</l>
<l>Now threw them lower, o'er his struggling waist.</l>
<l>Her twining limbs on ev'ry side she wound,</l>
<l>Lock'd him all o'er, and clasp'd him all around.</l>
<l>"So when a tow'ring eagle's talons bear</l>
<l>A Snake close grip'd, and hissing thro' the air</l>
<l>About his neck the curling serpent clings,</l>
<l>And fetters with his tail his spacious wings."</l>
<l>Still, tho' detain'd, the boy the bliss denies,</l>
<l>Still struggles to resist the virgin's joys.</l>
<l>"In vain you strive," she cries," this proud disdain,</l>
<l>Foolish, ungrateful youth, is all in vain.</l>
<l>Grant ye, good gods, no day, no time may see</l>
<l>Me sever'd from this youth, or he from me."</l>
<l>To the maid's prayer propitious gods inclin'd,</l>
<l>Straight into one their different forms were twin'd,</l>
<l>And as they mingled souls, their bodies join'd.</l></div1>

<head>Elegy I:  By Dryden</head>
<l>For mighty wars I thought to tune my lute,</l>
<l>And make my measures to my subject suit.</l>
<l>Six feet for ev'ry verse the muse design'd,</l>
<l>But Cupid laughing, when he saw my mind,</l>
<l>From ev'ry second verse a foot purloin'd.</l>
<l>"Who gave thee, boy, this arbitrary sway,</l>
<l>On subjects, not thy own, commands to lay,</l>
<l>Who Phoebus only, and his laws obey ?</l>
<l>'Tis more absurd, than if the queen of love</l>
<l>Should in Minerva's arms to battle move;</l>
<l>Or manly Pallas from that queen should take</l>
<l>Her torch, and o'er the dying lover shake.</l>
<l>In fields as well may Cynthia sow the corn,</l>
<l>Or <placeName key="tgn,1092955">Ceres</placeName> wind in woods the bugle-horn;</l>
<l>As well may Phoebus quit the trembling string,</l>
<l>For sword and shield; and Mars may learn to sing.</l>
<l>Already thy dominions are too large;</l>
<l>Be not ambitious of a foreign charge.</l>
<l>If thou wilt reign o'er all, and ev'ry where,</l>
<l>The god of music for his harp may fear.</l>
<l>Thus when with soaring wings I seek renown,</l>
<l>Thou pluck'st my pinions, and I flutter down.</l>
<l>Could I on such mean thoughts my muse employ,</l>
<l>I want a mistress, or a blooming boy."</l>
<l>Thus I complain'd; his bow the stripling bent,</l>
<l>And chose an arrow fit for his intent.</l>
<l>The shaft his purpose fatally pursues;</l>
<l>" Now, poet, there's a subject for thy muse,"</l>
<l>He said: (too well, alas, he knows his trade,)</l>
<l>For in my breast a mortal wound he made.</l>
<l>Far hence ye proud Hexameters remove,</l>
<l>My verse is pac'd, and tramell'd into love.</l>
<l>With myrtle wreaths my thoughtful brows enclose,</l>
<l>While in unequal verse I sing my woes.

<head>Elegy  II:  By Creech</head>
<l>Ah me! why am I so uneasy grown?</l>
<l>Ah! why so restless on my bed of down?</l>
<l>Why do I wish to sleep, but wish in vain?</l>
<l>Why am I all the tedious night in pain?</l>
<l>What cause is this, that ease, that rest denies?</l>
<l>And why my words break forth in gentle sighs?</l>
<l>Sure I should know if love had fix'd his dart;</l>
<l>Or creeps he softly in with treacherous art,</l>
<l>And then grows tyrant, there and wounds the heart?</l>
<l>'Tis so, the shaft sticks deep, and galls my breast;</l>
<l>'Tis tyrant love, that robs my thoughts of rest!</l>
<l>Well, shall I tamely yield, or must I fight?</l>
<l>I'll yield; 'tis patience makes a burden light:</l>
<l>A shaken torch grows fierce, and sparks arise;</l>
<l>But, if unmov'd, the fire looks pale and dies.</l>
<l>The hard-mouth'd horse smarts for his fierce disdain</l>
<l>The gentle's ridden with a looser rein.</l>
<l>Love smooths the gentle, but the fierce reclaims;</l>
<l>He fires their breasts, and fills their souls with flames.</l>
<l>I yield; great Love, my former crimes forgive,</l>
<l>Forget my rebel thoughts, and let me live;</l>
<l>No need of force: I willingly obey,</l>
<l>And now unarm'd, shall prove no glorious prey.</l>
<l>Go take thy mother's doves, thy myrtle crown,</l>
<l>And for thy chariot, Mars shall lend his own;</l>
<l>There thou shalt sit in thy triumphant pride,</l>
<l>And, whilst glad shouts resound on ev'ry side,</l>
<l>Thy gentle hands thy mother's doves shall guide.</l>
<l>And there to make thy glorious pomp and state,</l>
<l>A train of sighing youths, and maids shall wait,</l>
<l>Yet none complain of an unhappy fate.</l>
<l>There newly conquer'd I, still fresh my wound,</l>
<l>Will march along, my hands with myrtle bound;</l>
<l>There modesty, with veils thrown o'er her face,</l>
<l>Now doubly blushing at her own disgrace;</l>
<l>There sober thoughts, and whatso'er disdains</l>
<l>Love's rules, shall feel his power, and bear his chains:</l>
<l>Then all shall fear, all bow, yet all rejoice;</l>
<l>"Io triumphe" be the public voice.</l>
<l>Thy constant guards, soft fancy, hope and fear,</l>
<l>Anger, and soft caresses shall be there:</l>
<l>By these strong guards are men and gods o'erthrown;</l>
<l>These conquer for thee, Love, and these alone,</l>
<l>Thy mother, from the sky thy pomp shall grace,</l>
<l>And scatter sweetest roses in thy face:</l>
<l>There glorious Love shall ride, profusely dress'd</l>
<l>With all the richest jewels of the east:</l>
<l>Rich gems thy quiver, and thy wheels infold,</l>
<l>And hide the poorness of the baser gold.</l>
<l>Then thou shalt conquer many, then.thy darts</l>
<l>Shall scatter thousand wounds on tender hearts:</l>
<l>Thy shafts themselves will fly, thy neighb'ring fire</l>
<l>Will catch mens' breasts, and kindle warm desire.</l>
<l>Thus conqu'ring <placeName key="tgn,2097807">Bacchus</placeName> looks in Indian groves,</l>
<l>He drawn by tigers, thou by murm'ring doves.</l>
<l>Well then, since I too can increase thy train,</l>
<l>Spend not thy force on me, and rage in vain;</l>
<l>Look on thy kinsman Caesar's happy slaves,</l>
<l>The same victorious arm that conquers, saves.

<head>Elegy  III:  To His Mistress. By Charles Hopkins.</head>
<l>Be just, dear maid, an equal passion prove,</l>
<l>Or show me cause why I should ever love.</l>
<l>I do not at your cold disdain repine,</l>
<l>Nor ask your love, do you but suffer mine.</l>
<l>I dare not aim at more exalted bliss,</l>
<l>And Venus will bestow her vot'ry this.</l>
<l>Take hin, who will for endless ages serve:</l>
<l>Take him whose faithful flame will never swerve</l>
<l>Though no illustrious names my race adorn;</l>
<l>Who am but of equestrian order born;</l>
<l>Though a few ploughs serve my paternal fields,</l>
<l>Nor my small table many dishes yields;</l>
<l>Yet Bacchus, Phoebus, and the tuneful nine,</l>
<l>Are all my friends, and to my side incline,</l>
<l>And love's great god, at last, will make me thine.</l>
<l>Heav'n knows, dear maid, I love no other fair;</l>
<l>In thee lives all my love, my heav'n lies there.</l>
<l>Oh! may I by indulgent Fate's decree,</l>
<l>With thee lead all my life, and die with thee.</l>
<l>Thy beauties yield me my transporting theme;</l>
<l>And while I celebrate thy charming name,</l>
<l>My verse shall be as sacred as my flame.</l>
<l>Jove's sev'ral rapes, his injur'd Io's wrongs,</l>
<l>Are made immortal in his poet's songs.</l>
<l>Verse still reveals where Leda's flames began,</l>
<l>Rais'd by the secret godhead in the swan,</l>
<l>The story of the rape Europa bore,</l>
<l>Shall last while winds shall rage, or waters roar.</l>
<l>Your name shall live like theirs, while verse endures,</l>
<l>And mine be ever writ, and read with yours.

<head>Elegy  IV:  To His Mistress, whose husband is invited to a feast with him. The poet instructed her how to behave herself in his company.  By <placeName key="tgn,1014723">Dryden</placeName>.</head>
<l>Your husband will be with us at the treat,</l>
<l>May that be the last supper he shall eat.</l>
<l>And am poor I, a guest invited there,</l>
<l>Only to see, while he may touch the fair?</l>
<l>To see you kiss, and hug your nauseous lord,</l>
<l>While his lewd hand descends below the board?</l>
<l>No wonder that Hippodamia's charms,</l>
<l>At such a sight, the Centaurs urg'd to arms:</l>
<l>That in a rage, they threw their cups aside,</l>
<l>Assail'd the bridegroom, and would force the bride.</l>
<l>I am not half a horse, (I would I were :)</l>
<l>Yet hardly can from you my hands forbear.</l>
<l>Take, then, my counsel; which observ'd, may be,</l>
<l>Of some importance both to you and me.</l>
<l>Be sure to come before your man be there,</l>
<l>There's nothing can be done, but come howe'er.</l>
<l>Sit next him, (that belongs to decency;)</l>
<l>But tread upon my foot in passing by.</l>
<l>Read in my looks what silently they speak,</l>
<l>And slily, with your eyes, your answer make.</l>
<l>My lifted eye-brow shall declare my pain,</l>
<l>My right hand to his fellow shall complain;</l>
<l>And on the back a letter shall design,</l>
<l>Beside a note that shall be writ in wine.</l>
<l>Whene'er you think upon our last embrace,</l>
<l>With your fore-finger gently touch your face.</l>
<l>If any word of mine offend my dear,</l>
<l>Pull with your hand the velvet of your ear;</l>
<l>If you are pleas'd with what I do or say,</l>
<l>Handle your rings, or vith your fingers play.</l>
<l>As suppliants use at altars, hold the board,</l>
<l>Whene'er you wish the devil may take your lord.</l>
<l>When he fills for you, never touch the cup,</l>
<l>But bid th' officious cuckold drink it up:</l>
<l>The waiter on those services employ;</l>
<l>Drink you, and I will snatch it from the boy,</l>
<l>Watching the part where your sweet mouth hath been,</l>
<l>And thence, with eager lips, will suck it in.</l>
<l>If he, with clownish manners, thinks it fit</l>
<l>To taste, and offer you the nasty bit,</l>
<l>Reject his greasy kindness, and restore</l>
<l>Th' unsav'ry morsel he had chew'd before.</l>
<l>Nor let his arms embrace your neck, nor rest</l>
<l>Your tender cheek upon his hairy breast;</l>
<l>Let not his hand within your bosom stray,</l>
<l>And rudely with your pretty bubbies play.</l>
<l>But, above all, let him no kiss receive,</l>
<l>That's an offence I never can forgive;</l>
<l>Do not, oh! do not that sweet mouth resign,</l>
<l>Lest I rise up in arms, and cry 'tis mine.</l>
<l>I shall thrust in betwixt, and void of fear</l>
<l>The manifest adult'rer will appear.</l>
<l>These things are plain to sight, but more I doubt</l>
<l>What you conceal beneath your petticoat;</l>
<l>Take not his leg between your tender thighs,</l>
<l>Nor with your hand provoke my foe to rise.</l>
<l>How many love inventions I deplore,</l>
<l>Which I myself have practis'd all before !</l>
<l>How oft have I been forc'd the robe to lift</l>
<l>In company; to make a homely shift</l>
<l>For a bare bout, ill huddled o'er in haste,</l>
<l>While o'er my side the fair her mantle cast!</l>
<l>You to your husband shall not be so kind,</l>
<l>But lest you should, your mantle leave behind.</l>
<l>Encourage him to tope, but kiss him not,</l>
<l>Nor mix one drop of water in his pot.</l>
<l>If he be fuddled well, and snores apace,</l>
<l>Then we may take advice from time and place.</l>
<l>When all depart, while compliments are loud,</l>
<l>Be sure to mix among the thickest crowd;</l>
<l>There I will be, and there we cannot miss,</l>
<l>Perhaps to grubble, or at least to kiss.</l>
<l>Alas, what length of labor I employ,</l>
<l>Just to secure a short and transient joy!</l>
<l>For night must part us, and when night is come</l>
<l>Tuck'd underneath his arm, he leads you home.</l>
<l>He locks you in, I follow to the door,</l>
<l>His fortune envy, and my own deplore;</l>
<l>He kisses you, he more than kisses too,</l>
<l>Th' outrageous cuckold thinks it all his due.</l>
<l>But add not to his joy by your consent,</l>
<l>And let it not be given, but only lent;</l>
<l>Return no kiss, nor move in any sort,</l>
<l>Make it a dull and a malignant sport.</l>
<l>Had I my wish he should no pleasure take,</l>
<l>But slubber o'er your bus'ness for my sake;</l>
<l>And whate'er fortune shall this night befall,</l>
<l>Coax me to morrow by forswearing all.

<head>Elegy V:  By Duke</head>
<l>'Twas noon when I, scorch'd with the double fire</l>
<l>Of the hot sun and my more hot desire,</l>
<l>Stretch'd on my downy couch at ease was laid,</l>
<l>Big with expectance of the lovely maid.</l>
<l>The curtains but half drawn, a light let in</l>
<l>Such as in shades of thickest groves is seen,</l>
<l>Such as remains when the sun flies away,</l>
<l>Or when night's gone, and yet it is not day.</l>
<l>This light to modest maids must be allow'd,</l>
<l>Where shame may hope its guilty head to shroud.</l>
<l>And now my love <placeName key="tgn,2044648">Corinna</placeName> did appear,</l>
<l>Loose on her neck fell her divided hair;</l>
<l>Loose as her flowing gown, that wanton'd in the air.</l>
<l>In such a garb, with such a grace and mien,</l>
<l>To her rich bed came the Assyrian queen;</l>
<l>So Lais looked when all the youth of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName></l>
<l>With adoration did her charms confess.</l>
<l>Her envious gown to pull away I tried,</l>
<l>But she resisted still, and still denied;</l>
<l>But so resisted that she seem'd to be</l>
<l>Unwilling to obtain the victory;</l>
<l>So I at last an easy conquest had,</l>
<l>Whilst my fair combatant herself betray'd.</l>
<l>But when she naked stood before my eyes,</l>
<l>Gods, with what charms did she my soul surprise!</l>
<l>What snowy arms did I both see and feel!</l>
<l>With what rich globes did her soft bosom swell!</l>
<l>Plump as ripe clusters rose each glowing breast,</l>
<l>Courting the hand, and suing to be press'd!</l>
<l>What a smooth plain was on her belly spread,</l>
<l>Where thousand little loves and graces play'd!</l>
<l>What thighs! what legs ! but why strive I in vain,</l>
<l>Each limb, each grace, each feature to explain</l>
<l>One beauty did through her whole body shine;</l>
<l>I saw, admir'd, and press'd it close to mine</l>
<l>The rest who knows not? Thus entranc'd we lay,</l>
<l>Till in each other's arms we died away;</l>
<l>0 give me such a noon, ye gods, to ev'ry day!

<l>The smallest crevice will my bus'ness do,</l>
<l>It cannot be so straight but I'll slip through.</l>
<l>Love guides me when by night I walk the street,</l>
<l>And when I grope my way directs my feet.</l>
<l>By night I was a youth afraid to walk,</l>
<l>Frighted by children and old nurses' talk;</l>
<l>I wonder'd men could wander in the gloom,</l>
<l>And kept, for fear of spirits, close at home.</l>
<l>Love and his mother, when they knew my care,</l>
<l>Cried, "Fool, thou shalt not long these phantoms fear."</l>
<l>Nor fear'd I long, for love my heart possess'd;</l>
<l>Those visions vanish'd, and my terrors ceas'd:</l>
<l>Nor ghosts nor scourers did I dread, but stroll'd</l>
<l>The streets a-nights, and grew in peril bold.</l>
<l>Thee only do I fear, and trembling stand</l>
<l>To wait the motions of thy tardy hand:</l>
<l>With soft request thy succour I implore,</l>
<l>Nor sue to Jove nor dread the Thund'rer more.</l>
<l>See how the gate is moistened with my tears!</l>
<l>What marks of my impatient love it bears!</l>
<l>Remember, when thou for the lash wert stripp'd</l>
<l>Who sav'd thee, at whose suit thou wert not whipp'd.</l>
<l>Did not I sooth thy angry lady's mind,</l>
<l>And make thy peace? Be thou to me as kind.</l>
<l>Think what soft things to move her soul I said,</l>
<l>And let them in a lover's favour plead.</l>
<l>But ah! the tender things that made her kind,</l>
<l>Work no such wonders on thy cruel mind.</l>
<l>Wouldst thou my friendly offices repay,</l>
<l>Fate throws a fair occasion in thy way;</l>
<l>Unlock the gate, the morning will not stay.</l>
<l>Unlock the gate; and as thou'rt kind to me,</l>
<l>So may thy gentle lady prove to thee;</l>
<l>May she to loose thy hateful chains incline,</l>
<l>And stead of water, be thy portion wine.</l>
<l>But what avail my soothing words? Thy ear</l>
<l>Is deaf, inhuman! to my moving pray'r.</l>
<l>Your gates with posts of pond'rous oak are barr'd,</l>
<l>As if your house was for a siege prepar'd;</l>
<l>Why all this fence? what foe have you to fear?</l>
<l>And why in peace do you provide for war?</l>
<l>Thus rudely if your lady's friends you treat,</l>
<l>What usage must her foes expect to meet?</l>
<l>Unlock the gate,-the morning will not stay;</l>
<l>Unlock the gate, and give my love its way.</l>
<l>Or is it sloth or is it sleep that brings,</l>
<l>This let to love, and pinions down his wings!</l>
<l>Why else do I in vain repeat my prayer,</l>
<l>Is it, thou dost not, or thou wilt not hear?</l>
<l>When first I waited at thy gate, and thought</l>
<l>To 'scape thy care, I was at midnight caught.</l>
<l>With over-dilligence thou then look'st out,</l>
<l>To spy what lover was upon the scout.</l>
<l>These are wild guesses, thou'rt perhaps employ'd</l>
<l>More sweetly, and enjoy'st what I enjoy'd.</l>
<l>And while I'm waiting with impatience here,</l>
<l>Thy envied fortune's with the faithless fair.</l>
<l>Oh, for thy pleasure, give me all thy pains,</l>
<l>Let us change chances, and be mine thy chains.</l>
<l>Unlock the gate, the morning will not stay,</l>
<l>Unlock the gate, and kindness past repay.</l>
<l>Hark: or I dream, or on the hinge I hear</l>
<l>The wicket turn, or bolts unloosen'd jar.</l>
<l>I dream, indeed, the bolts as they were laid,</l>
<l>Stand fix'd: the noise was by my fancy made.</l>
<l>But all, alas! is hush'd, I hear no sound,</l>
<l>All in the silence of the night is drown'd.</l>
<l>Here, hopeless of admittance, I attend,</l>
<l>While on my head the pearly dews descend.</l>
<l>Unlock the gate, the morning will not stay,</l>
<l>Unlock the gate, I will no longer pray,</l>
<l>But force by sword and fire my readier way.</l>
<l>What need of fire or sword? myself alone,</l>
<l>More pow'rful, than or sword or fire am grown.</l>
<l>Around your heads shall flaming torches fly,</l>
<l>And Jove the house shall burn, as well as I.</l>
<l>Night, love, and wine encourage and inflame:</l>
<l>These triumph over fear, and that o'er shame.</l>
<l>All ways I've tried, but all successless prove,</l>
<l>Nor threats can fright thee, nor entreaties move;</l>
<l>Deaf to my pray'rs as to my tears thou'rt blind,</l>
<l>Thy gate is less obdurate than thy mind.</l>
<l>But see, the ruddy morn begins to rise,</l>
<l>And paints with rosy streaks the eastern skies,</l>
<l>While crowing cocks the lab'rer's sloth revile,</l>
<l>And summon wretches to their daily toil.</l>
<l>Throw then, fond man, thy fragrant chaplet by,</l>
<l>And let it at thy lady's threshold lie.</l>
<l>When in the morn thy faded flow'rs she spies,</l>
<l>Kind thoughts of me may in her bosom rise,</l>
<l>Perhaps she may resent her porter's crime,</l>
<l>And grieve that here so ill I spent my time.</l>
<l>Against me though thou shut'st thy lady's gate,</l>
<l>I cannot one, that serves my mistress, hate.</l>
<l>You both who did against my hopes rebel,</l>
<l>Ah, porter; and ah, cruel gate, farewell.

<head>Elegy VII:  To His Mistress, whom he had beaten.  By Henry Cromwell.</head>
<l>Come, if ye're friends, and let these hands be bound,</l>
<l>Which could with impious rage a mistress wound:</l>
<l>What more did Ajax in his fury do,</l>
<l>When all the sacred grazing herd he slew?</l>
<l>Or he<note anchored="yes" place="foot" resp="ed">Orestes</note> who spared not her who gave him breath?</l>
<l>So ill the son reveng'd his father's death!</l>
<l>Then I had broke the most religious ties,</l>
<l>Both to my parents and the deities:</l>
<l>I tore (0 heav'ns!) her finely braided hair,</l>
<l>How charming then look'd the disorder'd fair.</l>
<l>So Atalanta in her chaise is drawn,</l>
<l>Where the <placeName key="tgn,2136419">Arcadian</placeName> beasts her empire own:</l>
<l>So Ariadne, left upon the shore,</l>
<l>Does all alone her lost estate deplore.</l>
<l>Who would not then have rail'd and talk'd aloud</l>
<l>(Which to the helpless sex might be allowed.)</l>
<l>She only did upbraid me with her eye,</l>
<l>Whose speaking tears did want of words supply.</l>
<l>0, that some merciful superior pow'r</l>
<l>Had struck me lame before that fatal hour,</l>
<l>And not have suffer'd me to pierce my heart</l>
<l>So deeply, in the best and tend'rest part;</l>
<l>To make a lady that subjection own,</l>
<l>Which is not to the meanest Roman known.</l>
<l>'Twas Diomede, who first a goddess struck,</l>
<l>I from his hand that curs'd example took;</l>
<l>But he was far less criminal than I,</l>
<l>I was a lover, he an enemy.</l>
<l>March like a conqueror in triumph now,</l>
<l>With laurel wreaths encompassing your brow,</l>
<l>And render to the mighty gods your vow:</l>
<l>So, as you pass, th' attending gazing crowd,</l>
<l>By their applause shall speak your courage loud:</l>
<l>Let your sad captive in the front appear,</l>
<l>With streaming cheeks, and with dishevell'd hair.</l>
<l>Such lips were form'd for kinder words than these,</l>
<l>Wounds made by lovers' furious ecstasies.</l>
<l>Though like a torrent I was hurried on,</l>
<l>A slave to passion which I could not shun,</l>
<l>I might have only pierc'd her tender ear</l>
<l>With threatening language, such as virgins fear.</l>
<l>Fear having chill'd the current of her blood,</l>
<l>She pale as Parian marble statue stood;</l>
<l>Tears, which suspense did for a while restrain,</l>
<l>Gush'd forth, and down her cheeks the deluge ran.</l>
<l>As when the sun does by a powerful beam</l>
<l>Dissolve the frost, it runs into a stream.</l>
<l>The lamentable objects struck me dead,</l>
<l>And tears of blood to quench those tears I shed;</l>
<l>Thrice at her feet the prostrate suppliant fell,</l>
<l>And thrice did she repulse the criminal.</l>
<l>What would I not your anger to abate,</l>
<l>Redeem your favour, or remove your hate?</l>
<l>To your revenge no means or method spare;</l>
<l>Revenge, alas! is easy to the fair.

<head>Elegy VIII:  He Curses a Bawd, for going about to debauch his mistress.  By Sir Charles Sedley.</head>
<l>There is a bawd renown'd in <placeName key="tgn,2094077">Venus</placeName>' wars,</l>
<l>Aud dreadful still with honorable scars;</l>
<l>Her youth and beauty, craft and guile supply,</l>
<l>Sworn foe to all degrees of chastity.</l>
<l>Dypsas, who first taught love-sick maids the way</l>
<l>To cheat the bridegroom on the wedding-day,</l>
<l>And then a hundred subtle tricks devis'd,</l>
<l>Wherewith the am'rous theft might be disguis'd;</l>
<l>Of herbs and spells she tries the guilty force,</l>
<l>The poison of a mare that goes to horse.</l>
<l>Cleaving the midnight air upon a switch,</l>
<l>Some for a bawd, most take her for a witch.</l>
<l>Each morning sees her reeling to her bed,</l>
<l>Her native blue o'ercome with drunken red:</l>
<l>Her ready tongue ne'er wants a useful lie,</l>
<l>Soft moving words, nor charming flattery.</l>
<l>Thus I o'erheard her to my <placeName key="tgn,2075531">Lucia</placeName> speak:</l>
<l>"Young <placeName key="tgn,2274809">Damon</placeName>'s heart wilt thou for ever break</l>
<l>He long has lov'd thee, and by me he sends</l>
<l>To learn thy motions, which he still attends;</l>
<l>If to the park thou go'st, the plays are ill;</l>
<l>If to the plays, he thinks the air would kill.</l>
<l>The other day he gaz'd upon thy face,</l>
<l>As he would grow a statue in the place;</l>
<l>And who indeed does not? like a new star,</l>
<l>Beauty like thine strikes wonder from afar.</l>
<l>Alas! methinks thou art ill-dress'd to-night;</l>
<l>This point's too poor; thy necklace is not right;</l>
<l>This gown was by some botching tailor made,</l>
<l>It spoils thy shape; this fucus is ill laid.</l>
<l>Hear me, and be as happy as thou'rt fair:</l>
<l>Damon is rich, and what thou wanst, can spare.</l>
<l>Like thine his face, like thine his eyes are thought.</l>
<l>Would he not buy, he might himself be bought."</l>
<l>Fair <placeName key="tgn,2075531">Lucia</placeName> blush'd.  "It is a sign of grace,</l>
<l>(Dypsas replied,) that red becomes thy face.</l>
<l>All lovers now by what they give are weighed,</l>
<l>And she is best belov'd that best is paid;</l>
<l>The sun-burnt Latins, in old Tatius' reign,</l>
<l>Did to one man perhaps their love restrain:</l>
<l><placeName key="tgn,2096104">Venus</placeName> in her Aeneas' city rules,</l>
<l>And all adore her deity but fools.</l>
<l>Go on, ye fair, chaste only let such live</l>
<l>As none will ask, and know not how to give.</l>
<l>Life steals away, and our best hours are gone</l>
<l>Ere the true use or worth of them be known.</l>
<l>Things long neglected, of themselves decay;</l>
<l>What we forbear, time rudely makes his prey.</l>
<l>Beauty is best preserv'd by exercise,</l>
<l>Nor for that task can one or few suffice.</l>
<l>Wouldst thou grow rich, thou must from many take:</l>
<l>From one 'twere hard continually to rake.</l>
<l>Without new gowns and coaches, who can live ?</l>
<l>What does thy poet but new verses give?</l>
<l>A poet, the last thing that earth does breed,</l>
<l>Whose wit, for sixpence, any one may read.</l>
<l>Hang the poor lover, and his pedigree;</l>
<l>The thriving merchant, or fat judge, give me.</l>
<l>Love truly none, but seem in love with all,</l>
<l>And at old friends to thy new lovers rail.</l>
<l>Sometimes deny, 'twill appetite procure;</l>
<l>The sharp-set hawks will stoop to any lure.</l>
<l>Then grant again, lest he a habit get</l>
<l>Of living from thee; but be sure thou let</l>
<l>No empty lover in; murmur sometimes,</l>
<l>And at first hurt, reproach him with thy crimes.</l>
<l>Seem jealous, when thou'st been thyself to blame;</l>
<l>'Twill stop his mouth, if thou the first complain.</l>
<l>All thou hast done be ready to forswear:</l>
<l>For lovers' oaths fair <placeName key="tgn,2096104">Venus</placeName> has no ear.</l>
<l>Whilst lie is with thee, let some woman bring</l>
<l>Some Indian stuff or foreign precious thing;</l>
<l>Which thou must say thou want'st, and he must buy,</l>
<l>Though for it six months hence in gaol he lie.</l>
<l>Thy mother, sister, brother, and thy nurse,</l>
<l>Must have a pull each at thy lover's purse.</l>
<l>Let him from rivals never be secure,</l>
<l>That hope once gone, love will not long endure;</l>
<l>Show him the presents by those rivals sent,</l>
<l>So shall his bounty thy request prevent.</l>
<l>When he will give no more, ask him to lend:</l>
<l>If he wants money, find a trusting friend.</l>
<l>Get hangings, cabinets, and looking-glass,</l>
<l>Or any thing for which his word will pass.</l>
<l>Practise these rules, thou'lt find the benefit!</l>
<l>I lost my beauty ere I got this wit."</l>
<l>I at that word step'd from behind the door,</l>
<l>And scarce my nails from her thin cheeks forbore.</l>
<l>Her few gray hairs in rage I vow'd to pull,</l>
<l>And thrust her drunken eyes into her skull.</l>
<l>"Poor in a dungeon's bottom may'st thou rot,</l>
<l>Die with a blow with thy beloved pot;</l>
<l>No brandy, and eternal thirst, thy lot."

<head>Elegy IX:  Of Love and War.  By Henry Cromwell.</head>
<l>Trust me, my Atticus, in love are wars;</l>
<l>And Cupid has his camp, as well as <placeName key="tgn,2090583">Mars</placeName>:</l>
<l>The age that's fit for war best suits with love,</l>
<l>The old in both unserviceable prove,</l>
<l>Infirm in war, and impotent in love.</l>
<l>The soldiers which a general does require,</l>
<l>Are such as ladies would in bed desire:</l>
<l>Who but a soldier, and a lover, can</l>
<l>Bear the night's cold, in show'rs of hail and rain?</l>
<l>One in continual watch his station keeps,</l>
<l>Or on the earth in broken slumbers sleeps;</l>
<l>The other takes his still repeated round</l>
<l>By mistress' house &mdash; then lodges on the ground.</l>
<l>Soldiers, and lovers, with a careful eye,</l>
<l>Observe the motions of the enemy:</l>
<l>One to the walls makes his approach in form,</l>
<l>Pushes the siege, and takes the town by storm:</l>
<l>The other lays his close to Celia's fort,</l>
<l>Presses his point, and gains the wish'd-for port.</l>
<l>As soldiers, when the foe securely lies</l>
<l>In sleep, and wine dissolv'd, the camp surprise;</l>
<l>So when the jealous to their rest remove,</l>
<l>And all is hush'd, &mdash; the other steals to love.</l>
<l>You then, who think that love's an idle fit,</l>
<l>Know, that it is the exercise of wit.</l>
<l>In flames of love the fierce Achilles burns,</l>
<l>And, quitting arms, absent Briseis mourns:</l>
<l>From the embraces of Andromache</l>
<l>Went Hector arm'd for war, and victory.</l>
<l>As Agamemnon saw Cassandra pass</l>
<l>With hair dishevell'd, and disorder'd dress,</l>
<l>H' admir'd the beauties of the prophetess:</l>
<l>The god of war was caught in th' act of love;</l>
<l>A story know to all the court above.</l>
<l>Once did I pass my hours in sloth and ease,</l>
<l>Cool shades and beds of down could only please;</l>
<l>When a commanding beauty rais'd my mind,</l>
<l>I left all little trifling thoughts behind,</l>
<l>And to her service all my heart resign'd:</l>
<l>Since, like an active soldier, have I spent</l>
<l>My time in toils of war, in beauty's tent:</l>
<l>And for so sweet a pay all dangers underwent.</l>
<l>You see, my Atticus, by what I prove,</l>
<l>Who would not live in idleness-must love.

<head>Elegy XI:  To Nape, praying her to deliver his letter to her mistress.  By Henry Cromwell.</head>
<l>Nape, who know'st so well to set the hair,</l>
<l>And all the fashions of the modish fair,</l>
<l>Like thee no lady's  woman in the town</l>
<l>Can forward an intrigue, or pin a gown;</l>
<l>No maid than thee can boast a quicker eye,</l>
<l>Nor sooner the sour husband's coming spy.</l>
<l>Here, Nape, take this billet-doux, and bear</l>
<l>My soul's soft wishes to the absent fair.</l>
<l>If I can guess, thy heart is not of flint,</l>
<l>Nor is there the least vein of iron in't;</l>
<l>I something in thy looks and manners see</l>
<l>Above the rudeness of thy low degree;</l>
<l>A softer turn, to pity more inclined,</l>
<l>Than vulgar souls, a more complacent mind;</l>
<l>Thou feel'st, if I can guess, an equal flame,</l>
<l>And thine and my distemper is the same.</l>
<l>If how I do, she asks, do thou reply,</l>
<l>For the dear night, and night's dear joys, I die.</l>
<l>Tell her the letter will the rest explain,</l>
<l>And does my soul, and all its hopes contain.</l>
<l>But time, while I am speaking, flies: be sure</l>
<l>To give the billet in a leisure hour:</l>
<l>Don't be content with her imperfect view,</l>
<l>But make her, when she has it, read it through.</l>
<l>I charge thee, as she reads, observe her eyes,</l>
<l>Catch, if thou canst, her gentle looks and sighs;</l>
<l>As these are sure presages of my joy,</l>
<l>So frowns and low'rs my flattering hopes destroy.</l>
<l>Pray her, when she has read it, to indite</l>
<l>An answer, and a long epistle write.</l>
<l>I hate a billet, where at once I view</l>
<l>A page all empty, but a line or two.</l>
<l>Let her without a margin fill it up,</l>
<l>And crowd it from the bottom to the top.</l>
<l>But why should I her pretty fingers tire?</l>
<l>A word's enough, and all that I desire.</l>
<l>Ah, Nape, let her only bid me come;</l>
<l>The page is large, which for that word has room.</l>
<l>Her letter, like a conqu'ror's, shall be bound</l>
<l>With bays, for it with conquests shall be crown'd.

<l>And e'en to ope the tender letter scorn'd</l>

<l>From combs of Cosica the wax was ta'en,</l>

<l>Bees there from venom'd flow'rs their honey suck,</l>

<l>There hatch their young, and there the om'nous owl.</l>
<l>How mad to use such tablets must I be?</l>

<l>Lawyers, on you, might horrid jargon write,</l>

<l>Well might your plain the wicked writings bear</l>
<l>Where the rich miser robs the ruin'd heir.</l>
<l>When I first purchas'd you, I feared no less,</l>

<head>Elegy XIII:  To the Morning, not to make haste.  By an unknown hand.</head>
<l>Aurora, rising from old Tithon's bed,</l>
<l>Does o'er the eastern skies her roses spread:</l>
<l>Stay, beauteous morn, awhile thy chariot stay,</l>
<l>Awhile with lagging wheels retard the day.</l>
<l>So may young birds, as often as the spring</l>
<l>Renews the year, o'er Memnon's ashes sing.</l>
<l>Now I lie folded in <placeName key="tgn,2044648">Corinna</placeName>'s arms,</l>
<l>And all her soul is mine, and all her charms;</l>
<l>I now am to her panting bosom press'd,</l>
<l>And now, if ever lover was, am bless'd.</l>
<l>As yet sweet sleep sits heavy on our eyes,</l>
<l>And warbling birds forbid, as yet to rise.</l>
<l>Stay, beauteous morning, for to love-sick maids</l>
<l>And youths, how grateful are these dusky shades!</l>
<l>All stay, and do not, from the blushing east,</l>
<l>With dawning glories break our balmy rest.</l>
<l>When night's black mantle does those glories hide,</l>
<l>The pilot by the stars his ship can guide,</l>
<l>And in mid-sea a certain course pursue,</l>
<l>As safe as when he has the sun in view.</l>
<l>What pleasure in thy light should mortals take?</l>
<l>Thou dost the weary traveller awake;</l>
<l>Though to the down his heavy head reclines,</l>
<l>Up he must lift it for the morning shines.</l>
<l>The soldier braces on his brazen shield,</l>
<l>Quits his warm tent, and fits him for the field:</l>
<l>The lab'ring hind his harrow takes, and now</l>
<l>The peasant yokes his oxen to the plough:</l>
<l>The boy half wak'd, and rubbing still his eyes,</l>
<l>Is loth alike to go to school, or rise;</l>
<l>While o'er his task he does imperfect nod,</l>
<l>He fears the ferula, he dreads the rod.</l>
<l>The bridegroom, starting from his bride's embrace,</l>
<l>Runs to his lawyer to consult his case;</l>
<l>A word is wanting in the dower deed,</l>
<l>And what to save the portion must he plead?</l>
<l>Now hungry serjeants quit their tempting ease,</l>
<l>To haunt the crowded courts and pick up fees.</l>
<l>Thy rise brings labour to the female band,</l>
<l>And puts the spindle in the spinster's hand:</l>
<l>Light are these toils, and little is the pain</l>
<l>To rise to work, and rest at night again;</l>
<l>But who that e'er knew love's transporting joys,</l>
<l>Could from the arms of youth and beauty rise?</l>
<l>Oft have I wish'd that night would keep her ground,</l>
<l>And all her stars be at thy rising found;</l>
<l>Oft have I wish'd the winds would stop thy way,</l>
<l>Repel thy car, or clouds involve the day.</l>
<l>Dost thou in envy lash each lazy steed,</l>
<l>And whirl thy chariot with unwonted speed?</l>
<l>Black was thy son, and in his hue's express'd</l>
<l>The gloomy passions of his parent's breats;</l>
<l>He, born of Cephalus, his ravish'd sire,</l>
<l>Is a known proof of thy adult'rous fire.</l>
<l>Thou, by his colour, wouldst thy crime conceal;</l>
<l>Ah, that to Tithon I the tale could tell!</l>
<l>Search all the records of Heaven's lechers round,</l>
<l>A fouler story cannot there be found.</l>
<l>In Cephalus' embraces when you lay,</l>
<l>And oft by theft renew'd your wanton play;</l>
<l>When Tithon's impotence you made your sport,</l>
<l>Did you not think the joyous moments short?</l>
<l>Lock'd in his arms did you in transports lie,</l>
<l>Ah! would you not, like me, to Phoebus cry,</l>
<l>"Stop, stop thy rapid course? Am I to blame</l>
<l>That Tithon's old, and cannot feel thy flame?</l>
<l>See how the moon does her Endymion keep</l>
<l>In night conceal'd, and drown'd in dewy sleep.</l>
<l>As lovely is the moon, as fair as thou,</l>
<l>Who freely, where she loves, her favours does bestow.</l>
<l>Jove, when he rob'd Amphitryon of his joy,</l>
<l>Did two whole nights in am'rous thefts employ;</l>
<l>Unknown when in Alcmena's arms he lay,</l>
<l>The night he doubles and suspends the day."</l>
<l>The morning heard my railing, and for shame</l>
<l>Blush'd that by force she must disturb my flame;</l>
<l>Bright Phoebus rushing forth, the glorious day</l>
<l>Drove the dear shades, that hid our joys, away.

<head>Elegy  XIV:  He comforts his mistress for the loss of her hair by the means she took to beautify it.  By an unknown hand.</head>
<l>I us'd to warn you, not with so much care,</l>
<l>And waste of ointment, to adorn your hair:</l>
<l>That warning now is useless, you have none,</l>
<l>And with your hair that trouble too is gone.</l>
<l>Where are the silken tresses, which adown</l>
<l>Your shoulders hung? A web was never spun</l>
<l>So fine, but, ah! those flowing curls are gone.</l>
<l>Ah fatal art! ah fatal care, and pains!</l>
<l>That robb'd me of the dearest of my chains.</l>
<l>Nor of a black, nor of a golden hue</l>
<l>They were, but of a dye between the two.</l>
<l>How could you hurt, or poison with perfume,</l>
<l>Those curls that were so easy to the comb?</l>
<l>That to no pains expos'd you, when you set</l>
<l>Their shining tresses for young hearts a net?</l>
<l>That ne'er provok'd you with your maids to war,</l>
<l>For hurting you with your entangled hair?</l>
<l>You ne'er were urg'd to some indecent fray,</l>
<l>Nor in a fury snatch'd the comb away.</l>
<l>The teeth ne'er touch'd you, and her constant care,</l>
<l>Without ill arts, would have preserv'd your hair.</l>
<l>Behind your chair I oft have seen her stand,</l>
<l>And comb and curl it with a gentle hand:</l>
<l>Oft have I seen it on your  shoulders play</l>
<l>Uncomb'd, as on your purple bed you lay.</l>
<l>Your artless tresses with more charms appear,</l>
<l>Than when adorn'd with all your cost and care.</l>
<l>When on the grass the Thracian nymphs recline,</l>
<l>Of <placeName key="tgn,2097807">Bacchus</placeName> full, and weary of their wine,</l>
<l>Less lovely are their locks, than yours, less fair</l>
<l>The ringlets of their soft dishevell'd hair:</l>
<l>Softer was thine, like fleecy down it felt,</l>
<l>And to the finger did as freely yield,</l>
<l>How didst thou torture it, the curls to turn,</l>
<l>Now with hot irons at thy toilet burn?</l>
<l>This rack, with what obedience did it bear?</l>
<l>"Ah spare," I cried, "thy patient tresses spare!</l>
<l>To hurt them  is a sin: this needless toil</l>
<l>Forbear, and do not, what adorns thee, spoil.</l>
<l>'Tis now too late to give your labour o'er,</l>
<l>Those tortur'd ringlets are, alas ! no more.</l>
<l>Ah, cease the cruel thought, and cease to pass</l>
<l>Such irksome minutes at your faithful glass !</l>
<l>In vain thou seek'st thy silken locks to find;</l>
<l>Banish the dear remembrance from thy mind.</l>
<l>No weeds destroy'd them with their pois'nous juice,</l>
<l>Nor canst thou witches' magic charms accuse,</l>
<l>Nor rival's rage, nor dire enchantment blame,</l>
<l>Nor envy's blasting tongue, nor fever's flame.</l>
<l>The mischief by thy own fair hands was wrought;</l>
<l>Nor dost thou suffer for another's fault.</l>
<l>How oft I bade thee, but in vain, beware</l>
<l>The venom'd essence, that destroy'd thy hair?</l>
<l>Now with new arts thou shalt thy pride amuse,</l>
<l>And curls, of German captives borrow'd, use.</l>
<l>Drusus to <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> their vanquish'd nation sends</l>
<l>And the fair slave to thee her tresses lends.</l>
<l>With alien locks thou wilt thy head adorn,</l>
<l>And conquests gain'd by foreign beauties scorn.</l>
<l>How wilt thou blush, with other charms to please,</l>
<l>And cry, "How fairer were my locks than these !"</l>
<l>By heav'ns, to heart she takes her head's disgrace,</l>
<l>She weeps, and covers with her hands her face.</l>
<l>She weeps, as in her lap her locks she views;</l>
<l>What woman would not weep, such locks to lose!</l>
<l>Ah, that they still did on her shoulders flow,</l>
<l>Ah, that they now, where once they grew, did grow!</l>
<l>Take courage, fair <placeName key="tgn,2044648">Corinna</placeName>, never fear,</l>
<l>Thou shalt not long these borrow'd tresses wear:</l>
<l>Time for your beauty shall this loss repair</l>
<l>And you again shall charm with native hair.

<head>Elegy III:  To a Eunuch, who had the keeping of his mistress</head>
<l>How hard's my hap, to have my fair consign'd</l>
<l>To one, who is imperfect in his kind;</l>
<l>To one, who ne'er can have the pow'r to prove</l>
<l>As woman, or as man, the mutual joys of love!</l>
<l>Who practis'd first on boys the cutting steel,</l>
<l>Deserv'd himself the fatal wound to feel.</l>
<l>Couldst thou be capable of Cupid's fires,</l>
<l>Or the least sensible of love's desires,</l>
<l>Some pity thou wouldst have on me, and grant</l>
<l>Thy aid, for what thou canst not know I want.</l>
<l>Ill suits thee now, the warrior's lance to wield,</l>
<l>To mount the manag'd horse, or lift the brazen shield:</l>
<l>Arms are for men, and not for such as thee,</l>
<l>Who shouldst from ev'ry manly thought be free.</l>
<l>No banner shouldst thou, but thy lady's bear,</l>
<l>And have no other leader but the fair.</l>
<l>Much it behoves thee then to strive to gain</l>
<l>Her favour, and thou need'st not strive in vain.</l>
<l>Consult her pleasure, and her will obey,</l>
<l>To favour that's the sure, the ready way:</l>
<l>Without it, how unhappy wilt thou be!</l>
<l>Life is without it of no use to thee.</l>
<l>Thou'rt beautiful, and mayst thy prime enjoy,</l>
<l>And well thy beauty and thy youth employ.</l>
<l>Study to serve thy gentle mistress well,</l>
<l>And merit her good graces by thy zeal;</l>
<l>Watch as thou wilt, the trouble thou mayst spare,</l>
<l>She'll easily deceive thy utmost care.</l>
<l>When two fond lovers are agreed to meet,</l>
<l>Canst thou their well-concerted plot defeat?</l>
<l>The ways of kindness thou shouldst rather use;</l>
<l>By being civil thou wilt nothing lose;</l>
<l>And when an opportunity is fail,</l>

<head>Elegy  IV:  That he loves all sorts of women.</head>
<l>Vice by my verse I never will defend,</l>
<l>Nor by false arms to fence my own pretend.</l>
<l>Frankly my failings I with shame confess;</l>
<l>To hide my errors would not make them less.</l>
<l>My faults, whate'er I suffer by't, I own,</l>
<l>That others, if they please, those faults may shun</l>
<l>I hate myself, my follies, and would fain</l>
<l>Be, were it in my pow'r, another man.</l>
<l>How difficult it is, ye righteous Gods,</l>
<l>Against our wills to bear such heavy loads.</l>
<l>I have not strength to guard myself from ill,</l>
<l>And, as I wish, to rule my wicked will.</l>
<l>I'm hurry'd on, as by the boistrous sea</l>
<l>The driving bark is swiftly borne away.</l>
<l>No certain form inflames my am'rous breast,</l>
<l>All beauty is alike to me the best;</l>
<l>A hundred causes kindle my desires,</l>
<l>And love ne'er wants a torch to light my fires.</l>
<l>When on the earth the modest virgin looks,</l>
<l>That very modesty of hers provokes;</l>
<l>And if I chance to meet a forward fair,</l>
<l>I'm taken with her frank and easy air:</l>
<l>I figure to myself a thousand charms,</l>
<l>A thousand raptures in her wanton arms.</l>
<l>If, like the damsels of the <placeName key="tgn,7021127">Sabine</placeName> race,</l>
<l>She's rude, I look upon it as grimace;</l>
<l>That sullen as she seems at first, 'tis art,</l>
<l>That I the more may prize the conquest or her heart.</l>
<l>New joys, if she's a wit, I hope to find;</l>
<l>And with her body, to possess her mind:</l>
<l>If foolish, I in that can see no harm,</l>
<l>And in her very folly find a charm.</l>
<l>I know a maid so very fond, and dull,</l>
<l>To me she thinks Callimachus a fool.</l>
<l>I soon am pleas'd with one that's pleas'd with me,</l>
<l>Alike we in our taste and wish agree:</l>
<l>But if the fair my verses don't approve,</l>
<l>I bragging tell her, she will like my love;</l>
<l>If with her tongue, or with her heel she's brisk,</l>
<l>Her prattle pleases, and her gamesome frisk;</l>
<l>But if she's heavy, I suppose at night</l>
<l>She'll change, and prove, as I would have her, light,</l>
<l>The fair that sings, enchants me with her voice;</l>
<l>Oh, what a gust it gives a lover's joys!</l>
<l>When her shrill shakes afresh his bosom wound,</l>
<l>And from her lips he kisses off the sound;</l>
<l>When her soft fingers touch the silver strings,</l>
<l>And sweetly to the sounding lute she sings;</l>
<l>Who can resist such strong redoubled charms?</l>
<l>Her music melts me, as her beauty warms</l>
<l>If in the dance the nimble nymph I find,</l>
<l>And view how she her pliant limbs does wind,</l>
<l>How artfully she to the music moves,</l>
<l>I cry, "How happy is the man she loves!"</l>
<l>My humour, in a word, is plainly this,</l>
<l>All objects please, and nothing comes amiss.</l>
<l>To love, and be belov'd my sole employ:</l>
<l>Dispos'd to be enjoy'd, and to enjoy.</l>
<l>This lady for her length I like, her spread</l>
<l>Will swell my arms, and fill the joyous bed;</l>
<l>She's like the lusty heroines of old,</l>
<l>And with a strong embrace her lover will enfold.</l>
<l>This lass, because she's little, I approve;</l>
<l>The least are lightest in the sports of love.</l>
<l>With every size my passion does agree,</l>
<l>And tall and short are both alike to me.</l>
<l>I fancy, when undress'd I find the fair,</l>
<l>'Tis less her want of charms, than want of care.</l>
<l>If with her dishabille, I cry, " I'm pleas'd,"</l>
<l>How beauteous would she be if she were dress'd</l>
<l>And when she does her best apparel wear,</l>
<l>I think her riches in her pride appear.</l>
<l>The fair, the olive, are to me the same,</l>
<l>Alike the swarthy, and the sandy dame.</l>
<l>When her black curls adown her shoulders flow,</l>
<l>Such Leda's were, her skin as white as snow;</l>
<l>And when her golden locks her head adorn,</l>
<l>I straight compare her to the saffron morn.</l>
<l>My love with no complexion disagrees,</l>
<l>But all alike my ready passion please.</l>
<l>The younger by their bloom my heart secure,</l>
<l>The elder win it as they're more mature;</l>
<l>And though the younger may excel in charms,</l>
<l>The elder clasp you with experienc'd arms</l>
<l>What all the city like, is liked by me,</l>
<l>And I with them and all my loves agree.</l>
<l>I'm proud to be the rival of the town,</l>
<l>And to their taste will still conform my own.

<head>Elegy V:  To His False Mistress.  By Eusden.</head>
<l>Cupid, be gone! I can for beauty sigh,</l>
<l>But not be forc'd to wish each hour to die;</l>
<l>For so I wish whene'er my restless thoughts</l>
<l>Dwell on her falsehoods and repeated faults.</l>
<l>All other plagues know sometimes to be civil,</l>
<l>But woman is a sure, perpetual evil.</l>
<l>No pimp I bribe to prove thy perjur'd vows,</l>
<l>Nor intercepted once thy billet-doux.</l>
<l>0, cou dst thou but my arguments disprove!</l>
<l>A cause so good is here unwish'd in love.</l>
<l>Happy, who dares t' avow his censur'd flame,</l>
<l>And vindicate the secret tripping dame.</l>
<l>Blushless, tho' guilty, with uplifted eyes,</l>
<l>"'Tis false, my life, by yon bright Heaven," she cries.</l>
<l>Himself he fools, and madly feeds his grief,</l>
<l>Who from conviction seeks the sad relief.</l>
<l>Wretched I saw thy wantonness unsought,</l>
<l>By thee in sleep secure and eyeless thought;</l>
<l>With glances on each other how you hung!</l>
<l>How ev'ry nod had more than half a tongue!</l>
<l>How roll'd thy glowing eyes! how lewd they spoke!</l>
<l>E'en from thy artful fingers language broke;</l>
<l>While writing on the board with pens they vied,</l>
<l>And the spilt wine the want of ink supplied.</l>
<l>The silent speech too well I understood,</l>
<l>For to deceive a lover yet who could?</l>
<l>Tho' thou didst write in a laconic hand,</l>
<l>And words for sentences were taught to stand.</l>
<l>Now ended was the treat, and ev'ry guest</l>
<l>Indulg'd his ease, and lay compos'd to rest:</l>
<l>Your close, lascivious kisses then I spied,</l>
<l>And something more than lips to lips applied;</l>
<l>Such from a sister brothers ne'er receive,</l>
<l>But yielding fair ones to warm lovers give.</l>
<l>Not so <placeName key="tgn,2118015">Diana</placeName> would to Phoebus press,</l>
<l>But Cytherea so her <placeName key="tgn,2090583">Mars</placeName> would bless.</l>
<l>Too far provok'd, at last I cried aloud,</l>
<l>"On whom are pleasures, due to me, bestow'd?</l>
<l>I must not, will not, cannot bear this sight;</l>
<l>'Tis lawful, sure, to seize upon my right.</l>
<l>These raptures to us both in common are,</l>
<l>But whence, ye furies, claims a third his share?"</l>
<l>Enrag'd I spoke, and o'er her cheeks were spread</l>
<l>Swift newborn glories in a sudden red;</l>
<l>Such blushes on the bridal night adorn</l>
<l>The trembling virgin; such the rising morn.</l>
<l>So sweet a hue the lab'ring <placeName key="tgn,2056258">Cynthia</placeName> shows,</l>
<l>Or the fair lily damask'd by the rose;</l>
<l>Or iv'ry, which time's yellow taint defies,</l>
<l>When twice enrich'd with proud Assyrian dies:</l>
<l>Such were her looks, and a diviner grace</l>
<l>Had never brighten'd that enchanting face.</l>
<l>She cast her eyes down on the humble ground;</l>
<l>Her eyes, so cast, an unknown sweetness found.</l>
<l>Mournful her looks; her mournful looks became</l>
<l>Shining thro' grief, and beautiful in shame.</l>
<l>I rush'd, resolv'd her golden locks to tear,</l>
<l>And with mad violence disrobe the fair;</l>
<l>But as I viewed her face, th' extended hand</l>
<l>Shrunk back, nor hearken'd to the harsh command.</l>
<l>Others protection seek by dint of arms,</l>
<l>Her only safeguard was -- her wondrous charms.</l>
<l>I, who but late look'd insolently brave,</l>
<l>Fell from my height, and couch'd a suppliant slave:</l>
<l>I rav'd no longer at another's bliss,</l>
<l>But begg'd the transport of as sweet a kiss.</l>
<l>Smiling she said, " How grateful thy request!</l>
<l>If e'er my kisses please thee, take the best."</l>
<l>Oh, with what gust as from her soul they came!</l>
<l>Such might melt Jove, and stop the vengeful flame;</l>
<l>I fear'd my rival too enjoy'd the same.</l>
<l>These, better than from me she learn'd I thought,</l>
<l>Something taught new, alas! I wish'd untaught;</l>
<l>What most gave pleasure, that now stings the most;</l>
<l>Why were our darting tongues entirely lost?</l>
<l>Nor fret I thou in kissing shouldst excel,</l>
<l>And yet 'tis strange to know to kiss so well;</l>
<l>But ah! such lectures only could be read</l>
<l>By youthful tutors, and imbib'd abed.</l>
<l>That sage who'er these large improvements made,</l>
<l>Was by his pupil preciously repay'd.

<head>Elegy VI:  On the Death of His Mistress's Parrot.  By <placeName key="tgn,2266465">Creech</placeName>.</head>
<l>Alas! poor Poll, my Indian talker, dies!</l>
<l>Go, birds, and celebrate his obsequies;</l>
<l>Go, birds, and beat your breasts, your faces tear,</l>
<l>And pluck your gaudy plumes instead of hair;</l>
<l>Let doleful tunes the frighted forest wound,</l>
<l>And your sad notes supply the trumpet's sound.</l>
<l>Why, Philomel, dost mourn the Thracian rage?</l>
<l>It is enough, thy grief at last assuage;</l>
<l>His crimson faults are now grown white with age.</l>
<l>Now mourn this bird; the cause of all thy woe</l>
<l>Was great, 'tis true, but it was long ago.</l>
<l>Mourn, all ye wing'd inhabitants of air,</l>
<l>But you, my turtle, take the greatest share;</l>
<l>You too liv'd constant friends and free from strife</l>
<l>Your kindness was entire, and long as life:</l>
<l>What Pylades to his Orestes vow'd.</l>
<l>To thee, poor Poll, thy friendly turtle show'd,</l>
<l>And kept his love as long as fate allow'd.</l>
<l>But, ah! what did thy faith, thy plumes, and tail,</l>
<l>And what thy pretty speaking art, avail?</l>
<l>And what that thou wert giv'n, and pleas'd my miss,</l>
<l>Since now the bird's unhappy glory dies ?</l>
<l>A lovely verdant green grac'd ev'ry quill,</l>
<l>The deepest vivid red did paint thy bill;</l>
<l>In speaking thou didst ev'ry bird excel,</l>
<l>None prattled, and none lisp'd the words so well.</l>
<l>'Twas envy only sent this fierce disease;</l>
<l>Thou wert averse to war, and liv'dst in peace,</l>
<l>A talking harmless thing, and lov'dst thine ease.</l>
<l>The fighting quails still live 'midst all their strife,</l>
<l>And even that, perhaps, prolongs their life.</l>
<l>Thy meat was little, and thy prattling tongue</l>
<l>Would ne'er permit to make thy dinner long:</l>
<l>Plain fountain water all thy drink allow'd,</l>
<l>And nut and poppy-seed were all thy food.</l>
<l>The preying vultures and the kites remain,</l>
<l>And the unlucky crow still caws for rain;</l>
<l>The chough still lives 'midst fierce <placeName key="tgn,2070580">Minerva</placeName>'s hate,</l>
<l>And scarce nine hundred years conclude her fate;</l>
<l>But my poor Poll now hangs his sickly head,</l>
<l>My Poll, my present from the east, is dead.</l>
<l>Best things are sooner snatch'd by cov'tous fate,</l>
<l>To worse she freely gives a longer date;</l>
<l>Thersites brave Achilles' fate surviv'd,</l>
<l>And <placeName key="tgn,2069653">Hector</placeName> fell, whilst all his brothers liv'd.</l>
<l>Why should I tell what vows <placeName key="tgn,2044648">Corinna</placeName> made?</l>
<l>How oft she begg'd thy life, how oft she pray'd ?</l>
<l>The seventh day came, and now the Fates begin</l>
<l>To end the thread, they had no more to spin;</l>
<l>Yet still he talk'd, and when death nearer drew,</l>
<l>His last breath said, "<placeName key="tgn,2044648">Corinna</placeName>, now adieu!"</l>
<l>There is a shady cypress grove below,</l>
<l>And thither (if such doubtful things we know)</l>
<l>The ghosts of pious birds departed go;</l>
<l>'Tis water'd well, and verdant all the year,</l>
<l>And birds obscene do never enter there;</l>
<l>There harmless swans securely take their rest,</l>
<l>And there the single Phoenix builds her nest;</l>
<l>Proud peacocks there display their gaudy train,</l>
<l>And billing turtles coo o'er all the plain:</l>
<l>To these dark shades my parrot's soul shall go,</l>
<l>And with his talk divert the birds below;</l>
<l>Whilst here his bones enjoy a noble grave,</l>
<l>A little marble, and an epitaph:-</l>

<l>And my tomb proves my mistress lov'd me well."

<l>What tho' at last my cause I clearly gain?</l>

<l>If at the play I in fop-corner sit,</l>

<l>If any looks on me, you think you spy</l>

<l>A silent soft discourse in ev'ry grace,</l>

<l>Thy nat'ral beauty all her hearts improve,</l>
<l>And make me more enamour'd of my love.</l>

<head>Elegy VIII:  To Corinna's Chambermaid.  By the same hand.</head>
<l>Dear, skilful <placeName key="tgn,2165330">Betty</placeName>, who dost far excel</l>
<l>My lady's other maids in dressing well;</l>
<l>Dear Betty, fit to be preferred above</l>
<l>To <placeName key="tgn,2075297">Juno</placeName>'s chamber, or the queen of love;</l>
<l>Genteel, well-bred, not rustically coy,</l>
<l>Not easy to deny desired joy;</l>
<l>Thro' whose soft eyes still secret wishes shine,</l>
<l>Fit for thy mistress' use, but more for mine;</l>
<l>Who, <placeName key="tgn,2165330">Betty</placeName>, did the fatal secret see?</l>
<l>Who told <placeName key="tgn,2044648">Corinna</placeName> you were kind to me!</l>
<l>Yet when she chid me for my kind embrace,</l>
<l>Did any guilty blush spread o'er my face!</l>
<l>Did I betray thee, maid, or could she spy</l>
<l>The least confession in my conscious eye !</l>
<l>Not that I think it a disgrace to prove</l>
<l>Stol'n sweets, or make a chambermaid my love;</l>
<l>Achilles wanton'd in Briseis' arms,</l>
<l>Atrides bow'd to fair <placeName key="tgn,2087009">Cassandra</placeName>'s charms:</l>
<l>Sure I am less than these,-then what can bring</l>
<l>Disgrace to me, that so became a king !</l>
<l>But when she look'd on you, poor harmless maid,</l>
<l>You blush'd, and all the kind intrigue betray'd;</l>
<l>Yet still I vow'd, I made a stout defence,</l>
<l>I swore, and look'd as bold as innocence;</l>
<l>"Damme, -- egad!" all that, and -- "let me die!"'</l>
<l>Kind <placeName key="tgn,2094077">Venus</placeName>, do not hear my perjury;</l>
<l>Kind <placeName key="tgn,2094077">Venus</placeName>, stop thy ears when lovers lie.</l>
<l>Now, <placeName key="tgn,2165330">Betty</placeName>, how will you my oaths requite?</l>
<l>Come, pr'ythee let's compound for more delight;</l>
<l>Faith, I am easy, and but ask a night.</l>
<l>What! start at the proposal? how! deny</l>
<l>Pretend fond fears of a discovery ?</l>
<l>Refuse, lest some sad chance the thing betray ?</l>
<l>Is this your kind, your damn'd obliging way ?</l>
<l>Well, deny on; I'll lie, I'll swear no more;</l>
<l><placeName key="tgn,2044648">Corinna</placeName> now shall know thou art a whore.</l>

<head>Elegy IX:  To Love.  By the Earl of <placeName key="tgn,7014348">Rochester</placeName>.</head>
<l>O Love! how cold and slow to take my part,</l>
<l>Thou idle wanderer about my heart!</l>
<l>Why thy old faithful soldier wilt thou see</l>
<l>Oppress'd in thy own tents? they murder me;</l>
<l>Thy flames consume, thy arrows pierce thy friends;</l>
<l>Rather on foes pursue more noble ends.</l>
<l>Achilles' sword would certainly bestow</l>
<l>A cure as certain as it gave the blow.</l>
<l>Hunters, who follow flying game, give o'er</l>
<l>When the prey's caught, hope still leads on before;</l>
<l>We, thine own slaves, feel thy tyrannic blows.</l>
<l>While thy tame hand's unmov'd against thy foes.</l>
<l>On men disarm'd, how can you gallant prove ?</l>
<l>And I was long ago disarm'd by love.</l>
<l>Millions of dull men live, and scornful maids;</l>
<l>We'll own love valiant when he these invades.</l>
<l><placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> from each corner of the wide world snatch'd</l>
<l>A laurel, or't had been to this day thatch'd;</l>
<l>But the old soldier has his resting-place,</l>
<l>And the good batter'd horse is turn'd to grass:</l>
<l>The harass'd whore, who liv'd a wretch to please,</l>
<l>Has leave to be a bawd, and take her ease.</l>
<l>For me then, who have truly spent my blood,</l>
<l>Love, in thy service, and so boldly stood</l>
<l>In <placeName key="tgn,2087042">Celia</placeName>'s trenches, were't not wisely done,</l>
<l>E'en to retire, and live at peace at home ?</l>
<l>No-might I gain a godhead to disclaim</l>
<l>My glorious title to my endless flame,</l>
<l>Divinity with scorn I would forswear,</l>
<l>Such sweet, dear, tempting devils women are.</l>
<l>Whene'er those flames grow faint, I quickly find</l>
<l>A fierce black storm pour down upon my mind;</l>
<l>Headlong I'm hurl'd like horsemen who in vain</l>
<l>Their fury-flaming coursers would restrain.</l>
<l>As ships, just when the harbour they attain,</l>
<l>Are snatch'd by sudden blasts to sea again,</l>
<l>So Love's fantastic storms reduce my heart,</l>
<l>Half rescu'd, and the god resumes his dart.</l>
<l>Strike here, this undefended bosom wound,</l>
<l>And for so brave a conquest be renown'd.</l>
<l>Shafts fly so fast to me from ev'ry part,</l>
<l>You'll scarce discern the quiver from my heart.</l>
<l>What wretch can bear a livelong night's dull rest,</l>
<l>Or think himself in lazy slumbers blest?</l>
<l>Fool-is not sleep the image of pale death?</l>
<l>There's time for rest when fate has stopp'd your breath.</l>
<l>Me may my soft deluding dear deceive,</l>
<l>I'm happy in my hopes, while I believe:</l>
<l>Now let her flatter, then as fondly chide,</l>
<l>Often may I enjoy, oft be denied.</l>
<l>With doubtful steps the god of war does move,</l>
<l>By thy example, in ambiguous love.</l>
<l>Blown to and fro, like down from thy own wing,</l>
<l>Who knows when joy or anguish thou wilt bring?</l>
<l>Yet at thy mother's and thy slave's request,</l>
<l>Fix an eternal empire in my breast;</l>
<l>And let th' inconstant charming sex,</l>
<l>Whose wilful scorn does lovers vex,</l>
<l>Submit their hearts before thy throne;</l>
<l>The vassal world is then thy own.

<head>Elegy X:  <placeName key="tgn,2071526">Ovid</placeName> tells Graecinus, that he is fallen in love with a couple of ladies.  By an unknown hand.</head>
<l>What you affirm'd, my friend, is prov'd untrue,</l>
<l>That none at once could madly dote on two.</l>
<l>Deceiv'd, unarm'd, we Cupid soon o'ercame,</l>
<l>And I glow shameless with a double flame.</l>
<l>They both are fair, both dress'd so nicely well,</l>
<l>That the pre-eminence is hard to tell.</l>
<l>Sometimes for this, sometimes for that I burn,</l>
<l>And each more beauteous sparkles in her turn.</l>
<l>Each claims my passion, and my heart divides</l>
<l>As to and fro the doubtful galliot rides.</l>
<l>Here driven by winds, and there redriven by tides.</l>
<l>Why doubly chain'd ? was not a single fair</l>
<l>Enough to load me with perpetual care?</l>
<l>Why are more leaves brought to the shady wood,</l>
<l>Stars to the sky, or waters to the flood ?</l>

<l>Still on my foes may such dull blessings fall.</l>
<l>May they, insipidly supine, be spread</l>
<l>Along the middle of a widowed bed;</l>
<l>While I with sprightliness love's vigil's keep,</l>
<l>Stretch'd out for something far more sweet than sleep.</l>
<l>Others from ruin fly, to mine I run,</l>
<l>To be by women pleasingly undone,</l>
<l>Longing for two, since undestroy'd by one.</l>
<l>Still let my slender limbs for love suffice;</l>
<l>I want no nerves, but want the bulky size.</l>
<l>My limbs, tho' lean are not in vain display'd;</l>
<l>From me no female ever rose a maid.</l>
<l>Oft have I, when a luscious night was spent,</l>
<l>Saluted morn, nor cloy'd nor impotent.</l>
<l>Happy, who gasps in love his latest breath;</l>
<l>Give me, ye gods, so softly sweet a death !</l>
<l>Let the rough warriors grapple on the plain,</l>
<l>And with their blood immortal honour gain;</l>
<l>Let the vile miser plough for wealth the deep,</l>
<l>And, shipwrek'd in the unfatbom'd waters, sleep</l>
<l>May <placeName key="tgn,2094077">Venus</placeName> grant me but my last desire,</l>
<l>In the full height of rapture to expire.</l>
<l>Perhaps some friend, with kindly dew supplied,</l>

<l>Io Triumphe! I have won the prize,</l>
<l>For in my arms the fair <placeName key="tgn,2044648">Corinna</placeName> lies.</l>
<l>Nor jealous husband, nor a guardian's care,</l>
<l>Nor door defended with a double bar,</l>
<l>Could fence against a lover's artifice,</l>
<l>For in my arms the fair <placeName key="tgn,2044648">Corinna</placeName> lies.</l>
<l>With reason of my victory I boast,</l>
<l>The conquest gain'd, and yet no blood is lost;</l>
<l>I scal'd no walls, I pass'd no ditch profound,</l>
<l>Safe were my wars, and all without a wound.</l>
<l>My only work a charming girl to gain;</l>
<l>The pleasure well rewards the little pain.</l>
<l>Ten years the Greeks did in one siege employ,</l>

<l>What glory was there by th' Atrides won,</l>
<l>So many chiefs before a single town!</l>
<l>Not thus did I my pleasant toils pursue,</l>
<l>And the whole glory to myself is due;</l>
<l>Myself was horse and foot, myself alone</l>
<l>The captain and the soldier was in one,</l>
<l>And fought beneath no banner but my own.</l>
<l>Whether by strength I combated, or wile,</l>
<l>Fortune did ever on my actions smile;</l>
<l>I only owe my triumph to my care,</l>
<l>And by my patience only won the fair.</l>

<l>For Helen, ravish'd by the Dardan boy,</l>

<l>The Centaurs double form'd, half man, half beast,</l>
<l>Defil'd with horrid war the nuptial feast;</l>
<l>Inflam'd by wine and woman's magic charms,</l>
<l>They turn'd the jolly face of joy to arms.</l>
<l>'Twas woman urg'd the strife; a second fair</l>

<l>She gives them courage, her they both regard,</l>
<l>As one that caus'd the war, and must reward.</l>
<l>Compell'd by Cupid in his host to list</l>
<l>(And who that has a heart can love resist ?)</l>
<l>His soldier I have been, without the guilt</l>
<l>Of blood, in any of our battles spilt;</l>

<l>I seem to walk oe'r the fields of naked sand,</l>
<l>Or tread an antic maze in fairy land,</l>
<l>Where frightful specires, and pale shades appear,</l>
<l>And hollow groans invade my troubled ear;</l>
<l>Where ev'ry breeze that through my arbour flies,</l>
<l>First sadly murmurs, and then turns to sighs.</l>
<l>The vines love elms; what elms from vines remove?</l>
<l>Then why should I be parted from my love?</l>
<l>And yet by me you once devoutly swore,</l>
<l>By your own eyes, those stars that I adore,</l>
<l>That all my bus'ness you would make your own,</l>
<l>And never suffer me to be alone:</l>
<l>But faithless woman nat'rally deceives,</l>
<l>Their frequent oaths are like the falling  leaves,</l>
<l>Which when a storm has from the branches tore</l>
<l>Are lost by ev'ry blast, and seen no more:</l>
<l>Yet if you will be true, your vows retrieve,</l>
<l>Be kind, and I can easily forgive ;</l>
<l>Prepare your coach, to me direct your course,</l>
<l>Drive fiercely on, and lash the lazy horse;</l>
<l>And while you ride I will prolong the day,</l>
<l>And try the power of verse to smooth your way.</l>
<l>Sink down ye mountains, sink ye lofty hills,</l>
<l>Ye vallies be obedient to her wheels,</l>
<l>Ye streams be dry, ye hindr'ing woods remove,</l>
<l>'Tis love that drives, and all must yield to love !

<head>Elegy XVII:  He tells <placeName key="tgn,2044648">Corinna</placeName> he will always be her slave</head>
<l>If there's a wretch, who thinks it is a shame,</l>
<l>To serve a lovely and a loving dame:</l>
<l>If such a slave he loads with infamy,</l>
<l>I'm willing he should judge as hard of me;</l>
<l>I'm willing all the world should know my shame</l>
<l>If <placeName key="tgn,2081683">Venus</placeName> will abate my raging flame.</l>
<l>Let me a fair and gentle mistress have,</l>
<l>And then proclaim aloud that I'm her slave.</l>
<l>Beauty is apt to swell a maiden's mind,</l>
<l>And thus <placeName key="tgn,2044648">Corinna</placeName> is to pride inclin'd:</l>
<l>But as she is above all maiden's fair,</l>
<l>What's pride in them is insolence in her;</l>
<l>Less fair I wish she was, or knew it less;</l>
<l>How learnt she, she is lovely by her face!</l>
<l>Her mirror tells her so, she often tries</l>
<l>Her mirror, and believes her charming eyes.</l>
<l>The looks she then puts on, are still her best,</l>
<l>And she ne'er uses it but when she's dress'd.</l>
<l>Though wide the empire of your beauties spread,</l>
<l>Beauty to draw my am'rous glances made:</l>
<l>Compare your servant's merit with your eyes,</l>
<l>You'll find no cause his service to dispise.</l>
<l>Don't think I press upon your pride too hard.</l>
<l>For little things may be with great compar'd:</l>
<l>We're told Calypso, an immortal pow'r,</l>
<l>Detain'd a mortal in th' Ogygian pow'r,</l>
<l>And when her pray'r to stay he would not grant,</l>
<l>So strong her love, she kept him by constraint.</l>
<l>A Nereid took the Pythian to her arms.</l>
<l>And <placeName key="tgn,2033144">Numa</placeName> knew divine <placeName key="tgn,2118102">Egeria</placeName>'s charms.</l>
<l><placeName key="tgn,2094117">Vulcan</placeName> though lame, and of a form obscene,</l>
<l>Was oft made happy by the Paphian queen;</l>
<l>She matter'd not his limping, but approv'd</l>
<l>His flame, and saw no faults in him she lov'd</l>
<l>My verses are unequal like his feet,</l>
<l>Yet the long kindly with the shorter meet.</l>
<l>As they with them, why shouldst thou not with me</l>
<l>Comply, my life and my divinity !</l>
<l>Myself, when I am in thy arms, I'll own</l>
<l>Thy subject, and the bed shall be thy throne;</l>
<l>Thou there, my lovely queen, shall give me laws,</l>
<l>Nor in my absence, to rejoice have cause,</l>
<l>Nor ever shall my services be blam'd</l>
<l>Nor shalt thou of thy servant be asham'd.</l>
<l>My poetry's my purse, my fortun's there,</l>
<l>I have no other way to win the fair;</l>
<l>Nor is that way the worst; the brightest dames</l>
<l>Would in my verse immortalize their names.</l>
<l>My muse the place of an estate supplies,</l>
<l>And none that know her worth, her wealth despise.</l>
<l>Some tempted by <placeName key="tgn,2044648">Corinna</placeName>'s spreading fame,</l>
<l>In envy rob her, and usurp her name;</l>
<l>What would they give, d'ye think, to be the same ?</l>
<l>But neither could Eurotas, nor the Po,</l>
<l>With poplar shaded, in one channel flew;</l>
<l>By diff'rent, and by distant banks they glide,</l>
<l>Are rivers both, but various in their tide.</l>
<l>There are more beauties, but there's none like thine,</l>
<l>There are more versed, but thou hast only mine;</l>
<l>No other charms can e'er inspire my muse,</l>
<l>And other themes I with disdain refuse.

<head>Elegy XVIII:  To Macer, blaming him for not writing of love as he did.</head>
<l>While, Macer, you Achilles' choler sing,</l>
<l>And <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> before the walls of <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilium</placeName> bring;</l>
<l>While feats of arms in Phrygian fields you tell,</l>
<l>And how old Tory by Grecion vengeance fell;</l>
<l>I my soft hours in softer songs employ,</l>
<l>And all my leisure give to love and joy.</l>
<l>When to high acts, my voice I strive to raise,</l>
<l>Love laughs at my attempt, and mocks my lays;</l>
<l>"Begone!" I often to my mistress cry,</l>
<l>But have not courage, yet, myself to fly.</l>
<l>Whene'er she sees me in this sullen fit,</l>
<l>She fondles me, and, on my knee will sit:</l>
<l>"Enough of this (say I), for shame give o'er,</l>
<l>Enough of love, we'll play the fool no more."</l>
<l>" Ah, is it then a shame to love?" she cries,</l>
<l>And chides, and melts me with her weeping eyes.</l>
<l>Around my neck her snowy arms she throws,</l>
<l>And to my lips with stifling kisses grows.</l>
<l>How can I all this tenderness refuse ?</l>
<l>At once my wisdom, and my will I lose;</l>
<l>I'm conquer'd, and renounce the glorious train</l>
<l>Of arms, and war, to sing of love again:</l>
<l>My themes are acts, which I myself have done,</l>
<l>And my muse sings no battles but my own.</l>
<l>Once I confess I did the drama try,</l>
<l>And ventur'd with success on tragedy;</l>
<l>My genius with a moving scene agrees,</l>
<l>And if I ventured further I might please:</l>
<l>But love my heroics makes a jest,</l>
<l>And laughs to see me in my buskins drest.</l>
<l>Asham'd, and weary of this tragic whim,</l>
<l>For tender thoughts I quitted the sublime.</l>
<l>My mind my mistress bends another way,</l>
<l>Her must my muse in all her songs obey;</l>
<l>Though oft I do not what I write approve,</l>
<l>Like, or not like it, I must sing of love.</l>
<l>Whether for <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>'s illustrious dame,</l>
<l>To great Ulysses I a letter frame,</l>
<l>Or for Oenone tender things indite,</l>
<l>Or soft complaints for injur'd Phillis write;</l>
<l>Whether fair Canace's incestuous care</l>
<l>I sooth, or flatter Dido's fierce despair;</l>
<l>Whether I fan Medea's raging fire,</l>
<l>Or for sweet Sappho touch the Lesbian lyre;</l>
<l>Whether I Phaedra's lawless love relate,</l>
<l>Or Theseus' flight and Ariadne's fate:</l>
<l>Oh, that Sabinus, my departed friend,</l>
<l>Could from all quarters now his answers send!</l>
<l>Ulysses' hand should to his queen be known,</l>
<l>And wretched Phaedra hear from Theseus' son;</l>
<l>Dido Aeneas' answer should receive,</l>
<l>And Phillis Demophoon's, if alive;</l>
<l>Jason should to Hypsipyle return</l>
<l>A sad reply, and Sappho cease to mourn:</l>
<l>Nor him whom she can ne'er possess, desire,</l>
<l>But give to Phoebus fane her votive lyre.</l>
<l>As much as you in lofty epics deal,</l>
<l>You, Macer, show that you love's passion feel,</l>
<l>And sensible of beauty's powerful charm,</l>
<l>You hear their call amid the noise of arms.</l>
<l>A place for <placeName key="tgn,7008038">Paris</placeName> in your verse we find,</l>
<l>And Helen's to the young adult'rer kind;</l>
<l>There lovely Laodamia mourns her lord,</l>
<l>The first that fell by <placeName key="tgn,2069653">Hector</placeName>'s fatal sword.</l>
<l>If well I know you, and your mind can tell,</l>
<l>The theme's as grateful, and you like as well</l>
<l>To tune your lyre for Cupid as for <placeName key="tgn,2090583">Mars</placeName>,</l>

<head>Elegy  XIX:  By Dryden.</head>
<l>If for thyself thou wilt not watch thy whore,</l>
<l>Watch her for me that I may love her more.</l>
<l>What comes with ease we nauseously receive,</l>
<l>Who but a sot would scorn to love with leave?</l>
<l>With hopes and fears my flames are blown up higher;</l>
<l>Make me despair, and then I can desire.</l>
<l>Give me a jilt to tease my jealous mind;</l>
<l>Deceits are virtues in the female kind.</l>
<l><placeName key="tgn,2044648">Corinna</placeName> my fantastic humour knew,</l>
<l>Play'd trick for trick, and kept herself still new;</l>
<l>She, that next night I might the sharper come,</l>
<l>Fell out with me, and sent me fasting home.</l>
<l>Or some pretence to lie alone would take ;</l>
<l>Whene'er she pleas'd her head and teeth would ache:</l>
<l>Till having won me to the highest strain,</l>
<l>She took occasion to be sweet again.</l>
<l>With what a gust, ye gods, we then embrac'd!</l>
<l>How ev'ry kiss was dearer than the last!</l>
<l>Thou whom I now adore, be edified,</l>
<l>Take care that I may often be denied;</l>
<l>Forget the promis'd hour, or feign some fright,</l>
<l>Make me lie rough on bulks each other night.</l>
<l>These are the arts that best secure thy reign,</l>
<l>And this the food that must my fires maintain.</l>
<l>Gross easy love does, like gross diet, pall;</l>
<l>In squeasy stomachs honey turns to gall.</l>
<l>Had Danae not been kept in brazen tow'rs,</l>
<l>Jove had not thought her worth his golden show'rs:</l>
<l>When <placeName key="tgn,2075297">Juno</placeName> to a cow turn'd Io's shape,</l>
<l>The watchman help'd her to a second leap.</l>
<l>Let him who loves an easy whetstone whore,</l>
<l>Pluck leaves from trees, and drink the common shore.</l>
<l>The jilting harlot strikes the surest blow,</l>
<l>A truth which I by sad experience know;</l>
<l>The kind, poor, constant creature we despise,</l>
<l>Man but pursues the quarry while it flies.</l>
<l>But thou dull husband of a wife too fair,</l>
<l>Stand on thy guard, and watch the precious ware;</l>
<l>If creaking doors, or barking dogs, thou hear,</l>
<l>Or windows scratch'd, suspect a rival there.</l>
<l>An orange wench would tempt thy wife abroad;</l>
<l>Kick her, for she's a letter-bearing bawd.</l>
<l>In short, be jealous as the devil in hell,</l>
<l>And set my wit on work to cheat thee well.</l>
<l>The sneaking city-cuckold is my foe;</l>
<l>I scorn to strike but when he wards the blow.</l>
<l>Look to thy hits and leave off thy conniving,</l>
<l>I'll be no drudge to any wittol living;</l>
<l>I have been patient, and forborne thee long,</l>
<l>In hope thou wouldst not pocket up thy wrong:</l>
<l>If no affront can rouse thee, understand</l>
<l>I'll take no more indulgence at thy hand.</l>
<l>What, ne'er to be forbid thy house and wife</l>
<l>Damn him who loves to lead so ill a life.</l>
<l>Now I can neither sigh, nor whine, nor pray;</l>
<l>All those occasions thou hast ta'en away.</l>
<l>Why art thou so incorrigibly civil ?</l>
<l>Do somewhat I may wish thee at the devil</l>
<l>For shame, be no accomplice in my treason;</l>
<l>A pimping husband is too much in reason.</l>
<l>Once more wear horns, before I quite forsake her</l>
<l>In hopes whereof, I rest thy cuckold-maker.

<div2 type="poem" n="1">
<head>Elegy I:  The Poet deliberates with himself whether he should continue writing elegies, or attempt tragedy.</head>
<l>Unhurt by steel, arose an ancient wood,</l>
<l>A mansion fit for some retiring god;</l>
<l>With craggy stones a secret grot was hung,</l>
<l>And in the midst a sacred fountain sprung;</l>
<l>The courting birds repeating songs of love,</l>
<l>With soft complainings sweetly fill'd the grove:</l>
<l>Here wand'ring thoughtful, and intent to choose</l>
<l>Some theme unsung, to please the busy muse;</l>
<l>Fair elegy came on with gentle pace,</l>
<l>Unforc'd her air and easy was her grace.</l>
<l>Her flaxen hair, in curious tresses wreath'd,</l>
<l>Ambrosial sweets and heav'nly odours breath'd;</l>
<l>A simple dress the careless charmer bore,</l>
<l>And loving looks, and smiles unartful wore.</l>
<l>Next came the goddess of the tragic scene,</l>
<l>With stately tread, and proud majestic mien</l>
<l>Her front severe, with hanging curls was drown'd,</l>
<l>Her length of robe was full, and swept the ground:</l>
<l>Her hand held out, a regal sceptre grac'd,</l>
<l>And Lydian buskins half her legs embrac'd.</l>
<l>She first; "Must love for ever tune thy  voice,</l>
<l>Fond idle bard, and trifling in thy choice</l>
<l>Thy wanton songs employ the drunkard's tongue,</l>
<l>In ev'ry street thy ribald lays are sung;</l>
<l>The finger marks thee in thy passing by,</l>
<l>'Behold, where goes the slave of love,' they cry.</l>
<l>Thy lewd exploits, thou profligate, are grown</l>
<l>The public theme, and talk of all the town;</l>
<l>Whilst unconcern'd, and lost to sense of shame,</l>
<l>Thou still runn'st on nor mind'st thy ruin'd fame.</l>
<l>Enough thou'st told the plaints of fond desire,</l>
<l>Now let a nobler inspiration fire;</l>
<l>Thy matter cramps thy genius, learn to find</l>
<l>A manly subject, and exert thy mind.</l>
<l>In songs for girls, fond toys, and idle play,</l>
<l>Thy muse has wanton'd all her hours away.</l>
<l>But youth at length has fill'd its measure up;</l>
<l>My friend, 'tis time to taste of t'other cup.</l>
<l>Now in my service let thy force be shown,</l>
<l>Assert my honour, and retrieve thy own;</l>
<l>Thy sprightly fancy, and inventive wit,</l>
<l>The lofty style of tragic scenes will fit."</l>
<l>She said; and proudly rising in her gait,</l>
<l>Thrice shook her tresses, and display'd her state.</l>
<l>With open look (nor was my sight beguil'd)</l>
<l>And joyous eyes her rival sweetly smil'd;</l>
<l>Sustain'd her hand a myrtle branch upright?</l>
<l>Or did my fancy form the charming sight?</l>
<l>"Still so severe, 0, tragedy ! (she cried);</l>
<l>And canst thou ne'er forego thy sullen pride?</l>
<l>I not compare my lowly lays to thine;</l>
<l>Too weak materials for the vast design.</l>
<l>The style unlabour'd, negligent the dress,</l>
<l>My verse is humbler, and my matter less.</l>
<l>Gay, wanton, soft, my business is to move,</l>
<l>With melting strains, the playful god of love.</l>
<l>Bereft of me, fair <placeName key="tgn,2094077">Venus</placeName> wants her charms,</l>
<l>I help the goddess, and prepare her arms.</l>
<l>My luring art, and soothing lays prevail,</l>
<l>Where lofty port, and tragic buskins fail.</l>
<l>I more deserve, by making that my care,</l>
<l>Thy rigid pride allows not thee to bear:</l>
<l>By me, <placeName key="tgn,2044648">Corinna</placeName> first was taught to try</l>
<l>Tobreak from prison, and deceive the spy;</l>
<l>I first induc'd the fearful fair to slide</l>
<l>With tremb'ling caution from her husband's side;</l>
<l>When to thy arms, all loose, and disarray'd,</l>
<l>Prepar'd for pleasure, flew the melting maid.</l>
<l>Fix'd on her door, how oft I've hung on high,</l>
<l>Expos'd, and patient of each gazing eye !</l>
<l>How oft, in secret, while the keeper stay'd,</l>
<l>Within her woman's panting bosom laid !</l>
<l>Once sent a birthday gift, the cruel dame</l>
<l>In pieces tore, and gave me to the flame.</l>
<l>I taught thee first to cultivate thy mind;</l>
<l>Thy fancy brightened, and thy wit refin'd;</l>
<l>Thou to my care those merits must allow,</l>
<l>For which my rival would seduce thee now;"</l>
<l>They spoke. I answer'd, "Let me both conjure</l>
<l>To spare a mind with terrors unsecure;</l>
<l>Nor to my charge, when once pronounc'd, be laid</l>
<l>As crimes, the words my trembling tongue has said.</l>
<l>To gain me glory, thy decrees ordain</l>
<l>The regal sceptre and the tragic strain;</l>
<l>With painful labour need I toil for fame,</l>
<l>When easier tasks already raise my name?</l>
<l>Thou mak'st my love immortal; thee I choose:</l>
<l>Be thou my queen, and still command my muse.</l>
<l>Majestic pow'r, forgive my simple choice,</l>
<l>Thy gentle rival has obtain'd my voice.</l>
<l>Short is the time in which her palm is won;</l>
<l>Ere thine is gain'd, the poet's life is done."</l>
<l>I lowly said: she gracious gave assent,</l>
<l>And diff'rent ways the parting rivals went.</l>
<l>Ye gentle loves, complete the work assign'd,</l>
<l>A greater labour seems to press behind.

<l>But now the pomp appears, the sacred throng</l>

<l>Either the gods are empty notions, crept</l>
<l>Into the minds of sleepers as they slept,</l>
<l>In vain are fear'd, are but the tricks of law,</l>
<l>To keep the foolish cred'lous world in awe;</l>
<l>Or, if there be a god, he loves the fair,</l>
<l>And all things at their sole disposal are.</l>
<l>For us are all the instruments of war</l>
<l>Design'd, the sword of <placeName key="tgn,2090583">Mars</placeName>, and <placeName key="tgn,2565867">Pallas</placeName>' spear;</l>
<l>'Gainst us alone Apollo's bows are bent,</l>
<l>And at our hands Jove's brandish'd thunder sent.</l>
<l>Yet of the ladies, oh ! how fond are they !</l>
<l>Dare not the inj'ries they receive, repay,</l>
<l>But those who ought to fear them they obey.</l>
<l>Jove to his votaries is most severe;</l>
<l>Temples nor altars does his lightning spare.</l>
<l>Obliging Semele in flames expires,</l>
<l>But those who merit, can escape the fires.</l>
<l>Is this the justice of your pow'rs divine?</l>
<l>Who then will offer incense at a shrine ?</l>
<l>Why do we thus reproach the deities ?</l>
<l>Have they not hearts ?-and surely they have eyes,</l>
<l>Nay, had I been a god, I had believ'd</l>
<l>The lovely criminals, and been deceiv'd;</l>
<l>Had wav'd the judgments to their perj'ries due,</l>
<l>And sworn myself that all they spoke was true.</l>
<l>Since then the gods such ample gifts bestow,</l>
<l>As make you absolute o'er men below;</l>
<l>Pray let me find some mercy in your reign,</l>
<l>Or spare at least your lover's eyes from pain.

<head>Elegy  IV:  To a man that locked up his wife. By Sir Charles Sedley</head>
<l>Vex not thyself and her, vain man, since all</l>
<l>By their own vice or virtue stand or fall.</l>
<l>She's truly chaste, and worthy of that name,</l>
<l>Who hates the ill, as well as fears the shame;</l>
<l>And that vile woman whom restraint keeps in,</l>
<l>Tho' she forbear the act, has done the sin.</l>
<l>Spies, locks, and bolts may keep her brutal part,</l>
<l>But thou'rt an odious cuckold in her heart.</l>
<l>They that have freedom use it least, and so</l>
<l>The power of ill does the design overthrow.</l>
<l>Provoke not vice by a too harsh restraint;</l>
<l>Sick men long most to drink, who know they mayn't.</l>
<l>The fiery courser, whom no art can stay,</l>
<l>Or rugged force, does oft fair means obey;</l>
<l>And he that did the rudest arm disdain,</l>
<l>Submits with quiet to the looser rein.</l>
<l>A hundred eyes had <placeName key="tgn,2086061">Argus</placeName>, yet the while</l>
<l>One silly maid did all those eyes beguile;</l>
<l>Danae, tho' shut within a brazen tow'r,</l>
<l>Felt the male virtue of the golden show'r;</l>
<l>But chaste Penelope, left to her own will</l>
<l>And free disposal, never thought of ill;</l>
<l>She to her absent lord preserv'd her truth,</l>
<l>For all th' addresses of the smoother youth,</l>
<l>What's rarely seen, our fancy magnifies;</l>
<l>Permitted pleasure who does not despise ?</l>
<l>Thy care provokes beyond her face, and more</l>
<l>Men strive to make tho cuckold than the whore.</l>
<l>They're wondrous charms we think, and long to know</l>
<l>That in a wife enchants a husband so:</l>
<l>Rage, swear, and curse, no matter, she alone</l>
<l>Pleases, who sighs, and cries, " I am undone."</l>
<l>But could thy spies say, " We have kept her chaste,"</l>
<l>Good servants then, but an ill wife thou hast;</l>
<l>Who fears to be a cuckold is a clown,</l>
<l>Not worthy to partake of this lewd town,</l>
<l>Where it is monstrous to be fair and chaste,</l>
<l>And not one inch of either sex lies waste.</l>
<l>Wouldst thou be happy ? with her ways comply,</l>
<l>And in her case lay points of honour by:</l>
<l>The friendship she begins, wisely improve,</l>
<l>And a fair wife gets one a world of love:</l>
<l>So shalt thou welcome be to ev'ry treat,</l>
<l>Live high, not pay, and never run in debt.

<head>Elegy V:  The Dream.  By Henry Cromwell.</head>
<l>'Twas in the midst and silent dead of night,</l>
<l>When heavy sleep oppos'd my weary sight,</l>
<l>This vision did my troubled mind affright:-</l>
<l>To Sol expos'd there stood a rising ground,</l>
<l>Which cast beneath a spacious shade around;</l>
<l>A gloomy grove of spreading oaks below,</l>
<l>And various birds were perch'd on ev'ry bough;</l>
<l>Just on the margin of a verdant mead,</l>
<l>Where murm'ring brooks refreshing waters spread</l>
<l>To shun the heat I sought this cool recess,</l>
<l>But in this shade I felt my heat no less;</l>
<l>When browzing o'er the flow'ry grass appear'd</l>
<l>A lovely cow, the fairest of the herd.</l>
<l>By spotless white distinguished from the rest,</l>
<l>Whiter than milk from her own udder press'd;</l>
<l>Whiter than falling, or the driven snow,</l>
<l>Before descending mists can make it flow.</l>
<l>She, with a lusty bull, her happy mate,</l>
<l>Delighted, on the tender herbage sat;</l>
<l>There, as he crops the flow'rs, and chews the cud,</l>
<l>Feasting a second time upon his food,</l>
<l>His limbs with sudden heaviness oppress'd,</l>
<l>He bends his head, and sinks to pleasing rest.</l>
<l>A noisy crow, cleaving the liquid air,</l>
<l>Thrice with lewd bill pick'd off the heifer's hair;</l>
<l>The glossy white imbib'd a spreading blot,</l>
<l>But on her breast appear'd a livid spot.</l>
<l>The cow rose slowly from her consort's side,</l>
<l>But when afar the grazing bull she spied,</l>
<l>Frisk'd to the herd, with an impetuous haste,</l>
<l>And pleas'd, in new luxuriant soil, her taste.</l>
<l>Oh, learn'd diviner!</l>
<l>What may this visionary dream portend,</l>
<l>If dreams in any future truth can end ?</l>
<l>The prophet nicely weighs what I relate,</l>
<l>And thus denounces in the voice of fate:-</l>
<l>"That heat you tried to shun i' th' shady grove,</l>
<l>But shunn'd in vain, was the fierce heat of love.</l>
<l>The cow denotes the nymph, your only care,</l>
<l>(For white's th' expressive image of the fair,)</l>
<l>And you the bull, abandon'd to despair.</l>
<l>The picking crow some busy bawd implies,</l>
<l>Who with base arts will soon seduce your prim.</l>
<l>You saw the cow to fresher pasture range,</l>
<l>So will your nymph for richer lovers change;</l>
<l>As mixing with the herd you saw her rove,</l>
<l>So will the fair pursue promiscuous love;</l>
<l>Soon will you find a foul incestuous blot,</l>
<l>As on the cow you view'd the livid spot."</l>
<l>At this my blood retired, with dismal fright,</l>
<l>And left me pale as death ; my fainting sight</l>
<l>Was quite o'ercast in dusky shades of night.

<head>Elegy  VI:  To a River, as he was going to his mistress.  By Rhymer.</head>
<l>Thy course, thy noble course a while forbear,</l>
<l>I am in haste now going to my dear!</l>
<l>Thy banks how rich, thy stream how worthy praise</l>
<l>Alas, my haste ! sweet river, let me pass.</l>
<l>No bridges here, no ferry, not an oar,</l>
<l>Or rope to haul me to the farther shore !</l>
<l>I have remember'd thee a little one,</l>
<l>Who now with all this flood com'st blund'ring down.</l>
<l>Did I refuse my sleep, my wine, my friend,</l>
<l>To spur along, and must I here attend ?</l>
<l>No art to help me to my journey's end!</l>
<l>Ye  Lapland powers, make me so far a witch,</l>
<l>I may astride get over on a switch.</l>
<l>Or, for some griffin, or that flying horse,</l>
<l>Or any monster to assist my course;</l>
<l>I wish his art that mounted to the moon,</l>
<l>In shorter journey would my job be done.</l>
<l>Why rave I for what crack-brain'd bards devise,</l>
<l>Or name their lewd unconscionable lies ?</l>
<l>Good river, let me find thy courtesy,</l>
<l>Keep within bounds, and mayst thou ne'er be dry.</l>
<l>Thou canst not think it such a mighty boast,</l>
<l>A torrent has a gentle lover cross'd.</l>
<l>Rivers should rather take the lover's side,</l>
<l>Rivers themselves love's wondrous power have tried.</l>
<l>'Twas on this score Inachus, pale and wan,</l>
<l>Sickly and green, into the ocean ran ;</l>
<l>Long before <placeName key="tgn,7014164">Troy</placeName> the ten-years siege did fear,</l>
<l>Thou, <placeName key="tgn,7002633">Xanthus</placeName>, thou Neaera's chains didst wear;</l>

<l>For Calydon, for all <placeName key="tgn,7002678">Aetolia</placeName></l>
<l>Was then contested such outrageous fray!</l>
<l>It neither was for gold, nor yet for fee;</l>
<l>Dejanira, it was all for thee.</l>
<l>E'en Nile so rich, that rolls thro' sev'n wide doors,</l>
<l>And uppish over all his country scours,</l>
<l>For Asop's daughter did such flame contract,</l>
<l>As not by all that stock of water slack'd.</l>
<l>I might a hundred goodly rivers name,</l>
<l>But must not pass by thee, immortal <placeName key="tgn,7011951">Thame</placeName>;</l>
<l>Ere thou couldst Isis to thy bosom take.</l>
<l>How didst thou wind and wander for her sake!</l>
<l>The lusty ----    with broad <placeName key="tgn,1124748">Humber</placeName> strove;</l>
<l>Was it for fame ? I say it was for love.</l>
<l>What makes the noble <placeName key="tgn,1128249">Ouse</placeName> up from the main</l>
<l>With hideous roar come bristling back again ?</l>
<l>He thinks his dearest Dervent left behind,</l>
<l>Or fears her false, in new embraces joined.</l>
<l>Thee also some small girl has warm'd, we guess,</l>
<l>Tho' woods and forests now hide thy soft place.</l>
<l>Whilst this I speak, it swells and broader grows,</l>
<l>And o'er the highest banks impetuous flows.</l>
<l>Dog-flood, what art to me ? or why dost check</l>
<l>Our mutual joys ? and, churl, my journey break ?</l>
<l>What wouldst, if thee indeed some noble race,</l>
<l>Or high descent, and glorious name did grace ?</l>
<l>When of no ancient house or certain seat,</l>
<l>(Nor, known before this time, untimely, great)</l>
<l>Rais'd by some sudden thaw thus high and proud,</l>
<l>No holding thee, ill-manner'd upstart flood ;</l>
<l>Not my love-tales can make thee stay thy course,</l>
<l>Thou--zounds, thou art a -- river for a horse.</l>
<l>Thou hadst no fountain, but from bears wert pist,</l>
<l>From snows, and thaws, or Scotch unsav'ry mist.</l>
<l>Thou crawl'st along, in winter foul and poor,</l>
<l>In summer puddled like a common-shore.</l>
<l>In all thy days when didst a courtesy ?</l>
<l>Dry traveller ne'er laid a lip to thee.</l>
<l>The bane to cattle, to the meadows worse,</l>
<l>For something all, I for my sufferings curse.</l>
<l>To such unworthy wretch, how am I sham'd,</l>
<l>That I the gen'rous am'rous river nam'd!</l>
<l>When <placeName key="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName> and Achelous I display'd,</l>

<head>Elegy VII:  Ovid laments his imperfect enjoyments.  By an unknown hand.</head>
<l>Was she not heavenly fair, and rich attir'd ?</l>
<l>Was she not that which all my soul desir'd ?</l>
<l>Yet were these arms around her idly spread,</l>
<l>And with an useless load I press'd the bed.</l>
<l>E'en to my wishes was the power denied,</l>
<l>When with my wishes the kind nymph complied</l>
<l>I lay without life's animated spring,</l>
<l>A dull, enervate, worthless, lumpish thing.</l>
<l>My neck she folded with a soft embrace,</l>
<l>Now kissed my eyes, now wanton'd o'er my face,</l>
<l>Now lov'd to dart her humid tongue to mine,</l>
<l>Now would her pliant limbs around me twine,</l>
<l>And sooth, by thousand ways, the sweet design.</l>
<l>The moving blandishments of sound she tried,</l>
<l>And, " My dear life, my soul, my all," she cried.</l>
<l>In vain, alas ! the nerves are slacken'd still,</l>
<l>And I prov'd only potent in my will;</l>
<l>A poor inactive sign of man I made,</l>
<l>And might as well for use have been a shade.</l>
<l>If old I live, how shall I old prevail,</l>
<l>When in my youth I thus inglorious fail?</l>
<l>The bloom of years becomes my shameful moan,</l>
<l>Now in full growth the ripen'd man is shown,</l>
<l>But not the strength of man to her was known.</l>
<l>Untouched by brothers, sisters thus retire,</l>
<l>Or vestals rise to watch th' eternal fire;</l>
<l>Yet many a nymph whom I forbear to name,</l>
<l>Rave kindly yielded, and indulg'd my flame</l>
<l>Nor could the vigour of their 0vid blame.</l>
<l>Corinna knows when numb'ring the delight,</l>
<l>Not less than nine full transports crown'd the night.</l>
<l>Is verse or herbs the source of present harms ?</l>
<l>Am I a captive to Thessalian charms ?</l>
<l>Has some enchantress this confusion brought,</l>
<l>And in soft wax my tortur'd image wrought</l>
<l>Deep in the liver is the needle fix'd ?</l>
<l>Plagues she by numbers, or by juices mix'd?</l>
<l>By numbers sudden the ripe harvest die,</l>
<l>And fruitful urns no more their streams supply;</l>
<l>Oaks shed, unshook, their acorns at the call,</l>
<l>And the vine wonders why her clusters fall.</l>
<l>Why may not magic act on me the same,</l>
<l>Unstring the nerves, and quite untune the frame!</l>
<l>Gall'd at the heart, and longing to perform,</l>
<l>I rais'd indeed, but rais'd an empty storm;</l>
<l>Most disappointed when the most propense,</l>
<l>And shame was second cause of impotence.</l>
<l>What limbs I touch'd ! and only touch'd ! oh, fie!</l>
<l>Where was the blissful touch ? her shift can vie</l>
<l>In feasts like these, and touch as well as I.</l>
<l>Yet to touch her e'en Nestor might grow young,</l>
<l>And centuries, like twenty-one, be strung.</l>
<l>Such was the maid; the parallel had ran</l>
<l>Graceful, if I could add, such was the man.</l>
<l>Some envious deity with vengeance glow'd,</l>
<l>So sweet a gift had been so ill bestow'd.</l>
<l>I burn to clasp her naked in my arms,</l>
<l>Did she not freely open all her charms ?</l>
<l>What boots good fortune, if we want the pow'r</l>
<l>To snatch the pleasures of the favour'd hour?</l>
<l>I, like a miser, only could behold,</l>
<l>And brooded o'er an useless mine of gold;</l>
<l>So Tantalus with fruit untouch'd is curst,</l>
<l>And dies amid the gliding stream of thirst;</l>
<l>So rises early from th' untasted fair,</l>
<l>The grave old prelate, and kneels down to pray'r,</l>
<l>Were yet her melting kisses misenploy'd?</l>
<l>Did she strive vainly to be well enjoy'd ?</l>
<l>Sure she has beauties might deaf rocks enchant,</l>
<l>Bend the proud oak, and soften adamant;</l>
<l>She would have mov'd a man tho' almost dead,</l>
<l>But with my manhood the whole life was fled.</l>
<l>If none should lend an ear, why is the song,</l>
<l>Or painted nymphs shown to a blinded throng !</l>
<l>Ye gods ! what joys did not my fancy raise !</l>
<l>I curl'd in folds of love a thousand ways.</l>
<l>Strong were my thoughts, but ah ! my body lay</l>
<l>Languid as roses pluck'd off yesterday.</l>
<l>Now all the blood the circling spirits fire,</l>
<l>And the lost field impertinent require;</l>
<l>Begone untimely nerves! I trust no more,</l>
<l>Such was the promise of your strength before.</l>
<l>Could you the fair one balk of her delight,</l>
<l>Disgrace your master by so base a fright,</l>
<l>And want the courage for so sweet a fight?</l>
<l>Did she not kindly too your stay demand,</l>
<l>And tempt it softly with a soothing hand ?</l>
<l>But when solicitings no life could gain,</l>
<l>And inspirations, tho' from her, were vain;</l>
<l>"Who bade thee thus thyself to me to bring !</l>
<l>Go for a silly unperforming thing:</l>
<l>Art thou a wretch by some curs'd spell destroy'd,</l>
<l>Or here com'st fribbling with past pleasure cloy'd?"</l>
<l>She spoke, and springing from the bed she flew,</l>
<l>And secret beauties so disclos'd to view;</l>
<l>Yet to conceal the joyless night's digrace,</l>
<l>She called for water with a smiling face,</l>
<l>And wash'd a nameless unpolluted place.

<head>Elegy  VIII:  He complains that his mistress did not give him a favourable reception.</head>
<l>What coxcomb will in future times think fit</l>
<l>To build in love his fortune on his wit ?</l>
<l>Wealth now is worth, whatever 'twas of old,</l>
<l>And merit valu'd by its weight in gold.</l>
<l>With male and female, this is now the rule,</l>
<l>And he that's poor, of course must be a fool.</l>
<l>The dame to read my am'rous verse delights,</l>
<l>My writings likes, but scorns the man that writes;</l>
<l>They freely on her privacy presume,</l>
<l>And find admittance where I must not come;</l>
<l>Me when she does her haunted house exclude,</l>
<l>To them she's civil, as to me she's rude.</l>
<l>Me she exposes to a thousand harms,</l>
<l>To walk the streets, while they are in her arms.</l>
<l>For whom does she my passion disregard ?</l>
<l>And who has intercepted my reward ?</l>
<l>Why is the beau with so much joy embrac'd ?</l>
<l>His pockets full, it seems, his coat is lac'd:</l>
<l>He won her with his military air</l>
<l>Which cheats as often as it charms the fair.</l>
<l>Could she her longing eyes forbear to fix</l>
<l>On his fine feather, and his coach and six!</l>
<l>Enrich'd by plunder, he could never miss</l>
<l>The favour, who would buy the venal bliss.</l>
<l>No matter how he got his wealth, by war,</l>
<l>And blood: she cares not, if she has her share.</l>
<l>The upstart forward was, 'tis said, in fight,</l>
<l>And in the field of battle made a knight:</l>
<l>But had his honour come without his gold,</l>
<l>His, sure, had been like my reception, cold.</l>
<l>To men of merit how could she be coy,</l>
<l>Yet to a murd'rer prostitute the joy?</l>
<l>That head which lolls upon your panting breast,</l>
<l>Was lately cover'd with a plumy crest.</l>
<l>Can you the bully to your bed admit ?</l>
<l>Are his hard limbs for ladies' dalliance fit ?</l>
<l>His hands in your embrace you'll find embru'd</l>
<l>With clotted, and perhaps with guiltless blood;</l>
<l>How awkward must it be for you to feel,</l>
<l>Near yours, his thigh that late was cas'd with steel</l>
<l>That ring, the token of his pride and state,</l>
<l>Was with a heavy gauntlet hid of late:</l>
<l>Canst thou have commerce with a thing so foul!</l>
<l>Where's now the boasted niceness of thy soul?</l>
<l>What pleasure canst thou in his roughness find?</l>
<l>Thou that wert once the softest of thy kind!</l>
<l>Behold what marks of brutal rage he bears,</l>
<l>And how he's mangled with dishonest scars.</l>
<l>Yet to these scars, dishonest as they are,</l>
<l>His wealth he owes, his fortunes with the fair.</l>
<l>No doubt, he makes a merit of his guilt,</l>
<l>And brags what blood he has in battle spilt.</l>
<l>Fine courtship this, to win a gentle dame;</l>
<l>Thou shar'st his money, and must share his shame.</l>
<l>Me, not the meanest of Apollo's train,</l>
<l>She hates, and I repeat my verse in vain;</l>
<l>I sing before her gate; her gate I find</l>
<l>Is less obdurate than her harden'd mind.</l>
<l>Forbear your songs, Apollo's sons, forbear,</l>
<l>And bend your future thoughts to arms and war.</l>
<l>Instead of inspirations, get commands;</l>
<l>To murder, and to rapine use your hands,</l>
<l>And you with ease reduce the female bands.</l>
<l>Had Homer in the Grecian army serv'd,</l>
<l>We ne'er had heard that he had begg'd, or starv'd.</l>
<l>Of gold the thund'rer show'd the mighty pow'r,</l>
<l>Descending softly thro' the brazen tow'r,</l>
<l>And clasping Danae in a golden show'r.</l>
<l>A thousand bars the virgin fair did hold,</l>
<l>But what are iron bars to bribes of gold?</l>
<l>Against this foe her father could not guard;</l>
<l>Watchmen, and women kept a fruitless ward.</l>
<l>The damsel, who herself before was coy,</l>
<l>Melts at the sight, and meets the dazzling joy.</l>
<l>When peaceful Saturn did heav'n's sceptre sway,</l>
<l>Deep in earth's womb the fatal metal lay;</l>
<l>None then their teeming mother's bowels tore,</l>
<l>In quest of hidden wealth, in various ore;</l>
<l>Fed with the fruits which bounteous nature yields,</l>
<l>In painted gardens, and in golden fields,</l>
<l>From her rich soil are reap'd spontaneous crops,</l>
<l>And from the forest oak sweet honey drops.</l>
<l>No hinds as yet did toil their time away,</l>
<l>Nor with keen clusters wound the parent clay:</l>
<l>As yet no landmark was by lab'rers set,</l>
<l>And none had learned to plough the sea as yet</l>
<l>None as yet knew the use of sails and oars,</l>
<l>Nor ventur'd voyages beyond their shores.</l>
<l>The wit of men the race of men destroys,</l>
<l>And all its pow'rs against itself employs.</l>
<l>How subtle's human nature to contrive</l>
<l>Its proper ruin, and itself deceive!</l>
<l>Why didst thou cities with high walls surround,</l>
<l>Why arms invent thy jarring sons to wound ?</l>
<l>What quarrel hast thou with the sea, and why</l>
<l>Didst thou at first the pathless ocean try ?</l>
<l>Cannot the land content thy restless pride ?</l>
<l>Didst thou with Saturn's sons the whole divide,</l>
<l>Thou wouldst not with three worlds be satisfied.</l>
<l>'Tis strange thy vast ambition did not fly</l>
<l>O'er earth, and sea, and air, and scale the sky;</l>
<l>That man did not aspire to be a god,</l>
<l>And tread the paths by Indian Bacchus trod,</l>
<l>To give his name to some distinguish'd star,</l>
<l>And be what Hercules and Caesar are.</l>
<l>Instead of yellow harvests, now we seek</l>
<l>For solid gold, and thro' earth's entrails break;</l>
<l>The wealth we thus acquire's the soldier's prey,</l>
<l>And dearly for the blood he spills we pay.</l>
<l>The courts deny admittance to the poor,</l>
<l>In vain the needy clients crowd the door;</l>
<l>The judges to the rich decree the cause,</l>
<l>And money only gives their force to laws.</l>
<l>'Tis money makes the judge with looks severe</l>
<l>Insult the poor, and give the rich his ear;</l>
<l>'Tis money buys the title, makes the knight,</l>
<l>And dignifies with quality the cit:</l>
<l>Let money do all this, and more; the bar</l>
<l>Let money govern, and direct the war.</l>
<l>Let peace, as money sets the terms, be made,</l>
<l>But let it not the rights of love invade.</l>
<l>Let us enjoy this privilege at least,</l>
<l>That if we must be poor, we may with love be bless'd:</l>

<l>He'll leave the house, let you your money fly.</l>
<l>If there's a god above, to whom belongs</l>
<l>The cause of love, and slighted lovers wrongs,</l>
<l>Revenge the false one's mercenary scorn,</l>
<l>And let ill-gotten pelf to dirt return.

<head>Elegy IX:  Upon the Death of Tibullus.  By <placeName key="tgn,2693739">Stepney</placeName>.</head>
<l>If Memnon's fate bewail'd with constant dew,</l>
<l>Does, with the day, his mother's grief renew,</l>
<l>If her son's death mov'd tender Thetis' mind</l>
<l>To swell with tears the waves, with sighs the wind;</l>
<l>Sad Cupid now despairs of conqu'ring hearts,</l>
<l>Throws by his empty quiver, breaks his darts:</l>
<l>Eases his useless bows from idle strings;</l>
<l>Nor flies, but humbly creeps with flagging wings.</l>
<l>He wants, of which he robb'd fond lovers, rest;</l>
<l>And wounds with furious hands his pensive breast.</l>
<l>Those graceful curls which wantonly did flow,</l>
<l>The whiter rivals of the falling snow,</l>
<l>Forget their beauty, and in discord lie,</l>
<l>Drunk with the fountain from his melting eye.</l>
<l>Nor Phoebus, nor the muses' queen, could give</l>
<l>Their son, their own prerogative, to live.</l>
<l>Orpheus, the heir of both his parents' skill,</l>
<l>Tam'd wond'ring beasts, not death's more cruel will.</l>
<l>Linus' sad strings on the dumb lute do lie. </l>
<l>In silence forc'd to let their master die.</l>
<l>His mother weeping does his eyelids close,</l>
<l>And on his urn, tears, her last gift, bestows.</l>
<l>His sister too, with hair dishevell'd, bears</l>
<l>Part of her mother's nature, and her tears.</l>
<l>With those, two fair, two mournful rivals come,</l>
<l>And add a greater triumph to his tomb:</l>
<l>Both hug his urn, both his lov'd ashes kiss,</l>
<l>And both contend which reap'd the greater bliss.</l>
<l>Thus <placeName key="tgn,1013136">Delia</placeName> spoke (when sighs no more could last)</l>
<l>Renewing by remembrance pleasures past;</l>
<l>"When youth with vigour did for joy combine,</l>
<l>I was Tibullus' life, Tibullus mine;</l>
<l>1 entertained his hot, his first desire,</l>
<l>And kept alive, till age, his active fire."</l>
<l>To her then Nemesis (when groans gave leave)</l>
<l>"As I alone was lov'd, alone I'll grieve;</l>
<l>Spare your vain tears, Tibullus' heart was mine,</l>
<l>About my neck his dying arms did twine:</l>
<l>I snatch'd his soul, which true to me did prove;</l>
<l>Age ended yours, death only stopp'd my love."</l>
<l>If any poor remains survive the flames,</l>
<l>Except thin shadows, and more empty names;</l>
<l>Free in Elysium shall Tibullus rove,</l>
<l>Nor fear a second death should cross his love.</l>
<l>There shall Catullus, crown'd with bays, impart</l>
<l>To his far dearer friend his open heart.</l>
<l>There Gallus (if fame's hundred tongues all lie)</l>
<l>Shall, free from censure, no more rashly die.</l>
<l>Such shall our poet's bless'd companions be,</l>
<l>And in their deaths, as in their lives, agree.</l>
<l>But thou, rich urn, obey my strict commands,</l>
<l>Guard thy great charge from sacrilegious hands.</l>
<l>Thou, earth, Tibullus' ashes gently use,</l>
<l>And be as soft and easy as his muse.

<l>Now <placeName key="tgn,2068435">Ceres</placeName>' feast is come, the trees are blown,</l>
<l>And my <placeName key="tgn,2044648">Corinna</placeName> now must lie alone.</l>
<l>And why, good <placeName key="tgn,2068435">Ceres</placeName>, must thy feast destroy</l>
<l>Man's chief delight, and why disturb his joy ?</l>
<l>The world esteems you bountiful and good,</l>
<l>You led us from the field and from the wood,</l>
<l>And gave us fruitful corn, and wholesome food.</l>
<l>Till then poor wretched man on acorns fed;</l>
<l>Oaks gave him meat, and flow'ry fields a bed.</l>
<l>First <placeName key="tgn,2068435">Ceres</placeName> made our wheat and barley grow,</l>
<l>And taught us how to plough, and how to mow;</l>
<l>Who then can think that she designs to prove</l>
<l>Our piety, by coldness in our love ?</l>
<l>Or make poor lovers sigh, lament, and groan,</l>
<l>Or charge her votaries to lie alone ?</l>
<l>For <placeName key="tgn,2068435">Ceres</placeName>, though she loves the fruitful fields,</l>
<l>Yet sometimes feels the force of love, and yields:</l>
<l>This <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> can witness, (<placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> not always lies)</l>
<l><placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> that nurs'd Jove, and heard his infant cries,</l>
<l>There he was suckled who now rules the skies.</l>
<l>That Jove his education there receiv'd,</l>
<l>Will raise her fame, and make her be believ'd;</l>
<l>Nay she herself will never strive to hide</l>
<l>Her love, 'tis too well known to be denied:</l>
<l>She saw young Jasius in the Cretan grove</l>
<l>Pursue the deer, she saw, and fell in love.</l>
<l>She then perceived when first she felt the fire,</l>
<l>On this side modesty, on that desire;</l>
<l>Desire prevail'd, and then the field grew dry,</l>
<l>The farmer lost his crop and knew not why;</l>
<l>When he had toil'd, manur'd his grounds, and plough' d,</l>
<l>Harrow'd his fields, and broke his clods, and sow'd,</l>
<l>No corn appear'd, none to reward his pain,</l>
<l>His labour and his wishes were in vain.</l>
<l>For <placeName key="tgn,7010621">Ceres</placeName> wand'red in the woods and groves,</l>
<l>And often heard, and often told her loves:</l>
<l>Then <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> alone a fruitful summer knew,</l>
<l>Where'er the goddess came a harvest grew.</l>
<l>Ida was grey with corn, the furious boar</l>
<l>Grew fat with wheat, and wonder'd at the store:</l>
<l>The Cretans wish'd that such all years would prove,</l>
<l>They wish'd that <placeName key="tgn,7010621">Ceres</placeName> would be long in love.</l>
<l>Well then, since then 'twas hard for you to lie</l>
<l>All night alone, why at your feast must I ?</l>
<l>Why must I mourn, when you rejoice to know</l>
<l>Your daughter safe, and queen of all below?</l>
<l>'Tis holy-day, and calls for wine and love;</l>
<l>Come, let's the height of mirth and humor prove,</l>
<l>These gifts will please our master pow'rs above.

<head>Elegy  XI:  To his Mistress, that he cannot help loving her.</head>
<l>So much I've suffer'd, and so long, no more</l>
<l>I'll bear the wrongs which I have borne before.</l>
<l>Begone, vile Cupid, I'll no more endure</l>
<l>Thy slavish labors, and fatigues impure;</l>
<l>From hence, I'll put an end to all the pains</l>
<l>Thou'st cost me, and from hence shake off thy chains.</l>
<l>I hate the liv'ry I with pleasure wore,</l>
<l>And blush at bonds, which once with pride I bore:</l>
<l>But this, methinks, should have been done before.</l>
<l>To leave my wicked courses I begin,</l>
<l>As years deprive me of the gust of sin.</l>
<l>On Cupid's neck I should have trod when young,</l>
<l>And vanquish'd him when my desires were strong.</l>
<l>In that there had been virtue; now there's none,</l>
<l>The world will say so; let the world say on.</l>
<l>Much opposition I shall meet; perhaps,</l>
<l>The lewd will laugh, and threaten a relapse.</l>
<l>To bear reproaches I must be prepar'd,</l>
<l>Easy's the end, when the beginning's hard;</l>
<l>Content let me the present pain endure,</l>
<l>For the sharp medicine is the patient's cure.</l>
<l>How oft you have expos'd me to the cold,</l>
<l>While in your arms you did my rival hold!</l>
<l>How like a slave have I been forc'd to wait</l>
<l>All weathers, and how oft have watched the gate!</l>
<l>As if your house was trusted to my care</l>
<l>And I, your sentinel, did duty there.</l>
<l>Oft have I seen your sated lover come</l>
<l>With looks, as if he long'd to be at home.</l>
<l>But what most grated on my jealous mind,</l>
<l>Was that he there the waiting fool should find.</l>
<l>That aggravated most the cruel curse;</l>
<l>I would not wish my greatest foe a worse.</l>
<l>How oft have I attended you abroad,</l>
<l>Or in the city, cirque, or on the road ?</l>
<l>They took me for your husband by my care,</l>
<l>Or that your guardian or your slave I were.</l>
<l>I by the people's glances, and your own,</l>
<l>Observ'd you were acquainted with the town;</l>
<l>That of your love if I possess'd a part,</l>
<l>'Twas plain I shared with many more your heart.</l>
<l>What need I of your perjuries bring proof,</l>
<l>Suppose the common talk was not enough!</l>
<l>What do your ogles and your gestures mean,</l>
<l>Your carriage at th' assembly and the scene ?</l>
<l>There's scarce a fop you meet with in your way,</l>
<l>To whom you have not something soft to say;</l>
<l>Some token which you either understand</l>
<l>By mystic words or motion of the hand.</l>
<l>They tell me you are sick; I run to see,</l>
<l>And find, as ill as you pretend to be,</l>
<l>It is not for my rival, but for me.</l>
<l>I seldom told you of your faults, but strove</l>
<l>To cover all your failings with my love;</l>
<l>Of this I might remind you, and much more,</l>
<l>But what avails it now; th' affair is o'er:</l>
<l>A fond you found me, and a patient man,</l>
<l>And get you such another if you can.</l>
<l>I fear not now your frowns; my bark defies</l>
<l>The storm of words, and tempest of your eyes;</l>
<l>No coaxing now, your hardest phrases use,</l>
<l>Your looks, your language, all their terrors lose;</l>
<l>I am not such a fool as I have been,</l>
<l>To dread your spirit, and to sooth your spleen.</l>
<l>But, ah! by diff'rent passions I'm oppress'd,</l>
<l>Fierce love and hate contend within my breast;</l>
<l>My soul they thus divide, but love, I fear,</l>
<l>Will prove too strong, and get the mast'ry there;</l>
<l>I'll strive to hate her, but if that should prove</l>
<l>A fruitless strife, in spite of me I'll love.</l>
<l>The bull does not affect the yoke, but still</l>
<l>He bears the thing he hates against his will</l>
<l>I hate, I fly the faithless fair in vain,</l>
<l>Her beauty ever brings me back again;</l>
<l>She always in my heart will have a place,</l>
<l>I hate her humour, but I love her face;</l>
<l>No rest I to my tortur'd soul can give,</l>
<l>Nor with her nor without her can I live.</l>
<l>Oh ! that thy mind we in thy face did view,</l>
<l>Less lovely that thou wert, or else more true.</l>
<l>How diffrent are thy manners and thy sight!</l>
<l>Thy deeds forbid us and thy eyes invite.</l>
<l>Thy actions shock us, and thy beauty moves,</l>
<l>And he who hates thy faults, thy person loves.</l>
<l>Happy, ah ! ever happy should I be,</l>
<l>If I no charms or no defects could see.</l>
<l>Thee I conjure by all our past delights,</l>
<l>Our cheerful days and our transporting nights,</l>
<l>By all the imprecated gods above,</l>
<l>To whom thou art forsworn, but most by Love,</l>
<l>By thy fair face, which I as much adore</l>
<l>As all those gods, and own as much its pow'r,</l>
<l>Forgive me this offence, and I'll offend no more.</l>
<l>Be what thou wilt, thy humour good or ill,</l>
<l>I'll love thee, thou shalt be my mistress still</l>
<l>Ah, let my passion ever favour find,</l>
<l>Or be it with, or be't against my mind,</l>
<l>But rather let me sail before the wind.</l>
<l>Ah, let thy wishes with my will agree,</l>
<l>Since surely I thy slave must ever be;</l>
<l>In thee since I have centred all my joys,</l>
<l>Oh Venus ! let my love be still my choice.

<l>What wayward orb, what inauspicious star</l>
<l>Did then rule heav'n ? what gods against me war?</l>
<l>She who so much my fatal passion wrongs,</l>
<l>Was known and first made famous by my songs.</l>
<l>I lov'd her first, and lov'd her then alone,</l>
<l>But now, I fear, I share her with the town.</l>
<l>Am I deceiv'd  or can she be the same,</l>
<l>Who only to my verses owes her fame</l>
<l>My verse a price upon her beauty laid,</l>
<l>And by my praises she her market made;</l>
<l>Whom but myself can I with reason blame?</l>
<l>Without me she had never had a name.</l>
<l>Did I do this, who knew her soul so well?</l>
<l>Dearly to me she did her favours sell;</l>
<l>And when the wares were to the public known,</l>
<l>Why should I think she'd sell to me alone ?</l>
<l>'Twas I proclaim'd to all the town her charms,</l>

<l>Her house is now as common as the stews;</l>
<l>For this I'm to the muse oblig'd, and more</l>
<l>For all the mischiefs envy has in store.</l>
<l>This comes of gallantry, while some employ</l>

<l>Why did the town so readily believe</l>

<l>I wish the tales I've of <placeName key="tgn,2044648">Corinna</placeName> told,</l>
<l>Had been receiv'd as fables were of old;</l>
<l>Of furious Scylla's horrid shape we read,</l>
<l>And how she scalp'd her hoary father's lead:</l>
<l>Of her fair face, and downward how she takes</l>
<l>The wolf's fierce form, the dog's, or curling snake's;</l>
<l>Serpents for hair, in ancient song we meet,</l>
<l>And man and horse with wings instead of feet.</l>
<l>Huge Tityon from the skies the poets flung,</l>
<l>Encelladus's wars with Jove they sung;</l>
<l>How by her spells, and by her voice, to beasts,</l>
<l>The doubtful virgin chang'd her wretched guests;</l>
<l>How Eolus did for <placeName key="tgn,2093866">Ulysses</placeName> keep</l>
<l>The winds in bottles while he plough'd the deep:</l>
<l>How Cerberus, three headed, guarded hell;</l>
<l>And from his car the son of Phoebus fell:</l>
<l>How thirsty Tantalus attempts to sip</l>
<l>The stream in vain, that flies his greedy lip:</l>
<l>How Niobe in marble drops a tear,</l>
<l>And a bright nymph was turn'd into a bear:</l>
<l>How Progne, now a swallow, does bemoan</l>
<l>Her sister nightingale, and pheasant son.</l>
<l>In Leda, Danae, and Europa's rapes,</l>
<l>They sing the king of gods in various shapes;</l>
<l>A swan he lies on ravish'd Leda's breast,</l>
<l>And Danae by a golden show'r compress'd;</l>
<l>A bull does o'er the waves Europa bear,</l>
<l>And Proteus any form he pleases wear.</l>
<l>How oft do we the Theban wonders read,</l>
<l>Of serpent's teeth transform'd to human seed!</l>
<l>Of dancing woods, and moving rocks, that throng</l>
<l>To hear sweet Orpheus, and <placeName key="tgn,2132474">Amphion</placeName>'s song ?</l>
<l>How oft do the Heliades bemoan,</l>
<l>In tears of gum, the fall of Phaeton!</l>
<l>The sun from Atreus' table frightened flies,</l>
<l>And backward drives his chariot in the skies.</l>
<l>Those now are nymphs that lately were a fleet;</l>
<l>Poetic license ever was so great.</l>
<l>But none did credit to these fictions give,</l>

<head>Elegy  XIII:  Of Juno's Feast.</head>
<l>My wife, a native of Phaliscan plains,</l>
<l>Where the rich soils enrich the lab'ring swains,</l>
<l>Where purple grapes and golden apples grow,</l>
<l>A conquest we to great <placeName key="tgn,2068320">Camillus</placeName> owe.</l>
<l>When once to <placeName key="tgn,2075297">Juno</placeName>'s feast she thither went,</l>
<l>My mind to know the secret rites was bent:</l>
<l>The pious priests the solemn sports prepare,</l>
<l>And purify the fane with holy care.</l>
<l>A heifer of the place they sacrifice,</l>
<l>But ne'er to men expose their mysteries,</l>
<l>I mark'd the hidden way my consort went,</l>
<l>And follow'd down the deep and dark descent.</l>
<l>To an old wood at last I came, whose shade</l>
<l>Impress'd a horror on the gloom it made,</l>
<l>And ev'ry step with trembling feet I trod,</l>
<l>Profan'd, I thought, the dwelling of a god.</l>
<l>An altar there was rais'd by hands divine,</l>
<l>And fragrant incense flam'd around the shrine.</l>
<l>Chaste matrons there their vow'd oblations pay,</l>
<l>And celebrate with joyful hymns the day.</l>
<l>Soon as the fife the signal gives, they move</l>
<l>In long procession through the sacred grove</l>
<l>Branches and flow'rs are with devotion spread</l>
<l>O'er all the way, and priestly vestments laid.</l>
<l>Next after these, through loud acclaims, they lead</l>
<l>A cow milk white, and of Phaliscan breed;</l>
<l>Then a young steer, whose forehead ne'er had borne</l>
<l>The crooked honours of the butting horn.</l>
<l>The least of all the victims was a swine,</l>
<l>And then a ram whose horns around his temples twine.</l>
<l>A goat, whom most the goddess hates, comes last;</l>
<l>The present feels her vengeance for the past.</l>
<l>When in a wood to hide herself she tried,</l>
<l>She by the bleating of a goat was spied;</l>
<l>For this the beast is by the boys pursu'd;</l>
<l>For this she's ever greedy of its blood,</l>
<l>And he, who first the letcher wounds in play,</l>
<l>Claims by her law, and hears the prize away.</l>
<l>The tender youth, and tim'rous virgin strow</l>
<l>With robes the ground the goddess is to go.</l>
<l>The virgins' locks with golden fillets bound,</l>
<l>And sparkling diamonds glitt'ring all around;</l>
<l>Buskins embroider'd on their feet they wear,</l>
<l>And spreading trains with pride uneasy bear.</l>
<l>Here, as in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> the custom was of old,</l>
<l>The image of the goddess we behold</l>
<l>Borne on the heads of maidens, and behind</l>
<l>The priestesses in beauteous rank you find.</l>
<l>An awful silence reigns : the goddess last</l>
<l>Approaches, and with her the pomp is past.</l>
<l>The dress was Greek, and such Halesus wore,</l>
<l>When in a fright he fled the Grecian shore;</l>
<l>His father kill'd, an <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> ship he fraught,</l>
<l>And to this coast the royal treasure brought.</l>
<l>Much peril had he past, much labour known,</l>
<l>O'er lands and seas, before he reach'd our own,</l>
<l>And landing built, with happy hand, the town,</l>
<l>Where first he did this festival revive,</l>
<l>And its Greek rules to the Phaliscans give;</l>
<l>The rites and sacrifices first he show'd,</l>
<l>As practis'd now within this ancient wood.</l>

<l>At least seem virtuous, and tho' false you be,</l>

<l>Enjoy the pleasure of the present times,</l>
<l>But let not me be knowing of your crimes.</l>
<l>Do you forswear't, tho' in the act you're caught,</l>
<l>I'll trust the oath, and think my eyes in fault.

<head>Elegy XV:   To Venus, that he may have done writing elegies.</head>
<l>To Virgil Mantua owes immortal fame,</l>
<l>Catullus to <placeName key="perseus,Verona">Verona</placeName> gives a name;</l>
<l>Why mayn't, if I attempt some great design,</l>
<l>Peligne be as much oblig'd to mine ?</l>
<l>Why mayn't my muse a glorious toil pursue,</l>
<l>And as much honour to my country do ?</l>
<l>A people, who, when <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> has been alarm'd</l>
<l>By foreign foes, in her defence have arm'd;</l>
<l>Beneath your golden banners I have fought</l>
<l>So long, your discipline so much have taught,</l>
<l>'Tis time to give me a discharge, to prove</l>
<l>Some other, some more glorious theme than love</l>
<l>See Bacchus beckons me my voice to raise,</l>
<l>Of lofty deeds to sings, in lofty lays;</l>
<l>To mount my muse on some more generous horse,</l>
<l>And try her courage in some daring course.</l>
<l>Adieu, my sighing elegies, adieu!</l>
<l>I'll be no more concern'd with love or you;</l>
<l>But what I write my being shall survive,</l>
<l>And in his verse the poet ever live.</l></div2></div1>
