                  <head>Against Timarchus</head>
                  <div2 n="1" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I have never, fellow citizens, brought indictment against any Athenian, nor vexed any man when he was rendering account of his office<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">The Athenian Constitution provided for rigid auditing of the accounts of all officials at the close of their year of office, and gave full opportunity to any citizen to bring charges against any act of their administration.  Such opportunity might easily be used for malicious or blackmailing attack</note>;  but in all such matters I have, as I believe, shown myself a quiet and modest man.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">A quiet citizen, as distinguished from the professional political blackmailer, <foreign lang="greek">sukofa/nths</foreign></note> But when I saw that the city was being seriously injured by the defendant, Timarchus, who, though disqualified by law, was speaking in your assemblies,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">As the speech proceeds we shall see that Aeschines declares that Timarchus was guilty of immoral practices that disqualified him from speaking before the people.</note> and when I myself was made a victim of his blackmailing attack&mdash;the nature of the attack I will show in the course of my speech&mdash;</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="2" type="section"><p>I decided that it would be a most shameful thing if I failed to come to the defence of the whole city and its laws, and to your defence and my own;  and knowing that he was liable to the accusations that you heard read a moment ago by the clerk of the court, I instituted this suit, challenging him to official scrutiny.  Thus it appears,fellow citizens, that what is so frequently said of public suits is no mistake, namely, that very often private enmities correct public abuses.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="3" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>You will see, then, that Timarchus cannot blame the city for any part of this prosecution, nor can he blame the laws, nor you, nor me, but only himself.  For because of his shameful private life the laws forbade him to speak before the people, laying on him an injunction not difficult, in my opinion, to obey&mdash;nay, most easy;  and had he been wise, he need not have made his slanderous attack upon me.  I hope, therefore, that in this introduction I have spoken as a quiet and modest citizen ought to speak.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="4" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I am aware, fellow citizens, that the statement which I am about to make first is something that you will undoubtedly have heard from other men on other occasions;  but I think the same thought is especially timely on this occasion, and from me. It is acknowledged, namely, that there are in the world three forms of government, autocracy, oligarchy, and democracy:  autocracies and oligarchies are administered according to the tempers of their lords, but democratic states according to established laws.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="5" type="section"><p>And be assured, fellow citizens, that in a democracy it is the laws that guard the person of the citizen and the constitution of the state, whereas the despot and the oligarch find their protection in suspicion and in armed guards.  Men, therefore, who administer an oligarchy, or any government based on inequality, must be on their guard against those who attempt revolution by the law of force;  but you, who have a government based upon equality and law, must guard against those whose words violate the laws or whose lives have defied them;  for then only will you be strong, when you cherish the laws, and when the revolutionary attempts of lawless men shall have ceased.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="6" type="section"><p>And it behooves us, I think, not only when we are enacting laws, to consider always how the laws that we make may be good and advantageous to the democracy, but when once we have enacted them, it equally behooves us, if all is to be well with the state, to obey the laws that we have enacted, and to punish those who do not obey them.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Consider, fellow citizens, how much attention that ancient lawgiver, Solon, gave to morality, as did Draco and the other lawgivers of those days.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="7" type="section"><p>First, you recall, they laid down laws to protect the morals of our children, and they expressly prescribed what were to be the habits of the freeborn boy, and how he was to be brought up;  then they legislated for the lads, and next for the other age-groups in succession, including in their provision, not only private citizens, but also the public men.  And when they had inscribed these laws, they gave them to you in trust, and made you their guardians.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="8" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now it is my desire, in addressing you on this occasion, to follow in my speech the same order which the lawgiver followed in his laws.  For you shall hear first a review of the laws that have been laid down to govern the orderly conduct of your children, then the laws concerning the lads, and next those concerning the other ages in succession, including not only private citizens, but the public men as well.  For so, I think, my argument will most easily be followed.  And at the same time I wish, fellow citizens, first to describe to you in detail the laws of the state, and then in contrast with the laws to examine the character and habits of Timarchus.  For you will find that the life he has lived has been contrary to all the laws.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="9" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In the first place, consider the case of the teachers.  Although the very livelihood of these men, to whom we necessarily entrust our own children, depends on their good character, while the opposite conduct on their part would mean poverty, yet it is plain that the lawgiver distrusts them;  for he expressly prescribes, first, at what time of day the free-born boy is to go to the school-room;  next, how many other boys may go there with him, and when he is to go home.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="10" type="section"><p>He forbids the teacher to open the school-room, or the gymnastic trainer the wrestling school, before sunrise, and he commands them to close the doors before sunset;  for he is exceeding suspicious of their being alone with a boy, or in the dark with him.  He prescribes what children are to be admitted as, pupils, and their age at admission.  He provides for a public official who shall superintend them, and for the oversight of slave-attendants of school-boys.  He regulates the festivals of the Muses in the school-rooms, and of Hermes in the wrestling-schools.  Finally, he regulates the companionships that the boys may form at school, and their cyclic dances.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Dances by specially trained groups of boys, often competive between tribes, were popular features of many of the Greek festivals.  Those dances which were arranged for a circular dancing-ground were called  &ldquo;cyclic&rdquo;.</note></p></div2>
                  <div2 n="11" type="section"><p>He prescribes, namely, that the choregus, a man who is going to spend his own money for your entertainment, shall be a man of more than forty years of age when he performs this service, in order that he may have reached the most temperate time of life before he comes into contact with your children.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>These laws, then, shall be read to you, to prove that the lawgiver believed that it is the boy who has been well brought up that will be a useful citizen when he becomes a man.  But when a boy's natural disposition is subjected at the very outset to vicious training, the product of such wrong nurture will be, as he believed, a citizen like this man Timarchus.  Read these laws to the jury.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="12" type="section"><p><quote type="Laws"><title>Laws</title><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&lsqb;The teachers of the boys shall open the school-rooms not earlier than sunrise, and they shall close them before sunset.  No person who is older than the boys shall be permitted to enter the room while they are there, unless he be a son of the teacher, a brother, or a daughter's husband.  If any one enter in violation of this prohibition, he shall be punished with death.  The superintendents of the gymnasia shall under no conditions allow any one who has reached the age of manhood to enter the contests of Hermes together with the boys.  A gymnasiarch who does permit this and fails to keep such a person out of the gymnasium, shall be liable to the penalties prescribed for the seduction of free-born youth.  Every choregus who is appointed by the people shall be more than forty years of age.&rsqb;</quote></p></div2>
                  <div2 n="13" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now after this, fellow citizens, he lays down laws regarding crimes which, great as they undoubtedly are, do actually occur, I believe, in the city.  For the very fact that certain unbecoming things were being done was the reason for the enactment of these laws by the men of old.  At any rate the law says explicitly:  if any boy is let out for hire as a prostitute, whether it be by father or brother or uncle or guardian, or by any one else who has control of him, prosecution is not to he against the boy himself, but against the man who let him out for hire and the man who hired him;  against the one because he let him out for hire, and against the other, it says, because he hired him.  And the law has made the penalties for both offenders the same.  Moreover the law frees a son, when he has become a man, from all obligation to support or to furnish a home to a father by whom he has been hired out for prostitution;  but when the father is dead, the son is to bury him and perform the other customary rites.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="14" type="section"><p>See, gentlemen, how admirably this legislation fits the case;  so long as the father is alive he is deprived of all the benefits of fatherhood, precisely as he deprived his son of a citizen's right to speak;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">The son, as one whose person had been prostituted, was debarred from addressing the assembly of the people. cp. <bibl n="Aeschin. 1.3">Aeschin. 1.3</bibl>.</note> but when he is dead, and unconscious of the service that is being rendered him, and when it is the law and religion that receive the honor, then at last the lawgiver commands the son to bury him and perform the other customary rites.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But what other law has been laid down for the protection of your children?  The law against panders.  For the lawgiver imposes the heaviest penalties if any person act as pander in the case of a free-born child or a free-born woman.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="15" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And what other law?  The law against outrage, which includes all such conduct in one summary statement, wherein it stands expressly written:  if any one outrage a child &lpar;and surely he who hires, outrages&rpar; or a man or woman, or any one, free or slave, or if he commit any unlawful act against any one of these.  Here the law provides prosecution for outrage, and it prescribes what bodily penalty he shall suffer, or what fine he shall pay.  Read the law.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="16" type="section"><p><quote type="Law"><title>Law</title><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&lsqb;If any Athenian shall outrage a free-born child, the parent or guardian of the child shall demand a specific penalty.  If the court condemn the accused to death, he shall be delivered to the constables and be put to death the same day.  If he be condemned to pay a fine, and be unable to pay the fine immediately, he must pay within eleven days after the trial, and he shall remain in prison until payment is made.  The same action shall hold against those who abuse the persons of slaves.&rsqb;</quote></p></div2>
                  <div2 n="17" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now perhaps some one, on first hearing this law, may wonder for what possible reason this word  &ldquo;slaves&rdquo; was added in the law against outrage.  But if you reflect on the matter, fellow citizens, you will find this to be the best provision of all.  For it was not for the slaves that the lawgiver was concerned, but he wished to accustom you to keep a long distance away from the crime of outraging free men, and so he added the prohibition against the outraging even of slaves.  In a word, he was convinced that in a democracy that man is unfit for citizenship who outrages any person whatsoever.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="18" type="section"><p>And I beg you, fellow citizens, to remember this also, that here the lawgiver is not yet addressing the person of the boy himself, but those who are near him, father, brother, guardian, teachers, and in general those who have control of him.  But, as soon as the young man has been registered in the list of citizens, and knows the laws of the state, and is now able to distinguish between right and wrong, the lawgiver no longer addresses another, Timarchus, but now the man himself.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="19" type="section"><p>And what does he say?   &ldquo;If any Athenian,&rdquo; he says,  &ldquo;shall have prostituted his person, he shall not be permitted to become one of the nine archons,&rdquo; because, no doubt, that official wears the wreath;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">The myrtle wreath was worn as sign of the sacred character of the office, and it protected the person from assault.</note>&ldquo;nor to discharge the office of priest,&rdquo; as being not even clean of body;   &ldquo;nor shall he act as an advocate for the state,&rdquo; he says,  &ldquo;nor shall ever hold any office whatsoever, at home or abroad,whether filled by lot or by election;  nor shall he be a herald or an ambassador&rdquo;</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="20" type="section"><p>&mdash;nor shall he prosecute men who have served as ambassadors, nor shall he be a hired slanderer&mdash; &ldquo;nor ever address senate or assembly,&rdquo; not even though he be the most eloquent orator in <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>.  And if any one contrary to these prohibitions, the lawgiver has provided for criminal process on the charge of prostitution, and has prescribed the heaviest penalties therefor.  Read to the jury this law also, that you may know, gentlemen, in the face of what established laws of yours, so good and so moral, Timarchus has had the effrontery to speak before the people&mdash;a man whose character is so notorious.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="21" type="section"><p><quote type="Law"><title>Law</title><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&lsqb;If any Athenian shall have prostituted his person, he shall not be permitted to become one of the nine archons, nor to discharge the office of priest, nor to act as an advocate for the state, nor shall he hold any office whatsoever, at home or abroad, whether filled by lot or by election;  he shall not be sent as a herald;  he shall not take part in debate, nor be present at public sacrifices;  when the citizens are wearing garlands, he shall wear none;  and he shall not enter within the limits of the place that has been purified for the assembling of the people.  If any man who has been convicted of prostitution act contrary to these prohibitions, he shall be put to death.&rsqb;</quote></p></div2>
                  <div2 n="22" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>This law was enacted concerning youths who recklessly sin against their own bodies.  The laws relating to boys are those read to you a moment ago;  but I am going to cite now laws that have to do with the citizens at large.  For when the lawgiver had finished with these laws, he next turned to the question of the proper manner of conducting our deliberations concerning the most important matters, when we are met in public assembly.  How does he begin?   &ldquo;Laws,&rdquo; he says,  &ldquo;concerning orderly conduct.&rdquo;  He began with morality, thinking that that state will be best administered in which orderly conduct is most common.  And how does he command the presiding officers to proceed?</p></div2>
            	<div2 n="23" type="section"><p>After the purifying sacrifice has been carried round<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">&ldquo;It was custom at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> to purify the ecclesia, the theatres, and the gatherings of the people in general by the sacrifice of very small pigs, which they named <foreign lang="greek">kaqa/rsia</foreign>.&rdquo;&mdash;Harpocration</note> and the herald has offered the traditional prayers, the presiding officers are commanded to declare to be next in order the discussion of matters pertaining to the national religion, the reception of heralds and ambassadors, and the discussion of secular matters.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">The above interpretation is confirmed by <bibl n="Aristot. Ath. Pol. 43.1">Aristot. Const. Ath. 43.1.29</bibl> f., where we find the same phraseology, evidently that of the law itself.  Heralds, whose person was inviolate even in time of war, were often sent to carry messages from one state to another.  They frequently prepared the way for negotiations to be conducted by ambassadors, appointed for the special occasion.</note> The herald then asks,  &ldquo;Who of those above fifty years of age wishes to address the assembly?&rdquo;  When all these have spoken, he then invites any other Athenian to speak who wishes &lpar;provided such privileges belongs to him&rpar;.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">That is, any citizen who is not disqualified by some loss of civic privilege inflicted as a penalty.  Aeschines has in mind the fact that a man like Timarchus would not have the privilege.</note></p></div2>
                  <div2 n="24" type="section"><p>Consider, fellow citizens, the wisdom of this regulation.  The lawgiver does not forget, I think, that the older men are at their best in the matter of judgment, but that courage is now beginning to fail them as a result of their experience of the vicissitudes of life.  So, wishing to accustom those who are the wisest to speak on public affairs, and to make this obligatory upon them, since he cannot call on each one of them by name, he comprehends them all under the designation of the age-group as a whole, invites them to the platform, and urges them to address the people.  At the same time he teaches the younger men to respect their elders, to yield precedence to them in every act, and to honor that old age to which we shall all come if our lives are spared.</p></div2>
            	<div2 n="25" type="section"><p>And so decorous were those public men of old, Pericles, Themistocles, and Aristeides &lpar;who was called by a name most unlike that by which Timarchus here is called&rpar;, that to speak with the arm outside the cloak, as we all do nowadays as a matter of course, was regarded then as an ill-mannered thing, and they carefully refrained from doing it.  And I can point to a piece of evidence which seems to me very weighty and tangible.  I am sure you have all sailed over to <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName>, and have seen the statue of Solon there.  You can therefore yourselves bear witness that in the statue that is set up in the Salaminian market-place Solon stands with his arm inside his cloak.  Now this is a reminiscence, fellow citizens, and an imitation of the posture of Solon, showing his customary bearing as he used to address the people of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Aristot. Ath. Pol. 28.3">Aristot. Const. Ath. 28.3</bibl>&rpar; says of Cleon:   &ldquo;He was the first to use unseemly shouting and coarse abuse on the Bema, and to harangue the people with his cloak girt up short about him, whereas all his predecessors had spoken decently and in order.  &lpar;<placeName key="tgn,1029705">Kenyon</placeName>'s trans.&rpar;</note></p></div2>
                  <div2 n="26" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>See now, fellow citizens, how unlike to Timarchus were Solon and those men of old whom I mentioned a moment ago.  They were too modest to speak with the arm outside the cloak, but this man not long ago, yes, only the other day, in an assembly of the people threw off his cloak and leaped about like a gymnast, half naked, his body so reduced and befouled through drunkenness and lewdness that right-minded men, at least, covered their eyes, being ashamed for the city, that we should let such men as he be our advisers.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="27" type="section"><p>It was with such conduct as this in view that the lawgiver expressly prescribed who were to address the assembly, and who were not to be permitted to speak before the people.  He does not exclude from the platform the man whose ancestors have not held a general's office, nor even the man who earns his daily bread by working at a trade;  nay, these men he most heartily welcomes, and for this reason he repeats again and again the invitation, &ldquo;Who wishes to address the assembly?&rdquo;</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="28" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Who then are they who in the lawgiver's opinion are not to be permitted to speak?  Those who have lived a shameful life;  these men he forbids to address the people.  Where does he show this?  Under the heading &ldquo;Scrutiny of public men&rdquo;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes"><p>The Athenian <foreign lang="greek">r(h/twr</foreign> was both public speaker and political leader.  The profession was definite and well recognised.  No one English word covers both the political and the oratorical activity of the profession.</p><p>All public officials were required to submit to a fomal scrutiny &lpar;<foreign lang="greek">dokimasi/a</foreign>&rpar; before taking office.  The examining body was usually a law-court;  in the case of the archons it was a court, after a preliminary hearing by the senate;  senators elect appeared before the outgoing senate.  From our passage it appears that a sort of &ldquo;scrutiny&rdquo; might be applied to the men who made politics their profession, without regard to any office for which they might be candidates.</p></note> he says, &ldquo;If any one attempts to speak before the people who beats his father or mother, or fails to support them or to provide a home for them.&rdquo;  Such a man, then, he forbids to speak.  And right he is, by Zeus, say I!  Why?  Because if a man is mean toward those whom he ought to honor as the gods, how, pray, he asks, will such a man treat the members of another household, and how will he treat the whole city?  Whom did he, in the second place, forbid to speak?</p></div2>

Why?  Man, if you fail to take up arms in behalf of the state, or if you are such a coward that you are unable to defend her, you must not claim the right to advise her, either.  Whom does he specify in the third place?  &ldquo;Or the man,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;who has debauched or prostituted himself.&rdquo;  For the man who has made traffic of the shame of his own body, he thought would be ready to sell the common interests of the city also.

                  <div2 n="30" type="section"><p>&ldquo;Or the man,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;who has squandered his patrimony or other inheritance.&rdquo;  For he believed that the man who has mismanaged his own household will handle the affairs of the city in like manner;  and to the lawgiver it did not seem possible that the same man could be a rascal in private life, and in public life a good and useful citizen;  and he believed that the public man who comes to the platform ought to come prepared, not merely in words, but, before all else, in life.</p></div2>

For I remit all the sins that as a boy he committed against his own body;  let all this be treated as were the acts committed in the days of the Thirty, or before the year of Eucleides,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">That is, &ldquo;forgiven and forgotten,&rdquo; as were the crimes of the supporters of the Thirty Tyrants after the restoration of the democracy, in the archonship of Eucleides, 403/2.</note> or whenever else a similar statute of limitations has been passed.  But what he is guilty of having done after he had reached years of discretion, when he was already a youth, and knew the laws of the state, that I will make the object of my accusation, and to that I call uponyou to give serious attention.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="40" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>First of all, as soon as he was past boyhood he settled down in the Peiraeus at the establishment of Euthydicus the physician, pretending to be a student of medicine, but in fact deliberately offering himself for sale, as the event proved.  The names of the merchants or other foreigners, or of our own citizens, who enjoyed the person of Timarchus in those days I will pass over willingly, that no one may say that I am over particular to state every petty detail.  But in whose houses he has lived to the shame of his own body and of the city, earning wages by precisely that thing which the law forbids, under penalty of losing the privilege of public speech, of this I will speak.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="41" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Fellow citizens, there is one Misgolas, son of Naucrates, of the deme Collytus, a man otherwise honorable, and beyond reproach save in this, that he is bent on that sort of thing like one possessed, and is accustomed always to have about him singers or cithara-players.  I say this, not from any liking for indecent talk, but that you may know what sort of man Misgolas is.  Now this Misgolas, perceiving Timarchus' motive in staying at the house of the physician, paid him a sum of money in advance and caused him to change his lodgings, and got him into his own home;  for Timarchus was well developed, young, and lewd, just the person for the thing that Misgolas wanted to do, and Timarchus wanted to have done.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="42" type="section"><p>Timarchus did not hesitate, but submitted to it all, though he had income to satisfy all reasonable desires.  For his father had left him a very large property, which he has squandered, as I will show in the course of my speech.  But he behaved as he did because he was a slave to the most shameful lusts, to gluttony and extravagance at table, to flute-girls and harlots, to dice, and to all those other things no one of which ought to have the mastery over a man who is well-born and free.  And this wretch was not ashamed to abandon his father's house and live with Misgolas, a man who was not a friend of his father's, nor a person of his own age, but a stranger, and older than himself, a man who knew no restraint in such matters, while Timarchus himself was in the bloom of youth.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="43" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Among the many ridiculous things which Timarchus did in those days was one which I wish to relate to you.  The occasion was the procession at the City Dionysia.  Misgolas, who had taken possession of him, and Phaedrus, son of Callias, of the deme Sphettus, were to march in the procession together.  Now Timarchus here had agreed to join them in the procession, but they were busy with their general preparations, and he failed to come back.  Misgolas, provoked at the thing, proceeded to make search for him in company with Phaedrus.  They got word of him and found him at lunch with some foreigners in a lodging-house.  Misgolas and Phaedrus threatened the foreigners and ordered them to follow straight to the lock-up for having corrupted a free youth.  The foreigners were so scared that they dropped everything and ran away as fast as they could go.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="44" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The truth of this story is known to everybody who knew Misgolas and Timarchus in those days.  Indeed, I am very glad that the suit that I am prosecuting is against a man not unknown to you, and known for no other thing than precisely that practice as to which you are going to render your verdict.  For in the case of facts which are not generally known, the accuser is bound, I suppose, to make his proofs explicit;  but where the facts are notorious, I think it is no very difficult matter to conduct the prosecution, for one has only to appeal to the recollection of his hearers.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="45" type="section"><p> owever, although the fact in this case is acknowledged, I remember that we are in court, and so I have drafted an affidavit for Misgolas, true and not indelicate in phrasing, as I flatter myself.  For I do not set down the actual name of the thing that Misgolas used to do to him, nor have I written anything else that would legally incriminate a man who has testified to the truth.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">That is, Misgolas can testify to the truth of the affidavit without thereby testifying to any criminal act of his own.</note> But I have set down what will be no news for you to hear, and will involve the witness in no danger nor disgrace.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="46" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>If therefore Misgolas is willing to come forward here and testify to the truth, he will be doing what is right;  but if he prefers to refuse the summons rather than testify to the truth, the whole business will be made clear to you.  For if the man who did the thing is going to be ashamed of it and choose to pay a thousand drachmas into the treasury rather than show his face before you,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">It is evident from this that when a formal summons to testify in court was refused, a definite fine was inflicted.</note> while the man to whom it has been done is to be a speaker in your assembly, then wise indeed was the lawgiver who excluded such disgusting creatures from the platform. </p></div2>
                  <div2 n="47" type="section"><p> But if Misgolas does indeed answer the summons, but resorts to the most shameless course, denial of the truth under oath, as a grateful return to Timarchus, and a demonstration to the rest of them that he well knows how to help cover up such conduct, in the first place he will damage himself, and in the second place he will gain nothing by it.  For I have prepared another affidavit for those who know that this man Timarchus left his father's house and lived with Misgolas, though it is a difficult thing, no doubt, that I am undertaking.  For I have to present as my witnesses, not friends of mine nor enemies of theirs, nor those who are strangers to both of us, but their friends. </p></div2>
                  <div2 n="48" type="section"><p> But even if they do persuade these men also not to testify&mdash;I do not expect they will, at any rate not all of them&mdash;one thing at least they will never succeed in accomplishing:  they will never hush up the truth, nor blot out Timarchus' reputation among his fellow citizens&mdash;a reputation which he owes to no act of mine, but to his own conduct.  For the life of a virtuous man ought to be so clean that it will not admit even of a suspicion of wrong-doing.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="49" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But I wish to say another thing in anticipation, in case Misgolas shall answer before the laws and before you.  There are men who by nature differ widely from the rest of us as to their apparent age.  For some men, young in years, seem mature and older than they are;  others, old by count of years, seem to be mere youths.  Misgolas is such a man.  He happens, indeed, to be of my own age, and was in the cadet corps with me;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">All Athenian young men were required to undergo military training during the two years following their eighteenth birthday.  The first year they were in garrison at the <placeName key="perseus,Piraeus">Piraeus</placeName>.  At the close of the year, after a public exhibition of their military attainments, they received a shield and spear from the state, and then were sent out for another year to garrison the forts and patrol the borders.</note> we are now in our forty-fifth year.  I am quite gray, as you see, but not he.  Why do I speak of this?  Because I fear that,seeing him for the first time, you may be surprised,and some such thought as this may occur to you:  &ldquo;Heracles!  This man is not much older than Timarchus.&rdquo;  For not only is this youthful appearance characteristic of the man, but moreover Timarchus was already past boyhood when he used to be in his company.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="50" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But not to delay, call first, if you please, those who know that Timarchus here lived in the house of Misgolas, then read the testimony of Phaedrus, and, finally, please take the affidavit of Misgolas himself, in case fear of the gods, and respect for those who know the facts as well as he does, and for the citizens at large and for you the jurors, shall persuade him to testify to the truth.<quote type="Testimony"><title>Testimony</title><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&lsqb;Misgolas, son of Nicias, of <placeName key="perseus,Piraeus">Piraeus</placeName>, testifies.  Timarchus, who once used to stay at the house of Euthydicis the physician, became intimate with me, and I hold him today in the same esteem as in all my past acquaintance with him.&rsqb;</quote></p></div2>
                  <div2 n="51" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now, fellow citizens, if Timarchus here had remained with Misgolas and never gone to another man's house, his conduct would have been more decent&mdash;if really any such conduct is &ldquo;decent&rdquo;&mdash;and I should not have ventured to bring any other charge against him than that which the lawgiver describes in plain words, simply that he was a kept man.  For the man who practises this thing with one person, and practises it for pay, seems to me to be liable to precisely this charge.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="52" type="section"><p> But if, saying nothing about these bestial fellows, Cedonides, Autocleides, and Thersandrus, and simply telling the names of those in whose houses he has been an inmate, I refresh your memories and show that he is guilty of selling his person not only in Misgolas' house, but in the house of another man also, and again of another, and that from this last he went to still another, surely you will no longer look upon him as one who has merely been a kept man, but&mdash;by Dionysus, I don't know how I can keep glossing the thing over all day long&mdash;as a common prostitute.  For the man who follows these practices recklessly and with many men and for pay seems to me to be chargeable with precisely this.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="53" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Well, when now Misgolas found him too expensive and dismissed him, next Anticles, son of Callias, the deme Euonymon, took him up.  Anticles, however, is absent in <placeName key="tgn,7002673">Samos</placeName> as a member of the new colony, so I will pass on to the next incident.  For after this man Timarchus had left Anticles and Misgolas, he did not repent or reform his way of life, but spent his days in the gambling-place, where the gaming-table is set, and cock-fighting and dice-throwing are the regular occupations.  I imagine some of you have seen the place; at any rate you have heard of it. </p></div2>
                  <div2 n="54" type="section"><p> Among the men who spend their time there is one Pittalacus, a slave-fellow who is the property of the city.  He had plenty of money, and seeing Timarchus spending his time thus he took him and kept him in his own house.  This foul wretch here was not disturbed by the fact that he was going to defile himself with a public slave, but thought of one thing only, of getting him to be paymaster for his own disgusting lusts;  to the question of virtue or of shame he never gave a thought.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="55" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now the sins of this Pittalacus against the person of Timarchus, and his abuse of him, as they have come to my ears, are such that, by the Olympian Zeus, I should not dare to repeat them to you.  For the things that he was not ashamed to do in deed, I had rather die than describe to you in words.  But about the same time, while, as I have said, he was staying with Pittalacus, here comes Hegesandrus, back again from the <placeName key="tgn,7002638">Hellespont</placeName>.  I know you are surprised that I have not mentioned him long before this, so notorious is what I am going to relate.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="56" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>This Hegesandrus, whom you know better than I, arrives.  It happened that he had at that time sailed to the <placeName key="tgn,7002638">Hellespont</placeName> as treasurer to the general Timomachus, of the deme Acharnae;  and he returned, having made the most, it is said, of the simple-mindedness of the general, for he had in his possession no less than eighty minas of silver.  Indeed, he proved to be, in a way, largely responsible for the fate of Timomachus.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Between 363 and 359 one Athenian general after another was condemned to death or heavily fined for lack of success in the North.  Timomachus was sent into banishment.</note></p></div2>
                  <div2 n="57" type="section"><p> Hegesandrus, being so well supplied with money, resorted to the house of Pittalacus, who gambled with him;  there he first saw this man Timarchus;  he was pleased with him, lusted after him, and wanted to take him to his own house, thinking, doubtless, that here was a man of his own kidney.  So he first had a talk with Pittalacus, asking him to turn Timarchus over to him.  Failing to persuade him, he appealed to the man himself.  He did not spend many words;  the man was instantly persuaded.  For when it is a question of the business itself, Timarchus shows an openmindedness and a spirit of accommodation that are truly wonderful;  indeed, that is one of the very reasons why he ought to be an object of loathing.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="58" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When now he had left Pittalacus' house and been taken up by Hegesandrus, Pittalacus was enraged, I fancy, at having wasted, as he considered it, so much money, and, jealous at what was going on, he kept visiting the house.  When he was getting to be a nuisance, behold, a mighty stroke on the part of Hegesandrus and Timarchus!  One night when they were drunk they, with certain others, whose names I do not care to mention,</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="59" type="section"><p> burst into the house where Pittalacus was living.  First they smashed the implements of his trade and tossed them into the street&mdash;sundry dice<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Probably the scholiast is right in explaining <foreign lang="greek">a)straga/lous diasei/stous</foreign> &ldquo;shaken astragali,&rdquo; as the gamester's name for a sort of dice.  Perhaps the hearers would understand that they were loaded dice.  Benseler, however, approves Dorville's explanation, that these dice had been many a time before now &ldquo;shaken&rdquo; between Pittalacus and the rascals who are now tossing them into the street.</note> and dice-boxes, and his gaming utensils in general;  they killed the quails and cocks, so well beloved by the miserable man;  and finally they tied Pittalacus himself to the pillar and gave him an inhuman whipping, which lasted until even the neighbors heard the uproar.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="60" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The next day Pittalacus, exceeding angry over the affair, comes without his cloak to the marketplace and seats himself at the altar of the Mother of the Gods.  And when, as always happens, a crowd of people had come running up, Hegesandrus and Timarchus, afraid that their disgusting vices were going to be published to the whole town&mdash;a meeting of the assembly was about to be held&mdash;hurried up to the altar themselves, and some of their gaming-companions with them,</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="61" type="section"><p> and surrounding Pittalacus begged him to get up, saying that the whole thing was only a drunken frolic;  and this man himself, not yet, by Zeus, repulsive to the sight as he is now, but still usable, begged, touching the fellow's chin, and saying he would do anything Pittalacus pleased.  At last they persuaded him to get up from the altar, believing that he was going to receive some measure of justice.  But as soon as he had left the marketplace, they paid no more attention to him.</p></div2>

Here was a man who had done him no wrong, but, quite the opposite, had been wronged by him, a man on whom he had no claim, in fact, a slave belonging to the city;  this man he attempted to enslave to himself, alleging that he was his owner.  Now Pittalacus, reduced to desperate straits, falls in with a man&mdash;a very good man he is&mdash;one Glaucon of the deme Cholargus;  he attempts to rescue Pittalacus and secure his freedom. </p></div2>
                  <div2 n="63" type="section"><p> law-suits were next begun.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Suits between Glaucon and Hegesandrus, who claimed that Pittalacus was a slave of his.</note> As time went on they submitted the matter to the arbitration of Diopeithes of Sunium, a man of Hegesandrus' own deme and one with whom he had had dealings in his younger years.  Diopeithes undertook the case, but put it off again and again in order to favor these parties.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="64" type="section"><p> But when now Hegesandrus was coming before you as a public speaker, being at the same time engaged in his attack on Aristophon of Azenia, an attack which he kept up until Aristophon threatened to institute against him before the people the same process that I have instituted against Timarchus, and when Hegesandrus' brother Crobylus<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Crobylus, &ldquo;Top-knot,&rdquo; was the nickname of Hegesippus, associate of Demosthenes in the anti-Macedonian agitation.

And they came to a settlement.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Amphisthenes testifies to the same effect.  &ldquo;I rescued Pittalacus and secured his freedom, when Hegesandrus was attempting to make him his slave,&rdquo; and so forth.&rsqb;</quote></p></div2>
                  <div2 n="67" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now I will summon Hegesandrus himself for you.  I have written out for him an affidavit that is too respectable for a man of his character, but a little more explicit than the one I wrote for Misgolas.  I am perfectly aware that he will refuse to swear to it, and presently will perjure himself.  Why then do I call him to testify?  That I may demonstrate to you what sort of man this kind of life produces&mdash;how regardless of the gods, how contemptuous of the laws, how indifferent to all disgrace.  Please call Hegesandrus.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">The Clerk of the Court now reads the affidavit, and calls on Hegesandrus to swear to it.  He refuses.</note></p></div2>

When I returned from my voyage to the <placeName key="tgn,7002638">Hellespont</placeName>, I found Timarchus, son of Arizelus, staying at the house of Pittalacus, the gambler.  As a result of this acquaintance I enjoyed the same intimacy with Timarchus as with Leodamas previously.&rsqb;</quote></p></div2>
                  <div2 n="69" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I was sure, fellow citizens, that Hegesandrus would disdain the oath, and I told you so in advance.  This too is plain at once, that since he is not willing to testify now, he will presently appear for the defence.  And no wonder, by Zeus!  For he will come up here to the witness stand, I suppose, trusting in his record, honorable and upright man that he is, an enemy of all evil-doing, a man who does not know who Leodamas was&mdash;Leodamas, at whose name you yourselves raised a shout as the affidavit was being read.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="70" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Shall I yield to the temptation to use language somewhat more explicit than my own self-respect allows?  Tell me, fellow citizens, in the name of Zeus and the other gods, when a man has defiled himself with Hegesandrus, does not that man seem to you to have prostituted himself to a prostitute?  In what excesses of bestiality are we not to imagine them to have indulged when they were drunken and alone!  Don't you suppose that Hegesandrus, in his desire to wipe out his own notorious practices with Leodamas, which are known to all of you, made extravagant demands on the defendant, hoping to make Timarchus' conduct so exceedingly bad that his own earlier behavior would seem to have been modest indeed?</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="71" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And yet you will presently see Hegesandrus and his brother Crobylus leaping to the platform here and most vehemently and eloquently declaring that what I say is all nonsense.  They will demand that I present witnesses to testify explicitly where he did it, how he did it, or who saw him do it, or what sort of an act it was&mdash;a shameless demand, I think.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="72" type="section"><p> For I do not believe your memory is so short that you have forgotten the laws that you heard read a few moments ago, in which it stands written that if anyone hires any Athenian for this act, or if any one lets himself out for hire, he is liable to the most severe penalties, and the same penalties for both offences.  Now what man is so reckless that he would be willing to give in plain words testimony which, if the testimony be true, would inevitably amount to information against himself as liable to extreme punishment?</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="73" type="section"><p> Only one alternative then remains:  that the man who submitted to the act shall acknowledge it.  But he is on trial on precisely this charge, that after such conduct as this, he breaks the laws by speaking before the assembly.  Shall we, then, drop the whole affair,and make no further inquiry?  By Poseidon, a fine home this city will be for us, if when we ourselves know that a thing has been done in fact, we are to ignore it unless some man come forward here and testify to the act in words as explicit as they must be shameless.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="74" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But pray consider the case with the help of illustrations;  and naturally the illustrations will have to be like the pursuits of Timarchus.  You see the men over yonder who sit in the bawdy-houses, men who confessedly pursue the profession.  Yet these persons, brought to such straits as that, do nevertheless make some attempt to cover their shame:  they shut their doors.  Now if, as you are passing along the street, any one should ask you, &ldquo;Pray, what is the fellow doing at this moment?&rdquo; you would instantly name the act, though you do not see it done, and do not know who it was that entered the house;  knowing the profession of the man, you know his act also. </p></div2>
                  <div2 n="75" type="section"><p> In the same way, therefore, you ought to judge the case of Timarchus, and not to ask whether anyone saw, but whether he has done the deed.  For by heaven, Timarchus, what shall a man say?  What would you say yourself about another man on trial on this charge?  What shall we say when a young man leaves his father's house and spends his nights in other people's houses, a conspicuously handsome young man?  When he enjoys costly suppers without paying for them, and keeps the most expensive flutegirls and harlots?  When he gambles and pays nothing himself but another man always pays for him?</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="76" type="section"><p> Does it take a wizard to explain all that?  Is it not perfectly plain that the man who makes such demands must himself necessarily be furnishing in return certain pleasures to the men who are spending their money on him?  I say &ldquo;furnishing pleasures,&rdquo; because, by the Olympian Zeus, I don't know how I can use more euphemistic language than that in referring to your contemptible conduct.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="77" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But also look at the case, if you please, with the help of certain illustrations taken from the field of politics, especially matters which you have in hand just now.  We have been having revisions of the citizen-lists in the demes, and each one of us has submitted to a vote regarding himself to determine whether he is a genuine citizen or not.  Now whenever I am in the court-room listening to the pleas,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">A person whose name was thrown out by the decision of the members of the deme had an appeal to the courts.</note> I see that the same argument always prevails with you:  when the prosecutor says</p></div2>

For I suppose you are of the opinion that when one knows a thing perfectly of his own knowledge, he does not need argument or testimony in addition.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="79" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Come now, in God's name!  if, as on the question of birth, so on the question of these personal habits, Timarchus had to submit to a vote as to whether he is guilty of the charge or not, and the case were being tried in court and were being brought before you as now, except that it were not permitted by constitution or statute either for me to accuse or for him to defend himself, and if this crier who is now standing at my side were putting the question to you in the formula prescribed by law, &ldquo;The hollow ballot for the juror who believes that Timarchus has been a prostitute, the solid ballot for the juror who does not,&rdquo;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Each juror was provided with two small disks, one with a solid stem through the middle, the other with a hollow stem.  The juror who wished to vote for conviction cast the disk with the hollow stem, and vice versa.  The unusual ballot was dropped into another urn.  As the juror came forward with the two disks, one in each hand, the ends of the stem pressed between thumb and forefinger, even the  nearest bystander could not see which disk he cast to be counted, and which he discarded.</note> what would be your vote?  I am absolutely sure that you would decide against him. </p></div2>
                  <div2 n="80" type="section"><p>  Now if one of you should ask me, &ldquo;How do you know that we would vote against him?&rdquo;  I should answer, &ldquo;Because you have spoken out and told me.&rdquo;  And I will remind you when and where each man of you speaks and tells me:  it is every time that Timarchus mounts the platform in the assembly;  and the senate spoke out, when last year he was a member of the senate.  For every time he used such words as &ldquo;walls&rdquo; or &ldquo;tower&rdquo; that needed repairing, or told how so-and-so had been &ldquo;taken off&rdquo; somewhere, you immediately laughed and shouted, and yourselves spoke the words that belong to those exploits of which he, to your knowledge, is guilty.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Fortunately the modern reader is spared a knowledge of the double entente that made the vulgar listeners laugh when a man like Timarchus used the words <foreign lang="greek">tei=xos, pu/rgos</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">a)pa/gein</foreign>.  Probably <foreign lang="greek">pu/rgos</foreign> suggested the women's apartments, and <foreign lang="greek">a)pa/gein</foreign> may have suggested seduction.</note></p></div2>
                  <div2 n="81" type="section"><p>  will pass over the most of these incidents and those which happened long ago, but I do wish to remind you of what took place at the very assembly in which I instituted this process against Timarchus.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">The first step in the process was for Aeschines, at a meeting of the assembly, formally to summon Timarchus to legal scrutiny &lpar;<foreign lang="greek">dokimasi/a</foreign>&rpar; of his right to speak before the people.</note><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Senate of the Areopagus appeared before the people in accordance with the resolution that Timarchus had introduced in the matter of the dwelling-houses on the Pnyx.  The member of the Areopagus who spoke was Autolycus, a man whose life has been good and pious, by Zeus and Apollo, and worthy of that body. </p></div2>
                  <div2 n="82" type="section"><p> Now when in the course of his speech he declared that the Areopagus disapproved the proposition of Timarchus, and said, &ldquo;You must not be surprised, fellow citizens, if Timarchus is better acquainted than the Senate of the Areopagus with this lonely spot and the region of the Pnyx,&rdquo; then you applauded and said Autolycus was right, for Timarchus was indeed acquainted with it.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Evidently the region was a disreputable one, and the houses known as cheap places of ill repute.</note></p></div2>
                  <div2 n="83" type="section"><p> Autolycus, however, did not catch the point of your uproar;  he frowned and stopped a moment;  then he went on:  &ldquo;But, fellow citizens, we members of the Areopagus neither accuse nor defend, for such is not our tradition, but we do make some such allowance as this for Timarchus:  he perhaps,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;thought that where everything is so quiet, there will be but little expense for each of you.&rdquo;  Again, at the words &ldquo;quiet&rdquo; and &ldquo;little expense,&rdquo; he encountered still greater laughter and shouting from you.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Apparently the speaker meant that Timarchus thought that in this time of peace, with its small demands on the treasury, only a light burden would fall on each citizen, if the state should carry out the local improvements proposed, perhaps the clearing away of the disreputable houses from the slope of the hill.</note></p></div2>
                  <div2 n="84" type="section"><p> and when he spoke of the &ldquo;house sites&rdquo; and the &ldquo;tanks&rdquo; you simply couldn't restrain yourselves.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">It is not unlikely that the vulgar crowd made merry over the word <foreign lang="greek">oi)kope/dwn</foreign> as sounding like <foreign lang="greek">o)rxide/dwn</foreign>&lpar;testicles&rpar;, and <foreign lang="greek">la/kkwn</foreign> like <foreign lang="greek">lakkope/dwn</foreign> &lpar;scrota&rpar;.</note> Thereupon Pyrrandrus came forward to censure you, and he asked the people if they were not ashamed of themselves for laughing in the presence of the Senate of the Areopagus.  But you drove him off the platform, replying, &ldquo;We know, Pyrrandrus, that we ought not to laugh in their presence, but so strong is the truth that it prevails&mdash;over all the calculations of men.&rdquo; </p></div2>
                  <div2 n="85" type="section"><p> This, then, I understand to be the testimony that has been offered you by the people of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, and it would not be proper that they should be convicted of giving false testimony.  When I, fellow citizens, say not a word, you of yourselves shout the name of the acts of which you know he is guilty;  strange, then, it would be if when I name them, you cannot remember them;  even had there been no trial of this case, he would have been convicted;  strange indeed then if when the charge has been proved, he is to be acquitted!</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="86" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But since I have mentioned the revision of the lists and the measures proposed by Demophilus,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Demophilus was the author of the proposition to revise the citizen lists.</note> I wish to cite a certain other illustration in this connection.  For this Demophilus had previously brought in a measure of the following sort:  he declared that there were certain men who were attempting to bribe the members of the popular assembly and the courts as well&mdash;the same assertion that Nicostratus also has made very recently.  Some cases under this charge have been in the courts, others are still pending. </p></div2>
                  <div2 n="87" type="section"><p> Come now, in the name of Zeus and the gods, if they had resorted to the same defence that Timarchus and his advocates now offer, and demanded that someone should testify explicitly to the crime, or else that the jurors should refuse to believe the charge, surely according to that demand it would have been absolutely necessary for the one man to testify that he gave a bribe, the other, that he took a bribe, though the law threatens each of them with death precisely as in this case if anyone hires an Athenian for a disgraceful purpose, and again if any Athenian voluntarily hires himself out to the shame of his body. </p></div2>
                  <div2 n="88" type="section"><p> Is there any man who would have testified, or any prosecutor who would have undertaken to present such proof of the act?  Surely not.  What then?  Were the accused acquitted?  No, by Heracles!  They were punished with death, though their crime was far less, by Zeus and Apollo, than that of this defendant;  those poor wretches met such a fate because they were unable to defend themselves against old age and poverty together, the greatest of human misfortunes;  the defendant should suffer it because he is unwilling to restrain his own lewdness.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="89" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now if this trial were taking place in another city, and that city were the referee, I should have demanded that you should be my witnesses, you who best know that I am speaking the truth.  But since the trial is at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, and you are at the same time judges and witnesses of the truth of what I say, it is my place to refresh your memory, and yours not to disbelieve me.  For I think Timarchus' anxiety is not for himself alone, fellow citizens, but for all the others also whose practices have been the same as his. </p></div2>
                  <div2 n="90" type="section"><p> For if in the future, as always in the past, this practice is going to be carried on in secret, and in lonely places and in private houses, and if the man who best knows the facts, but has defiled one of his fellow citizens, is to be liable to the severest punishment if he testifies to the truth, while the man on trial, who has been denounced by the testimony of his own life and of the truth, is to demand that he be judged, not by the facts that are notorious, but by the testimony of witnesses, then the law is done away with, and so is the truth, while a plain path is marked out by which the worst wrongdoers may escape. </p></div2>
                  <div2 n="91" type="section"><p> For what foot-pad or adulterer or assassin, or what man who has committed the greatest crimes, but has done it secretly, will be brought to justice?  For whereas such of these criminals as are caught in the act are instantly punished with death, if they acknowledge the crime, those who have done the act secretly and deny their guilt, are tried in the courts, and the truth can be determined by circumstantial evidence only.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="92" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Take the example of the Senate of the Areopagus, the most scrupulous tribunal in the city.  I myself have before now seen many men convicted before this tribunal, though they spoke most eloquently, and presented witnesses;  and I know that before now certain men have won their case, although they spoke most feebly, and although no witnesses testified for them.  For it is not on the strength of the pleading alone, nor of the testimony alone, that the members of the court give their verdict, but on the strength of their own knowledge and their own investigations.  And this is the reason why that tribunal maintains its high repute in the city. </p></div2>
                  <div2 n="93" type="section"><p> Therefore, my fellow citizens, I call upon you to make your decision in this case in the same manner.  In the first place, let nothing be more credible in your eyes than your own knowledge and conviction regarding this man Timarchus.  In the second place, look at the case in the light, not of the present moment, but of the time that is past.  For the words spoken before today about Timarchus and his practices were spoken because they were true;  but what will be said today will be spoken because of the trial,and with intent to deceive you.  Give, therefore, the verdict that is demanded by the longer time, and the truth, and your own knowledge.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="94" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And yet a certain speech-writer who is concocting his defense<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Aeschines names this speech-writer in <bibl n="Aeschin. 1.119">Aeschin. 1.119</bibl>.</note> says that I contradict myself;  since it seems to him impossible, he says, for the same man to have been a prostitute and to have consumed his patrimony.  For, he says, to have sinned against one's own body is the act of a boy, but to have consumed one's patrimony is that of a man.  And furthermore he says that those who defile themselves exact pay for it.  He therefore goes up and down the marketplace expressing his wonder and amazement that one and the same man should have prostituted himself and also have consumed his patrimony.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="95" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now if anyone does not understand the facts of the case, I will try to explain them more clearly.  Hegesandrus, who kept Timarchus, had married an heiress.  So long as her inheritance held out, and the money that Hegesandrus had brought back with him from his voyage with Timomachus, they lived in all luxury and lewdness.  But when these resources had been wasted and gambled away and eaten up, and this defendant had lost his youthful charm, and, as you would expect, no one would any longer give him anything, while his lewd and depraved nature constantly craved the same indulgences, and with excessive incontinence kept making demand after demand upon him,</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="96" type="section"><p> then, at last, incessantly drawn back to his old habits, he resorted to the devouring of his patrimony.  And not only did he eat it up, but, if one may so say, he also drank it up!  He sold one piece of property after another, not for what it was worth&mdash;he couldn't wait for a higher offer nor even for the bare value, but let it go for what it would fetch on the instant, so urgently did he hasten to gratify his lusts.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="97" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>His father left him a fortune which another man would have found sufficient for the service of the state also.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Such a fortune would have been enough to enable the ordinary man to perform the special honorable services demanded of rich citizens, to be trierarch, choregus, etc.</note> But Timarchus was not able even to preserve it for himself.  There was a house south of the Acropolis, a suburban estate at Sphettus, another piece of land at <placeName key="perseus,Alopeke">Alopeke</placeName>, and besides there were nine or ten slaves who were skilled shoemakers, each of whom paid him a fee of two obols a day, and the superintendent of the shop three obols.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Masters sometimes allowed their slaves to buy their time at so much per day;  this fee was called <foreign lang="greek">a)pofora/</foreign>.

Certain men also owed him money, and there were house furnishings.</p></div2>

But even from this spot he did not withhold his hand;  this too he sold, for 2,000 drachmas.  Of the slaves, men and women, he left not one;  he has sold them all.

Of these, Eupolemus was the first to die, before the estate had been divided;  next, Arizelus, the father of Timarchus.  So long as Arizelus lived, he managed the whole estate, because of the ill-health of Arignotus and the trouble with his eyes, and because Eupolemus was dead.  By agreement with Arignotus he regularly gave him a sum of money for his support. </p></div2>
            	<div2 n="103" type="section"><p> then Arizelus, the father of the defendant Timarchus, died also.

But after Timarchus was enrolled in the citizens' list, and had come into control of the estate, he thrust aside this old and unfortunate man, his own uncle, and made way with the estate.  He gave nothing to Arignotus for his support, but was content to see him, fallen from such wealth, now receiving the alms that the city gives to disabled paupers.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">&ldquo;The Senate also examines the infirm paupers.

Two points of my plea remain, and I pray to all the gods and goddesses that I may be enabled to speak regarding them as I have planned to do, for the public good;  and I should like you to give attention to what I am about to say, and to follow me with willing mind.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="117" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The first of these points is an anticipation of the defence which I hear he is about to offer, for I fear that if I neglect this topic, that man who professes to teach the young the tricks of speech<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">The reference is to Demosthenes, who, we must from this statement conclude, was in his earlier years a professional teacher of rhetoric, as well as a lawyer and politician.</note> may mislead you by some artifice, and so defraud the state.  My second point is an exhortation of the citizens to virtue.  And I see many young men present in court, and many of their elders, and not a few citizens of other states of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>, gathered here to listen.  Do not imagine that they have come to look at me. </p></div2>
                  <div2 n="118" type="section"><p> Nay, rather have they come to find out about you, whether you not only know how to make good laws, but also are able to distinguish between good conduct and bad;  whether you know how to honor good men;  and whether you are willing to punish those who make their own life a reproach to the city.  I will first speak to you about the defence.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="119" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The eminent orator Demosthenes says that you must either wipe out your laws, or else no attention must be paid to my words.  For he is amazed, he says, if you do not all remember that every single year the senate farms out the tax on prostitutes, and that the men who buy this tax do not guess, but know precisely, who they are that follow this profession.  When, therefore, I have dared to bring impeachment against Timarchus for having prostituted himself, in order that I may deprive him of the right to address the people in assembly, Demosthenes says that the very act complained of calls, not for an accuser's arraignment, but for the testimony of the tax-gatherer who collected this tax from Timarchus.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="120" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now, fellow citizens, see whether the reply that I make seems to you frank and straightforward.  For I am ashamed in the city's behalf, if Timarchus,the counsellor of the people, the man who dares to go out into <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName> on their embassies, if this man, instead of undertaking to clear his record of the whole matter, shall ask us to specify the localities where he plied his trade, and to say whether the tax collectors have ever collected the prostitutes' licence from him. </p></div2>
                  <div2 n="121" type="section"><p> For your sakes pray let him give up such defence as that!  But I myself will suggest to you, Timarchus, a different line of defence, which is honorable and fair, and you will adopt it, if you are conscious of having done nothing shameful.  Come, dare to look the jury in the face and say that which a decent man ought to say of his youth:   &ldquo;Fellow citizens, I have been brought up as boy and youth among you;  how I have spent my time is no secret to you, and you see me with you in your assemblies. </p></div2>
                  <div2 n="122" type="section"><p> Now if I were defending myself before any other set of men on the charge on which I stand accused, I think your testimony would readily suffice to refute the words of my accuser.  For if any such act has been committed by me, nay rather if my life has exhibited to you even any resemblance to that of which he accuses me, I feel that the rest of my life is not worth living;  I freely concede you my punishment, that the state may have therein a defence in the eyes of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>.  I have not come here to beg for mercy from you;  nay, do with me what you will, if you believe that I am such a man as that.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>This, Timarchus, is the defence of a good and decent man, a man who has confidence in his past life, and who with good reason looks with contempt upon all efforts to slander him. </p></div2>
                  <div2 n="123" type="section"><p> But the defence which Demosthenes persuades you to make is not for a free man, but for a prostitute&mdash;quibbling about when and where!  But since you do take refuge in the names of the lodgings, demanding that in our proof we specify every single house where you plied your trade, to such an argument as that you will never again resort, if you are wise, when you have heard what I am about to say.  For it is not the lodgings and the houses which give their names to the men who have lived in them, but it is the tenants who give to the places the names of their own pursuits. </p></div2>
                  <div2 n="124" type="section"><p> Where, for example, several men hire one house and occupy it, dividing it between them, we call it an  &ldquo;apartment house,&rdquo; but where one man only dwells, a  &ldquo;house.&rdquo;  And if perchance a physician moves into one of these shops on the street, it is called a  &ldquo;surgery.&rdquo;  But if he moves out and a smith moves into this same shop, it is called a  &ldquo;smithy&rdquo;;  if a fuller, a  &ldquo;laundry&rdquo;;  if a carpenter, a  &ldquo;carpenter's shop&rdquo;;  and if a pimp and his harlots, from the trade itself it gets its name of  &ldquo;brothel.&rdquo;  So that you have made many a house a brothel by the facility with which you have plied your profession.  Ask not, then, where it was that you practised it, but make this your defence, that you have never done the thing.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="125" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But it seems that we are to have another argument, too, concocted by the same sophist.

He says first<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Some of Aeschines' anticipations of the arguments of his opponents would be possible in the preparation of his speech for the court-room;  others were probably added to the speech as prepared for publication, after the speeches for the defence had been heard.

Again, that the herm called  &ldquo;the Herm of Andocides&rdquo; is not that of Andocides, but a votive offering of the tribe Aegeis. </p></div2>
                  <div2 n="126" type="section"><p> and Demosthenes by way of a jest presents himself as an example, for he poses as a man who knows how to indulge in pleasantries and to joke about his own manner of life.   &ldquo;Unless,&rdquo; he says,  &ldquo;I am to answer to the name when the crowd call me, not Demosthenes, but &lsquo;Batalus,&rsquo; just because I got that nickname from my nurse, as my baby-name.&rdquo;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">On the nickname, see <bibl n="Aeschin. 2.99">Aeschin. 2.99</bibl>.</note> And  he says that if Timarchus did develop into a handsome youth, and if he is jeered at through slanderous interpretation of that fact, and not because of his own actions, surely he ought not for that reason to fall into misfortune.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="127" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But, Demosthenes, in the case of votive offerings, houses, estates, and all dumb objects in general, I do indeed hear many names applied, ever changing, never twice the same;  for in them are no actions good or bad, but the man who happens to have become connected with them, whoever he may be, gives them a name according to the greatness of his own reputation.  But in the case of the life and conduct of men, a common report which is unerring does of itself spread abroad throughout the city;  it causes the private deed to become matter of public knowledge, and many a time it even prophesies what is about to be. </p></div2>
                  <div2 n="128" type="section"><p> to manifest and so far from being fabricated is this statement of mine, that you will find that both our city and our forefathers dedicated an altar to Common Report, as one of the greatest gods;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">The scholiast tells us that this altar was dedicated to commemorate news of a victory of Cimon's in <placeName key="tgn,7002611">Pamphylia</placeName>, received at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> the day the battle was fought.  <bibl n="Paus. 1.17.1">Paus. 1.17.1</bibl>&rpar; attests the existence of the altar.</note> and you will find that Homer again and again in the <title>Iliad</title> says, of a thing that has not yet come to pass,  &ldquo;Common Report came to the host;&rdquo;  and again you will find Euripides declaring that this god is able not only to make known the living, revealing their true characters, but the dead as well, when he says,  &ldquo;Common Report shows forth the good man, even though he be in the bowels of the earth;&rdquo; </p></div2>
                  <div2 n="129" type="section"><p> and Hesiod expressly represents her as a goddess, speaking in words that are very plain to those who are willing to understand, for he says,  &ldquo;But Common Report dies never, the voice that tongues of many men do utter.

For all who are ambitious for honor from their fellows believe that it is from good report that fame will come to them.  But men whose lives are shameful pay no honor to this god, for they believe that in her they have a deathless accuser. </p></div2>
                  <div2 n="130" type="section"><p> Call to mind, therefore, fellow citizens, what common report you have been accustomed to hear in the case of Timarchus.

But, I think, so long as the boy is not his own master and is as yet unable to discern who is a genuine friend, and who is not, the law teaches the lover self-control, and makes him defer the words of friendship till the other is older and has reached years of discretion;  but to follow after the boy and to watch over him the lawgiver regarded as the best possible safeguard and protection for chastity. </p></div2>
                  <div2 n="140" type="section"><p> and so it was that those benefactors of the state, Harmodius and Aristogeiton, men pre-eminent for their virtues, were so nurtured by that chaste and lawful love&mdash;or call it by some other name than love if you like&mdash;and so disciplined, that when we hear men praising what they did, we feel that words are inadequate to the eulogy of their deeds.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="141" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But since you make mention of Achilles and Patroclus, and of Homer and the other poets&mdash;as though the jury were men innocent of education, while you are people of a superior sort, who feel yourselves quite beyond common folks in learning&mdash;that you may know that we too have before now heard and learned a little something, we shall say a word about this also.  For since they undertake to cite wise men, and to take refuge in sentiments expressed in poetic measures, look, fellow citizens, into the works of those who are confessedly good and helpful poets, and see how far apart they considered chaste men, who love their like, and men who are wanton and overcome by forbidden lusts. </p></div2>
                  <div2 n="142" type="section"><p> I will speak first of Homer, whom we rank among the oldest and wisest of the poets.  Although he speaks in many places of Patroclus and Achilles, he hides their love and avoids giving a name to their friendship, thinking that the exceeding greatness of their affection is manifest to such of his hearers as are educated men. </p></div2>
                  <div2 n="143" type="section"><p> For Achilles says somewhere in the course of his lament for the death of Patroclus, as recalling one of the greatest of sorrows, that unwillingly he has broken the promise he had given to Menoetius, the father of Patroclus;  for he had promised to bring his son back safe to Opus, if he would send him along with him to <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, and entrust him to his care.  It is evident from this that it was because of love that he undertook to take care of him. </p></div2>

And with such nobility of soul did he hasten to take vengeance on the man who slew his friend, that when all tried to comfort him and urged him to bathe and take food, he swore that he would do none of these things until he had brought the head of Hector to the grave of Patroclus. </p></div2>
                  <div2 n="146" type="section"><p> And when he was sleeping by the funeral pyre, as the poet says, the ghost of Patroclus stood before him, and stirred such memories and laid upon Achilles such injunctions, that one may well weep, and envy the virtue and the friendship of these men.

                  <div2 n="153" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Examine the sentiments, fellow citizens, which the poet expresses.  He says that before now he has been made judge of many cases, as you today are jurors;  and he says that he makes his decisions, not from what the witnesses say, but from the habits and associations of the accused;  he looks at this, how the man who is on trial conducts his daily life, and in what manner he administers his own house, believing that in like manner he will administer the affairs of the state also;  and he looks to see with whom he likes to associate.  And, finally, he does not hesitate to express the opinion that a man is like those whose  &ldquo;company he loves to keep.&rdquo;  It is right, therefore, that in judging Timarchus you follow the reasoning of Euripides. </p></div2>
                  <div2 n="154" type="section"><p> How has he administered his own property?  He has devoured his patrimony, he has consumed all the wages of his prostitution and all the fruits of his bribery, so that he has nothing left but his shame.  With whom does he love to be?  Hegesandrus!  And what are Hegesandrus' habits?  The habits that exclude a man by law from the privilege of addressing the people.  What is it that I say against Timarchus, and what is the charge that I have brought?  That Timarchus addresses the people, a man who has made himself a prostitute and has consumed his patrimony.  And what is the oath that you have taken?  To give your verdict on the precise charges that are presented by the prosecution.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="155" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But not to dwell too long on the poets, I will recite to you the names of older and well-known men, and of youths and boys, some of whom have had many lovers because of their beauty, and some of whom, still in their prime, have lovers today, but not one of whom ever came under the same accusations as Timarchus.  Again, I will tell over to you in contrast men who have prostituted themselves shamefully and notoriously, in order that by calling these to mind you may place Timarchus where he belongs. </p></div2>
                  <div2 n="156" type="section"><p> First I will name those who have lived the life of free and honorable men.  You know, fellow citizens, Crito, son of Astyochus, Pericleides of Perithoedae, Polemagenes, Pantaleon, son of Cleagoras, and Timesitheus the runner, men who were the most beautiful, not only among their fellow citizens, but in all <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>, men who counted many a man of eminent chastity as lover;  yet no man ever censured them. </p></div2>
                  <div2 n="157" type="section"><p> and again, among the youths and those who are still boys, first, you know the nephew of Iphicrates, the son of Teisias of Rhamnos, of the same name as the defendant.  He, beautiful to look upon, is so far from reproach, that the other day at the rural Dionysia when the comedies were being played in Collytus, and when Parmenon the comic actor addressed a certain anapaestic verse to the chorus, in which certain persons were referred to as  &ldquo;big Timarchian prostitutes,&rdquo; nobody thought of it as aimed at the youth, but, one and all, as meant for you, so unquestioned is your title to the practice.  Again, Anticles, the stadium runner, and Pheidias,the brother of Melesias.  Although I could name many others, I will stop, lest I seem to be in a way courting their favor by my praise.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="158" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But as to those men who are kindred spirits with Timarchus, for fear of arousing their enmity I will mention only those toward whom I am utterly indifferent.  Who of you does not know Diophantes, called  &ldquo;the orphan,&rdquo; who arrested the foreigner and brought him before the archon, whose associate on the bench was Aristophon of Azenia?<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">The archon eponymus is meant.  When sitting as president of a court he was assisted by two advisers, <foreign lang="greek">pa/redroi</foreign>.</note> For Diophantes accused the foreigner of having cheated him out of four drachmas in connection with this practice, and he cited the laws that command the archon to protect orphans, when he himself had violated the laws that enjoin chastity.  Or what Athenian was not indignant at Cephisodorus, called Molon's son, for having ruined his surpassing beauty by a most infamous life?  Or Mnesitheus, known as the cook's son?  Or many others, whose names I am willing to forget? </p></div2>
                  <div2 n="159" type="section"><p> For I have no desire to tell over the whole list of them one by one in a spirit of bitterness.  Nay, rather I could wish that I might be at a loss for such examples in my speech, for I love my city.  But since we have selected for special mention a few from each of the two classes, on the one side men who have been loved with a chaste love, and on the other men who sin against themselves, now let me ask you this question, and pray answer me:  To which class do you assign Timarchus&mdash;to those who are loved, or to those who are prostitutes?  You see, Timarchus, you are not to be permitted to desert the company which you have chosen and go over to the ways of free men. </p></div2>
                  <div2 n="160" type="section"><p> But if they shall undertake to say that no man has been a prostitute unless he was hired under contract, and if they demand that I produce writings and witnesses, I ask you first to call to mind the laws concerning prostitution;  in them the lawgiver has nowhere made mention of contracts, for he did not inquire whether it was by contract that a person had defiled himself, but in comprehensive terms, no matter how the deed is done, he commands that the man who did it shall take no part in public affairs.  And he is right;  for the man who in his youth was led by shameful indulgence to surrender honorable ambition, that man, he believed, ought not in later life to be possessed of the citizen's privileges. </p></div2>
                  <div2 n="161" type="section"><p> In the second place, it is easy to demonstrate the folly of this plea.  For we should all acknowledge this, that we enter into contracts because we do not trust one another, the object being that the party who has not violated the written terms may receive satisfaction by verdict of the courts from the one who has.  If, therefore, this business needs the help of the courts, those who have served as prostitutes by contract, in case they are wronged, have left them, according to the argument of the defendants, recourse to the protection of the laws.  And what would be the plea that either side would advance?  Imagine the case, not as something that I am telling you, but as going on before your eyes.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="162" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Assume that the man who hired the other is in the right as regards the fact and the man who was hired is in the wrong and has no ground to stand on;  or assume the opposite, that the man who was hired is fair and fulfils his engagement, but the man who has plucked the flower of his youth and hired him has broken his word;  then imagine that you yourselves are sitting as jury.  Now the elder man, when his time allowance and the right to speak are given him,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Each speaker was given a definite time allowance, measured by the water-clock;  hence the expression, <foreign lang="greek">a)podoqe/ntos tou= u(/datos</foreign>, &ldquo;when the water is given him.&rdquo;</note> will press his accusation vigorously, and looking, of course, into your faces, he will say,</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="163" type="section"><p> &ldquo;Fellow citizens, I hired Timarchus to serve me as a prostitute according to the contract that is deposited with Demosthenes&rdquo;&mdash;there is no reason why that statement might not be made!&mdash;&rdquo;but he fails to carry out his engagement with me.&rdquo;  And now, of course, he proceeds to describe this engagement to the jury, telling what it is that a man of that sort is expected to do.  Thereupon will not the man be stoned who has hired an Athenian contrary to the laws, and will he not leave the court-room not only sentenced to pay his fine,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">In certain classes of private suits, if the plaintiff failed to receive one-fifth of the votes of the jury, he had to pay to the defendant one-sixth of the sum for which he had sued &lpar;one obol in the drachma &lpar;&equals; six obols&rpar;, hence the name <foreign lang="greek">e)pwbeli/a</foreign>&rpar;.</note> but also convicted of wanton outrage?</p></div2>

For who will not say,  &ldquo;And then do you thrust yourself into the market-place, do you put on a garland,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">See the note on <bibl n="Aeschin. 1.19">Aeschin. 1.19</bibl>.</note> do you attempt to do anything else that the rest of us do?&rdquo;  His contract, you see, is of no use to him.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="165" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now let me tell you how it happens that it has become the prevailing custom to say, that persons have in the past become prostitutes  &ldquo;under written contract.&rdquo;  One of our citizens &lpar;I will not name him, for I have no desire to make myself hated&rpar;, foreseeing none of the consequences which I have just described to you, is said to have served as prostitute according to a contract deposited with Anticles.  Now, since he was not a private citizen, but active in politics and subject to scurrilous attack, he caused the city to become accustomed to this expression, and that is the reason why some men ask whether in a given case the practice has been  &ldquo;by written contract.&rdquo;  But the lawgiver did not care how the thing was brought about;  on the contrary, if there is a letting for hire in any way whatsoever, the man who does the deed is condemned by him to disgrace.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="166" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But nevertheless, although all this is so plainly defined, many irrelevant arguments will be invented by Demosthenes.  Possibly, when he sticks to his subject, we might be less indignant with him for the animosity he shows;  but when, to the injury of our national rights, he foists in matters that do not belong to the case, then one may well be angry.  Philip will be largely in evidence, and the name of Philip's son Alexander is going to be mixed up in it.  For in addition to all the rest that is bad in him, this Demosthenes is an ill-mannered and boorish sort of person. </p></div2>
                  <div2 n="167" type="section"><p> His offensive talk against Philip is foolish and out of place, but not so serious a mistake as that which I am about to mention.  For confessedly he will be making his slanderous charges against a man&mdash;he who is himself no man.

                  <div2 n="168" type="section"><p> For, under the impression that he is hurting me with reference to the accounting which I am about to render for my service on the embassy,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">See the Introduction to <bibl n="Aeschin. 2">Aeschin. 2</bibl>.</note> he says that when the other day he himself was describing the boy Alexander, telling how at a certain banquet of ours he played the cithara, reciting certain passages in which there were thrusts at another boy, and when he reported to the senate what he himself happened to know about the incident, I got angry at his jests at the expense of the boy,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">The words of double meaning that Aeschines says Demosthenes applied to the boy Alexander would be connected with the story of this  &ldquo;playing&rdquo; and  &ldquo;reciting.&rdquo;</note> as though I were not merely a member of the embassy, but one of the boy's own family. </p></div2>
                  <div2 n="169" type="section"><p> Now I naturally have had no conversation with Alexander, because of his youth, but Philip I do praise now because of his auspicious words, and if in what he does toward us in the future he shall fulfil the promise of what he now says, he will make praise of him a safe and easy thing.  I did, indeed, rebuke Demosthenes in the senate-chamber, not because I was counting the favor of the boy, but because I felt that if you should listen to such words as his, the city would show itself as ill-behaved as the speaker.</p></div2>

Demosthenes, after he had spent his patrimony, went up and down the city, hunting rich young fellows whose fathers were dead, and whose mothers were administering their property.

If you do that, you will not fail of respect, and you will have the same sentiments when you are called to enforce laws that you had when you made them;  but if you do otherwise, it will appear that when crimes are about to be committed, you foresee them and are angry, but after they have been committed, you no longer care.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="177" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>To sum it all up, if you punish the wrongdoers, your laws will be good and valid;  but if you let them go, good laws, indeed, but valid no longer.  And I shall not hesitate to speak out and tell you why I say this.  I will explain by means of an illustration.  Why do you suppose it is, fellow citizens, that the existing laws are good, but that the decrees of the city are inferior to them,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">A law &lpar;<foreign lang="greek">no/mos</foreign>&rpar; could be enacted or amended only by a special legislative commission, by an elaborate process, under careful precautions, at a fixed time in the civil year.

                  <div2 n="178" type="section"><p> I will explain to you the reason.  It is because you enact the laws with no other object than justice, not moved by unrighteous gain, or by either partiality or animosity, looking solely to what is just and for the common good.  And because you are, as I think, naturally, more clever than other men, it is not surprising that you pass most excellent laws.  But in the meetings of the assembly and in the courts, you oftentimes lose all hold of the discussion of the matter in hand, and are led away by deceit and trickery;  and you admit into your cases at law a custom that is utterly unjust, for you allow the defendants to bring counter accusations against the complainants. </p></div2>
                  <div2 n="179" type="section"><p> and when you have been drawn away from the defence itself, and your minds have become intent on other things, you forget the accusation entirely, and leave the court-room without having received satisfaction from either party&mdash;not from the complainant, for you are given no opportunity to vote with reference to him, and not from the defendant, for by his extraneous charges he has brushed aside the original complaints against himself, and gone out of court scot-free.  Thus the laws are losing their force, the democracy is being undermined, and the custom is steadily gaining ground.  For you sometimes thoughtlessly listen to mere talk that is unsupported by a good life.</p></div2>

                  <div2 n="2" type="section"><p> and it was not anger that made him say it; for no man who is lying is angry with the victim of his calumny, nor do men who are speaking the truth try to prevent the defendant from obtaining a hearing; for the prosecution does not find justification in the minds of the hearers until the defendant has had opportunity to plead for himself and has proved unable to refute the charges that have been preferred.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="3" type="section"><p> But Demosthenes, I think, is not fond of fair argument, nor is that the sort of preparation he has made.  No, it is your anger that he is determined to call forth.  And he has accused me of receiving bribes&mdash;he who would be the last man to make such suspicion credible!  For the man who seeks to arouse the anger of his hearers over bribery must himself refrain from such conduct.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="4" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But, fellow citizens, as I have listened to Demosthenes' accusation, the effect upon my own mind has been this:  never have I been so apprehensive as on this day, nor ever more angry than now, nor so exceedingly rejoiced.  I was frightened, and am still disturbed, lest some of you form a mistaken judgment of me, beguiled by those antitheses of his, conceived in deliberate malice.

                  <div2 n="5" type="section"><p> To you I do, indeed, give praise and high esteem for putting your faith in the life of those who are on trial, rather than in the accusations of their enemies; however, I would not myself shrink from defending myself against this charge.  For if there is any man among those who are standing outside the bar&mdash;and almost the whole city is in the court&mdash;or if there is any man of you, the jurors, who is convinced that I have ever perpetrated such an act, not to say towards a free person, but towards any creature, I hold my life as no longer worth the living.  And if as my defence proceeds I fail to prove that the accusation is false, and that the man who dared to utter it is an impious slanderer, then, even though it be clear that I am innocent of all the other charges, I declare myself worthy of death.</p></div2>

Then it was, and not till then, that Philocrates of Hagnus offered a motion, which was passed by unanimous vote of the people that Philip be allowed to send to us a herald and ambassadors to treat for peace.

So Aristodemus the actor is sent as envoy to Philip, as being an acquaintance of his, and of a profession that naturally wins friends.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="16" type="section"><p> But when Aristodemus returned from his mission, his report to the senate was delayed by certain business of his, and meanwhile Iatrocles came back from <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, released by Philip without ransom.

This he said not only before the senate, but also at an assembly of the people.

                  <div2 n="18" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Next Philocrates moved that ten ambassadors be chosen to go to Philip and discuss with him both the question of peace and the common interests of the Athenians and Philip.

To prove the truth of this, take, if you please, the decrees, and read the deposition of Aristodemus, and call the witnesses before whom the deposition was made, in order that the jury may know who was the good friend of Philocrates, and who it was that promised to persuade the people to bestow the rewards on Aristodemus.<quote type="Decrees"><title>Decrees</title></quote><quote type="Deposition"><title>Deposition</title></quote></p></div2>

But the whole story was a fabrication; for how could I have urged Demosthenes against Philocrates, when I knew that he had been Philocrates' advocate in the suit against the legality of his motion, and that he had been nominated to the embassy by Philocrates?</p></div2>

Alexander succeeded his father, but after a short reign he was assassinated.  His mother Eurydice with her paramour Ptolemaeus took the throne.  Her power was threatened by Pausanias, a member of a rival princely house.</note> an exile then, but favoured by opportunity and the support of many of the people, and bringing a Greek force with him, and when he had already seized Anthemon, <placeName key="tgn,7011182">Therma</placeName>, Strepsa, and certain other places, at a time when the Macedonians were not united, but most of them favoured Pausanias: at this crisis the Athenians elected Iphicrates as their general to go against <placeName key="perseus,Amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName>&mdash;for at that time the people of Amphipolis were holding their city themselves and enjoying the products of the land.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="28" type="section"><p> When Iphicrates had come into this region&mdash;with a few ships at first, for the purpose of examining into the situation rather than of laying siege to the city&mdash; &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said I,  &ldquo;your mother Eurydice sent for him, and according to the testimony of all who were present, she put your brother Perdiccas into the arms of Iphicrates, and set you upon his knees&mdash;for you were a little boy&mdash;and said, &lsquo;Amyntas, the father of these little children, when he was alive, made you his son,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Amyntas, hard pressed by his Illyrian and Thessalian neighbors, had at one time been driven from his throne by a rival prince.

It is conjectured that this was the occasion of his adoption of the Athenian Iphicrates, one of the most capable leaders of mercenary troops.</note> and enjoyed the friendship of the city of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>; we have a right therefore to consider you in your private capacity a brother of these boys, and in your public capacity a friend to us.&rsquo;</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="29" type="section"><p> After this she at once began to make earnest entreaty in your behalf and in her own, and for the maintenance of the throne&mdash;in a word for full protection.  When Iphicrates had heard all this, he drove Pausanias out of <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> and preserved the dynasty for you.&rdquo;  Next I spoke about Ptolemaeus, who had been made regent, telling what an ungrateful and outrageous thing he had done:  I explained how in the first place he continually worked against our city in the interest of <placeName key="perseus,Amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName>, and when we were in controversy with the Thebans, made alliance with them; and then how Perdiccas, when he came to the throne, fought for <placeName key="perseus,Amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName> against our city.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="30" type="section"><p> And I showed that, wronged as you were, you maintained your friendly attitude; for I told how, when you had conquered Perdiccas in the war, under the generalship of Callisthenes, you made a truce with him, ever expecting to receive some just return.  And I tried to remove the ill feeling that was connected with this affair by showing that it was not the truce with Perdiccas that led the people to put Callisthenes to death, but other causes.  And again I did not hesitate to complain of Philip himself, blaming him for having taken up in his turn the war against our state.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="31" type="section"><p> As proof of all my statements, I offered the letters of the persons in question, the decrees of the people, and Callisthenes' treaty of truce.  Now the facts about our original acquisition both of the district and of the place called Ennea Hodoi,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Ennea Hodoi &lpar; &ldquo;Nine Roads&rdquo;&rpar; was the old name of the place colonized by the Athenians in 436 under the name of <placeName key="perseus,Amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName>.</note> and the story of the sons of Theseus, one of whom, Acamas, is said to have received this district as the dowry of his wife&mdash;all this was fitting to the occasion then, and was given with the utmost exactness, but now I suppose I must be brief; but those proofs which rested, not on the ancient legends, but on occurrences of our own time, these also I called to mind.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="32" type="section"><p> For at a congress<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">The   &ldquo;Congress of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>,&rdquo; 371 b.c.</note> of the Lacedaemonian allies and the other Greeks, in which Amyntas, the father of Philip, being entitled to a seat, was represented by a delegate whose vote was absolutely under his control, he joined the other Greeks in voting to help <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> to recover possession of <placeName key="perseus,Amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName>.  As proof of this I presented from the public records the resolution of the Greek congress and the names of those who voted.</p></div2>

But if you argue that it is right for you to keep the place because you took it in war, if it is true that it was a war against us in which you took the city, you do hold it justly, by right of conquest; but if it was from the Amphipolitans that you took a city which belonged to the Athenians, it is not the property of the Amphipolitans that you are holding, but territory of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>.&rdquo;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes"><placeName key="perseus,Amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName> was founded as a colony of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> in 436, and became one of the most important cities on the northern coast.  The Spartans seized it early in the Peloponnesian war, and held it till the close of the war.  They then renounced their claim to it, but the people of the city themselves refused to return to Athenian allegiance.  Repeated expeditions were sent out by the Athenians to retake the city, but without success.  One of Philip's first acts was to seize <placeName key="perseus,Amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName>.  It was claimed at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> that he had promised, if given a free hand, to restore the place to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>; but this he refused to do, and so began the first war between <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> and Philip.  The Athenian claim to the city was therefore one of the most important matters to be presented by the ambassadors whose mission Aeschines is here describing.</note></p></div2>
                  <div2 n="34" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now when I had said this and more beside, at last came Demosthenes' turn to speak.  All were intent, expecting to hear a masterpiece of eloquence.  For, as we learned afterwards, his extravagant boasting had been reported to Philip and his court.  So when all were thus prepared to listen, this creature mouthed forth a proem&mdash;an obscure sort of thing and as dead as fright could make it; and getting on a little way into the subject he suddenly stopped speaking and stood helpless; finally he collapsed completely.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="35" type="section"><p> Philip saw his plight and bade him take courage, and not to think, as though he were an actor on the stage, that his collapse was an irreparable calamity, but to keep cool and try gradually to recall his speech, and speak it off as he had prepared it.  But he, having been once upset, and having forgotten what he had written, was unable to recover himself; nay, on making a second attempt, he broke down again.  Silence followed; then the herald bade us withdraw.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="36" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now when we were by ourselves, our worthy colleague Demosthenes put on an exceedingly sour face and declared that I had ruined the city and the allies.  And when not only I, but all the rest of the ambassadors were amazed, and asked him his reason for saying that, he asked me if I had forgotten the situation at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, and if I did not remember that the people were worn out and exceedingly anxious for peace.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="37" type="section"><p> &ldquo;Or does your confidence rest,&rdquo; said he,  &ldquo;on those fifty ships that have been voted but are never going to be manned?  You have so exasperated Philip by the speech you have made that the effect of it could not possibly be to make peace out of war, but implacable war out of peace!&rdquo;  I was just beginning to answer him, when the attendants summoned us.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="38" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When we had come in and taken our seats, Philip began at the beginning and undertook to make some sort of answer to every argument which we had advanced.  Naturally he dwelt especially on my argument, for I think I may fairly say that I had omitted nothing that could be said; and again and again he mentioned my name in the course of his argument.  But in reply to Demosthenes, who had made such a laughing.stock of himself, not one word was said on a single point, I believe.  And you may be sure that this was pain and anguish to him.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="39" type="section"><p> But when Philip turned to expressions of friendship, and the bottom dropped out of the slander which this Demosthenes had previously uttered against me before our fellow ambassadors, that I was going to be the cause of disagreement and war, then indeed it was plain to see that he was altogether beside himself, so that even when we were invited to dinner he behaved with shameful rudeness.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="40" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When we set out on our return home after completing our mission, suddenly he began talking to each of us on the way in a surprisingly friendly manner.  Why, up to that time I had never so much as known the meaning of words like  &ldquo;kerkops,&rdquo; or the so-called  &ldquo;paipalema,&rdquo; or  &ldquo;palimbolon&rdquo;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">We are as ignorant of the particular shades of vulgarity and rascality conveyed by these words as Aeschines says he was before his initiation.</note> but now after acquiring him as expounder of the mysteries of all rascality, I am fully instructed.</p></div2>

As for me, he fol- lowed me about, congratulating me on my ability and praising my speech; so lavish was he in his compliments that I became sick and tired of him.  And when we were all dining together at <placeName key="tgn,7010894">Larisa</placeName>, he made fun of himself and the embarrassment which had come upon him in his speech, and he declared that Philip was the most wonderful man under the sun.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="42" type="section"><p> When I had added my testimony, saying something like this, that Philip had shown excellent memory in his reply to what we had said, and when <placeName key="tgn,6001610">Ctesiphon</placeName>, who was the oldest of us, speaking of his own advanced age and the number of his years, added that in all his many years he had never looked upon so charming and lovable a man, then this Sisyphus<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">A proverbial name for a cheat.</note> here clapped his hands and said,</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="43" type="section"><p> &ldquo;But, Ctesiphon, it will never do for you to tell the people that, nor would our friend here,&rdquo; meaning me,  &ldquo;venture to say to the Athenians that Philip is a man of good memory and great eloquence.&rdquo;  And we innocently, not foreseeing the trick of which you shall hear presently, allowed him to bind us in a sort of agreement that we would say this to you.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Demosthenes dared them to do it; they accepted the challenge and wagered that they would.</note> And he begged me earnestly not to fail to tell how Demosthenes also said something in support of our claim to <placeName key="perseus,Amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName>.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="44" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now up to this point I am supported by the testimony of my colleagues in the embassy, whom he has reviled and slandered from beginning to end of his accusation.

And I beg of you to continue to hear patiently the rest of my narrative.  I do not forget that each of you is anxious to hear the story of Cersobleptes and the charges made about the Phocians, and I am eager to get to those subjects; but you will not be as well able to follow them unless you shall first hear all that preceded.

                  <div2 n="48" type="section"><p> After giving an account of our mission in general, I went on to say, according to the agreement with my colleagues on the embassy, that Philip showed both memory and eloquence when he spoke.

                  <div2 n="49" type="section"><p> After we had spoken, last of all Demosthenes arose, and with that imposing air of his, and rubbing his forehead, when he saw that the people approved my report and were satisfied with it, he said that he was amazed at both parties, as well the listeners as the ambassadors, for they were carelessly wasting time&mdash;the listeners wasting the time for taking counsel, the ambassadors the time for giving it, all of them amusing themselves with foreign gossip, when they ought to be giving attention to our own affairs; for nothing, he said, was easier than to render account of an embassy.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="50" type="section"><p> &ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; said he,  &ldquo;to show you how the thing ought to be done.&rdquo;  As he said this he called for the reading of the decree of the people.

Now, if you please, take the letter that we have brought from Philip.&rdquo;  When this had been read he said,  &ldquo;You have your answer; it remains for you to deliberate.&rdquo;</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="51" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The people shouted, some applauding his forceful brevity, but more of them rebuking his abominable jealousy.  Then he went on and said,  &ldquo;See how briefly I will report all the rest.  To Aeschines Philip seemed to be eloquent, but not to me; nay, if one should strip off his luck and clothe another with it, this other would be almost his equal.</p></div2>

I, as well as all my colleagues in the embassy, saw the son of Cersobleptes a hostage at Philip's court; and this is still the case.</p></div2>

Cersobleptes was not a member of this league,  but sought to be admitted at the last moment, in order to gain the protection of the peace.  Demosthenes, feeling that his admission would endanger the success of the negotiations for peace, attempted to prevent his admission, by insisting on the irregularity of the procedure; Cersobleptes should have presented his credentials to the senate and obtained from them a resolution advising the assembly to hear his plea; and this should have been done at an earlier meeting.</note> When he had thus spoken, Aleximachus of the deme Pelex handed to the presiding officers a motion to be read, in which it was written that the representative of Cersobleptes be permitted to join the other allies in giving the oath to Philip.</p></div2>

The Athenians now reappointed the same men, including Aeschines, to go to meet Philip.  Aeschines, now recovered in health, went on this fourth embassy.  Demosthenes &lpar;<bibl n="Dem. 19.126">Dem. 19.126</bibl>&rpar; falsely declares that he went without having been elected.  For the whole story from Demosthenes' standpoint, see <bibl n="Dem. 19.121">Dem. 19.121-133</bibl>.  In <bibl n="Dem. 19.172">Dem. 19.172</bibl>, Demosthenes betrays the fact that there really was a reelection for the fourth embassy, and so confirms Aeschines' statement.</note> I was, indeed, chosen one of the ambassadors to the Amphictyons, and even as I had shown myself zealous in reporting to you the embassy from which I had returned, so now, although I was in poor health, I did not refuse the new mission, but promised to serve, if I should have the strength.  But as the ambassadors were on the point of setting out, I sent my brother and his son with my physician to the senate, not to decline service for me</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="95" type="section"><p> (for the law does not permit men who have been elected by the assembly to decline before the senate), but merely to testify to my illness.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When now the ambassadors had been informed of the fate of the Phocians, they returned, and a meeting of the assembly was held.  I had by this time recovered and was present.  When the people insisted that we who had been originally elected should all go on with the embassy in spite of what had happened, I thought it my duty to speak the truth to the Athenians.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">That is, Aeschines felt that he ought now to say frankly that his health was such that he could not decline that service.</note></p></div2>
                  <div2 n="96" type="section"><p> and when I rendered account of my service on that embassy, you, Demosthenes, preferred no charge, but you proceed against my conduct on this embassy, the embassy that was appointed to receive the oaths.

Well, as I just now intimated, fellow citizens, at the meeting of the ambassadors I said that it seemed to me that we were strangely ignoring the most important matter that the people had entrusted to us.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="103" type="section"><p> &ldquo;The reception of the oaths, the discussion of the other questions, and the talk about the prisoners, all that sort of thing could have been done, I think, if the city had entrusted it to some of its petty servants and sent them.  But to reach a right solution of the supreme question, so far as that is in our power or Philip's,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">The supreme question of the hour was the settlement of the long continued Phocian war.  Whether <placeName key="tgn,4003963">Phocis</placeName> was to be defeated and <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> given a dangerous increase of power depended in large measure on what action Philip and the Athenians should decide to take, either jointly or severally.  The Athenians had been unable to persuade Philip's ambassadors to include the Phocians among the states to be protected by the peace, but it was hoped that these ambassadors from <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> would be able to persuade Philip himself to favour <placeName key="tgn,4003963">Phocis</placeName> as against <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>.</note> this is now a task for wise ambassadors.  I mean,&rdquo; said I,  &ldquo;the question of the expedition to <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae">Thermopylae</placeName>, which you see in course of preparation.  That I am not wide of the mark in this matter, I will show you by weighty considerations.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="104" type="section"><p> For ambassadors from <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> are here, ambassadors from Lacedaemonia have arrived, and here are we with a decree of the people in which it stands written, &lsquo;The ambassadors shall also negotiate concerning any other good thing that may be within their power.&rsquo;  All <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName> is watching to see what is going to happen.  If now our people had thought it wise to speak out plainly to Philip, bidding him strip the Thebans of their insolence, and rebuild the walls of the Boeotian towns,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">The small towns of <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName> which had been subjugated by <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, and were now supporting the Phocians in the hope of regaining their independence.</note> they would have asked this of him in the decree.  But as it is, by the obscurity of their language they left open a way of retreat for themselves, in case they should fail to persuade him, and they thought best to take the risk its our persons.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="105" type="section"><p> Men, therefore, who are ambitious to serve the state must not assume the function of other ambassadors whom the Athenians could have sent instead of us, and at the same time, on their own initiative, try to avoid stirring up the hostility of the Thebans.

                  <div2 n="106" type="section"><p> As I was in the midst of these words, Demosthenes protested with a loud voice, as all our colleagues know, for on top of all his other crimes he is for the Boeotians.  At any rate words like these came from him:  &ldquo;This fellow is full of quarrelsomeness and rashness.  For myself, I confess that I am timid, that I fear danger from afar, but I protest against embroiling the cities one with another; I hold it to be the wise course that we ambassadors refrain from meddlesome conduct.</p></div2>

To show that I speak the truth, please call my colleagues and read their testimony.<quote type="Testimony"><title>Testimony</title></quote></p></div2>
                  <div2 n="108" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Accordingly, fellow citizens, when the ambassadors were assembled at <placeName key="perseus,Pella">Pella</placeName>, and Philip had arrived, and the herald called the ambassadors of the Athenians, we came forward, not in the order of age, as in the former embassy&mdash;a procedure which found favour with some, and which seemed to be in accord with the orderly way of our city<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">The Athenian  &ldquo;way&rdquo; in such matters is described in <bibl n="Aeschin. 3.2">Aeschin. 3.2</bibl>.</note>&mdash;but in the way that was dictated by the effrontery of Demosthenes.  For he said that he was the youngest of all, but declared that he could not yield the position of first speaker, and would not permit a certain person&mdash;hinting at me&mdash;to take possession of Philip's ears and leave the rest no chance to speak.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="109" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>He began his speech with certain slanderous allusions to his colleagues, to the effect that not all of us had come with the same end in view, nor were we all of one mind; and then he proceeded to review his own previous services to Philip: first, his defence of Philocrates' motion, when Philocrates, having moved that Philip be permitted to send ambassadors to the Athenians to discuss peace, was defendant on the charge of having made an unconstitutional proposal; secondly, he read the motion of which Demosthenes himself was author, to grant safe conduct to the herald and ambassadors from Philip; and thirdly, the motion that restricted the people's discussion of peace to appointed days.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="110" type="section"><p> To the account he added a conclusion like this:  that he had been the first to put a curb on those who were trying to block the peace; that he had done this, not by his words, but by fixing the dates.  Then he brought up another motion, the one which provided that the people should discuss an alliance also; then, after that, the motion about assigning the front seats at the Dionysia to Philip's ambassadors.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="111" type="section"><p> He alluded also to the special attention he had shown them: the placing of cushions, and certain watchings and vigils of the night, caused by men who were jealous of him and wished to bring insult upon his honourable name!  And that utterly absurd story, whereat his colleagues covered their faces for shame, how he gave a dinner to the ambassadors of Philip; and how when they set out for home he hired for them some teams of mules, and escorted them on horseback.  For he did not hide in the dark, as certain others do, but made an exhibition of his fawning conduct.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="112" type="section"><p> And finally he carefully corrected those other statements:<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">The statements that his colleagues had made to the assembly on their return from the first embassy, as related in <bibl n="Aeschin. 2.47">Aeschin. 2.47</bibl> and <bibl n="Aeschin. 2.52">Aeschin. 2.52</bibl>.</note>&ldquo;I did not say that you are beautiful, for a woman is the most beautiful of all beings; nor that you are a wonderful drinker, for that is a compliment for a sponge, in my opinion; nor that you have a remarkable memory, for I think such praise belongs to the professional sophist.&rdquo; But not to prolong the story, he said such things in the presence of the ambassadors from almost the whole of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>, that laughter arose such as you seldom hear.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="113" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But when at last he stopped and there was silence, I was forced to speak&mdash;after such an exhibition of ill-breeding and such excess of shameful flattery.  Necessarily, by way of preface, I made a brief reply to his insinuations against his colleagues, saying that the Athenians had sent us as ambassadors, not to offer apologies in <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> for ourselves, but as men adjudged by our life at home to be worthy of our city.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="114" type="section"><p> Then after speaking briefly on the subject of the oaths for which we had come, I reviewed the other matters that you had entrusted to us.  For the eminent Demosthenes, for all his exceeding eloquence, had not mentioned a single essential point.  And in particular I spoke about the expedition to <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae">Thermopylae</placeName>, and about the holy places, and <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>, and the Amphictyons.  I called on Philip to settle matters there, preferably not with arms, but with vote and verdict; but if that should be impossible &lpar;it was already evident that it was, for the army was collected and on the spot&rpar;, I said that he who was on the point of deciding the fate of the holy places of our nation ought to give careful thought to the question of piety, and to give attention to those who undertook to give instruction as to our traditions.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="115" type="section"><p> At the same time I reviewed from the beginning the story of the founding of the shrine, and of the first synod of the Amphictyons that was ever held; and I read their oaths, in which the men of ancient times swore that they would raze no city of the Amphictyonic states, nor shut them off from flowing water either in war or in peace; that if anyone should violate this oath, they would march against such an one and raze his cities;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">The city that has violated its Amphictyonic oath can no longer claim the protection of that oath.</note> and if any one should violate the shrine of the god or be accessory to such violation, or make any plot against the holy places, they would punish him with hand and foot and voice, and all their power.  To the oath was added a mighty curse.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="116" type="section"><p> When I had read all this, I solemnly declared that in my opinion it was not right that we should overlook the fact that the cities in <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName> were lying in ruins.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">See on <bibl n="Aeschin. 2.104">Aeschin. 2.104</bibl>.</note> To prove that they were Amphictyonic cities and thus protected by the oaths, I enumerated twelve tribes which shared the shrine: the Thessalians, Boeotians &lpar;not the Thebans only&rpar;, Dorians, Ionians, Perrhaebi, Magnetes, Dolopians, Locrians, Oetaeans, Phthiotians, Malians, and Phocians.  And I showed that each of these tribes has an equal vote, the greatest equal to the least: that the delegate from <placeName key="perseus,Dorion">Dorion</placeName> and Cytinion has equal authority with the Lacedaemonian delegates, for each tribe casts two votes; again, that of the Ionian delegates those from <placeName key="perseus,Eretria">Eretria</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Priene">Priene</placeName> have equal authority with those from <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> and the rest in the same way.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="117" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now I showed that the motive of this expedition was righteous and just; but I said that the Amphictyonic Council ought to be convened at the temple, receiving protection and freedom to vote,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">The Council had been unable to meet while the Phocians were holding the shrine.  Aeschines would have Philip' s army occupy <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>, and so restore the Amphictyons to their rights.</note> and that those individuals who were originally responsible for the seizure of the shrine ought to be punished&mdash;not their cities, but the individuals who had plotted and carried out the deed; and that those cities which surrendered the wrongdoers for trial ought to be held guiltless.   &ldquo;But if you take the field and with your forces confirm the wrongdoing of the Thebans,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">If Philip should help the Thebans to subdue the Phocians, the confirmation of Theban control over the Boeotian cities would naturally follow, as it did in the event.</note> you will receive no gratitude from those whom you help, for you could not possibly do them so great a service as the Athenians once did, and they have no memory for that; while you will be wronging those whom you leave in the lurch, and will find them, not your friends in the future, but all the more your enemies.&rdquo;</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="118" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But not to waste time in reciting to you now precisely what was spoken there, I will content myself with this brief summary of it all.  Fortune and Philip were masters of the issue, but I, of loyalty to you and of the words spoken.  My words were words of justice, and they were spoken in your interest; the issue was not according to our prayer, but according to Philip's acts.  Who, therefore, is it that deserves your approval?  Is it the man who showed no desire to do any good thing whatever, or the man who left undone nothing that was in his power? But I now pass over many things for lack of time.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="119" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>He said that I deceived you by saying that within a few days <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> would be humbled; and that I told about the Euboeans, how I had frightened them, and that I led you on into empty hopes.  But, fellow citizens, let me tell you what it is that he is doing.  While I was with Philip I demanded&mdash;and when I returned to you I reported that I thought it right&mdash;that <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> should be Boeotian, and not <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName>, Theban.  He asserts, not that I reported this, but that I promised it.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="120" type="section"><p> And I told you that Cleochares of <placeName key="perseus,Chalcis">Chalcis</placeName> said that he was surprised at the sudden agreement between you and Philip, especially when we had been instructed  &ldquo;to negotiate concerning any good thing that should be within our power.&rdquo;  For he said the people of the small states, like himself, were afraid of the secret diplomacy of the greater.  Demosthenes asserts, not that I related this fact, but that I promised to hand over <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName>!  But I had supposed that when the city was about to deliberate on matters of supreme importance, no statement from any Hellenic source ought to be ignored.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="121" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But he falsely declared that when he wished to report the truth, he was hindered by me, together with Philocrates&mdash;for he divided the responsibility in that case also.  Now I should like to ask you this: Has any ambassador sent out from <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> ever been prevented from presenting to the people an official report of his conduct?  And if one had suffered such treatment and had been repudiated by his colleagues, would he ever have made a motion that they be given a vote of thanks and invited to dinner?  But Demosthenes on his return from the second embassy, in which he says that the cause of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName> was ruined, moved the vote of thanks in his decree;</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="122" type="section"><p> and not only that, but when I had reported to the people what I had said about the Amphictyons and Boeotians, not briefly and rapidly as now, but as nearly word for word as possible, and when the people heartily applauded, I called upon him together with the other ambassadors, and asked them whether my report was true, and identical with what I had said to Philip; and when all my colleagues had testified and praised me, after them all Demosthenes arose and said: No, I had not to-day been speaking as I spoke there, but that I spoke twice as well there.  You who are going to give the verdict are my witnesses of this.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="123" type="section"><p> and yet what better opportunity could he have had to convict me than to do it then and there, if I was in any wise deceiving the city?  You say, Demosthenes, that while I was in a conspiracy against the city in the first embassy, you were not aware of it, but that on the second you found it out&mdash;the embassy in which we find you testifying to my services!  And while accusing me for my conduct on the first embassy, you at the same time deny that you accuse me, and direct your accusations against the embassy that was sent to take the oaths.  And yet if it is the peace you find fault with, it was you who moved to add the alliance to it.  And if Philip did at any point deceive the city, his deception had to do with the peace, for he was maneuvering for the precise form of peace that would serve his own advantage.  But it was the earlier embassy that offered the opportunity to accomplish this; the second took place after the thing was already done.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="124" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>How he has deceived you&mdash;deceit is ever the mark of the charlatan&mdash;see from his own words.  He says that I went down the Loedias river to Philip in a canoe by night, and that I wrote for Philip the letter which came to you.  For Leosthenes, who had been exiled from <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> through the work of blackmailers, was not competent to write a clever letter&mdash;a man whom some do not hesitate to rank next to Callistratus of <placeName key="perseus,Aphidna">Aphidna</placeName> as an able orator!</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="125" type="section"><p> and Philip himself was not competent, against whom Demosthenes was not able to hold his own when he tried to speak in your behalf! nor Python of <placeName key="perseus,Byzantium">Byzantium</placeName>, a man who takes pride in his ability as a writer! but, as it seems, the thing required my help too!  And you say that time and again I had private interviews with Philip in the daytime, but you accuse me of paddling down the river in the night&mdash;the need of a midnight letter was so urgent!</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="126" type="section"><p> But there is no truth in your story, as those who messed with me have come to testify&mdash;Aglaocreon of <placeName key="perseus,Tenedos">Tenedos</placeName> and latrocles the son of Pasiphon, with whom I slept every night during the whole time, from beginning to end; they know that I was never away from them a single night, nor any part of a night.  We present also our slaves and offer them for torture;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Slave testimony was accepted in the Athenian courts only when it was given, or offered, under torture.</note> and I offer to interrupt my speech if the prosecution agree.

For among those men who contrary to the laws crown officers who have not yet submitted their accounts, some, who at heart are orderly citizens&mdash;if any one is really orderly who proposes illegal measures&mdash;at any rate some do make an attempt to cloak their shame; for they add to their decrees the proviso that the man who is subject to audit shall be crowned  &ldquo;after he shall have rendered account and submitted to audit of his office.&rdquo;</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="12" type="section"><p>The injury to the state is indeed no less, for the hearings for accounting are prejudiced by previous votes of thanks and crowns; but the man who makes the motion does show to the bearers that while he has made an illegal motion, he is ashamed of the wrong thing that he has done.  But <placeName key="tgn,6001610">Ctesiphon</placeName>, fellow citizens, overleaping the law that governs those who are subject to audit, and not deigning to resort to the pretext of which I have just spoken, has moved that before the accounting, before the auditing, you crown Demosthenes&mdash;in the midst of his term of office.</p></div2>

                  <div2 n="14" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Well, to their arguments I will oppose your law, a law which you yourselves passed in the expectation of silencing such pretexts; for it expressly says &ldquo;the elective offices,&rdquo; including all in a single phrase, calling everything which is filled by popular election an  &ldquo;office,&rdquo; and specifying  &ldquo;the superintendents of public works.&rdquo;  But Demosthenes is in charge of the construction of walls, superintendent of the greatest of the works;  &ldquo;and all who have charge of any business of the state for more than thirty days, and all to whom is given the presidency of a court&rdquo;; but every superintendent of public works holds the presidency of a court.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">It was a principle of the Athenian legal system that litigation arising within the sphere of any executive department should come before a court presided over by the head of that department.</note></p></div2>

For by right, fellow citizens, the orator and the law ought to speak the same language; but when the law utters one voice and the orator another, you ought to give your vote to the just demand of the law, not to the shamelessness of the speaker.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="17" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But now to  &ldquo;the irrefutable argument,&rdquo; as Demosthenes calls it, I wish to reply briefly in advance.  For he will say,  &ldquo;I am in charge of the construction of walls; I admit it; but I have made a present of a hundred minas to the state, and I have carried out the work on a larger scale than was prescribed; what then is it that you want to audit?  unless a man's patriotism is to be audited!&rdquo;  Now to this pretext hear my answer, true to the facts and beneficial to you.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In this city, so ancient and so great, no man is free from the audit who has held any public trust.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="18" type="section"><p>I will first cite cases where this would be least expected.  For example, the law directs that priests and priestesses be subject to audit, all collectively, and each severally and individually&mdash;persons who receive perquisites only, and whose occupation is to pray to heaven for you; and they are made accountable not only separately, but whole priestly, families together, the Eumolpidae, the Ceryces, and all the rest.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="19" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Again, the law directs that the trierarchs be subject to audit, though they have had no public funds in their hands, and though they are not men who filch large sums from your treasury and pay out small ones, and not men who claim to be making donations when they are only paying back what is your own, but men who are acknowledged by all to have spent their family fortunes in their ambition to serve you.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Furthermore, not the trierarchs alone, but also the highest bodies in the state, come under the verdict of the courts of audit.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="20" type="section"><p>For, first, the Senate of the Areopagus is required by the law to file its accounts with the Board of Auditors and to submit to their examination; yes, even those men, who sit with solemn aspect yonder as the court of highest competence, are brought under your verdict.  Shall the Senate of the Areopagus, then, receive no crown?  They shall not, for such is not the tradition of our fathers.  Have they, then, no love of honor?  Indeed they have!  They so love honor that they are not satisfied with merely keeping free from guilt, but they punish their members even for mistakes.  But your politicians are pampered.  Further, the lawgiver has made the Senate of Five Hundred subject to audit.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="21" type="section"><p>And so deep is his distrust of those who are subject to audit, that he says at the very beginning of the laws,  &ldquo;The officer who has not yet submitted his accounts shall not leave the country?&rdquo;   &ldquo;Heracles !&rdquo; some one may answer,  &ldquo;because I held an office may I not leave the country?&rdquo;  No, for fear you may make profit of the public money or the public acts, and then run away.  Furthermore, the man who is subject to audit is not allowed to consecrate his property, or to make a votive offering, or to receive adoption,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">An official who caused himself to be adopted into some family poorer than his own might thus diminish the security which the state would hold in case of his misconduct in office.</note> or to dispose of his property by will and he is under many other prohibitions.

                  <div2 n="22" type="section"><p>&ldquo;Yes, but there is a man who has received no public funds and spent none, but has simply had something to do with administrative matters.&rdquo;  He too is commanded to render account to the auditors.   &ldquo;And how shall the man who has received nothing and spent nothing render account to the state?&rdquo;  The law itself suggests and teaches what he is to write; for it commands him to file precisely this statement,  &ldquo;I have neither received nor spent any public funds.&rdquo;  There is nothing in all the state that is exempt from audit, investigation, and examination.  As proof of what I say, hear the laws themselves.<quote type="Laws"><title>Laws</title></quote></p></div2>
                  <div2 n="23" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So when Demosthenes at the height of his impudence shall say that because the money was a gift he is not subject to audit, suggest this to him: was it not, then, your duty, Demosthenes, to allow the herald of the Board of Auditors to make this proclamation, sanctioned by law and custom,  &ldquo;Who wishes to prefer charges?&rdquo;  Let any citizen who wishes have the opportunity to claim that you have given nothing, but that from the large sums under your control you have spent a mere trifle on the repair of the walls, whereas you have received ten talents from the city for this work.

                  <div2 n="25" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In earlier times, fellow citizens, the city used to elect a Comptroller of the Treasury, who every prytany made to the people a report of the revenues.  But because of the trust which you placed in Eubulus, those who were elected Superintendents of the Theoric Fund held &lpar;until the law of Hegemon was passed&rpar; the office of Comptroller of the Treasury and the office of Receiver of Moneys; they also controlled the dockyards, had charge of the naval arsenal that was building, and were Superintendents of Streets; almost the whole administration of the state was in their hands.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="26" type="section"><p>I say this, not to accuse or blame them, but because I wish to show you this: that while the lawgiver, in case any one is subject to audit for a single office&mdash;though it be the least&mdash;does not permit him to be crowned until lie has rendered his account and submitted to audit, <placeName key="tgn,6001610">Ctesiphon</placeName> did not hesitate to move to crown Demosthenes, who was holding all the offices in <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> at once.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="27" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Furthermore I will present to you Demosthenes himself as witness to the fact that at the time when <placeName key="tgn,6001610">Ctesiphon</placeName> made his motion, Demosthenes was holding the office of Commissioner for the Repair of Walls, and so was handling public funds, imposing fines like the other magistrates, and privileged to preside in court.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">See on <bibl n="Aeschin. 3.14">Aeschin. 3.14</bibl>.</note> For in the archonship of Chaerondas, on the last day but one of Thargelion,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">The spring of 337, nine months after the battle of <placeName key="tgn,7010731">Chaeronea</placeName>.

On this point Demosthenes and <placeName key="tgn,6001610">Ctesiphon</placeName> will argue at length.  But the law is brief and clear and it makes short work of their devices.  I wish first to speak to you briefly about this.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="29" type="section"><p>There are, fellow citizens, three classes of public officers.  The first and most obvious class are all who are appointed by lot or by election; the second class are those who administer some public business for more than thirty days, and the Commissioners of Public Works; but third it stands written in the law that if any others receive presidencies of courts,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">See on <bibl n="Aeschin. 3.14">Aeschin. 3.14</bibl>.</note> they also shall  &ldquo;hold office on passing their scrutiny.&rdquo;</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="30" type="section"><p>Now when you subtract those officials who are chosen by popular election and those appointed by lot, there remain those whom the tribes, the trittyes,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">A trittys was a third of a tribe and was composed of a group of adjoining demes.  The division was recognized for certain administrative purposes.</note> and the demes appoint from among their own number to administer public funds.  This happens when, as in the present case, some work is assigned to the several tribes, like the digging of trenches or the building of triremes.  That what I say is true, you shall learn from the laws themselves.<quote type="Laws"><title>Laws</title></quote></p></div2>
                  <div2 n="31" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Recall now what has been said: the lawgiver directs that after approval in court<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">The court for the scrutiny of incoming officers.  See on <bibl n="Aeschin. 3.15">Aeschin. 3.15</bibl>.</note> those appointed by the tribes shall  &ldquo;hold office&rdquo;; but the tribe Pandionis appointed Demosthenes an  &ldquo;officer,&rdquo; a Builder of Walls; and he has received for this work from the general treasury nearly ten talents.  Another law forbids crowning an official before he has rendered his accounts, and you have sworn to vote according to the laws; but yonder politician has moved to crown the man who has not yet rendered his accounts, and he has not added  &ldquo;when he shall have rendered account and submitted to audit&rdquo; and I convict him of the unlawful act, bringing as my witnesses the laws, the decrees, and the defendants.  How could one more clearly prove that a man has made an unlawful motion?</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="32" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Furthermore, I will show you that the proclamation of the crown, as proposed in his decree, is to be made in an illegal manner.

                  <div2 n="33" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>This, fellow citizens, is an excellent law.  For it seems that it was the idea of the lawgiver that the public man ought not to be thinking of outsiders as he receives his honors, but to be well content with honor received in the city itself and from the  people; and that he ought not to treat such proclamations as a source of revenue.  So thought the lawgiver.  But <placeName key="tgn,6001610">Ctesiphon</placeName> how?  Read his decree.<quote type="Decree"><title>Decree</title></quote></p></div2>
                  <div2 n="34" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>You hear, fellow citizens, how the lawgiver commands that the man who is crowned by the people be proclaimed among the people, on the Pnyx, at a meeting of the assembly,  &ldquo;and nowhere else&rdquo;; but <placeName key="tgn,6001610">Ctesiphon</placeName>, in the theater&mdash;not only overriding the laws but also changing the place; not when the Athenians are in assembly, but when tragedies are being performed; not in the presence of the people, but in the presence of the Hellenes, that they also may know what sort of man we honor.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="35" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Having, then, made a motion that is so manifestly illegal, he will call Demosthenes as his ally and bring up the artifices of rhetoric for the assault on the laws.  These tricks I will reveal and of these I will forewarn you, lest you be taken unawares and deceived.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>They will not be able to deny that the laws forbid the man who is crowned by the people to be proclaimed outside the assembly, but they will present for their defence the Dionysiac law, and will use a certain portion of the law, cheating your ears.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="36" type="section"><p>For they will offer a law that has nothing to do with this case, and will say that the city has two laws governing proclamations: one, the law that I now offer in evidence, which expressly forbids the man who is crowned by the people to be proclaimed outside the assembly; but they will say that there is another law, contradictory to this, and that that law has given authority for the proclamation of the crown at the time of the tragedies in the theater,  &ldquo;if the people vote.&rdquo;  And so they will say that it is in accordance with that law that <placeName key="tgn,6001610">Ctesiphon</placeName> has made his motion.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="37" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now against their tricks I will introduce your own laws as my advocates, as indeed I earnestly try to do throughout this whole prosecution.  For if what they say is true, and such a custom has crept into your government that invalid laws stand written among the valid, and that there exist two laws concerning one and the same action, which contradict each other, how could any man longer call this a  &ldquo;government,&rdquo; if in it the laws command to do and not to do one and the same thing?</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="38" type="section"><p>But that is not the case.  May you never reach the point where your laws are in such disorder as that!  Nor was the lawgiver who established the democracy guilty of such neglect; he has expressly laid upon the Thesmothetae<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">The Thesmothetae were the six lower archons.  They had general supervision of all the courts, and particular control of numerous specified cases.</note> the duty of making an annual revision of the laws in the presence of the people, prescribing sharp investigation and examination, in order to determine whether any law stands written which contradicts another law, or an invalid law stands among the valid, or whether more laws than one stand written to govern each action.</p></div2>

                  <div2 n="40" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>If now, fellow citizens, what they assert were true, and two laws had been in force governing proclamations, I think the Thesmothetae would necessarily have searched them out, and the prytanes would have referred them to the Nomothetae, and one or the other of the two laws would have been repealed, either the law that gave authority for the proclamation, or the law that forbade it.  But seeing that no such thing has been done, surely what they say is demonstrated to be, not only false, but absolutely impossible.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="41" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But I will show you where they get this false assertion.  First, however, I will tell the reason why the laws governing the proclamations in the theater were enacted.  It frequently happened that at the performance of the tragedies in the city proclamations were made without authorization of the people, now that this or that man was crowned by his tribe, now that others were crowned by the men of their deme, while other men by the voice of the herald manumitted their household slaves, and made all <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName> their witness;</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="42" type="section"><p>and, most invidious of all, certain men who had secured positions as agents of foreign states managed to have proclaimed that they were crowned&mdash;it might be by the people of <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName>, or of <placeName key="tgn,7002670">Chios</placeName>, or of some other state&mdash;in recognition of their merit and uprightness.  And this they did, not like those who were crowned by your senate or by the people, by first obtaining your consent and by your decree, and after establishing large claims upon your gratitude, but themselves reaching out after the honor with no authorization from you.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="43" type="section"><p>The result of this practice was that the spectators, the choregi, and the actors alike were discommoded, and that those who were crowned in the theater received greater honors than those whom the people crowned.  For the latter had a place prescribed where they must receive their crown, the assembly of the people, and proclamation  &ldquo;anywhere else&rdquo; was forbidden; but the others were proclaimed in the presence of all the Hellenes; the one class with your consent, by your decree; the other, without decree.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="44" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now some legislator, seeing this, caused a law to be enacted which has nothing to do with the law concerning those who are crowned by our people, and did not supersede it.  For it was not the assembly that was being disturbed, but the theater; and he was not enacting a law contradictory to the previously existing laws, for that may not be done; but a law governing those who, without your decree, are crowned by their tribe or deme, and governing the freeing of slaves, and also the foreign crowns.  He expressly forbids the manumission of a slave in the theater, or the proclamation of a crown by the tribe or deme,  &ldquo;or by any one else,&rdquo; he says,  &ldquo;and the herald who disobeys shall lose his civic rights.&rdquo;</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="45" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When, therefore, the lawgiver designates, for those who are crowned by the senate, the senate-house as the place of proclamation, and, for those who are crowned by the people, the assembly, and when he forbids those who are crowned by the demes or tribes to be proclaimed at the tragedies&mdash;that no one may try to get spurious honor by begging crowns and proclamations, and when in the law he further forbids proclamation being made by any one else, senate, people, tribe, and deme being thus eliminated&mdash;when one takes these away, what is it that is left except the foreign crowns?</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="46" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>For the truth of my assertion I will show you a strong argument derived from the laws themselves.  For the golden crown itself which is proclaimed in the city theater the law takes from the man who is crowned, and commands that it be dedicated to Athena.  And yet who among you would dare to charge the Athenian people with such illiberality?  For certainly no state, nay, not even a private person&mdash;not one&mdash;would be so mean as to proclaim a crown and at the same moment demand back the gift which he himself had made.  But I think it is because the crown is the gift of foreigners that the dedication is made, lest any one set a higher value upon the gratitude of a foreign state than upon that of his own country, and so become corrupted.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="47" type="section"><p>But the other crown, the crown that is proclaimed in the assembly, no one dedicates, but he is permitted to keep it, that not only he, but also his descendants, having the memorial in their house, may never become disloyal to the democracy.  And the reason why the lawgiver also forbade the proclamation of the foreign crown in the theater  &ldquo;unless the people vote,&rdquo; is this: he would have the state that wishes to crown any one of your citizens send ambassadors and ask permission of the people, for so he who is proclaimed will be more grateful to you for permitting the proclamation than to those who confer the crown.  But to show that my statements are true, hear the laws themselves.<quote type="Laws"><title>Laws</title></quote></p></div2>
                  <div2 n="48" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When, therefore, they try to deceive you, and say that it is added in the law that the bestowal of the crown is permitted  &ldquo;if the people vote,&rdquo; do not forget to suggest to them, Yes, if it is another state that is crowning you; but if it is the Athenian people, a place is designated for you where the ceremony must be performed; it is forbidden you to be crowned outside the assembly.  For you may spend the whole day in explaining the meaning of the words  &ldquo;and nowhere else&rdquo;; you will never show that his motion is lawful.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="49" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But that part of my accusation remains upon which I lay greatest stress: the pretext upon which he claims that the crown is deserved.  It reads thus in his motion :  &ldquo;And the herald shall proclaim in the theater in the presence of the Hellenes that the Athenian people crown him for his merit and uprightness,&rdquo; and that monstrous assertion,  &ldquo;because he continually speaks and does what is best for the people.&rdquo;</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="50" type="section"><p>You see how entirely simple the remainder of our argument becomes, and how easy for you, my hearers, to weigh.  For it is obviously incumbent upon me, the complainant, to show this to you, that the praise given to Demosthenes is false, and that he never began to  &ldquo;speak what was best,&rdquo; nor now  &ldquo;continues to do what is good for the people.&rdquo;  If I show this, then <placeName key="tgn,6001610">Ctesiphon</placeName> will doubtless lose his case, and justly; for all the laws forbid inserting falsehoods in the decrees of the people.

                  <div2 n="51" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The case is this: To review the private life of Demosthenes would, in my opinion, demand too long a speech.

                  <div2 n="52" type="section"><p>when Demosthenes as one of the trierarchs carried the general on his ship, and shared his table, his sacrifices, and his libations and how after he had been thus honored because the general was an old friend of his father's, he did not hesitate, when the general was impeached, and was on trial for his life, to become one of his accusers; or, again, that story about Meidias and the blow of the fist that Demosthenes got when he was choregus, in the orchestra, and how for thirty minas he sold both the insult to himself and the vote of censure that the people had passed against Meidias in the theater of Dionysus.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Meidias was a rich and domineering man,who had conceived a bitter hatred for Demosthenes in the course of the suites against Demosthenes' guardians.  When Demosthenes was serving as choregus, Meidias, meeting him in the orchestra, in the presence of the spectators, struck him in the face.  The people, at a meeting held in the theater at the close of the festival, passed a vote of censure against Meidias, and Demosthenes instituted a suit in the courts; but finally, probably for worthy political reasons, he compromised the case.</note></p></div2>
                  <div2 n="53" type="section"><p>Now these incidents and all the others like them I think it is best to pass over; not that I would betray you, gentlemen of the jury, or politely yield this case to him, but because I fear that I shall encounter in you the feeling that, while all this is true, it is an old story, admitted by everybody.  And yet, <placeName key="tgn,6001610">Ctesiphon</placeName>, when a man's utter shame is so credible to the hearers and so notorious that his accuser seems, not to be speaking what is false, but what is stale, and what everybody admits at the outset, ought that man to be crowned with a golden crown, or ought he to be censured?  And you, who had the effrontery to make your false and unlawful motion, ought you to despise the courts, or ought you to give satisfaction to the city?</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="54" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But concerning the crimes of his public life I will try to speak more explicitly.  For I understand that when the defence are given opportunity to speak, Demosthenes will enumerate to you four periods in the history of the city as the periods of his own political activity.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">In fact, Demosthenes made no such division.</note> One of them, and the first, as I hear, he reckons as the time of our war with Philip over <placeName key="perseus,Amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName>.  He marks this off by the peace and alliance that were made on motion of Philocrates of Hagnus, and with the cooperation of Demosthenes himself, as I shall show.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="55" type="section"><p>And he says that the second period was the time while we kept the peace, doubtless up to that day on which this same orator put an end to the existing peace, by himself introducing the motion for war; and the third period, the period of war, up to the events of <placeName key="tgn,7010731">Chaeronea</placeName>; and the fourth, the present period.  When he has enumerated these, he intends, as I hear, to call me forward and ask me to tell him for which of these four periods I accuse him, and when it is that I say that his policy has not been for the best interests of the people.  And if I refuse to answer, and cover my face and run away, he says he will come and uncover me and lead me to the platform, and force me to answer.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="56" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In order, then, that he may lose his confidence, and that you may be instructed in advance, and that I may reply, in the presence of the jury, Demosthenes, and of all the other citizens who are standing there outside the bar, and of all the other Greeks who have taken the trouble to listen to this case&mdash;and I see that not a few are here, more in fact than have ever attended a public trial within the memory of any man&mdash;I answer you that for all the four periods which you enumerate I accuse you.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="57" type="section"><p>And if the gods permit, and the jurors give us an impartial hearing, and I am able to call to mind all that I know about you, I confidently expect to show to the jury that for the safety of the city it is the gods who are responsible, and the men who in the crisis have treated the city with humanity and moderation;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">The reference is to the unexpected moderation shown by both Philip and Alexander in their treatment of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, when they had the city entirely in their power, after her persistent efforts against them.</note> but for all our misfortunes, Demosthenes.  The order of my treatment shall be that which I understand he will follow; and I will speak first concerning the first period, second concerning the second, third concerning the next, and fourth concerning the present situation.

                  <div2 n="58" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>You could have made that former peace,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">&ldquo;That former peace&rdquo; is the Peace of Philocrates, 346 b.c., so distinguished from the peace existing at the time of this speech.</note> fellow citizens, supported by the joint action of a congress of the Greek states, if certain men had allowed you to wait for the return of the embassies which at that crisis you had sent out among the Greeks, with the call to join you against Philip; and in the course of time the Greeks would of their own accord have accepted your hegemony again.  Of this you were deprived, thanks to Demosthenes and Philocrates, and the bribes which they took in their conspiracy against the common weal.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="59" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But if such a statement as I have just made, falling suddenly on your ears, is too incredible to some of you, permit me to suggest how you ought to listen to the rest of my argument: When we take our seats to audit the accounts of expenditures which extend back a long time, it doubtless sometimes happens that we come from home with a false impression; nevertheless, when the accounts have been balanced, no man is so stubborn as to refuse, before he leaves the room, to assent to that conclusion, whatever it may be, which the figures themselves establish.</p></div2>

If some of you have come from home with the opinion, formed in the past, that of course Demosthenes has never in conspiracy with Philocrates said a word in Philip's interest&mdash;if any man of you is under such impression, let him decide nothing either way, aye or no, until he has heard; for that would not be fair.  But if, as I briefly recall the dates, and cite the resolutions which Demosthenes moved in cooperation with Philocrates, the truthful audit of the facts shall convict Demosthenes of having moved more resolutions than Philocrates concerning the original peace and alliance,</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="61" type="section"><p>and of having flattered Philip and his ambassadors with a shamelessness which was beyond measure, and of being responsible to the people for the failure to secure the concurrence of a general congress of the Greek states in the making of the peace, and of having betrayed to Philip Cersobleptes, king of <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>, a friend and ally of our city&mdash;if I shall clearly demonstrate all this to you, I shall make of you this modest request: in God's name agree with me, that in the first of his four periods his policies have not been those of a good citizen.  I will speak in a way that will enable you to follow me most easily.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="62" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Philocrates made a motion<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">In 348 b.c.</note> that we permit Philip to send to us a herald and ambassadors to treat concerning peace.  This motion was attacked in the courts as illegal.  The time of the trial came.  Lycinus, who had indicted him, spoke for the prosecution; Philocrates made answer for himself, and Demosthenes spoke in his behalf;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">In <bibl n="Aeschin. 2.14">Aeschin. 2.14</bibl>, Aeschines says that Philocrates was ill, and called in Demosthenes as his advocate &lpar;<foreign lang="greek">sunh/goros</foreign>&rpar;.

After this came the archonship of Themistocles.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Beginning in midsummer, 347 b.c.</note> Now Demosthenes came in as senator, not drawn by the lot either as a member of the senate or as a substitute, but through intrigue and bribery; the purpose of it was to enable him to support Philocrates in every way, by word and deed, as the event itself made evident.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="63" type="section"><p>For now Philocrates carries a second resolution, providing for the election of ten ambassadors, who shall go to Philip and ask him to send hither plenipotentiaries to negotiate peace.  Of these ambassadors one was Demosthenes.  On his return, Demosthenes was a eulogist of the peace, he agreed with the other ambassadors in their report, and he alone of the senators moved to give safe-conduct to Philip's herald and ambassadors; and in this motion he was in accord with Philocrates, for the one had given permission to send a herald and ambassadors hither, the other gave safe-conduct to the embassy.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="64" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As to what followed, I beg you now to pay especial attention.  For negotiations were entered into&mdash;not with the other ambassadors, who were slandered again and again by Demosthenes after he had changed face, but with Philocrates and Demosthenes &lpar;naturally, for they were at once ambassadors and authors of the motions&rpar;&mdash;first, that you should not wait for the ambassadors whom you had sent out with your summons against Philip, for they wished you to make the peace, not together with the Greeks, but by yourselves;</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="65" type="section"><p>secondly, that you should vote, not only for peace, but also for alliance with Philip, in order that any states which were taking note of what the Athenian democracy was doing might fall into utter discouragement on seeing that, while you were summoning them to war, you had at home voted to make both peace and an alliance; and thirdly, that Cersobleptes, king of <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>, should not be included in the oaths, nor share the alliance and peace&mdash;indeed, an expedition was already being levied against him.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="66" type="section"><p>Now the man who was buying such services was doing no wrong, for before the oaths had been taken and the agreements entered into, he could not be blamed for negotiating to his own advantage; but the men who sold, who admitted Philip into partnership in the control of the strongholds of the state, were deserving of your great indignation.  For the man who now shouts,  &ldquo;Down with Alexander!&rdquo; and in those days,  &ldquo;Down with Philip!&rdquo; the man who throws in my face the friendship of Alexander, this man Demosthenes,</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="67" type="section"><p>stole away the opportunities of the city by making the motion that the prytanes call an assembly for the eighth day of Elaphebolion, the day of the sacrifice to Asclepius, and the introductory day of the festival<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">The Great Dionysia, April 5th, 346 b.c.</note>&mdash;the sacred day&mdash;a thing that no man remembers ever to have been done before.  And what was his pretext?   &ldquo;In order,&rdquo; he says,  &ldquo;that if Philip's ambassadors shall by that time have arrived, the people may most speedily deliberate on their relations with Philip.&rdquo; He thus appropriates the assembly for the ambassadors in advance, before their arrival, cutting short your time, and hurrying on the whole business; and this was in order that you might make the peace, not in cooperation with the other Greeks, on the return of your ambassadors,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">The ambassadors who had been sent out to call other Greek states to unite against Philip.</note> but alone.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="68" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After this, fellow citizens, Philip's ambassadors arrived<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">It seems that Philip's ambassadors did not arrive in time for the discussion appointed for the 8th; but they were in <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> during at least a part of the Dionysia &lpar;<bibl n="Aeschin. 3.76">Aeschin. 3.76</bibl>&rpar;.</note> but yours were absent, summoning the Greeks against Philip.  Thereupon Demosthenes carries another resolution, in which he provides that we take counsel, not only regarding peace, but on the subject of an alliance also; and that we should do this without waiting for your ambassadors to return, but immediately after the City Dionysia, on the 18th and 19th of the month.

                  <div2 n="69" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When now, fellow citizens, the Dionysia were past and the assemblies took place, in the first assembly a resolution of the synod of the allies was read,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">At this time <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> was at the head of a small league, all that was left of the great maritime league begun in 378, but largely broken up by the league war of 357&mdash;55.

The resolution empowered <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> in advance to act in behalf of the league.</note> the substance of which I will give briefly before having it read to you.  First, they provided only that you should take counsel regarding peace, and omitted the word  &ldquo;alliance&rdquo;&mdash;and that not inadvertently, but because they looked upon even the peace as necessary, rather than honorable; secondly, they met Demosthenes' bribery with a well-chosen remedy,</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="70" type="section"><p>by adding in their resolution that any Greek state that wished should be permitted within the space of three months to have its name inscribed with the Athenians on the same stone, and to share the oaths and agreements.  In this way they were taking two precautions, and those of the greatest importance; for first, they provided the period of three months, a sufficient time for the ambassadors of the Greek states to arrive; and secondly, they sought to secure to the city the good-will of the Greeks, by the provision for a general congress, in order that in case the agreements should be violated, we might not enter upon the war unprepared and alone&mdash;the misfortune that actually came upon us, thanks to Demosthenes.  Now that what I say is true, you shall learn by hearing the resolution itself<quote type="Resolution of the Allies"><title>Resolution of the Allies</title></quote></p></div2>
                  <div2 n="71" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I acknowledge that I supported this resolution, as did all who spoke in the first of the two assemblies; and the people left the assembly with substantially this supposition, that peace would be made &lpar;that, however, it was better not to discuss an alliance, because of our summons to the Greeks&rpar;, and that the peace would be shared by all the Greeks.  Night intervened.  We came the next day to the assembly.  Then it was that Demosthenes, hastening to get possession of the platform, and leaving no other man an opportunity to speak, said that the propositions of yesterday were utterly useless unless Philip's ambassadors could be persuaded to assent to them.  He further said that he could not conceive of peace without alliance.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="72" type="section"><p>For he said we must not&mdash;I remember the expression he used, for the word was as odious as the man&mdash;he said we must not  &ldquo;rip off&rdquo; the alliance from the peace, nor wait for the slow decisions of the other Greeks, but we must either fight ourselves, or by ourselves make the peace.  And finally he called Antipater<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">One of Philip's ambassadors.</note> to the platform, and proceeded to ask him a certain question&mdash;he had previously told him what he gas going to ask, and had instructed him what he was to answer, to the injury of the state.

And when now I had finished and gone out from the council, there was great outcry and excitement among the Amphictyons, and nothing more was said about the shields that we had dedicated, but from now on the subject was the punishment of the Amphissians.  As it was already late in the day, the herald came forward and made proclamation that all the men of <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> who were of full age, slaves and free men alike, should come at daybreak on the morrow with shovels and mattocks to the place that is there called the Thyteion.  And again the same herald proclaimed that all the hieromnemons and the pylagori should come to the same place to the aid of the god and the sacred land;  &ldquo;And whatever city shall fail to appear, shall he debarred from the shrine and shall be impure and under the curse.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="123" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The next morning we came to the designated spot, and descended to the Cirrhaean plain.

                  <div2 n="124" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now on the next day Cottyphus, the presiding officer, called an  &ldquo;assembly&rdquo; of the Amphictyons &lpar;they call it an  &ldquo;assembly&rdquo; when not only the pylagori and hieromnemons are called together,but with them those who are sacrificing and consulting the god&rpar;.  Then immediately one charge after another was brought against the Amphissians, and our city was much praised.  As the outcome of all that was said,they voted that before the next Pylaea<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Before the next regular meeting of the Amphictyonic Council.

Now the substance of the bill was this:  &ldquo;The hieromnemon of the Athenians,&rdquo; it says,  &ldquo;and the pylagori who are at the time in office, shall go to <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae">Thermopylae</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> at the times appointed by our fathers&rdquo;; fine in sound, shameful in fact; for it prevents attendance on the special meeting at <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae">Thermopylae</placeName>, which had to be held before the date of the regular meeting.</p></div2>

Shall I tell you the truth, or what is most agreeable for your ears?  I will tell you the truth, for it is the universal habit of speaking to please you that has brought the city to such a pass.

But when the Amphissians failed to pay the money to the god, and had restored the guilty men, and banished those righteous men who had been restored by the Amphictyons, under these circumstances at last the second campaign was made, a long time afterward, when Philip had now returned from his Scythian expedition.  It was to us that the gods had offered the leadership in the deed of piety, but Demosthenes' taking of bribes had prevented us.</p></div2>

It commanded the main road towards <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>.  For the Athenian feeling of the significance of its seizure,  see the famous passage in the speech of Demosthenes, <title>On the  Crown</title>, <bibl n="Dem. 19.168">Dem. 19.168</bibl> ff.</note> then, and not till  then, it was, when the peril was laying hold on them, that they sent for the Athenians.  You went out and were on the point of marching into <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> under arms, horse and foot, before ever Demosthenes had moved one single syllable about an alliance.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="141" type="section"><p>What brought you into <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> was the crisis and fear and need of alliance, not Demosthenes.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>For in this whole affair Demosthenes is responsible to you for three most serious mistakes.  The first was this: when Philip was nominally making war against you, but really was far more the enemy of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, as the event itself has proved &lpar;why need I say more?&rpar;, Demosthenes concealed these facts, which were so important, and pretending that the alliance was to be brought about, not through the crisis, but through his own negotiations,</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="142" type="section"><p>first he persuaded the people to give up all consideration of the terms of the alliance, and to count themselves fortunate if only it were made; and when he had gained this point he betrayed all <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName> to the Thebans by writing in the decree,  &ldquo;If any city refuse to follow <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, the Athenians shall aid the Boeotians in <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>,&rdquo;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">The traditional policy of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> had been to support the smaller Boeotian cities in their refusal to recognize Theban dominion over them.</note> cheating with words and altering the facts, as he is wont to do; as though, forsooth, when the Boeotians should be suffering in fact, they would be content with Demosthenes' fine phrases, rather than indignant at the outrageous way in which they had been treated;</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="143" type="section"><p>and, secondly, he laid two thirds of the costs of the war upon you, whose danger was more remote, and only one third on the Thebans &lpar;in all this acting for bribes&rpar;; and the leadership by sea he caused to be shared equally by both; but all the expenditure he laid upon you and the leadership by land, if we are not to talk nonsense, he carried away bodily and handed it over to <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>.  The result was that in all the war that followed, Stratocles, your general, had no authority to plan for the safety of his troops.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="144" type="section"><p>And it is not true that in this I alone accuse, while others are silent; nay, I speak, all men blame him, you know the facts&mdash;and are not angry!  For this is your experience as regards Demosthenes: you have so long been accustomed to hear of his crimes that they no longer surprise you.  But it ought not so to be; you ought to be indignant, and to punish him, if the city is to prosper in the future.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="145" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But he was guilty of a second and far greater crime; for he stole the senate-house of the city and the democracy outright and carried them off to <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, to the Cadmeia, by his agreement with the Boeotarchs for joint control.  And he contrived such domination for himself that now he came forward to the platform and declared that he was going as ambassador wherever he chose, whether you sent him or not;</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="146" type="section"><p>and, treating your magistrates as his slaves, and teaching them to raise no word of opposition against him, he declared that if any of the generals should oppose him,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">In connection with their service as commanders of the army and navy the generals had a considerable share in the responsibility for foreign relations.</note> he would bring suit to settle the claims of the speakers' platform as against those of the war office; for he said you owed more benefits to him from the platform than to the generals from the war office.  And by drawing pay for empty places in the mercenary force,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">The charge is that Demosthenes was in a conspiracy to pad the rolls.</note> by stealing the pay of the troops, and by hiring out those ten thousand mercenaries to the Amphissians<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">The administration, by detaching this large body of mercenaries and sending them to the immediate aid of the Amphissians, gave Philip the opportunity to sweep them away before meeting the army of the Athenians and Thebans at <placeName key="tgn,7010731">Chaeronea</placeName>.</note> against my repeated protests and complaints in the assembly&mdash;when the mercenaries had thus been carried off, he rushed the city all unprepared into the mist of peril.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="147" type="section"><p>What, think you, would Philip have prayed for at that crisis?  Would it not have been that he might in one place fight against the city's forces, and in another, in <placeName key="perseus,Amphissa">Amphissa</placeName>, against the mercenaries, and thus close his hand upon the Greeks already discouraged by so great a disaster?  And Demosthenes, who is responsible for such misfortunes as that, is not content with escaping punishment, but is miserable unless he shall he crowned with a golden crown!  Nor is he satisfied that the crown shall be announced in your presence, but if it is not to he proclaimed before the Hellenes, he is miserable over that.  So true it seems to be that a wicked nature, when it has laid hold on great license, works out public disaster.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="148" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But the third and greatest of the crimes that I have mentioned is that which I am about to describe.  Philip did not despise the Greeks, and he was well aware &lpar;for he was not without understanding&rpar; that he was about to contend in a little fraction of a day for all that he possessed; for that reason he wished to make peace, and was on the point of sending envoys.  The officials at <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> also were frightened at the impending danger&mdash;naturally, for they had no run-away orator and deserter to advise them, but the ten years' Phocian war had taught them a lesson not to be forgotten.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="149" type="section"><p>Now when Demosthenes saw that such was the situation, suspecting that the Boeotarchs were about to conclude a separate peace and get gold from Philip without his being in it, and thinking that life was not worth living if he was to be left out of any act of bribery, he jumped up in the assembly, when no man was saying a word either in favour of making peace with Philip or against it; and with the idea of serving a sort of notice on the Boeotarchs that they must turn over to him his share of the gain, he swore by Athena</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="150" type="section"><p>&lpar;whose statue, it seems, Pheidias wrought expressly that Demosthenes might have it to perjure himself by and to make profit of&rpar; that if any one should say that we ought to make peace with Philip, he would seize him by the hair and drag him to prison&mdash;in this imitating the politics of Cleophon, who, they tell us, in the time of the war against the Lacedaemonians, brought ruin to the state.  But when the officials in <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> would pay no attention to him, but even turned your soldiers back again when they had marched out, for they wished to give you an opportunity to deliberate concerning peace,</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="151" type="section"><p>then indeed he became frantic, and went forward to the platform and stigmatized the Boeotarchs as traitors to <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>, and declared that he would move a decree&mdash;he, who never looked on the face of an enemy in arms !&mdash;that you should send ambassadors to <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> to ask them to give you free passage through their country for the march against Philip.  But the officials in <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, ashamed lest they should seem in reality to be traitors to <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>, turned from the thought of peace, and threw themselves into the war.</p></div2>

                  <div2 n="160" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But when Philip was dead and Alexander had come to the throne, Demosthenes again put on prodigious airs and caused a shrine to he dedicated to Pausanias<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Pausanias was the man who assassinated Philip.</note> and involved the senate in the charge of having offered sacrifice of thanksgiving as for good news.  And he nicknamed Alexander  &ldquo;Margites&rdquo;;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Margites was the name of a caricature of Achilles in a poem that passed under the name of Homer.  &ldquo;Demosthenes asserted, then that Alexander, in his aspiration to be a second Achilles, would never get farther that to become a caricature of him.&rdquo;  &lpar;<persName><surname>Richardson</surname></persName>.&rpar;</note> and had the effrontery to say that Alexander would never stir out of <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, for he was content, he said, to saunter around<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Perhaps a sneer at Alexander's studies under Aristotle, the  &ldquo;Peripatetic.&rdquo;</note> in <placeName key="perseus,Pella">Pella</placeName>, and keep watch over the omens; and he said this statement was not based on conjecture, but on accurate knowledge, for valor was to be purchased at the price of blood.

This young man, distinguished for extraordinary beauty of person, once lived a long time in Demosthenes' house &lpar;what he used to do there or what was done to him, is a scandal that is in dispute, and the story is one that would be quite improper for me to repeat&rpar;.  Now I am told that this Aristion, his origin and personal history being unknown to the king, is worming himself into favour with Alexander and getting access to him.  Through him Demosthenes has sent a letter to Alexander, and has secured a certain degree of immunity for himself, and reconciliation; and he has carried his flattery to great lengths.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="163" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But see from the following how the facts tally with the charge.  For if Demosthenes had been bent on war with Alexander, as he claims to have been, or had any thought of it, three of the best opportunities in the world have been offered to him, and, as you see, he has not seized one of them.  One, the first, was when Alexander, newly come to the throne, and not yet fairly settled in his personal affairs, crossed into <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>.  The king of <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName> was at the height of his power then, with ships and money and troops,and he would gladly have received us into his alliance because of the dangers that were threatening him.  But did you, Demosthenes, at that time say a word? Did you move a decree?  Shall I assume that you followed your natural disposition and were frightened?  And yet the public opportunity waits not for the orator's fears.</p></div2>

                  <div2 n="165" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But I will pass over all this, and speak of the most recent events.  The Lacedaemonians and their mercenary force had been successful in battle and had destroyed the forces of Corrhagus;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Corrhagus was the Macedonian commander.  The reference is to the Spartan revolt against <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, which had been put down by Antipater shortly before the case of Aeschines against <placeName key="tgn,6001610">Ctesiphon</placeName> came to trial.</note> the Eleans and the Achaeans, all but the people of <placeName key="perseus,Pellene">Pellene</placeName>, had come over to them, and so had all <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName> except <placeName key="perseus,Megalopolis">Megalopolis</placeName>, and that city was under siege and its capture was daily expected.  Meanwhile Alexander had withdrawn to the uttermost regions of the North, almost beyond the borders of the inhabited world, and Antipater was slow in collecting an army; the whole outcome was uncertain.  Pray set forth to us, Demosthenes, what in the world there was that you did then, or what in the world there was that you said.  I will yield the platform to you, if you wish, until you have told us.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="166" type="section"><p>You are silent.  I can well understand your embarrassment.  But what you said then, I myself will tell now.  Do you not remember, gentlemen, his disgusting and incredible words?  Ye men of iron, how had you ever the endurance to listen to them!  When he came forward and said,  &ldquo;Certain men are pruning the city, certain men have trimmed off the tendrils of the people, the sinews of the state have been cut, we are being matted and sewed up, certain men are first drawing us like needles into tight places.&rdquo;</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="167" type="section"><p>What are these things, you beast?  Are they words or monstrosities?  And again when you whirled around in a circle on the platform and said, pretending that you were working against Alexander,  &ldquo;I admit that I organized the Laconian uprising, I admit that I am bringing about the revolt of the Thessalians and the Perrhaebi.&rdquo;  You cause a revolt of the Thessalians?  What!  Could you cause the revolt of a village?  Would you actually approach&mdash;let us talk not about a city&mdash;would you actually approach a house, where there was danger?  But if money is being paid out anywhere, you will lay siege to the place; a man's deed you will never do.  If any good-fortune come of itself, you will lay claim to it, and sign your name to the thing after it has been done; but if any danger approach, you will run away; and then if we regain confidence, you will call for rewards and crowns of gold.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="168" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Yes, but he is a friend of the people!  If now you attend only to the plausible sound of his words, you will be deceived as in the past; but if you look at his character and the truth, you will not be deceived.  Call him to account in this way: with your help I will reckon up what ought to be the inborn qualities of the  &ldquo;friend of the people&rdquo; and the orderly citizen; and over against them I will set down what manner of man one would expect the oligarch and the worthless man to be.  And I ask you to compare the two and to see to which class he belongs&mdash;not by his professions, but by his life.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="169" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I think you would all acknowledge that the following qualities ought to he found in the  &ldquo;friend of the people&rdquo;: in the first place, he should be free-born, on both his father's and his mother's side, lest because of misfortune of birth he be disloyal to the laws that preserve the democracy.  In the second place, he should have as a legacy from his ancestors some service which they have done to the democracy, or at the very least there must he no inherited enmity against it, lest in the attempt to avenge the misfortunes of his family he undertake to injure the city.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="170" type="section"><p>Thirdly, he ought to be temperate and self-restrained in his daily life, lest to support his wanton extravagance he take bribes against the people.  Fourthly, he ought to be a man of good judgment and an able speaker; for it is well that his discernment choose the wisest course, and his training in rhetoric and his eloquence persuade the hearers; but if he cannot have both, good judgment is always to be preferred to eloquence of speech.  Fifthly, he ought to be a man of brave heart, that in danger and peril he may not desert the people.  But the oligarch we should expect to have all the opposite qualities; why need I go over them again?  Examine, then, and see what one of these qualities belongs to Demosthenes.  And let the reckoning be made with all fairness.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="171" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>His father was Demosthenes of Paeania, a free man, for there is no need of lying.  But how the case stands as to his inheritance from his mother and his maternal grandfather, I will tell you.  There was a certain Gylon of Cerameis.  This man betrayed <placeName key="tgn,7002557">Nymphaeum</placeName> in the <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName> to the enemy, for the place at that time belonged to our city.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes"><placeName key="tgn,7002557">Nymphaeum</placeName> was a port of the Tauric Chersonese.</note> He was impeached and became an exile from the city, not awaiting trial.  He came to <placeName key="tgn,1115068">Bosporus</placeName><note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">The Cimmerian Bosporus; the chief city was Panticapeum, the modern Kertch.</note> and there received as a present from the tyrants of the land a place called  &ldquo;the Gardens.&rdquo;</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="172" type="section"><p>Here he married a woman who was rich, I grant you, and brought him a big dowry, but a Scythian by blood.  This wife bore him two daughters, whom he sent hither with plenty of money.  One he married to a man whom I will not name&mdash;for I do not care to incur the enmity of many persons,&mdash;the other, in contempt of the laws of the city,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">In 451/0 Pericles carried a measure which excluded from citizenship all who could not show pure Athenian blood through both parents.  By the close of the Peloponnesian war this restriction had fallen into neglect, and in 403 the restored democracy passed an enactment excluding from citizenship children born of a foreign mother after that date.  If Demosthenes' mother was born of a Thracian mother and after 403 &lpar;neither fact is certain&rpar;, she could not bear legitimate children to her Athenian husband.</note> Demosthenes of Paeania took to wife.  She it was who bore your busy-body and informer.  From his grandfather, therefore, he would inherit enmity toward the people, for you condemned his ancestors to death and by his mother's blood he would be a Scythian, a Greek-tongued barbarian&mdash;so that his knavery, too, is no product of our soil.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="173" type="section"><p>But in daily life what is he?  From being a trierarch he suddenly came forward as a hired writer of speeches,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">For To be a trierarch implied that a man was in comfortable circumstances.   &ldquo;He sank as a trierarch to rise as a pettifogger.&rdquo;  &lpar;Simcox.&rpar;</note> when he had disreputably squandered his patrimony.  But when he had lost his reputation even in this profession, for he disclosed his clients' arguments to their opponents, he vaulted on to the political platform.  And though he made enormous profits out of politics, he laid up next to nothing.  It is true that just now the Persian's gold has floated his extravagance, but even that will not suffice, for no wealth ever yet kept up with a debauched character.  And to sum it all up, he supplies his wants, not from his private income, but from your perils.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="174" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But as regards good judgment and power of speech, how does it stand with him?  Eloquent of speech, infamous of life!  For so licentious has been his treatment of his own body that I prefer not to describe his conduct; for before now I have seen people hated who recount too exactly the sins of their neighbors.  Then again, what is the outcome for the city?  His words are fine, his acts worthless.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="175" type="section"><p>But as concerns his bravery little remains for me to say.  For if he denied that he is a coward, or if you did not know it as well as he does himself, the account of it would have detained me.  But since he admits it himself in the assembly, and you are perfectly aware of it, it remains only to remind you of the laws as to this matter.  For Solon, the ancient lawgiver, thought it necessary to apply the same penalties to the coward as to the man who failed to take the field or the man who deserted his post.  For there are such things as indictments for cowardice.  Some of you may indeed be surprised to know that there are indictments for inborn defects.  There are.  To what end?  In order that each man of us, fearing the punishment of the laws more than he fears the enemy, may become a better champion of his country.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="176" type="section"><p>Therefore the man who fails to take the field, and the coward, and the man who has deserted his post are excluded by the lawgiver from the purified precincts of the Agora, and may not be crowned, nor take part in the sacred rites of the people.  But you, <placeName key="tgn,6001610">Ctesiphon</placeName>, command us to crown the man who by command of the laws is uncrowned; and by your decree you invite into the orchestra at the time of the tragedies the man who has no right to enter, and into the shrine of Dionysus the man who has betrayed all our shrines through cowardice.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But that I may not lead you away from the subject, remember this when he says that he is the  &ldquo;friend of the people&rdquo;; examine, not his speech, but his life; and consider, not who he says he is, but who he is.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="177" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I have mentioned crowns and rewards.  Let me, fellow citizens, while I still have the matter in mind, warn you that unless you put a stop to these prodigal gifts and these crowns thoughtlessly bestowed, neither those who receive honors from you will be grateful, nor will the prosperity of the city be restored.  For you will never in the world reform those who are bad, and the good you will plunge into extreme discouragement.  But I will present proofs which I think will convince you that what I say is true.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="178" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>If any one should ask you whether our city seems to you more glorious in our own time or in the time of our fathers, you would all agree, in the time of our fathers.  And were there better men then than now?  Then, eminent men; but now, far inferior.  But rewards and crowns and proclamations, and maintenance in the Prytaneum&mdash;were these things more common then than now?  Then, honors were rare among us, and the name of virtue was itself an honor.  But now the custom is already completely faded out, and you do the crowning as a matter of habit, not deliberately.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="179" type="section"><p>Are you not therefore surprised, when you look at it in this light, that the rewards are now more numerous, but the city was then more prosperous?  And that the men are now inferior, but were better then?  I will try to explain this to you.  Do you think, fellow citizens, that any man would ever have been willing to train for the pancratium or any other of the harder contests in the Olympic games, or any of the other games that confer a crown, if the crown were given, not to the best man, but to the man who had successfully intrigued for it?  No man would ever have been willing.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="180" type="section"><p>But as it is, because the reward is rare, I believe, and because of the competition and the honor, and the undying fame that victory brings, men are willing to risk their bodies, and at the cost of the most severe discipline to carry the struggle to the end.  Imagine, therefore, that you yourselves are the officials presiding over a contest in political virtue, and consider this, that if you give the prizes to few men and worthy, and in obedience to the laws, you will find many men to compete in virtue's struggle; but if your gifts are compliments to any man who seeks them and to those who intrigue for them, you will corrupt even honest minds.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="181" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>How true this is, I wish to teach you a little more explicitly.  Does it seem to you that Themistocles, who was general when you conquered the Persian in the battle of <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName>, was the better man, or Demosthenes, who the other day deserted his post?  Miltiades, who won the battle of Marathon, or yonder man?  Further&mdash;the men who brought back the exiled democracy from <placeName key="perseus,Phyle">Phyle</placeName>?

                  <div2 n="182" type="section"><p>But, by the Olympian gods, I think one ought not to name those men on the same day with this monster!  Now let Demosthenes show if anywhere stands written an order to crown any one of those men.  Was the democracy, then, ungrateful?  No, but noble-minded, and those men were worthy of their city.  For they thought that their honor should be conferred, not in written words, but in the memory of those whom they had served; and from that time until this day it abides, immortal.  But what rewards they did receive, it is well to recall.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="183" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>There were certain men in those days, fellow citizens, who endured much toil and underwent great dangers at the river Strymon, and conquered the Medes in battle.

                  <div2 n="192" type="section"><p>And in those days, so my father said, they gave no such hearing as is given now, but the jurors were far more severe toward the authors of illegal motions than was the accuser himself; and it frequently happened that they made the clerk stop, and told him to read to them the laws and the motion a second time; and they convicted a man of making an illegal motion, not in case he had overleaped all the laws together, but if one syllable only was contravened.  But the process as it is conducted nowadays is ridiculous.  The clerk reads the statement of the illegality which is charged, and the jurors, as though hearing an incantation, or some matter which is no concern of theirs, are attending to something else.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="193" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And already as a result of the tricks of Demosthenes you have admitted a shameful custom into your courts; for you have allowed your legal procedure to become perverted: the accuser is on the defensive, and the defendant plays the part of accuser; and the jurors sometimes forget what they are to judge, and are forced to bring in a verdict on matters which were never committed to their decision; while the defendant, if by any chance he does touch on the question at issue, pleads, not that his motion was lawful, but that on some past occasion another man has made an equally unlawful motion and been acquitted; a plea in which I hear <placeName key="tgn,6001610">Ctesiphon</placeName> now places great confidence.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="194" type="section"><p>Once the famous Aristophon of Azenia dared in your presence to boast that he had been acquitted seventy-five times on charge of making illegal motions.  Not so the venerable Cephalus, famous as the truest representative of democracy&mdash;not so, but he took pride in the very opposite fact, saying that although he had been the author of more measures than any other man, he had never once been indicted for an illegal motion; an honorable pride, I think.  For indictments for illegal motions were in those times brought, not only by political rivals against one another, but by friend against friend, if one was responsible for any error toward the state.  Yes, the following shall serve as an illustration:</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="195" type="section"><p>Archinus of Coele brought an indictment for an illegal motion against Thrasybulus of Steiria, one of his own companions in the return from <placeName key="perseus,Phyle">Phyle</placeName>; and he convicted him and though his services were recent, the jurors did not take them into account; for they thought that, just as Thrasybulus had brought them back from exile then, so now when they had been restored, by making a motion which was against the laws he was driving them into exile again.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="196" type="section"><p>But it is not so today; the very opposite is done.  For your worthy generals, and some of those who have received maintenance in the Prytaneum, beg men off who have been indicted for illegal motions.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">The meaning is that these influential men come into court and use their influence to secure the acquittal of personal friends of theirs.</note> But you ought to regard them as ungrateful.  For if any man who has been honored in a democracy, a government which owes its safety to the gods and to the laws, dares to aid men who make illegal motions, he is undermining the government from which he received his honors.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="197" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But I will tell you what plea is in order from the honest advocate.  When an indictment for an illegal motion is tried in court, the day is divided into three parts.  The first water is poured in<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Into the clepsydra, by which the time allowed to each side was measured.  Cp. <bibl n="Aeschin. 2.126">Aeschin. 2.126</bibl> and note.</note> for the accuser, the laws, and the democracy the second water, for the defendant and those who speak on the question at issue; but when the question of illegality has been decided by the first ballot,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">The jurors balloted first on the question whether the motion was illegal as charged.  If they sustained the prosecution, both sides then argued the question of the nature and extent of the penalty, after which the jurors cast a final ballot, fixing the penalty.</note> then the third water is poured in for the question of the penalty and the extent of your anger.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="198" type="section"><p>Whoever therefore in the discussion on the penalty asks for your vote,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">The reference is still to the request of influential men who come into court to help their friends.</note> is begging you to mitigate your anger; but he who in the first speech asks for your vote is asking you to surrender your oath, to surrender the law, to surrender the democratic constitution things which no man has a right to ask you to surrender, nor any man to grant another for his asking.  Bid them, therefore, to allow you to cast your first ballot according to the laws, before they plead on the question of penalty.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="199" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In short, fellow citizens, for my part I am almost ready to say that we ought to pass a special law governing indictments for illegal motions, which shall forbid either accuser or defendant to call in advocates.  For the question of right involved is not an indefinite one, but is defined by your own laws.  For as in carpentry, when we wish to know what is straight and what is not, we apply the carpenters' rule, which serves as our standard,</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="200" type="section"><p>so in indictments for illegal motions there lies ready to our hand as a rule of justice this tablet, containing the measure proposed and the laws which it transgresses.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">The tablet is the bulletin-board which had been publicly posted in advance to the trial, containing the indictment, the motion which was attacked, and the laws which were alleged to be violated by the motion.</note> Show that these agree one with another, <placeName key="tgn,6001610">Ctesiphon</placeName>, and then take your seat.  Why need you call Demosthenes to your support?  When you overleap the just defence and call forward a rascal and a rhetorician, you cheat the ears of the jury, you injure the city, you undermine the democracy.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="201" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>How you may avert speeches of that sort, fellow citizens, I will tell you.  When <placeName key="tgn,6001610">Ctesiphon</placeName> comes forward here and recites to you that introduction which has of course been composed for him,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Aeschines assumes that <placeName key="tgn,6001610">Ctesiphon</placeName>'s speech has been composed for him by Demosthenes, and that it will be a mere introduction to the real defence, which will follow from the lips of Demosthenes himself, speaking nominally as friendly supporter &lpar;<foreign lang="greek">sunh/goros</foreign>&rpar; of <placeName key="tgn,6001610">Ctesiphon</placeName>.</note> and when he then tries to kill time, and makes no answer to the charge, suggest to him, quietly, that he take the tablet and read the laws and his resolution side by side.  If he pretends that he does not hear you, then do you refuse to hear him.  For you have not come here to listen to men who dodge an honest defence, but to those who are willing to defend themselves with justice.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="202" type="section"><p>But if he shall overleap the just defence and call Demosthenes to the platform, the best course for you is to refuse to receive a sophist, who expects to overthrow the laws with words.  And when <placeName key="tgn,6001610">Ctesiphon</placeName> asks you if he shall call Demosthenes, let no man of you consider that he is doing a meritorious thing in being the first to cry,  &ldquo;Aye, call him, call him.&rdquo;  Against yourself you are calling him, against the laws you are calling him, against the constitution you are calling him.  But if after all you decide to listen, demand that Demosthenes make his defence in the same way in which I have made the accusation.  In what way have I made the accusation?  Let me recall it to you.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="203" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I did not at the beginning review the private life of Demosthenes, nor did I at the beginning call to mind a single one of his public crimes&mdash;though I certainly had great abundance of material, or else I must be the most helpless of mortals&mdash;but first I exhibited the laws which forbid crowning men who have not yet rendered their accounts, and then I convicted the orator of having moved to crown Demosthenes before he had rendered account, and that too without inserting the qualifying proviso,  &ldquo;When he shall have rendered account,&rdquo; but in utter contempt of you and of your laws.  And I told you what excuses they would offer for this, which I earnestly pray you to keep in mind.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="204" type="section"><p>Secondly, I recited to you the laws which govern proclamations, in which it is expressly forbidden that when one is crowned by the people the proclamation shall be made in any other place than in the assembly.  But the politician who is the defendant in this case has not only transgressed the laws, but the time of proclamation, and the place of it; for he orders the proclamation to be made, not in the assembly, but in the theater, not when the Athenian assembly is in session, but when the tragedies are about to he performed.  After saying this, I spoke briefly about his private life, but chiefly about his public crimes.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="205" type="section"><p>I insist, therefore, that you demand the same order of defence from Demosthenes; first, let him defend himself against the law of accountability, secondly, against the law which governs proclamations, and thirdly, and most important, let him show also that he is not unworthy of the reward.  But if he asks you to indulge him as to the order of his speech, and solemnly promises that at the close of his defence he will clear away the matter of illegality, do not yield to him, and do not forget that this is an old trick of the court-room.  For he would never of his own choice return to the defence against the illegality but because he has nothing to say which is just, he seeks by the insertion of extraneous matters to plunge you into forgetfulness of the charge.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="206" type="section"><p>As, therefore, in gymnastic contests you see the boxers contending with one another for position, so do you for the city's sake fight with him the whole day long for position as regards argument; and do not let him set his feet outside the bounds of the illegality charged, but watch him and lie in wait for him as you listen, drive him into discussion of the illegality, and look out for the twists and turns of his speech.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="207" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>What, on the other hand, will surely be the result for you if you listen in the way that they propose, I ought now to forewarn you.  For the defendant will call to his aid this juggler and cut-purse, a man who has torn the constitution to shreds.  This man weeps more readily than other men laugh, and nothing is so easy for him as perjury.  And I should not wonder if he should change his tactics and slander the listeners outside the bar, alleging that those whom truth herself has singled out and counted as oligarchs have come to the platform of the prosecution, but all the friends of the people to the platform of the defence.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">In court, plaintiff and defendant had each a platform, where he sat with his intimate friends and supporters.  It would appear from this passage that listeners who sympathized with either party grouped themselves near his platform.</note></p></div2>
                  <div2 n="208" type="section"><p>Now when he talks like that, in answer to such appeals to faction, make this suggestion to him:  &ldquo;Demosthenes, if the men of Phyle, who brought back the people from exile, had been like you, never had the democracy been reestablished.  But as it was, they saved the city out of great disasters, and gave utterance to those words which are the fairest product of enlightened minds, &lsquo;Forgive and forget.&rsquo;  But as for you, you tear open old sores, and you care more for the words of the moment than for the safety of the state.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But when, perjurer that he is, he takes refuge in the confidence which you place in oaths, remind him of this, that when a man repeatedly perjures himself, and yet is continually demanding to be believed because of his oaths, one of two things ought to be true, either the gods ought to be new gods, or the hearers not the same.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="209" type="section"><p>But in answer to his tears and the straining of his voice when he asks you,  &ldquo;Whither shall I flee, fellow citizens?  You have compassed me about, I have not whither to take wings,&rdquo; suggest to him,  &ldquo;But the Athenian people, Demosthenes, whither shall they flee?  What allies have been made ready to receive them?  What resources are prepared?  What bulwark have you thrown up before the people by your policies?  For we all see what provision you have made for yourself.  You have left the upper city and the Peiraeus, as it seems, is not so much your home, as an anchorage for you, off the city's coast.  And you have provided as means for your cowardly flight, the King's gold and the fruits of your political bribery.&rdquo;</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="210" type="section"><p>But, after all, why these tears?  Why all this noise?  Why this straining of the voice?  Is it not <placeName key="tgn,6001610">Ctesiphon</placeName> who is the defendant?  Is not the suit one in which the penalty is for the jury to determine?<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">a)gw=nes a)ti/mhtoi</foreign> were those in which the penalty was fixed by statute; in <foreign lang="greek">a)gw=nes timhtoi/</foreign>the penalty was to be determined in each case by the jury.  Aeschines represents the latter class of cases as involving less peril to the defendant.</note> Is it not true that you are pleading neither for your person nor for your citizenship nor for your property?  But what is this anxiety of his about?  About crowns of gold and proclamations in the theater&mdash;against the laws.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="211" type="section"><p>Nay, but if the people gone mad, or forgetful of the existing situation, had actually wished to crown him at a time so unfitting, he ought to have come before the assembly and said,  &ldquo;Fellow citizens, I accept the crown, but I do not approve the time at which the proclamation is to be made.  For events which have caused our city to shear her head in mourning are no fitting occasion for my head to receive a crown.&rdquo;  This I think a man would say whose life had been one of genuine virtue.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="212" type="section"><p>But the words which you, Demosthenes, will speak, are the natural expression of a worthless scoundrel, with whom virtue is a pretence.  One thing at any rate is sure, by Heracles; no one of you will feel any anxiety lest Demosthenes, a man high-spirited and distinguished in war, will, if he fails to receive the meed of valor, go back home and make away with himself&mdash;he who so despises honor in your eyes that on this pestilential and accountable<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">The Greek word <foreign lang="greek">u(peu/qunon</foreign>, here rendered  &ldquo;accountable,&rdquo; is the technical expression for the accountability of the official who has not yet appeared before the board of auditors.</note> head of his upon which <placeName key="tgn,6001610">Ctesiphon</placeName>, in defiance of all the laws, proposes that you set a crown, he has inflicted a thousand gashes, and he has made money out of his wounds by bringing suit<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">See <bibl n="Aeschin. 2.93">Aeschin. 2.93</bibl>.

I will speak only of what is common to the pair of them, and what I can honestly report to you concerning both.  For the opinion that each of them has of the other is true, and the things that each, as he goes about the market-place, says of the other are no falsehoods.</p></div2>

And Demosthenes says that when he looks at his own case only, he is confident, but that he is exceedingly anxious in view of Ctesiphon's wickedness and licentiousness!  Well, when men have thus condemned one another, you, the common judges of both, must surely not acquit them of the crimes they charge.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="215" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I wish also to caution you in a few words as to the slanders which they will utter against me.  For I learn that Demosthenes will say that the city has been greatly benefited by him, but damaged by me and he will bring up against me Philip and Alexander, and the charges connected with them.  And he is, as it seems, such a master-craftsman of words that he is not content to bring charges against whatever part I have taken in your political action, or whatever speeches I have delivered,</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="216" type="section"><p>but he actually attacks the very quietness of my life, and makes my silence an accusation, in order that no topic may be left untouched by his slanders.

                  <div2 n="217" type="section"><p>And, by Zeus, I understand that he proposes to ask me why I denounce his policy as a whole, but did not try to thwart it in detail, and did not prefer charges in the courts: and why I have brought suit at this late day without having steadily attacked his policy.  But I have never in the past emulated the habits of Demosthenes, nor am I ashamed of my own, nor would I wish unsaid the words which I have spoken in your presence, nor would I care to live had my public speeches been like his.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="218" type="section"><p>As to my silence, Demosthenes, it has been caused by the moderation of my life.  For a little money suffices me, and I have no shameful lust for more.  Both my silence and my speech are therefore the result of deliberation, not of the impulse of a spendthrift nature.  But you, I think, are silent when you have gotten, and bawl aloud after you have spent; and you speak, not when your judgment approves, and not what you wish to speak, but whenever your pay-masters so order.  And you are not ashamed of impostures in which you are instantly convicted of falsehood.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="219" type="section"><p>For my suit against this motion, which you say I instituted, not in the city's behalf, but as a manifesto to Alexander, was instituted while Philip was still alive, before Alexander had come to the throne, before ever you had had that dream of yours about Pausanias, or ever had conversed with Athena and Hera in the night.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">See <bibl n="Aeschin. 3.77">Aeschin. 3.77</bibl>.</note> How then could I have been already making a manifesto to Alexander?

For in oligarchies it is not he who wishes, but he who is in authority, that addresses the people; whereas in democracies he speaks who chooses, and whenever it seems to him good.  And the fact that a man speaks only at intervals marks him as a man who takes part in politics because of the call of the hour, and for the common good; whereas to leave no day without its speech, is the mark of a man who is making a trade of it, and talking for pay.</p></div2>

                  <div2 n="228" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And, by the Olympian gods, of all the things which I understand Demosthenes is going to say, I am most indignant at what I am now about to tell you.  For he likens me in natural endowment to the Sirens, saying that it was not charm that the Sirens brought to those who listened to them, but destruction, and that therefore the Siren-song has no good repute; and that in like manner the smooth flow of my speech and my natural ability have proved the ruin of those who have listened to me.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">No such passage occurs in the published speech of Demosthenes.  It is likely that he omitted it when he revised his speech for publication.</note> And yet I think no man in the world is justified in making such a statement about me.  It is a shame to accuse a man and not to be able to show the ground for the accusation.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="229" type="section"><p>But if the charge really had to be made, it was not for Demosthenes to make it, but for some general who, although he had rendered distinguished services to the state, was not gifted with the power of speech, and for that reason was envious of the natural endowments of his opponents in court, because he knew that he had not the ability to describe one of all the things he had accomplished, but saw in his accuser a man able to set forth to the hearers in all detail how he had himself administered things which had not been done by him at all.  But when a man who is made up of words, and those words bitter words and useless&mdash;when such a man takes refuge in  &ldquo;simplicity&rdquo; and  &ldquo;the facts,&rdquo; who could have patience with him?  If you treat him as you might a clarinet, and take out his tongue, you have nothing left!</p></div2>

On the ground that <placeName key="tgn,6001610">Ctesiphon</placeName>'s motion is lawful?  Never was a more unlawful motion made.  On the ground that he who moved the decree is not the sort of man to be punished?  You give up the possibility of calling any man to account for his manner of life, if you let this man go.  And is it not vexatious that whereas in former times the orchestra was piled with golden crowns with which the state was honored by the Hellenes,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Crowns were frequently sent from one state to another in recognition of generous services.</note> today in consequence of the policies of Demosthenes you the people go uncrowned and unproclaimed, but he is to be honored by the voice of the herald?</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="231" type="section"><p>If any one of the tragic poets who are to bring on their plays after the crowning should in a tragedy represent Thersites as crowned by the Greeks, no one of you would tolerate it, for Homer says he was a coward and a slanderer; but when you yourselves crown such a man as this, think you not that you would be hissed by the voice of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>?  Your fathers were wont to attribute to the people such deeds as were glorious and brilliant, but mean and unworthy acts they threw upon the incompetent politicians.  But <placeName key="tgn,6001610">Ctesiphon</placeName> thinks that you ought to take off from Demosthenes his ill-fame, and crown the people with it.</p></div2>

And&mdash;strangest of all&mdash;in the same court-rooms do you disfranchise those who are convicted of receiving bribes, and then yourselves propose to crown a man who, to your own knowledge, has always been in politics for pay?  If the judges at the Dionysiac festival are not honest in their award of the prize to the cyclic choruses, you punish them; but do you yourselves, who are sitting as judges, not of cyclic choruses, but of the laws and of integrity in public life, do you propose to bestow your rewards, not according to the laws, and not upon the rare and deserving, but upon the successful intriguer?</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="233" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Furthermore, a juror who so acts will go out from the court-room responsible for having made himself weak and the politician strong.  For in a democracy the private citizen is a king by virtue of the constitution and his own vote; but when he hands these over to another man, he has by his own act dethroned himself.  Still further, the oath that he has sworn before taking his seat haunts him and troubles him, for it was his oath, I think, that made his act a sin; and his service is unknown to the man whom he was trying to please, for the vote is cast in secret.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="234" type="section"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But it seems to me, fellow citizens, that the political situation, while fortunate, is also perilous; for we are not wise.  The fact that at the present time you, the people, give over the mainstays of the democracy to the few is to be deplored; but the fact that there has not sprung up to our hurt a crop of politicians both corrupt and daring is a gift of fortune.  For in former times the state did bring forth such characters, and they made short work of putting down the democracy.  For the people loved to be flattered, and in consequence were overthrown, not by the men whom they feared, but by those in whose hands they had placed themselves.</p></div2>
                  <div2 n="235" type="section"><p>And some of them actually joined the Thirty, who killed more than fifteen hundred of the citizens without trial, before they had even heard the charges on which they were to be put to death, and who would not even allow the relatives to be present at the burial of the dead.

For to have been responsible for the necessity of doing the work at all involves an accusation greater than is the credit for having done it well.  Indeed, it is not for surrounding the walls with palisades, and not for tearing down the public tombs<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">We learn from the orator Lycurgus &lpar;<bibl>Lyc.

I pass by his corruption in the case of the Amphissians and Euboeans; but when you give Demosthenes the credit for the alliance with <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, you deceive the ignorant and insult the sensible and well informed.

Now what brought the gold was the crisis, and his fear, and his need of allies.  And this same thing it was that brought about the alliance with <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>.  But you, Demosthenes, tire us out with your everlasting talk of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> and of that most ill-starred alliance, while you are silent as to the seventy talents of the king's gold which you have seized and embezzled.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">It appears that when <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> refused the 300 talents which had been brought from the king of <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName> to help in organizing a revolt against Alexander, the Persian envoys put at least a part of the gold into Demosthenes' hands, in the expectation that he would use it in unofficial efforts against <placeName key="tgn,7002715">Macedon</placeName>.</note></p></div2>
                  <div2 n="240" type="section"><p>Was it not for lack of money, nay, for lack of five talents, that the mercenaries failed to deliver up the citadel to the Thebans?<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">After <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> revolted from Alexander, her citadel was still held by a garrison of his mercenaries.</note> And when all the Arcadians were mobilized and their leaders were ready to bring aid, did not the negotiations fail for want of nine talents of silver?<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">This accusation is elaborated in Deinarchus' speech against Demosthenes &lpar;<bibl>Dein. 1.18-21</bibl>&rpar;.
