<div2 id="cps1" type="paragraph" n="1">
<p>These chapters, expanded from a recent course of
Oxford lectures, will, I hope, do something to supply
what I believe to be a real want. Textual emendation
too often misses the mark through want of knowledge
of what may be called &ldquo;the rules of the game.&rdquo;
Too often it seems as if the only resource that were
known for emending a corrupt passage were to rewrite
the sentence in capitals, with no division between the
words, and then to look out for letters which may
have been confused with others of similar form. The
confusion of letters in minuscule script and the confusion
of contractions, especially minuscule contractions,
played an important part in the corruption of texts,
but are seldom recognised to a corresponding extent in
our attempts at emendation. All this I believe to be
due to the absence of a satisfactory handbook on the
subject. For Greek we have the excellent <title lang="la">Commentatio
Palaeographica</title> of Bast&mdash;a book not so widely known, I
fear, in this country as it deserves to be. But for
<pb n="vi"/>Latin I am not acquainted with any except Hagen's
<title lang="la">Gradus ad Criticen.</title></p>
<p>A handbook of the kind clearly should provide
suitably long lists of examples; and these, I think it
will be admitted, had best be taken, so far as possible,
from the MSS of a single author. After hesitating
for some time between Virgil and Plautus, I finally
decided to take my lists from Plautus, for reasons that
are stated in the introductory pages. I have occasionally
added examples from Nonius Marcellus on this
account:&mdash;In two of the oldest MSS of that author
we are fortunate enough to possess an archetype (the
Leyden codex) and a direct copy (the Laurentian),
while two others (the Harleian and the Escurial) are
direct copies of this copy; so that the course of corruption
of words, which only lets itself be inferred in
the texts of most authors, can in the case of Nonius
be actually seen. In connexion with the variety of
reading in Horace <bibl n="Hor. Carm. 1.1">C. i. 1. 7</bibl>, <foreign lang="la">mobilium</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">nobilium,</foreign> it is
interesting to find the word <foreign lang="la">mobilem</foreign> of the parent MS
miscopied as <foreign lang="la">nobilem</foreign> (see p. 76 of this handbook).</p>
<p>These lists of examples, along with other details
which may be omitted by less advanced students, I
have put in small type. In the portions in ordinary			<!-- typeface -->
print examples, when available to me, have been taken
by preference from more familiar authors&mdash;Virgil,
Horace, and the like. This arrangement of the book
in different sizes of type will, I hope, facilitate its use
<pb n="vii"/>in schools. Now that boys of the upper forms of our
schools are required to know something of manuscript
variants and modern scholars' emendations, it seems
desirable that they should be provided with an elementary
knowledge of the manner in which the classical
texts have been transmitted to us and the dangers
undergone in the course of transmission.</p>
<p>In the second Appendix I have made the experiment
of simplifying and interpreting what is to many
readers a mass of meaningless symbols, an <foreign lang="la">apparatus
criticus.</foreign> In the third a few simple directions are
given to any one making his first collation of a Latin
MS.</p>
<p>I cannot conclude without an expression of gratitude
to my friend, Mr. Falconer Madan, the University
Lecturer on Mediaeval Palaeography, for the generous
help which I have received from him in the preparation
of this manual.</p>

<head>Introduction</head>
<div2 id="cis1" type="paragraph" n="1">
<head>The Text of Plautus&mdash;its special value for the study of Textual Emendation</head>
<p>There is no Latin author the study of whose text has
at once such interest and such value for students of
textual emendation as Plautus. For the text of
Plautus is on the one hand not nearly so certain as
the text of Virgil, of which we have some half-dozen
complete or fragmentary MSS. dating from the third to
the sixth century, nor on the other so hopelessly uncertain
as the text of Propertius, of which no MS.
exists that is older than the thirteenth or fourteenth
century. It is still full of difficulties, in spite of the
labours of a large number of scholars for a large
number of years, though each month&mdash;I might almost
say each week&mdash;sees a difficulty removed; and now that
we have at last a full collation<note anchored="yes">In the large Teubner edition by Ritschl's three pupils, Loewe
(now dead), Goetz, and Schoell, the last volume of which appeared in
1894. Some additions and corrections will be found in the critical
apparatus of the small Teubner text by Goetz and Schoell (Leipzig
1893-6).</note> of all the important
MSS., we may hope to attain before long to a completely
satisfactory text.<note anchored="yes">The text which modern criticism seeks to discover is that of the
first edition or, as an ancient edition is generally called, &ldquo;recension&rdquo;
of Plautus, which is variously referred to the time of Varro by
Ritschl, and to the age of Hadrian by Leo (<title lang="de">Plautinische Forschungen</title>
chap. i).</note> The study of the text of
Plautus has thus all the fascination of a problem which
<pb n="2"/>has not yet been solved, but which evidently can, and
sooner or later must, be solved. Even an untrained
student may at any moment by an ingenious conjecture
remove a difficulty, and thereby open the way to the
resolution of a score of similar problems.</p></div2>
<div2 id="cis2" type="paragraph" n="2">
<head>Valuable minuscule manuscript of Plautus</head>
<p>And the text of Plautus offers peculiarly useful
material to the student of textual criticism from the
following reason. It is for the larger part, like the text
of most Latin authors, dependent on minuscule<note anchored="yes">The earliest Latin MSS. were written in capitals till the fifth
century. From the fourth century we find MSS. in uncials or
rounded capitals (e.g. <mentioned>V</mentioned> is the capital, <mentioned>U</mentioned> the uncial form). From the
eighth century onwards minuscule or small writing became universal&mdash;in
Italy Lombardic minuscule, in Spain Visigothic minuscule, in France
and Germany Caroline or Carolingian minuscule. This last variety, introduced
in the reign of Charlemagne, and brought to artistic perfection in
Alcuin's School of Calligraphy at Tours, is reproduced in our ordinary
printers' type. For at the Renaissance period in Italy there had been
a reversion to the early Caroline minuscule, and the first Italian
printers copied this, the ordinary book-hand of the time. In Germany,
on the other hand, the debased form of Caroline minuscule, known as
Gothie or Scholastic Minuscule, was in vogue at the era of the
invention of printing; and German printers cut their printing-blocks
in imitation of this less pleasing script.</note> MSS.
of the tenth and eleventh centuries. Now one of these
minuscule MSS. of Plautus has for a great portion of the
text extraordinary value. It has preserved with rare
fidelity the actual text of the archetype, leaving corruptions
as they stood, with scarcely any attempt to
remove them. It thus throws a wonderful amount of
light on the course taken by corruptions in minuscule
MSS., as an example or two will show. In the
<bibl n="Pl. Ps. 4.4"><title>Pseudolus</title> v. 1041</bibl> for <foreign lang="la">te nunc</foreign> the other minuscule MSS.
of Plautus read <foreign lang="la">lenonem.</foreign> Ballio, a <foreign lang="la">&ldquo;leno,&rdquo;</foreign> is one of the
characters in the <title>Pseudolus,</title> and the word <foreign lang="la">leno</foreign> is of
frequent occurrence throughout the play; but it is
plain that the sense of this line requires <foreign lang="la">te nunc,</foreign> and
that <foreign lang="la">lenonem</foreign> must be a corruption of these two words.
The change seems a violent one, and it does not at
<pb n="3"/>first sight appear how we could justify such an emendation
as <foreign lang="la">te nunc</foreign> where MSS. read <foreign lang="la">lenonem.</foreign> A glance
at the good codex shows us the intermediate step
between the two readings. It has <foreign lang="la">lenunc,</foreign> having faithfully
preserved the miswriting of the archetype&mdash;a miswriting
not uncommon in MSS. (<ref target="c6s1" targOrder="U">ch. vi. &sect; 1</ref>)&mdash;of <mentioned>l</mentioned> for <mentioned>t</mentioned>.
Correct this single letter, and the line reads smoothly and metrically:</p>
<l><quote lang="la">Mac&eacute;doniensem qu&iacute; te nunc flent&eacute;m facit.</quote></l>
<p>The writer of the copy from which the other MSS. are
derived, trying to emend the obvious corruption <foreign lang="la">lenunc,</foreign>
succeeded only in effacing all trace of the true reading.
Again, in <bibl n="Pl. Ps. 1.3">Pseud. 267</bibl> the other MSS. offer an impossible
ending of a trochaic tetrameter, <foreign lang="la">dextram</foreign>:
<foreign lang="la">s&iacute; lucri quid d&eacute;tur, potius r&eacute;m divinam &ldquo;dextram.&rdquo;</foreign>
The true reading is <foreign lang="la">deseram,</foreign> as we learn from the good
codex, which has <foreign lang="la">destram</foreign>, <mentioned>t</mentioned> having been substituted for
<mentioned>e</mentioned> in the archetype&mdash;a substitution which probably
dates from a time when the text was written in
capitals. Other instances from the <title>Stichus</title> are: <bibl n="Pl. St. 4.1">v. 573</bibl>
<foreign lang="la">possit</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">opus sit,</foreign> where the good codex has <foreign lang="la">opos sit,</foreign> this
being probably a trace of the old spelling<note anchored="yes">We have OPOS on an old inscription (<title>C. I. L.</title> i. 52 <foreign lang="la">C. Pomponi
Quir&lsqb;ina&rsqb; opos</foreign>). See my <title>Latin Language</title> p. 236.</note> of Plautus'
time; <bibl n="Pl. St. 1.3">v. 192</bibl> <foreign lang="la">nive repleverit</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">ni vere perierit,</foreign> where the
good codex has <foreign lang="la">ni vere perlerit.</foreign> Other examples with
the same wrong division of words may be seen in the
<title>Persa</title>: <bibl n="Pl. Per. 4.4">v. 587</bibl> <foreign lang="la">aequo mihi curat</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">aequom hic orat,</foreign> where
the intermediate stage is <foreign lang="la">aequo mihi corat</foreign>;  <bibl n="Pl. Per. 4.3">v. 546</bibl> <foreign lang="la">qui
aspexi equidem</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">quia specie quidem</foreign> through <foreign lang="la">qui aspeci
equidem.</foreign> These examples, which might be multiplied
indefinitely, may suffice to illustrate the part played by
this codex, which so faithfully interprets for us the
puzzling varieties of reading that are found in its
<pb n="4"/>fellow MSS. The text of most Latin authors depends
on minuscule MSS. precisely similar to the ordinary
minuscule MSS. of Plautus, but an &ldquo;interpreter&rdquo; codex
is usually lacking; and that is why a study of the
Plautine text is so valuable a training for the emendation
of other Latin writers. The MSS. of these will
offer us hundreds of readings like <foreign lang="la">lenonem</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">te nunc</foreign>,
<foreign lang="la">dextram</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">deseram</foreign>, <foreign lang="la">aequo mihi curat</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">aequom hic orat,</foreign>
leaving us without the slightest clue to the origin and
course of the corruption. And yet it is a palmary rule
of textual criticism that until we can indicate how and
why a proposed reading was altered to the reading of
the MSS., our emendation cannot be satisfactory or
convincing.</p></div2>
<div2 id="cis3" type="paragraph" n="3">
<head>Ambrosian Palimpsest in capitals</head>
<p>There is still another feature of the Plautine text
which makes a study of it peculiarly valuable training
for textual emendation. Unlike the texts of most Latin
authors, it is not dependent on minuscule MSS. alone,
but has for a considerable part of the plays (for almost
the whole indeed of four plays, the <title>Persa, Poenulus,
Pseudolus,</title> and <title>Stichus</title>) a MS. in capital letters of the
fourth century, the famous Palimpsest of the Ambrosian
Library at Milan. All minuscule MSS. have, of course,
originally come from capital or uncial texts; and a
comparison of the minuscule and majuscule texts of
these four plays shows us the nature and extent of the
corruptions which a text would commonly suffer in its
transmission from majuscule to minuscule form. Thus
from a variety of reasons the MSS. of Plautus are
capable of teaching us more about Latin textual
criticism than those of almost any other Latin
author.</p>
<p>It was the discovery of this ancient MS. of Plautus,
the Ambrosian Palimpsest, which opened the way to
the scientific study of the Plautine text, as at present
conducted on the lines laid down by Ritschl. Before
<pb n="5"/>it appeared on the scene such corruptions as were
shared by all the minuscule MSS. had the credit of
being genuine readings, because every known codex
agreed in exhibiting them. Against a &ldquo;consensus&rdquo; of
MSS. textual criticism was powerless. By the help of
the Palimpsest, however, which offered a new reading
in many of these corrupt passages, Ritschl was able to
prove that all that this &ldquo;consensus&rdquo; of MSS. implied
was that, with the exception of the newly-discovered
codex, all our MSS. belonged to one and the same
&ldquo;family&rdquo;&mdash;in other words, were derived ultimately
from one and the same archetype or original MS.
From an examination into their peculiarities this lost
original has been assigned to the eighth or ninth
century&mdash;no very early date. The readings, therefore,
which Ritschl's predecessors had not ventured to alter
appear to be nothing else than the corrupt readings of
a single minuscule MS. of Charlemagne's time or later.
The value of a &ldquo;consensus&rdquo; of MSS. receives thus a
convenient illustration from the MSS. of Plautus; for
the agreement of a mere pair&mdash;namely, the Ambrosian
with any one of the others&mdash;is of far more importance
than the agreement of all the minuscule codices that
we possess.</p></div2>

1896.</note>:&mdash;</p>
<p>The first eight plays in <title>B</title> and the first three and a half

tenth-century MS., now lost. But this part of <title>B</title> was corrected

original&mdash;a MS. possibly of the tenth or early eleventh
century, which was itself a copy of the original of <title>BD,</title> so
that their text is not of much value. The second part
of <title>B</title>, containing the last twelve plays, is probably copied
directly from the archetype. In the latter portion of
the MS. the task of copying was divided between a number
of scribes, to each of whom only a short piece of the
original was assigned, with the result that the last seven
plays <foreign lang="la">(Pseud., Poen., Pers., Rud., Stich., Trin., Truc.)</foreign> have been
copied with extraordinary fidelity (see above, p. 2). <title>C</title>
and <title>D</title> (last twelve plays) are copies, made apparently in
the same scriptorium, of a lost (ninth- or tenth-century?)
MS., which was probably, like <title>B,</title> a direct copy of the
archetype.</p>

we have&mdash;

<p>It is probable that <title>P,</title> the archetype, was directly copied
from a MS. in capitals (i.e. not later than the fifth century);
so that our authorities for the text of Plautus resolve themselves
into two ancient MSS. in capitals&mdash;one preserved,
though in a fragmentary condition, viz. the Ambrosian
Palimpsest; the other lost, viz. the original from which <title>P</title>
was copied.</p></div2>
<div2 id="cis5" type="paragraph" n="5">
<head>Using the manuscripts to establish the text</head>
<p>Where we have the evidence of <title>A,</title> the Ambrosian
Palimpsest (in capital script), as well as of <title>P,</title> the archetype
of all the other MSS. (in minuscule script), we are
seldom at a loss to find the true reading. The difficulty
is to elicit the genuine text from the evidence of
<title>P</title> alone; and, owing to the fragmentary state of the
Palimpsest, that is what we have to do in the greater
number of plays. The <title>Persa, Poenulus, Pseudolus,</title> and
<title>Stichus</title> are, as before remarked, the favourable exceptions.
The method, then, to be followed by the textual
critic of Plautus is obvious. He must observe the corruptions
which the evidence of <title>A</title> enables him to detect
in the <title>P</title>-text of these four plays and others, and
infer, by deduction from the known to the unknown,
that the same corruptions will be present in other parts
of the work where the evidence of <title>A</title> is wanting. An
example will make this clear. In <bibl n="Pl. Trin. 2.4">Trin. 556</bibl> the minuscule
MSS. <title>(BCD)</title> agree in reading
<quote lang="la"><l>Me tibi dixisse hoc. Dixisti tu arcano satis,</l></quote>
<quote lang="meter"><l>- w -- - --u --- u-</l></quote>
<pb n="9"/>
which will not scan. The Ambrosian Palimpsest, however,
offers <foreign lang="la">dixti</foreign> instead of <foreign lang="la">dixisti,</foreign> a change which makes
the line perfectly metrical:
<quote lang="la"><l>Me t&iacute;bi dixisse hoc. D&iacute;xti tu arcan&oacute; satis.</l></quote>
<quote lang="meter"><l>- w -- - -u --- u-</l></quote></p>
<p>Similarly eleven lines below, in <bibl n="Pl. Trin. 2.4">v. 567</bibl>, the minuscule
MSS. have the unmetrical line
<quote lang="la"><l>quid tecum, Stasime? De istoc quod dixisti modo.</l></quote>
<quote lang="meter"><l>- -- wu -- - --u u-</l></quote></p>
<p>Here again <title>A</title> reads <foreign lang="la">dixti,</foreign> a form which restores the
metre of the line:
<quote lang="la"><l>quid t&eacute;cum, Stasime? D&eacute; istoc quod dixt&iacute; modo.</l></quote>
<quote lang="meter"><l>- -- wu -- - -u u-</l></quote></p>
<p>Some lines farther on, in <bibl n="Pl. Trin. 3.1">v. 602</bibl>, we have in the minuscule
MSS. a line with an extra syllable:
<quote lang="la"><l>quomodo tu istuc, Stasime, dixisti nostrum erilem filium?</l></quote>
<quote lang="meter"><l>wu -- wu --u -w- -u-</l></quote></p>
<p>Here we have not the Palimpsest to help us; for the
leaf which contained this part of the play has been lost.
For all that, no one could for a moment question the
propriety of departing from the reading of all the
minuscule MSS., <foreign lang="la">dixisti,</foreign> and of substituting for it <foreign lang="la">dixti:</foreign>
<quote lang="la"><l>qu&oacute;modo tu istuc, St&aacute;sime, dixti n&oacute;strum erilem f&iacute;lium?</l></quote>
<quote lang="meter"><l>wu -- wu -u -w- -u-</l></quote></p>
<p>For the instances just quoted show that the scribe of
the archetype had a habit of writing <foreign lang="la">dixisti</foreign> instead of
<foreign lang="la">dixti.</foreign> This example is typical of the method which must
be followed in reconstructing the text where we have the
testimony of the minuscule MSS. only&mdash;in other words,
the text of the greater portion of the plays. From
the portion where we have the evidence of <title>A</title> to check
the evidence of <title>P</title> we must discover what are the besetting
sins of the <title>P</title>-scribe; for the probability is that
corruptions in the <title>P</title>-text in the remaining portion also
of the plays are due to the same mistakes.</p></div2>
<div2 id="cis6" type="paragraph" n="6">
<head>Classification of the prevalent errors in manuscripts</head>
<p>These prevalent mistakes of the minuscule MSS. of
Plautus we shall find to be the prevalent mistakes of
<pb n="10"/>all Latin MSS. They may be roughly classified under
seven headings:
<list type="simple" rend="numbered">
<item>Emendation</item>
<item>Transposition</item>
<item>Omission</item>
<item>Insertion</item>
<item>Substitution</item>
<item>Confusion of Letters</item>
<item>Confusion of Contractions</item>
</list>
Of these only the first class, errors of emendation, are
deliberate deviations from the text of the original; the
others are all ordinary unintentional mistakes of copying.
I propose to devote a chapter to each class, and
in each chapter, after explaining with a few examples
from various authors the nature and cause of the corruption,
to give a list of examples from the MSS. of
Plautus, and finally, by way of supplementing theory
with practice, to indicate certain passages of Plautus,
not yet satisfactorily emended, which seem to me to
exhibit the corruption in question.

<div1 id="c1" type="chapter" n="1">
<head>Errors of Emendation</head>
<div2 id="c1s1" type="paragraph" n="1">
<head>Deliberate emendation a feature of Renaissance MSS, not early minuscule MSS</head>
<p>It is in the MSS. of the fifteenth century, the
period of the Renaissance of classical studies, that
deliberate emendation has most usurped the place of
faithful reproduction of an original. Manuscripts were
at that time to a great extent written by scholars
themselves or under their supervision; and it was
regarded as the first duty of the preparer of a
MS. to furnish his readers with a text which was
correct in sense and grammar. The corruptions, real
or imaginary, of the original were silently emended;
and lacunae were filled up with words or whole lines,
suggested by the ingenuity of the scribe himself or of
the scholar whose directions he followed. The fifteenth-century
MSS. of Plautus which contain the last twelve
plays afford examples to the full. We know them to
have been copied from the &ldquo;Codex Ursinianus&rdquo; (<ref target="cis4" targOrder="U">p. 6</ref>),
and from no other source; and since their original is
preserved to us, we can estimate exactly the deviations
of each copy. Thus in <cit><bibl n="Pl. Ps. 4.6">Pseud. 1063</bibl>
<quote lang="la">viso quid rerum meus Ulixes egerit</quote></cit>,
the archetype of our minuscule MSS. had <foreign lang="la">qui</foreign> instead
of <foreign lang="la">quid</foreign> a common mistake (<ref target="c7s2" targOrder="U">ch. vii. &sect; 2</ref>). The
corruption <foreign lang="la">quirerum</foreign> is faithfully preserved in <title>B</title>, but
in the original of <title>CD</title> a new confusion ensued&mdash;the
<pb n="12"/>substitution of <mentioned>s</mentioned> for <mentioned>r</mentioned> (<ref target="c6s1" targOrder="U">ch. vi. &sect; 1</ref>), <foreign lang="la">quiserum.</foreign> This
<foreign lang="la">quiserum</foreign> the late copy boldly alters to <foreign lang="la">quid servus:</foreign>
<quote lang="la"><l>viso quid servus meus Ulixes egerit.</l></quote></p>
<p>Again, the missing scenes of the <title lang="la">Amphitruo</title> were supplied
by a Renaissance scholar, Hermolaus Barbarus,
with verses of his own; and these <foreign lang="la">scenae suppositae</foreign>
appear both in MSS. of the time and in the early
printed editions.<note anchored="yes">See Ritschl <foreign lang="la">Opuscula</foreign> ii. 46.</note></p>
<p>It is these practices of the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries which have brought MSS. of this period
under suspicion, and which attach uncertainty to any
text, such as the <title lang="la">Silvae</title> of Statius, for which we have
no older authority than Renaissance MSS., or the
poem on Prosody of Terentianus Maurus, for which we
have only the <foreign lang="la">&ldquo;editio princeps&rdquo;</foreign> (Milan, 1497).<note anchored="yes">Printed from a MS., now lost, from the Irish monastery of
Bobbio in N. Italy. Pliny's Letters to Trajan are not quite in this
category, now that jottings from the lost Paris MS. have been discovered
by Mr. E. G. Hardy in the margin of an early edition in the Bodleian
Library (see <foreign lang="la">Journal of Philology</foreign> xvii. 95).</note></p></div2>
<div2 id="c1s2" type="paragraph" n="2">
<head>The Carolingian copyists</head>
<p>The period of Charlemagne and his successors
was another period of revival of learning. But, as a
rule, the Carolingian monk-copyists confined their
emendation to matters of spelling and punctuation,
and have not played havoc with the text of Latin
authors to the extent of the Renaissance scribes.
Interpolations are scarcely to be found, except in
grammatical texts, like Priscian and Nonius; and
even there they are to be regarded more as marginal
jottings of additional examples of a word or fresh
illustrations of a grammatical rule, which accidentally
found their way in subsequent copies out of the margin
into the text.</p></div2>
<div2 id="c1s3" type="paragraph" n="3">
<head>Wrong correction of spelling</head>
<p>The first duty of a Carolingian monk-copyist
was to correct the barbarous spelling of his original.
<pb n="13"/>In late Latin <mentioned>e</mentioned> and <mentioned>i, o</mentioned> and <mentioned>u</mentioned> were in certain circumstances
pronounced alike, <mentioned>ct</mentioned> had assumed the sound of
<mentioned>tt, x</mentioned> of <mentioned>s,</mentioned> so that in manuscripts of the period preceding
the Revival of Learning under Charlemagne we find
barbarisms like <foreign lang="la">littoris</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">lectoris, creaturem</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">creatorem,
auxerint</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">hauserint.</foreign> An <mentioned>i</mentioned> was prefixed in late Vulgar
Latin to words beginning with <mentioned>sp, sc, st,</mentioned> and some other
consonants; a final <mentioned>-um</mentioned> was pronounced as <mentioned>o</mentioned>; and these
mispronunciations, which have left their mark on the
Romance languages (e.g. Fr. <foreign lang="fr">&eacute;cole</foreign> from Vulg. Lat. <foreign lang="la">i-schola,</foreign>
Ital. <foreign lang="it">vino</foreign> from Lat. <foreign lang="la">vinum</foreign>), perverted the spelling of
the illiterate Merovingian copyists. For the purpose
of weeding out these barbarisms from MSS. the Carolingian
scribes were provided with text-books on
orthography, one of the most widely used of which
was the <title lang="la">De Orthographia</title> of Alcuin, the head of the
famous monastery-college of Tours. This task they
performed on the whole extremely well; and we owe
it to these monks that the texts of Latin authors have
come down to us in a readable state. But mistakes
were unavoidable. Occasionally a scribe left a misspelling
uncorrected, when it had assumed the form of
a different word; as, for example, <foreign lang="la">littoris,</foreign> a misspelling
of <foreign lang="la">lectoris,</foreign> has the form of the genitive singular of <foreign lang="la">littus</foreign> (on
errors of this kind see <ref target="c5s7" targOrder="U">ch. v</ref>). Occasionally in excess
of zeal he altered a perfectly correct form under the
idea that it was a misspelling. Thus <mentioned>o,</mentioned> we have seen,
was the Late Latin equivalent of <mentioned>-um</mentioned> of the accusative singular
masculine and nominative/accusative singular neuter of the second declension,
and would be corrected by a Carolingian copyist
to <foreign lang="la">-um.</foreign> But in <cit><bibl n="Pl. Bac. 3.3">Bacch. 463</bibl> <quote lang="la">cave malum</quote></cit> of the MSS. may
be a wrong correction of the Plautine <foreign lang="la">cave malo</foreign> (cf.
<cit><bibl n="Pl. Per. 3.1">Pers. 369</bibl> <quote lang="la">malo cavere meliust te</quote></cit>), the scribe having
wrongly supposed <foreign lang="la">malo</foreign> to be the same late Latin misspelling
of <foreign lang="la">malum</foreign> as <foreign lang="la">vino</foreign> etc. (Ital. <foreign lang="it">vino</foreign>), of <foreign lang="la">vinum.</foreign>
Similarly the common Plautine adverb <foreign lang="la">fac&emacr;te</foreign> has
<pb n="14"/>been altered to <foreign lang="la">facite</foreign> (2nd plural imperative) in <bibl n="Pl. Mil. 4.4">Mil. 1141</bibl>,
<bibl n="Pl. Mil. 4.4">1161</bibl> etc.</p></div2>
<div2 id="c1s4" type="paragraph" n="4">
<head>Wrong separation of words</head>
<p>Besides correcting the spelling of his original, a
Carolingian scribe had to attend to the proper separation
of the words and to the punctuation of the sentence.
Punctuation, unless in a very rudimentary form,<note anchored="yes"><p>In a Lyons MS. of Origen, belonging to the sixth or seventh century,
and written partly in uncials, partly in half-uncials, we find that
spacing takes the place of punctuation signs. For example, the sentence
<foreign lang="la">omnis enim qui male agit, odit lucem</foreign> is written so:  OMNISENIMQUIMALEAGIT ODITLUCEM
(See the <title lang="fr">Album Pal&eacute;ographique</title>).</p></note> can
hardly be said to be known in Latin MSS. till the
Carolingian period; and although in the more carefully
written ancient MSS.<note anchored="yes">The words are not separated in the Ambrosian Palimpsest of
Plautus. Thus <cit><bibl n="Pl. Ps. 4.7">Pseud. 1173</bibl> <quote lang="la">quotumo die</quote></cit> (see below), is there written
QVOTVMODIE.</note> we find the words ticked off
from each other by dots, the separation of words in
Latin MSS. may be put down to the credit of minuscule
copyists.<note anchored="yes">Alcuin in one of his letters to Charlemagne urges the necessity of
these reforms (<title>Mon. Germ. Hist.</title> Epp. iv. p. 285):  <quote lang="la">punctorum vero
distinctiones vel subdistinctiones licet ornatum faciant pulcherrimum
in sententiis, tamen usus illorum propter rusticitatem paene recessit a
scriptoribus. Sed sicut totius sapientiae decus et salutaris eruditionis
ornatus per vestrae nobilitatis industriam renovari incipit, ita et horum
usus in manibus scribentium redintegrandus esse optime videtur</quote>.</note> A thorough separation, indeed, is not
found in the earlier minuscule MSS., for small words,
such as prepositions, pronouns, and particles, are
usually joined to longer neighbouring words, a practice
which is exemplified on every page of the Plautus MSS.
(e.g. <cit><bibl n="Pl. Capt. prologue.0">Capt. 10</bibl> <quote lang="la">inalide</quote></cit> <title>BDE</title>,
<cit><bibl n="Pl. Capt. prologue.0">34</bibl> <quote lang="la">depreda</quote></cit> <title>DEJ</title>, <foreign lang="la">dequestoribus</foreign>
<title>BDE</title>, for <foreign lang="la">in Alide, de praeda, de quaestoribus</foreign>).<note anchored="yes">Occasionally the final letter of the preposition has been assimilated
to the initial letter of the noun, just as in a compound verb we find,
e.g., <foreign lang="la">suppeto</foreign> from <foreign lang="la">sub peto, anno</foreign> from <foreign lang="la">ad no.</foreign> Thus <foreign lang="la">sub petaso,</foreign>
&ldquo;under a hat&rdquo; (<bibl n="Pl. Am. 1.prol">Amph. 145</bibl>), is in our MSS. <foreign lang="la">suppetaso;</foreign> and in <bibl n="Pl. Am. 1.1">v. 256</bibl>
of the same play <foreign lang="la">ad nos,</foreign> from being written <foreign lang="la">adnos,</foreign> has become <foreign lang="la">annos</foreign>!
A long list of instances of the kind, some of them ancient, will be
found in Heraeus <title lang="la">Quaestiones de Codd. Livianis</title> Berlin 1885 p. 32.</note> This has
<pb n="15"/>often led to the loss of these small dependents. For
example, in <cit><bibl n="Pl. Cas. 4.4">Cas. 854</bibl> <quote lang="la">i belle bellalula</quote></cit> the first word has
been lost in our existing minuscule MSS., probably
because <foreign lang="la">ibelle,</foreign> so written, was taken for the same barbarous
spelling of <foreign lang="la">belle</foreign> as <foreign lang="la">ischola,</foreign> quoted above, of
<foreign lang="la">schola</foreign>; in <cit><bibl n="Pl. Rud. 3.6">Rud. 875</bibl> <quote lang="la">obsecro me</quote></cit>, written <foreign lang="la">obsecrome,</foreign> has
become in <title>B</title> <foreign lang="la">obsecrom</foreign> and in <title>CD</title> <foreign lang="la">obsecro.</foreign></p>
<p>Keller <title lang="de">(Epilegomena zu Hora:)</title> explains the loss of <mentioned>i</mentioned> in a
class of Horace MSS. in <cit><bibl n="Hor. Carm. 3.11">C. iii. 11. 50:</bibl>
<quote lang="la"><lg type="sapphics"><l>dum favet nox et Venus, i secundo</l>

by the supposition that <mentioned>i</mentioned> was written with a point before and
after it, <mentioned>.i.</mentioned>, and that these points were mistaken for <foreign lang="la">puncta
delentia</foreign> (<ref target="c4s1" targOrder="U">ch. iv. &sect; 1</ref>, below).</p></div2>
<div2 id="c1s5" type="paragraph" n="5">
<head>Erroneous emendations</head>
<p>The wrong separation of words in MSS. can
sometimes be remedied by a stroke of the pen.
Madvig's brilliant restoration of a passage of Seneca's
<title>Epistles</title> (89. 4) is a well-known example: <quote lang="la">philosophia
unde dicta sit, apparet: ipso enim nomine fatetur <emph>quid
amet.</emph> Sapientiam ita quidam finierunt, ut dicerent
divinorum et humanorum sapientiam</quote>. In this passage
the QUIDAMET of the Archetype had been wrongly
broken up by a Carolingian scribe into <foreign lang="la">quidam et,</foreign> so
that the MSS. offered: <foreign lang="la">ipso enim nomine fatetur
quidam et sapientiam ita quidam finierunt</foreign>; and
modern editors printed: <foreign lang="la">ipso enim nomine fatetur.
Quidam et sapientiam ita * * quidam finierunt</foreign>, supposing
a sentence to have dropped out after <foreign lang="la">ita.</foreign>
Similarly in  <cit><bibl n="Hor. Carm. 1.35">Hor. C. i. 35. 34:</bibl>
<quote lang="la"><lg type="alcaics"><l>quid nos dura refugimus</l>
<l>aetas?</l></lg></quote></cit>
the <foreign lang="la">durare fugimus</foreign> of certain MSS. is easily emended.
But usually the wrong separation of words brought
other mistakes in its train. In the <title>Persa</title> of Plautus,
<pb n="16"/><bibl n="Pl. Per. 4.4">v. 587</bibl>, we have seen <ref target="cis2" targOrder="U">(p. 3)</ref> that <foreign lang="la">aequom hic orat,</foreign> &ldquo;he
talks justice,&rdquo; written AEQVOMHICORAT, was in the
Carolingian archetype of our minuscule MSS. wrongly
broken up into <foreign lang="la">aequo mhi (mihi) corat.</foreign> The natural
consequence was that copyists fancied this <foreign lang="la">corat</foreign> to be
a misspelling of <foreign lang="la">curat,</foreign> so that we have in the manuscripts
<title>C</title> and <title>D</title> <foreign lang="la">aequo mihi curat.</foreign> Another example has been
already quoted from <bibl n="Pl. Per. 4.3">v. 546</bibl> of the same play. <foreign lang="la">Quia
specie quidem,</foreign> written QVIASPECIEQVIDEM, was
broken up into <foreign lang="la">qui aspeci equidem,</foreign> and was changed &mdash; how
could it be otherwise? &mdash; to <foreign lang="la">qui aspexi equidem</foreign>, the
<foreign lang="la">aspeci</foreign> being taken for a misspelling of <foreign lang="la">aspexi.</foreign> A
curious instance is found in <bibl n="Pl. Men. 2.2">v. 288</bibl> of the <title>Menaechmi,</title>
where <foreign lang="la">opsonatu redeo,</foreign> &ldquo;I come back from catering for
dinner,&rdquo; appeared first as <foreign lang="la">opso nature deo,</foreign> then as <foreign lang="la">ipso
naturae deo.</foreign></p></div2>
<div2 id="c1s6" type="paragraph" n="6">
<head>&ldquo;Ghost words.&rdquo;</head>
<p>The point to notice about all these wrong emendations of the text, or rather wrong corrections of
what seemed to be misspellings, is the extreme facility with which they were produced. A Carolingian copyist,
accustomed to correct errors like <foreign lang="la">littoris</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">lectoris, vino</foreign>
for <foreign lang="la">vinum</foreign> etc. in every other line of a Merovingian
original, could hardly do anything else than change <foreign lang="la">qui
aspeci equidem</foreign> into <foreign lang="la">qui aspexi equidem, opso nature deo</foreign> into
<foreign lang="la">ipso naturae deo,</foreign> or in <cit><bibl n="Pl. Ps. 4.7">Pseud. 1173</bibl> <quote lang="la">quo tum odie</quote></cit> (for
<foreign lang="la">quofumo die</foreign>) into <foreign lang="la">quo tum hodie.</foreign> Once that the first
error had been made, the error of not &ldquo;visualising&rdquo;
properly QVOTVMODIE as <foreign lang="la">quotumo die,</foreign> the further
development of the corruption followed as a matter of course. If, on the other hand, a miswriting in the
original was not recognised to be a miswriting, but was copied faithfully as it stood by successive generations
of scribes, a non-existent form might become perpetuated in MSS. A good example of this is a miswriting
of the Vulgate in the book of <cit><bibl n="Job 19.23">Job, ch. xix.
23-24:</bibl> <quote lang="la">quis mihi det ut (sermones mei) exarentur in
<pb n="17"/>stylo ferreo et plumbi lamina vel <emph>celte</emph> sculpantur in
silice?</quote></cit> Here <foreign lang="la">celte</foreign> is apparently nothing but a miswriting
of the adverb <foreign lang="la">certe.</foreign> There seems to be no such
word as <foreign lang="la">celte</foreign> in Latin. And yet this miswriting not
only survived successive generations of copyists, but
has actually established itself as a word of our language.
In archaeological books the term &ldquo;celt&rdquo; is of frequent
occurrence, meaning a particular kind of cutting instrument
which is found among the remains of prehistoric
man (see <title>The Oxford English Dictionary</title> s.v.)</p>
<p>Other familiar examples of &ldquo;ghost-words,&rdquo; as these
are called, are&mdash;&ldquo;Grampian,&rdquo; from a miswriting of <foreign lang="la">Mons
Graupius</foreign> in <bibl n="Tac. Ag. 29">Tacitus Agr. 29</bibl>; &ldquo;Boadicea,&rdquo; a scribe's
error for <foreign lang="la">Boudicca</foreign>;  Virgil's <foreign lang="la">Inarime</foreign> (<bibl n="Verg. A. 9.716"><title>Aen.</title> ix. 716</bibl>), from
a misapprehension of Homer's <foreign lang="greek">ei)n *)ari/mois</foreign> (<bibl n="Hom. Il. 2.783"><title>Il.</title> ii. 783</bibl>)
as one word, <foreign lang="greek">*ei)nari/mois</foreign>. An example from Plautus
MSS. is found in <bibl n="Pl. Poen. 5.5">Poen. 1301</bibl>, where the word <foreign lang="la">bajulus,</foreign>
&ldquo;a porter,&rdquo; written in the older spelling <foreign lang="la">baiiolus,</foreign> became
in the archetype of our minuscule MSS. <foreign lang="la">baliolus,</foreign> through
the common confusion of <mentioned>i</mentioned> with <mentioned>l</mentioned> (<ref target="c6s1" targOrder="U">ch. vi. &sect; 1</ref>). This
miswriting <foreign lang="la">baliolus</foreign> has found its way into a good many
Latin dictionaries, and has been provided not only with
more than one meaning, but also with more than one
etymology!</p></div2>
<div2 id="c1s7" type="paragraph" n="7">
<head>Modernising of archaic forms</head>
<p>The text of Plautus, with its numerous archaic
forms and constructions, has unfortunately suffered
greatly at the hands of mediaeval scribes. For example,
in the Latin of Plautus' day <foreign lang="la">ill&imacr;c,</foreign> as well as <foreign lang="la">illi,</foreign> was
dative singular of <foreign lang="la">ille; illi,</foreign> as well as <foreign lang="la">ill&imacr;c,</foreign> was the adverb
(originally locative singular of <foreign lang="la">ille</foreign>) &ldquo;there.&rdquo; But when a
Carolingian copyist found the O. Lat. <foreign lang="la">illic</foreign> dative singular in
his original, he naturally took it for a barbarous misspelling;
and relying on the rule of his text-book of
orthography that <foreign lang="la">illi</foreign> was the dative singular, <foreign lang="la">ill&imacr;c</foreign> the adverb,
he would usually substitute <foreign lang="la">illi</foreign> without hesitation.
For the O. Lat. adverb <foreign lang="la">illi</foreign> he would similarly write
<pb n="18"/><foreign lang="la">illic</foreign> in his copy. In a few cases the metre shows us
that a change of this kind has been made. Thus in
<cit><bibl n="Pl. Am. 1.1">Amph. 249:</bibl> <quote lang="la">namque &eacute;go fui illi in r&eacute; praesenti et m&eacute;us quom pugnat&uacute;mst pater,</quote></cit>
&ldquo;for I was there at the action itself, and so was my
father, when the fight took place.&rdquo; Here the minuscule
MSS. offer <foreign lang="la">illic</foreign>;  but since the metre (iambic
tetrameter acatalectic) requires the form <foreign lang="la">illi,</foreign> we can
be sure that <foreign lang="la">illic</foreign> is a scribe's substitution for the <foreign lang="la">illi</foreign> of
his original (cf. <bibl n="Pl. Capt. 2.2">Capt. 277-9</bibl>). This is in fact the leading
principle of Ritschl's treatment of the text of Plautus&mdash;the
restoration to the text of the archaic forms of Plautine
Latin, which had been silently changed to the
classical forms by mediaeval scribes. Thus in <bibl n="Pl. Mer. 1.1">Merc.
46</bibl>, where the minuscule MSS. agree in reading <foreign lang="la">objurgare,</foreign>
Ritschl made the line (an iambic trimeter) metrical by
reading <foreign lang="la">objurigare</foreign>:
<quote lang="la"><l>obj&uacute;rigare p&aacute;ter haec noctes &eacute;t dies</l></quote>,
<quote lang="meter"><l>--u-u w - -u - u-</l></quote>
&ldquo;my father used to censure this night and day,&rdquo; the
old form <foreign lang="la">obj&umacr;r&icaron;go</foreign> being attested by MSS. in other
passages, e.g. by <title>A</title> in <cit><bibl n="Pl. Trin. 1.2">Trin. 70:</bibl>
<quote lang="la">nem&oacute;st. Quid tu igitur r&oacute;gitas, tene obj&uacute;rigem?</quote></cit>
&ldquo;No one. Why ask then if it is you I censure?&rdquo;
When we look at the passages of Plautus which the
Latin grammarians quote in illustration of archaic
forms, we see to what an extent these archaic forms
have been modernised in the course of transmission.
Festus cites <foreign lang="la">termentum,</foreign> a derivative of <foreign lang="la">tero,</foreign> from the
<title>Bacchides</title>; but in <bibl n="Pl. Bac. 4.9">Bacch. 929</bibl>, clearly the line referred
to, <foreign lang="la">non pedibus termento fuit,</foreign> &ldquo;was not rough enough to
hurt the feet,&rdquo; we find <foreign lang="la">tormento</foreign> substituted in all the
minuscule MSS., though <title>A</title>, the Ambrosian Palimpsest,
<pb n="19"/>retains <foreign lang="la">termento.</foreign> The Palimpsest, however, is as guilty
as the other MSS. in other passages&mdash;such as <bibl n="Pl. Epid. 1.1">Epid. 10</bibl>,
quoted both by Festus and by Donatus for the archaic
adjective <foreign lang="la">habitus,</foreign> &ldquo;in good condition, stout&rdquo;:
<quote lang="la">c&oacute;rpulenti&oacute;r videre atque h&aacute;bitior. Huic gr&aacute;tia</quote>,
&ldquo;you seem stouter and in better liking. Thanks to
this (thieving hand of mine),&rdquo; where <title>A</title> has <foreign lang="la">abilior.</foreign> To
a fourth-century scribe, like the scribe of <title>A</title>, these old
forms, <foreign lang="la">habitus, illi</foreign> adverbial, <foreign lang="la">illic</foreign> dative, etc., would be almost
as unknown as to a Carolingian scribe. As a matter of
fact we have in the minuscule MSS. quite as many
archaic forms as in <title>A.</title> Sometimes they are preserved
by all the minuscule MSS., e.g. <bibl n="Pl. Men. 2.3">Men. 405</bibl> <foreign lang="la">semul</foreign> (class.
<foreign lang="la">simul</foreign>); sometimes by <title>B</title> alone, e.g. <bibl n="Pl. St. 2.2">Stich. 383</bibl> <foreign lang="la">poste</foreign>
(<foreign lang="la">post haec</foreign> <title>CD</title>, <foreign lang="la">postea</foreign> <title>A</title>), <bibl n="Pl. Ps. 1.3">Pseud. 386</bibl>
<foreign lang="la">ecfecta</foreign> (<foreign lang="la">haec facta</foreign> <title>CD</title>,
<foreign lang="la">effecta</foreign> <title>A</title>). And in a large number of instances a trace,
sometimes a very faint one, is preserved of a lost
archaism: e.g. in <bibl n="Pl. Cas. 2.6">Cas. 380</bibl>, quoted by Priscian for the
old nominative singular <foreign lang="la">sortis,</foreign> &ldquo;a lot,&rdquo; the words <foreign lang="la">alia sortis,</foreign>
&ldquo;another lot,&rdquo; are represented in <title>BVE</title> by <foreign lang="la">alias oris;</foreign>
and we can see that the old form <foreign lang="la">aiio</foreign> (class. <foreign lang="la">aio</foreign>) stood
in the archetype in <cit><bibl n="Pl. Cas. prologue.0">Cas. 71:</bibl>
<quote lang="la">at ego aiio id fieri in Gra&eacute;cia et Carth&aacute;gini</quote></cit>;
for <title>B</title> has <foreign lang="la">alio,</foreign> which in <title>VE</title> is changed to <foreign lang="la">alia</foreign> (to agree
with <foreign lang="la">Graecia</foreign>), and in <title>J</title> (as in <title>A</title>) is <foreign lang="la">aio.</foreign> The <title lang="la">Noctes
Atticae</title> of Aulus Gellius (second century a.d.) are full
of complaints about scribes of the time, who altered,
e.g., <foreign lang="la">majores vestrum</foreign> (<bibl n="Sal. Cat. 33.3">Sallust Cat. xxxiii. 3</bibl>) into <foreign lang="la">majores
vestri, vadimonium stitisses</foreign> (Cato) into <foreign lang="la">vadimonium stetisses,
quadrupes eques</foreign> (Ennius) into <foreign lang="la">quadrupes equus</foreign>; so that
we can see that this form of error in MSS. was of an
early date, and that mediaeval scribes are not the only offenders in this respect.</p>
<p>The modernising of archaic forms is carried out to a
<pb n="20"/>great extent in the MSS. of Plautus, and the student of
Plautine textual criticism must bestow great attention on
this point. But since most of the examples that might be
quoted in illustration (for a fuller list of them see <ref target="cas9" targOrder="U">Appendix
A</ref>) are peculiar to archaic Latin authors, it will be sufficient
to mention those which are commonly found in MSS. of
Cicero, Virgil, and the like.
<list type="simple" rend="numbered">
<item><mentioned rend="bold">ii for i.</mentioned>&mdash;An early grammarian (Velius Longus) tells
us that Cicero was in the habit of writing with double <mentioned>i</mentioned>
words like <foreign lang="la">Maia, Ajax,</foreign> where an <mentioned>i (j)</mentioned> stood between two
vowels. In MSS. of Cicero we find that this archaic spelling
has proved a stumbling-block to scribes. Thus <foreign lang="la">eiius</foreign> for
<foreign lang="la">ejus</foreign> has become in <bibl n="Cic. Mil. 16">Milo. 7. 16</bibl> <foreign lang="la">ei jus</foreign>,
in <bibl n="Cic. Fam. 6.2.1">Fam. vi. 2. 1</bibl> <foreign lang="la">et
jus,</foreign> in <bibl n="Cic. Att. 8.4.1">Att. viii. 4. 1</bibl> <foreign lang="la">ei vis.</foreign> (Leo ad Plaut. <bibl n="Pl. Mil. 4.6">Mil. 1274</bibl> cites
<foreign lang="la">melius</foreign> as a corruption of <foreign lang="la">eiius.</foreign>)</item>
<item><mentioned rend="bold">st for est.</mentioned>&mdash;Early grammarians (e.g. Marius Victorinus)
recommend the curtailed spelling of the substantive verb in
<foreign lang="la">audiendust</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">audiendus est, audiendast</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">audienda est,
audiendumst</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">audiendum est,</foreign> etc. Spellings of the kind
have usually been altered by mediaeval scribes, who sometimes
rightly understand the contraction and expand the
<foreign lang="la">-st</foreign> to the full form <foreign lang="la">est,</foreign> but often pervert <foreign lang="la">st</foreign>
to <foreign lang="la">sit</foreign> or <foreign lang="la">si,</foreign> or
even <foreign lang="la">sim</foreign> (written in MSS. <foreign lang="la">s&imacr;</foreign>), or <foreign lang="la">sunt</foreign> (written in MSS. <foreign lang="la">st</foreign>
with a line above). Thus in <bibl n="Pl. Ps. 1.5">Pseud. 448</bibl> <foreign lang="la">insipientiast,</foreign> &ldquo;it is
folly,&rdquo; is rightly written in the Palimpsest INSIPIENTIAST,
but in the minuscule MSS. is <foreign lang="la">insipientia (-cia) si</foreign> (cf. <bibl n="Pl. Mos. 3.2">Most. 701</bibl>).</item>
<item><mentioned rend="bold">-is Accusative Plural</mentioned>&mdash;The usual form of the accusative plural of
I-stems in good authors has <foreign lang="la">-is,</foreign> e.g. <foreign lang="la">civis, navis.</foreign> This is
very often altered by mediaeval copyists to <foreign lang="la">-es;</foreign> though the
remark of Aulus Gellius (<title>Noct. Att.</title> xiii. 21. 3-5) that
Virgil wrote <foreign lang="la">urbis</foreign> in <cit><bibl n="Verg. G. 1.25"><title>Georg.</title> i. 25:</bibl> <quote lang="la">urbisne invisere, Caesar</quote></cit>
etc., but <foreign lang="la">urbes</foreign> in <cit><bibl n="Verg. A. 3.106"><title>Aen.</title> iii. 106:</bibl> <quote lang="la">centum urbes habitant magnas</quote></cit>,
shows us the danger of correcting each and every form in <foreign lang="la">-es</foreign> to the form in <foreign lang="la">-is.</foreign></item>
<item><mentioned rend="bold">-os, -om for -us, -um.</mentioned>&mdash;In Late Latin, as we have
seen, <mentioned>u</mentioned> and <mentioned>o</mentioned> were in certain cases interchanged in pronunciation
and writing; e.g. <foreign lang="la">vinum</foreign> was pronounced and
written <foreign lang="la">vino</foreign> (cf. Italian <foreign lang="it">vino</foreign>). A Carolingian scribe might
<pb n="21"/>easily mistake a genuine form like <foreign lang="la">equom</foreign> or <foreign lang="la">servos,</foreign> nominative
singular, for a Merovingian misspelling, and substitute <foreign lang="la">equum,
servus.</foreign> In classical Latin <mentioned>o</mentioned>, the older vowel, was used
after another <mentioned>u</mentioned> or after the consonant <mentioned>v</mentioned>, but in the Latin of
Plautus' time the old spelling was retained in many other
situations beside. It is not always easy to feel certain that
an <mentioned>o</mentioned> which takes the place of <mentioned>u</mentioned> in the MSS. of Plautus is a
genuine survival of the Old Latin form (e.g. <foreign lang="la">opos sit</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">opus
sit</foreign>, which has become corrupted to <foreign lang="la">possit</foreign> in <bibl n="Pl. St. 4.1">Stich. 573</bibl>;
see above, <ref target="cis2" targOrder="U">p. 3</ref>), or a mere instance of the Late Latin use
of <mentioned>o</mentioned> for <mentioned>&ubreve;</mentioned>. Similarly <mentioned>e</mentioned> for <mentioned lang="la">i</mentioned> in Plautus MSS. is a survival
of the early form in <foreign lang="la">semul,</foreign> <foreign lang="la">&ldquo;simul,&rdquo;</foreign> <bibl n="Pl. Men. 2.3">Men. 405</bibl>, and the like,
but may sometimes date only from the Late Latin period
when <mentioned>&ibreve;</mentioned> had become <mentioned>e</mentioned> (cf. <ref target="c5s9" targOrder="U">ch. v. &sect; 9</ref>).</item>
<item><mentioned rend="bold">quoi,</mentioned> the spelling in vogue in the youth of Quintilian
(<bibl n="Quint. Inst. 1.7.27">i. 7. 27</bibl>), is, if understood by the scribe, corrected to <foreign lang="la">cui;</foreign>
if not understood, it often becomes <foreign lang="la">quo</foreign> or <foreign lang="la">qui</foreign> (cf. <bibl n="Pl. Bac. 1.2">Bacch. 126</bibl>,
<bibl n="Pl. Bac. 2.2">225</bibl>, <bibl n="Pl. Bac. 4.3">617</bibl>).</item>
<item><mentioned rend="bold">Unassimilated Prepositions in Compounds.</mentioned>&mdash;A
scribe was always prone to correct forms like <foreign lang="la">subpeto, adpeto</foreign>
etc. to <foreign lang="la">suppeto, appeto</foreign> etc., and in this respect has often
effaced the traces of the spelling of his original. On the other hand, he may often by this change have unconsciously
reverted to the older spelling; for the assimilated forms are often those used by the ancient writer himself (e.g.
Plautus used the form <foreign lang="la">assum</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">adsum,</foreign> and makes a
pun with it on <foreign lang="la">assum,</foreign> &ldquo;roasted,&rdquo; in <bibl n="Pl. Poen. 1.2">Poen. 279</bibl>), while the
unassimilated forms have been foisted into the text by grammarians and editors of the Empire. The same is
true of spellings like <foreign lang="la">quot</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">quod, set</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">sed</foreign>&mdash;spellings
which are generally corrected by Carolingian scribes, and which may in many cases not be really ancient. (For examples
in <title>A</title> see Studemund's Index.)  The assimilation of prepositions in compound verbs
often led to corruptions. Thus <foreign lang="la">conjecti</foreign> in <bibl n="Liv. 36.12.4">Livy xxxvi.
12. 4</bibl>, misread as <foreign lang="la">conlecti</foreign> (<ref target="c6s1" targOrder="U">ch. vi. &sect; 1</ref>), has become <foreign lang="la">collecti;
conjecere</foreign> in <bibl n="Liv. 30.5.4">Livy xxx. 5. 4</bibl>, misread <foreign lang="la">conlecere,</foreign> has become
<foreign lang="la">collegere</foreign> (see Heraeus, l.c.)
<pb n="22"/></item>
<item><mentioned rend="bold">ec- for ex- in Compounds before f.</mentioned>&mdash;The spellings
<foreign lang="la">ecfero, ecfugio</foreign> etc. were a puzzle to mediaeval scribes, who
generally replace them with <foreign lang="la">haec fero, et fero,</foreign> or the like.
Thus in <bibl n="Pl. Ps. 1.3">Pseud. 386</bibl>, as we have seen, <foreign lang="la">ecfecta</foreign> is retained by
<title>B</title> alone, while <title>C</title> and <title>D</title> have <foreign lang="la">haec facta.</foreign> (On the similarity
of <foreign lang="la">ec</foreign> to <foreign lang="la">et</foreign> in minuscule see <ref target="c6s1" targOrder="U">ch. vi. &sect; 1</ref>.)</item>
<item><mentioned rend="bold">iis for eis.</mentioned>&mdash;The dative and ablative plural of the demonstrative
<foreign lang="la">is,</foreign> when in the form <foreign lang="la">iis</foreign> or <foreign lang="la">is,</foreign> are often changed to
<foreign lang="la">his.</foreign> The correction in MSS. written in Caroline minuscules
is commonly made by writing above the initial <foreign lang="la">i</foreign> the sign of
the Greek rough breathing (see <ref target="c2s7" targOrder="U">ch. ii. &sect; 7</ref>).<note anchored="yes">e.g. in the early tenth-century MS. of Cicero <foreign lang="la">de Oratore</foreign> in the
British Museum (Harl. 2736) this correction has frequently been
made by a contemporary hand.</note></item>
<item><mentioned rend="bold">-umus for -imus.</mentioned>&mdash;The change was made at the
close of the Republic, e.g. <foreign lang="la">maxumus (-imus), vicensumus (-cesimus).</foreign></item>
<item><mentioned rend="bold">-undus</mentioned> for <mentioned rend="bold">-endus</mentioned> in gerundive.</item>
<item><mentioned rend="bold">-rier</mentioned> for <mentioned rend="bold">-ri</mentioned> in inf. pass., e.g. <bibl n="Pl. Mos. 1.2">Most. 117</bibl>.</item>
</list></p></div2>
<div2 id="c1s8" type="paragraph" n="8">
<head>Change of unfamiliar to familiar word</head>
<p>Not only an archaic form but any unfamiliar
word was liable to be changed by a scribe. Taking
it for a mere misspelling, he would substitute for it
some similar word which was familiar to him. In fact
most textual corruptions might be included under the
category of change of unfamiliar to familiar words;
and it is a cardinal law of textual emendation that
the form found by the scribe in his original must be
supposed to have been a form less easy to understand
or construe than the form which he substituted for it
in his copy. In <bibl n="Pl. Mil. 3.2">Mil. 831</bibl> the unfamiliar word <foreign lang="la">h&emacr;m&imacr;nas,</foreign>
&ldquo;pints,&rdquo; has become <foreign lang="la">feminas</foreign> in our minuscule MSS.;
in <bibl n="Pl. Mil. 4.4">Mil. 1178</bibl> <foreign lang="la">sc&ubreve;t&ubreve;lam,</foreign> &ldquo;an eye-shade,&rdquo; has become
<foreign lang="la">cultura;</foreign> and so on. The Latin interjections often
puzzled mediaeval scribes. Thus <foreign lang="la">heus</foreign> has been
changed to <foreign lang="la">ejus</foreign> in <bibl n="Pl. Men. 4.2">Men. 673</bibl> (cf. <bibl n="Pl. Men. 5.2">Men. 836</bibl>; <bibl n="Pl. Mil. 4.8">Mil. 1358</bibl>).
Greek words too, which were often written in Latin
letters, are curiously transformed. The salutation
<pb n="23"/><foreign lang="greek">xai=re</foreign> appears as <foreign lang="la">care</foreign> in MSS. of <bibl n="Cic. Fin. 1.3.9">Cicero Fin. i. 3. 9</bibl>;
<foreign lang="greek">nai\ ga/r</foreign>, written <foreign lang="la">necar</foreign> (<bibl n="Pl. Bac. 5.2">Bacch. 1162</bibl>), has been emended
by a scribe to <foreign lang="la">ne carpe.</foreign> And names of persons and
places suffer in the MSS. of Plautus as they do in all
MSS.; e.g. in <cit><bibl n="Pl. Men. 5.9">Men. 1112</bibl> <quote lang="la">ut abii Tarentum</quote></cit> has been
changed by one scribe to <foreign lang="la">ut habitarem tum.</foreign></p>
<p>To guard against mistakes with a proper name, a
horizontal line was often drawn above it in MSS. This
line seems to have been mistaken by the scribe of the
Ambrosian Palimpsest for a contraction-sign in <cit><bibl n="Pl. Cas. 5.4">Cas. 994</bibl>
<quote lang="la">Hector Ilius</quote></cit>, where the Palimpsest has <foreign lang="la">ecastor illius,</foreign> the
scribe supposing that ECTOR with over-line was a contraction of <foreign lang="la">ecastor.</foreign>
The confusion of <foreign lang="la">Ilium</foreign> with <foreign lang="la">illum, Ilio</foreign> with <foreign lang="la">illo,</foreign> etc., is of
frequent occurrence in MSS. (cf. <ref target="c6s1" targOrder="U">ch. vi. &sect; 1</ref>; <ref target="c5s12" targOrder="U">ch. v. &sect; 12</ref>).
Examples of this and other confusions of proper names
are given by Madvig in his <title lang="la">Adversaria Critica</title> i. pp. 71, 125 <foreign lang="la">sqq.</foreign></p></div2>
<div2 id="c1s9" type="paragraph" n="9">
<head>Grammatical corrections</head>
<p>Sometimes it is the grammatical construction of the sentence which has been altered through being
unintelligible to the scribe. The use of the ablative
with <foreign lang="la">facio,</foreign> &ldquo;offer sacrifice,&rdquo; in <cit><bibl n="Verg. Ecl. 3">Virg. <title>E.</title> iii. 77</bibl> <quote lang="la">cum
faciam vitula</quote></cit>, was not understood by copyists, who
have changed <foreign lang="la">vitula</foreign> to <foreign lang="la">vitulam.</foreign> Similarly the Plautine
use of the adverb was not recognised in <bibl n="Pl. As. 4.1">Asin. 807</bibl>,
where <foreign lang="la">quot pure habuerit</foreign> has been altered to <foreign lang="la">quot puras
habuerit,</foreign> with <foreign lang="la">puras</foreign> made to agree with the word in
the previous part of the line, <foreign lang="la">noctes.</foreign></p></div2>
<div2 id="c1s10" type="paragraph" n="10">
<head>Assimilation of ending</head>
<p>We may include under the head of grammatical corrections the assimilation of one ending to another.
For instance, <bibl n="Pl. Mil. 3.1">Mil. 631</bibl> <foreign lang="la">albicapillus,</foreign> written in the
archetype <foreign lang="la">albi capillus,</foreign> has become <foreign lang="la">albus capillus.</foreign> But
this is often a mere clerical error. Thus <cit><bibl n="Pl. Mil. 3.1">Mil. 630</bibl>
<quote lang="la">clare oculis video</quote></cit> was wrongly written <foreign lang="la">claris oculis video,</foreign>
evidently because the writer's mind wandered to the termination of the neighbouring word, and not because
he thought <foreign lang="la">clare</foreign> to be a miswriting of <foreign lang="la">claris.</foreign>
<pb n="24"/></p></div2>
<div2 id="c1s11" type="paragraph" n="11">
<head>Change of objectionable words</head>
<p>An error of deliberate emendation, not exemplified, I believe, in the MSS. of Plautus, is the change
of objectionable words. Many examples of this are found in a ninth-century Paris MS. containing extracts
from Martial; on which see the preface to Schneidewin's edition of Martial p. lxxxv.</p></div2>
<div2 id="c1s12" type="paragraph" n="12">
<head>Metrical emendations</head>
<p>As instance of a metrical emendation we may take
<cit><bibl n="Juv. 8.148">Juvenal viii. 148:</bibl> <quote lang="la"><l>ipse rotam adstringit sufflamine mulio consul.</l></quote></cit>
The word <foreign lang="la">mulio</foreign> having been miswritten <foreign lang="la">multo</foreign> (<ref target="c6s1" targOrder="U">ch. vi.
&sect; 1</ref>), the line was emended in our MSS. to <foreign lang="la">multo sufflamine
consul</foreign> to save the metre. Such emendations are rare in Plautus MSS., and where they do occur, cannot
be referred to mediaeval scribes; for these were ignorant of Plautine metre. They belong rather to ancient
editions or recensions of the plays.</p></div2>
<div2 id="c1s13" type="paragraph" n="13">
<head>Completion of a quotation</head>
<p>Nor can we exemplify from Plautus MSS. a not infrequent case of interpolation&mdash;namely, the
addition of words for the purpose of completing a quotation. For instance, a passage of Virgil (<bibl n="Verg. A. 6.577"><title>A.</title> vi.
577</bibl>) is quoted by Nonius Marcellus (229 M. 28) in
illustration of the word <foreign lang="la">Tartarus:</foreign>
<quote lang="la"><lg type="hexameter"><l>tum Tartarus ipse</l>
<l>bis patet in praeceps tantum.</l></lg></quote>
This is the form in which Nonius seems to have quoted the passage, and the form in which it is found
in the ninth-century Leyden MS. of Nonius. But in the Laurentian MS., belonging to the end of the ninth or
the beginning of the tenth century&mdash;a MS. which seems to be a direct copy of the Leyden codex&mdash;the second
line is completed with the letters <foreign lang="la">t. q. s. a.,</foreign> standing for
<foreign lang="la">tenditque sub auras.</foreign><note anchored="yes">The reading <foreign lang="la">auras</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">umbras</foreign>
in this line is found in MSS. of Virgil.</note></p></div2>
<div2 id="c1s14" type="paragraph" n="14">
<head>Adaptation to parallel passage</head>
<p>Very similar to this is another error&mdash;namely,
<pb n="25"/>the adaptation of a passage of an author to a parallel passage found in the same or another author. St.
Jerome complains that in some MSS. of the Gospels the description of an event in one Gospel was altered or
amplified in order to bring it into exact agreement with the description of the same event in another Gospel:
<quote lang="la" rend="blockquote">magnus hic in codicibus error inolevit, dum quod in
eadem re alius evangelista plus dixit, in alio, quia
minus putaverint, addiderunt. vel dum eundem
sensum alius aliter expressit, ille qui unum e quattuor
primum legerat, ad ejus exemplum ceteros quoque
aestimaverit emendandos. unde accidit ut apud nos
mixta sint omnia, et in Marco plura Lucae atque
Matthaei, rursum in Matthaeo plura Joannis et Marci,
et in ceteris reliquorum, quae aliis propria sunt, inveniantur.</quote>
The error has often arisen through the practice of transcribing parallel passages on the margin,
whence the divergent reading has found its way into the text. Often too it is a mere slip of memory on the
part of the scribe, who in transcribing one passage had let his thoughts wander to the diction of a similar
passage. On this form of error see <ref target="c5s5" targOrder="U">ch. v. &sect; 5</ref>.</p></div2>
<div2 id="c1s15" type="paragraph" n="15">
<head>Completion of argument or construction</head>
<p>Of additions to complete the argument, or to

kind. The change of <foreign lang="la">et spiritu</foreign> to <foreign lang="la">sed quae spiritu</foreign> in a

clearly the emendation of a monk-copyist.</p>
<p>The British Museum MS. of Plautus <title>(J),</title> a twelfth-century
MS., is a copy of a lost codex which was professedly an
<pb n="26"/>&ldquo;emended&rdquo; version. The writer of this lost MS., perhaps
an abbot of a monastery, wrote at the end an epigram of his
own composition, which has been reproduced in the British
Museum copy:
<quote lang="la"><lg type="hexameter"><l>exemplar mendum<note anchored="yes" place="inline" lang="en">(Corrupt.)</note> tandem me compulit ipsum</l>

<l>ne graphicus mendis proprias idiota repertis</l>
<l>adderet, et liber hic falso patre falsior esset.</l></lg></quote>
The result of the learned abbot's interference has been
that <title>J</title> is the most worthless of the twelfth-century MSS. of
Plautus. Occasionally, especially in the <title>Epidicus,</title> he has
made the right correction of his <foreign lang="la">exemplar mendum</foreign>; e.g.
in <bibl n="Pl. Epid. 3.1">v. 329</bibl> he has rightly corrected <foreign lang="la">fere</foreign> to <foreign lang="la">facere</foreign>
(<foreign lang="la">fere</foreign> <title>E</title>, <foreign lang="la">ferre</foreign> <title>B</title>).
But in the great majority of cases he has added his <quote lang="la">propriae
mendae</quote> to the <quote lang="la">mendae repertae</quote>; e.g. in
<cit><bibl n="Pl. Capt. 2.2">Capt. 274, </bibl> <quote lang="la">e&uacute;gepae! Thal&eacute;m talento n&oacute;n emam Mil&eacute;sium</quote></cit>,

<p>The following passages of Plautus should, I think, be
emended in accordance with the above considerations:&mdash;</p>
<p><bibl n="Pl. Mil. 4.2">Mil. 1005</bibl>. The MSS. offer: <quote lang="la">PAL. prius nequam iliam
<pb n="28"/>oculis tuis. PYRG. Video id (ideo) quod credo tibi.</quote>
If we look at the whole passage, we shall see that the emendation
of this line is mainly a matter of punctuation, like the famous
emendation of a line of Shakspeare (<bibl n="Shak. Oth 5.2.7"><title>Oth.</title> v. 2. 7</bibl>),
<quote lang="en"><l>Put out the light and then&mdash;. Put out the light!</l></quote>
for which in the old copies we find,
<quote lang="en"><l>Put out the light and then put out the light.</l></quote>
The soldier Pyrgopolinices is talking with the slave
Palaestrio about the pretended widow who has sent him a
message:
<quote lang="la"><lg type="senarii"><l>PAL. tum a&uacute;tem illa ipsast n&iacute;mium lepida n&iacute;misque nitida f&eacute;mina.</l>
<l>PYRG. h&eacute;rcle vero jam &aacute;dlubescit pr&iacute;mulum, Pala&eacute;strio.</l>
<l part="I">PAL. pr&iacute;usne quam illam ocul&iacute;s tuis &mdash;</l>
<l part="F">PYRG. Vide&oacute;n id quod cred&oacute; tibi?</l></lg></quote></p>
<p>Palaestrio is interrupted before he can finish his question
with the word <foreign lang="la">vidisti,</foreign> &ldquo;Are you in love with her without
having yet seen her?&rdquo; by the impatient rejoinder of the
soldier, &ldquo;Your description of her is so satisfactory that it is
as good as seeing her for myself,&rdquo; lit. &ldquo;Do I not see what
I believe from you?&rdquo; with <foreign lang="la">ne,</foreign> as often, for <foreign lang="la">nonne.</foreign></p>
<p>Cases of interruption of this kind are not uncommon in
Plautus, e.g. <cit><bibl n="Pl. Truc. 2.6">Truc. 504:</bibl> <quote lang="la">ST. S&aacute;lve. AS. Salvom&mdash; ST. Sc&iacute;o: sed peperitne,
&oacute;bseero, Phron&eacute;sium?</quote></cit>
where Astaphium is interrupted in the middle of the sentence
<foreign lang="la">salvom te advenisse gaudeo</foreign> (other examples are <bibl n="Pl. Epid. 1.2">Epid.
117</bibl>, <bibl n="Pl. Epid. 1.2">128</bibl>; <bibl n="Pl. Poen. 3.2">Poen. 607</bibl>).
<bibl n="Pl. Mil. 4.8">Mil. 1319</bibl> has been thus restored by Niemeyer:
<quote lang="la">PH. &Iacute;bo, quamquam inv&iacute;ta facio: h&oacute;mini pietas&mdash; PL. Sc&iacute;o: sapis.</quote></p>
<p><bibl n="Pl. St. 4.2">Stich. 629</bibl> should, I think, be so explained. The parasite's
bid for a dinner <foreign lang="la">non ego isti apud te (cenabo)?</foreign> is interrupted
by Epignomus:  <quote lang="la">N&oacute;n ego isti apud te&mdash;. S&aacute;tis spectatast m&iacute;hi jam tua fel&iacute;citas</quote>
(<foreign lang="la">ista</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">isti</foreign> <title>A</title>).
<pb n="29"/></p>
<p><bibl n="Pl. Mos. 2.1">Most. 419</bibl>. Sphaerio brings the key of the house to Tranio.
The line assigned to Tranio by the MSS. is quite intelligible,
if we suppose Sphaerio to hold up the key after the first sentence:
<quote lang="la"><lg><l>sed qu&iacute;d tu egredere, Spha&eacute;rio? jamjam. &oacute;ptume</l>
<l>praec&eacute;ptis parulsti,</l></lg></quote></p>

<p>I would resolve <foreign lang="la">acto</foreign> of the MSS. in <bibl n="Pl. Mos. 5.2">Most. 1134</bibl> into two
words, <foreign lang="la">ac tu</foreign> (a common case of substitution), and read:
<quote lang="la"><l>&aacute;ge, mitte ista: ac tu &aacute;d me in cenam&mdash;. D&iacute;c venturum:</l>
<l>qu&iacute;d taces?</l></quote></p>
<p>Archaic forms should, I fancy, be restored to the following

<head>Errors of Transposition</head>
<div2 id="c2s1" type="paragraph" n="1">
<head>Transposition of words a very frequent error</head>
<p>Transposition of words is perhaps the commonest error of MSS., so that a change in the order of the
words is usually the least violent remedy that an editor can apply to an unmetrical line. As an instance from
Plautus we may take <bibl n="Pl. St. 2.1">Stich. 293</bibl>, a trochaic septenarius, which in all the minuscule MSS. has the impossible
ending <foreign lang="la">censeo aequum,</foreign> but in <title>A</title> ends correctly with <foreign lang="la">aequom censeo:</foreign>
<quote lang="la">&aacute;d me adiri et s&uacute;pplicari &eacute;gomet mi aequom c&eacute;nseo.</quote></p>
<p>The scribe of the original of <title>CD</title> often fell into the
same error. For example, <bibl n="Pl. Ps. 1.3">Pseud. 322</bibl> is given both by
<title>B</title> and by <title>A</title> in this, the right, form:
<quote lang="la">n&eacute; illam vendas ne&uacute; me perdas h&oacute;minem amantem. Anim&oacute; bono es</quote>,
but in <title>C</title> and <title>D</title> we have <foreign lang="la">perdas me</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">me
perdas,</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">bono animo es</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">animo bono es.</foreign> Nor is the scribe of <title>A</title>
exempt from the same mistake. In <bibl n="Pl. Per. 4.4">Pers. 620</bibl> <title>P</title> seems
to be right in ending the line with <foreign lang="la">mi homo,</foreign> and <title>A</title> to
be wrong with its <foreign lang="la">homo mi.</foreign></p></div2>
<div2 id="c2s2" type="paragraph" n="2">
<head>Causes of transposition errors</head>
<p>The great frequency of this error is, no doubt, due to the readiness of the eye of a copyist to pass on
to a word in front of the word that should be written.  The error, once made, might be left without indication,
<pb n="32"/>through the reluctance of a copyist to spoil the look of the page, or to call down upon himself the censure of
his superior by leaving a token that a mistake had been committed. If the copyist discovered his mistake
at the moment of making it, he might add in its proper place the transposed word without leaving any sign of
correction (see <ref target="c2s3" targOrder="U">&sect; 3</ref> below). That is how the word <foreign lang="la">fieri</foreign>
comes to be repeated in <title>B</title> in <bibl n="Pl. Bac. 1.1">Bacch. 80</bibl>, where, instead
of <foreign lang="la">ut solet in istis fieri</foreign>, <title>B</title> has <foreign lang="la">ut solet fieri in istis fieri.</foreign>
This was in fact a besetting sin of the copyist of the <title>Bacchides</title> in <title>B,</title> though the first occurrence of the word
has been generally erased by the scribe or the corrector (see Goetz, Preface to the <title>Bacchides</title> p. vii <foreign lang="la">n.</foreign>)
(On wrong insertions of this kind see <ref target="c4s3" targOrder="U">ch. iv. &sect; 3</ref>.)</p>
<p>Leo in his <title lang="de">Plautinische Forschungen</title> p. 7 mentions as a common corruption of Latin texts, especially such as are
based on a single archetype, a similar error &mdash; namely, the repetition of a word immediately before the word it governs,
although it has been already written in its proper place. He cites for this latter error <cit><bibl n="Catul. 76">Catullus lxxvi. 23,</bibl>
<quote lang="la">non jam illud quaero contra me ut &lsqb;me&rsqb; diligat illa</quote></cit>.</p></div2>
<div2 id="c2s3" type="paragraph" n="3">
<head>Method of correcting transposition in MSS</head>
<p>The usual way of correcting a transposition in a MS. was by drawing faint sloping lines like accent strokes
above the two transposed words. The transposition of <foreign lang="la">frater</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">dare</foreign>
in <bibl n="Pl. Aul. 2.1">Aul. 158</bibl> was corrected in some such way in the original of <title>BD</title> (which, as we
have seen on p. 7, was the archetype of <title>EJ</title>), for <title>B</title>
has rightly <foreign lang="la">frater dare</foreign>, <title>D</title> has <foreign lang="la">dare frater</foreign> with the transposition-sign
faithfully copied, <title>EJ</title> have <foreign lang="la">dare frater</foreign> with
no sign, so that in the original of <title>EJ</title> these marks had been neglected.</p>
<p>In the Laurentian MS. of Nonius at Florence the same marks were used to correct the transposition of syllables in
<foreign lang="la">lacinium,</foreign> wrongly written for <foreign lang="la">lanicium</foreign> (i.e. <foreign lang="la">lanitium</foreign>);
but the scribe of the Harleian MS., which is a direct copy of the
<pb n="33"/>Laurentian, curiously mistook them for marks of deletion,
and has written <foreign lang="la">laum.</foreign> If we had not the original from
which the Harleian MS. was copied, how difficult it would have been to account for this corruption!</p></div2>
<div2 id="c2s4" type="paragraph" n="4">
<head>Words in margin of original often transposed in copy</head>
<p>Transposition is often the result of a word having been written in the margin of an original MS.
Unless there was clear indication of the place where the marginal word was to be inserted, it might easily
be inserted in one part of the line by one copyist, in another part by another. A marginal word may of
course be a word that properly belongs to the text but had been accidentally omitted by the writer of the
original; but it may also be a mere adscript which should have no place in the text, or a variant taken
from another, perhaps a worse, MS. (<ref target="c4s1" targOrder="U">ch. iv. &sect; 1</ref>). A certain amount of suspicion thus attaches to any word
which is differently placed in the sentence by two or more MSS. which have come from a common archetype.</p>
<p>Very often the transposition of a marginal word took this form, that the word was copied into the text immediately
beside the word which stood next to the margin in the original. The tenth-century Harleian MS. of Bede, a copy
of the famous Moore MS. at Cambridge, may furnish us with an example. In v. 24, annal. 538: <quote lang="la">eclipsis solis &hellip; ab
hora prima usque ad tertiam</quote>, the Moore MS. omits <foreign lang="la">solis</foreign> but
adds it in the margin at the end of the line, that is to say after the word <foreign lang="la">tertiam.</foreign> The Harleian copy has <quote lang="la">eclipsis &hellip;
ab hora prima usque ad tertiam solis</quote> (see Plummer's edition of Bede, Introd. p. xcix), the scribe having taken the word <foreign lang="la">solis</foreign>
to be the last word in the line&mdash;a word crowded out into the margin through want of space. Thus the place where a
transposed word is inserted may often indicate to us where the line ended in an archetype.</p></div2>
<div2 id="c2s5" type="paragraph" n="5">
<head>Transposition of &ldquo;overflow&rdquo; word at the end of a line</head>
<p>One other cause of the transposition of a word must be mentioned; for it is not uncommon in MSS. of Plautus and of any Latin poet who uses long
<pb n="34"/>metres. Where a verse was too long to be conveniently included in one line of the page, the &ldquo;overflow&rdquo;
word was set at the end of the preceding line, if there was a blank space there; and a stroke was
usually drawn in front of it to partition it off from the words after which it stood. If a copyist failed to
notice this stroke, the result was a transposition of the word. For example, in <cit><bibl n="Pl. As. 2.4">Asin. 474-5:</bibl>
<quote lang="la"><lg><l>ME. malum h&eacute;rcle vobis qua&eacute;ritis. LE. crura h&eacute;rcle diffring&eacute;ntur,</l>
<l>ni istum &iacute;npudicum percies. LIBANUS. perii h&eacute;rcle: age inpud&iacute;ce,</l></lg></quote></cit>
the &ldquo;overflow&rdquo; word of <bibl n="Pl. As. 2.4">v. 475</bibl> <foreign lang="la">(inpudice),</foreign> written in
the original at the end of the preceding line, is in our MSS. treated as a part of v. 474, which ends <foreign lang="la">diffringentur
inpudice,</foreign> while v. 475 ends with <foreign lang="la">age.</foreign>  In <bibl n="Pl. Epid. 3.4"><title>Epid.</title>
445</bibl> the &ldquo;overflow&rdquo; words <foreign lang="la">(in adulescentia)</foreign> were written
at the end, not of the preceding line, as is the usual practice, but of the following line; in the same play
the words <foreign lang="la">concludi volo,</foreign> which are properly the concluding
words of <bibl n="Pl. Epid. 3.3">v. 402</bibl>, were written in the original MS. at the end of the second line preceding.</p>
<p>This is a characteristic feature of MSS., even of prose texts, in Irish script. Where a paragraph closes before the
end of a line, the Irish scribe, wishing to economise his vellum, has regularly filled up the blank space with the continuation
of the following line. This practice has received from the Irish Grammarians the picturesque name of
&ldquo;head-under-wing,&rdquo; the long line with its end or &ldquo;head&rdquo; folded
back into the preceding line being compared to a bird sleeping with its head tucked under its wing.</p></div2>
<div2 id="c2s6" type="paragraph" n="6">
<head>Transposition of a line</head>
<p>Not merely words but whole lines may be transposed.  Usually the error is due to the scribe having
omitted a line and then having inserted it at the point
<pb n="35"/>he had reached when he discovered his mistake, either
one line late (<bibl n="Pl. Epid. 5.1">Epid. 635</bibl>-6; <foreign lang="la">Men.</foreign> 950-1) or two lines or
three lines, as the case might be. If the mistake was not discovered till the whole page was written,<note anchored="yes">A careful scribe would
always revise each page of his copy as he wrote it.</note> the omitted line would be added in the top or bottom margin (the
side margins not affording room enough), with signs indicating the proper place of insertion&mdash;such as <foreign lang="la">h.d.
(&ldquo;hic deest&rdquo;)</foreign>, <foreign lang="la">h.s. (&ldquo;hoc supplendum&rdquo;)</foreign>, or
<foreign lang="la">h.p. (&ldquo;hoc ponas&rdquo;)</foreign>. Sometimes a copyist neglects these signs
of his original and writes the line before the first line of the page (if it stood in the top margin), or after the
last line of the page (if it stood in the bottom margin). <bibl n="Pl. Men. 3.1">Men. 465</bibl>, for example, appears after <bibl n="Pl. Men. 3.2">v. 474</bibl> in the
minuscule MSS., though it has its proper place in <title>A</title>. <bibl n="Pl. Bac. 1.1">Bacch. 73</bibl> is twice written in the minuscule MSS., both
in its proper place and also before <bibl n="Pl. Bac. 1.1">v. 65</bibl>, which may have been the top line of the page in <title>P.</title></p>
<p>A twofold occurrence of a line is often the result of the fact that an emended version of it or a variant form taken
from another MS. had been appended in the margin by the corrector. The reason why <bibl n="Pl. Bac. 1.2">Bacch. 166-169</bibl> reappear in <title>B</title>
after <bibl n="Pl. Bac. 2.1">v. 175</bibl> seems to have been that they had been written in wrong order; for the words of the repeated passage are
unchanged, and the only perceptible difference is that at its first occurrence the order is wrong (168, 169, 166, 167).</p>
<p>The appearance in <title>A</title> of <bibl n="Pl. St. 1.3">vv. 232-3</bibl> of the <foreign lang="la">Stichus</foreign>
after <bibl n="Pl. St. 1.3">v. 208</bibl>, as well as at their proper place, may be due to the
scribe's having copied, when he turned over the page, the top lines, not of the left-hand page but of the right-hand
page of his original. The scribe of <title>P,</title> too, at first skipped a leaf of his original containing <bibl n="Pl. Ps. 4.7">vv. 1162-1204</bibl> of the

<p>In <title>B</title> the transposition of two long passages of the <title>Poenulus</title>

follow <bibl n="Pl. Poen. 3.2">v. 608</bibl>) is, I think, the result of two broadsheets of
the original having accidentally changed places. That original was apparently, like most mediaeval MSS., disposed
in &ldquo;quaternions,&rdquo; i.e. gatherings of four broadsheets which were laid one upon the other, and then folded into
eight leaves or sixteen pages. Each leaf of the <title>Poenulus</title> in
the original we know to have contained some 66 or 68 lines of the play (see <ref target="cas1" targOrder="U">Appendix A</ref>). The second broadsheet of the
quaternion (that is the second and seventh leaves), containing on leaf ii vv. 218-284 and on leaf vii vv. 547-608, was
put after, instead of before, the third broadsheet. This third broadsheet (the third and sixth leaves) had on leaf iii vv. 285-352 and on leaf vi vv. 480-546.</p></div2>

<head>Transposition of syllables and letters</head>
<p>The transposition of syllables and of letters is usually an indication of an uneducated copyist. In
<bibl n="Pl. Epid. 2.2">Epid. 285</bibl>, for example, <foreign lang="la">te nolo</foreign> was written <foreign lang="la">te lono.</foreign>
Forms like <foreign lang="la">dixti,</foreign> 2nd singular perfect indicative, being unfamiliar to
the scribe of the archetype (p. 9), often appear as <foreign lang="la">dixit</foreign> etc., the scribe having regarded them as illiterate spellings
of this kind (cf. <bibl n="Pl. Capt. 1.2">Capt. 155</bibl>).</p>
<p>Often the cause is to be found in the practice of writing letters like <mentioned>a, u</mentioned> above the line in early minuscule (cf.
Thompson <title>Greek and Latin Palaeography</title> p. 228); <foreign lang="la">at</foreign> might
thus become <foreign lang="la">ta, tu</foreign> might become <foreign lang="la">ut.</foreign> The letter <mentioned>h,</mentioned> especially
when added as a correction, was frequently written in the form of the Greek rough-breathing or "daseia" (as in <foreign lang="greek">(o</foreign>) above the line (e.g.
<bibl n="Pl. Am. 1.1">Amph. 299</bibl> <foreign lang="la">hercle,</foreign> in the original of <title>BDEJ</title>); and an <foreign lang="la">h</foreign> so written
was in danger, not only of being overlooked by a copyist or mistaken for another letter, but also of being written before
instead of after the letter above which it stood. In a Bodleian fifteenth-century MS. of Virgil (Canon. Lat. 61),
written in Italy, the word <foreign lang="la">Daphnim</foreign> in <bibl n="Verg. Ecl. 5"><title>Ecl.</title> v. 20</bibl> was first
miscopied as <foreign lang="la">dahpnim,</foreign> then corrected; and it is clear from various indications that in the original
the <mentioned>h</mentioned> was expressed by this suprascript sign.

<p>In some cases the transposition of two neighbouring words
gives evidence of itself in the faulty metre. Thus in <cit><bibl n="Hor. Carm. 3.19">Hor.
<title>C.</title> iii. 19. 14,</bibl>
<quote lang="la"><lg type="gl+glc"><l>ternos ter cyathos attonitus petet</l>
<l>vates,</l></lg></quote></cit>
the reading of some MSS., <foreign lang="la">attonitus cyathos,</foreign> declares itself to
be wrong by the fact that it will not scan. But in Virg.
<cit><bibl n="Verg. Ecl. 1"><title>E.</title> i. 7</bibl>
<quote lang="la"><l>ite, meae, felix quondam pecus, ite, capellae,</l></quote></cit>
both variants, <foreign lang="la">felix quondam</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">quondam felix,</foreign> equally suit the metre.</p>
<p>I think that in some verses of Plautus, even though the metre is intact, a transposition of words may be detected from
the fact that the Plautine practice of keeping together alliterative pairs of words is not observed. Thus in <bibl n="Pl. Capt. 3.4">Capt. 554</bibl> I would read
<quote lang="la">n&eacute; verere: m&uacute;ltos iste <emph>h&oacute;mines morbus</emph> m&aacute;cerat</quote>
(with hiatus, as often, at the end of the hemistich), where the minuscule MSS. have <foreign lang="la">morbus homines.</foreign>
<pb n="38"/></p>
<p>The same rule of alliteration shows that the corruption in the MSS. reading is due to transposition of words in
<cit><bibl n="Pl. Capt. 3.5">Capt. 691,</bibl>
<quote lang="la"><l>quando &eacute;go te exemplis <emph>&eacute;xcruciaro p&eacute;ssumis,</emph></l></quote></cit></p>
<p>where the minuscule MSS. have <foreign lang="la">pessumis excruciavero</foreign>;
<cit><bibl n="Pl. Capt. 3.1">Capt. 476,</bibl>
<quote lang="la"><l>quam &iacute;n tribu <emph>sont&eacute;s aperto c&aacute;pite</emph> condemn&aacute;nt reos,</l></quote></cit>
where they have <foreign lang="la">aperto capite sontes.</foreign></p>
<p>An interesting example of the transposition of a line is
found in a passage of the <bibl n="Pl. Trin. 4.4"><title>Trinummus</title>, vv. 1112-4</bibl>. After
v. 1111, which ends with <foreign lang="la">fide,</foreign> our MSS. <title>(BCD)</title> have:
<quote lang="la"><lg><l>quamquam labores multos</l>
<l>sed hic unus ut ego suspicor servat fidem</l>
<l>ob rem labore meum ego cepisse censeo.</l></lg></quote></p>
<p>The explanation of the confusion I take to be that the scribe
of the archetype noticed, after he had half written the line
<foreign lang="la">quamqu&aacute;m labores m&uacute;ltos</foreign>, (perhaps to be followed by <foreign lang="la">sollicit&uacute;dines</foreign>?),
that he had omitted (through homoeoteleuton) the line <foreign lang="la">sed h&iacute;c unus &hellip; <emph>fidem</emph>,</foreign>
and immediately supplied the deficiency. Then, without finishing the line <foreign lang="la">quamquam</foreign> etc., he proceeded to copy the line:
<quote lang="la">ob r&eacute;m alienam eum &eacute;go cepisse c&eacute;nseo</quote>, making confusion worse confounded by miscopying it!</p>
<p><bibl n="Pl. Truc. 4.4">Truc. 882</bibl> seems to me an example of the transposition of a syllable, the syllable <foreign lang="la">at,</foreign> which had been apparently
omitted and then added in the margin. The MSS. give <quote lang="la">id quoque <emph>interim futatim</emph> nomen conmemorabitur</quote>,
with the unintelligible word <foreign lang="la">futatim.</foreign> Here I would read <foreign lang="la">interatim furtim,</foreign> on the supposition that the O. Lat. word
<foreign lang="la">interatim</foreign> (an old form of <foreign lang="la">interim</foreign> mentioned by Paulus
Diaconus) had been miswritten <foreign lang="la">interim</foreign> and the omitted syllable <foreign lang="la">at</foreign> had been added in the margin, whence it found
its way not to the right word but to the neighbouring and similarly-ending adverb.

<div1 id="c3" type="chapter" n="3">
<head>Errors of Omission</head>
<div2 id="c3s1" type="paragraph" n="1">
<head>Haplography</head>
<p>The commonest kind of omission is that known as Haplography, by which one only of two identical or
similar words is written and the other is left out. In
Virgil <bibl n="Verg. G. 4.311"><title>G.</title> iv. 311</bibl>, for example,
<quote lang="la">miscentur, tenuemque <emph>magis magis</emph> aera carpunt,</quote>
some MSS. offer <foreign lang="la">tenuemque magis aera,</foreign> omitting the second <foreign lang="la">magis.</foreign></p>
<p>This is an error for which there is great scope in the text of an author like Plautus, who loves to pile
up phrases like <foreign lang="la">hic hinc huc transit,</foreign> and affects assonances
like <foreign lang="la">male malus, suavi suavitate.</foreign> So prone are scribes to this error that I believe that in fifty per cent.
of the lines of Plautus, where the same word is repeated or two almost identical words stand side by side, some
MS. or other will be found to omit one of the pair.  There is therefore every justification for an editor who
emends the defective metre of a line by the insertion of a word before or after a word of similar appearance.</p></div2>
<div2 id="c3s2" type="paragraph" n="2">
<head>Omission of name of speaker in dialogue</head>
<p>A not infrequent case of this error in the plays of Plautus is when in a dialogue the remark of one speaker
ends with the name of the other speaker in the vocative case. Here in the original the voc. would be immediately
followed by the same name, written in full or with contraction,
<pb n="40"/>as a &ldquo;nota personae,&rdquo; to indicate the speaker of the next remark. An example will be found in <bibl n="Pl. Epid. 4.1">Epid. 553</bibl>,
where the two speakers are Philippa and Periphanes. The lines begins with <foreign lang="la"><abbr expan="fabulata es">fabulata's</abbr></foreign>,
a remark of Periphanes; then Philippa says <foreign lang="la">mira memoras, Periphane,</foreign> to which Periphanes
replies <foreign lang="la">em istuc rectius.</foreign> The line seems to be preserved rightly in <title>A</title>:
<quote lang="la">f&aacute;bulata's. M&iacute;ra memoras, P&eacute;riphane. Em istue r&eacute;ctius</quote>;
but the minuscule MSS. omit <foreign lang="la">Periphane,</foreign> the word being regarded
as a &ldquo;nota personae&rdquo; and not as a part of the line. Many defective lines in Plautus which are divided between
two speakers have been successfully emended on this principle.</p></div2>
<div2 id="c3s3" type="paragraph" n="3">
<head>Omission of a syllable or a letter</head>
<p>Sometimes it is not a whole word that is omitted through haplography, but a repeated syllable or even
letter. For example, <bibl n="Pl. Mil. 1.1">Mil. 54</bibl> is rightly written in <title>A</title> thus:
<quote lang="la"><l>ATPEDITASTELLIQVIAERANTSIVIVIVERENT,</l></quote>
that is
<quote lang="la"><l>at p&eacute;ditastelli qu&iacute;a erant, sivi v&iacute;verent,</l></quote>
&ldquo;they were mere tag-rag-and-bobtail infantry, so I let them live.&rdquo; The repetition of the syllable <foreign lang="la">vi</foreign> proved a
stumbling-block to the scribe of <foreign lang="la">P,</foreign> who wrote <foreign lang="la">si viverent</foreign>
for <foreign lang="la">sivi viverent,</foreign> leaving a hiatus in the metre (between
<foreign lang="la">quia</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">erant</foreign>). We may be sure, though we have
not the testimony of <title>A</title> to help us, that it is a similar error which has obscured the name of Plautus in
<cit><bibl n="Pl. Mer. 1.1">Merc. 10,</bibl> <quote lang="la">ead&eacute;m Latine M&eacute;rcator Macc&iacute; Titi</quote></cit>,
where the repetition of the three similarly - written syllables (see <ref target="c6s1" targOrder="U">ch. vi. &sect; 1</ref>) <foreign lang="la">ci-ti-ti</foreign> led to the corruption
<foreign lang="la">mactici</foreign> in <title>P</title>&mdash;a corruption faithfully preserved by <title>B,</title>
but in <title>CD</title> changed to <foreign lang="la">mattici.</foreign> An instance from the
original of <title>CD</title> is <cit><bibl n="Pl. Ps. 1.3">Pseud. 246,</bibl>
<quote lang="la">quid h&oacute;c est? quis &eacute;st qui mor&aacute;m mi occup&aacute;to</quote></cit>,
<pb n="41"/>
where <foreign lang="la">moram mi,</foreign> probably written in the archetype<note anchored="yes">On the loss of small words which were joined in writing to longer
neighbouring words see <ref target="c1s4" targOrder="U">ch. i. &sect; 4</ref>, and on the contraction <foreign lang="la">m<hi rend="over">i</hi></foreign> for <foreign lang="la">mihi</foreign>
below, <ref target="c7s2" targOrder="U">ch. vii. &sect; 2</ref>.</note>
<foreign lang="la">moramm<hi rend="over">i</hi>,</foreign> became in the original of <foreign lang="la">CD moram,</foreign> with loss
of the pronoun.</p>
<p>A particularly common case is the omission of the final letter of a word when the following word begins
with the same letter. Thus the words <foreign lang="la">sic cogis,</foreign> written
<foreign lang="la">siccogis,</foreign> would run great danger of being miscopied <foreign lang="la">sicogis
(si cogis), me experti</foreign> would become <foreign lang="la">mexperti,</foreign> and so on.</p></div2>
<div2 id="c3s4" type="paragraph" n="4">
<head>Omission of unintelligible word,</head>
<p>The omission of a word, when due to haplography, is not hard to rectify. But omission is often
due to other causes. Sometimes a scribe would deliberately omit a word which he did not understand or
which he suspected of being a corruption, and would
leave a blank space for it, meaning the corrector<note anchored="yes">In the &ldquo;scriptorium&rdquo; of every monastery there was an official,
known as the &ldquo;corrector,&rdquo; whose duty was to revise a MS. as soon as
it had been written, and collate it with its original or with some other
MS. of the same work. The &ldquo;corrector&rdquo; of the first eight plays in <title>B</title>
I believe to have used in his revision not the actual original from which
<title>B</title> (as well as <title>D</title>) was copied, but the archetype itself, the original of the
original of <title>BD</title> (see p. 7 above). In the same way the Laurentian MS.
of Nonius has had valuable readings introduced into its text by a &ldquo;corrector,&rdquo;
who may have used for this purpose the actual archetype of all
our MSS. (<title>Class. Rev. x.</title> 16). &ldquo;Mixed&rdquo; texts, which cannot be referred
to one or other of two &ldquo;families&rdquo; of MSS., are to be explained by the
supposition that a text copied from an original of one family has been
corrected, either at the moment of its production or later, from a MS. of another family.</note> of
the MS. to insert it at the time of revision.<note anchored="yes">In <title>B</title> these omissions are indicated by a small <mentioned>d</mentioned>
(for <foreign lang="la">deest</foreign>) in the margin. The letter has usually been erased by the &ldquo;corrector&rdquo;
when he added the word required (e.g. <bibl n="Pl. Cas. 2.6">Cas. 361</bibl>), but traces of it
sometimes remain (e.g. <bibl n="Pl. Cas. prologue.0">Cas. 64</bibl>, <bibl n="Pl. Cas. 2.5">347</bibl>).</note> The
omission of <foreign lang="la">his cerebrum uritur</foreign> (<bibl n="Pl. Poen. 3.5">Poen. 770</bibl>) in <title>B</title> is perhaps
to be explained in this way; for the fact that <title>CD</title>
have the words (in the corrupt form <foreign lang="la">hisce Crebro auritur</foreign>) shows us that they stood in the archetype.
<pb n="42"/></p></div2>
<div2 id="c3s5" type="paragraph" n="5">
<head>Omission of Greek word</head>
<p>Many mediaeval scribes were ignorant of the Greek alphabet; and when a Greek word occurred in
their original, written in Greek and not Roman letters, they left it for the corrector to supply. Hence the
blanks in a twelfth-century Leyden MS. of Aulus Gellius, which are usually accompanied by a marginal
note <foreign lang="la">gr&lsqb;aeca&rsqb;</foreign> (see Hertz's Introduction p. lviii).</p></div2>
<div2 id="c3s6" type="paragraph" n="6">
<head>Omission of small word not necessary to sentence</head>
<p>A common case of omission in MSS. of Latin authors is the omission of small, unimportant words,
pronouns, particles, and the like, which are not necessary for the apprehension of the sense of the
sentence. This plays a great part in the MSS. of Plautus; for this author delights in the otiose use of
personal pronouns (<foreign lang="la">ego, tu</foreign> etc.) or particles (<foreign lang="la">vero, nam</foreign>
etc.), which a scribe who copied clause by clause and not word by word was very prone to omit. In
<bibl n="Pl. Bac. 1.2">Bacch. 134</bibl>, for instance, <quote lang="la">ibidem &eacute;go meam operam p&eacute;rdidi, ubi t&uacute; tuam</quote>,
the <foreign lang="la">ego</foreign> is retained by <title>B</title>, but was dropped in the
original of <foreign lang="la">CD.</foreign> That <title>B</title> is right we see from the quotation of this line by Charisius, who quotes it with
<foreign lang="la">ego</foreign>;  but the absence of the pronoun leaves no trace on the sense or metre of the line; and there were probably
several lines with this error in <title>P,</title> which afford us no possibility of detecting the omission. A large
number of cases of hiatus have been removed by Ritschl from the text by the insertion of small words
of this kind into the lines as they are presented in our minuscule MSS. <bibl n="Pl. Bac. 5.2">Bacch. 1170</bibl> may serve as example.
The reading of all our minuscule MSS. is <quote lang="la">senex &oacute;ptime quantumst &iacute;n terra, sine hoc exorare &aacute;bs te</quote>,
leaving the metre (anapaestic) defective. Ritschl restored the metre by inserting <foreign lang="la">me</foreign> after <foreign lang="la">sine:</foreign>
<quote lang="la">sine me h&oacute;c exorare &aacute;bs te</quote>. The liability of small words such
<pb n="43"/>as pronouns and prepositions to be omitted, through the practice of joining them in writing with longer
neighbouring words, has been already mentioned in <ref target="c1s4" targOrder="U">ch. i. &sect; 4</ref>: so that editors are justified in resorting to
the insertion of words of this kind to remove a hiatus or to supplement the defective number of syllables in a line.</p></div2>
<div2 id="c3s7" type="paragraph" n="7">
<head>Omission of word due to stain on page of archetype</head>
<p>Another cause of the omission of a word or several words or merely part of a word was the fact
that it was illegible in the archetype owing to the presence of a stain on the page. The omission of the
illegible word would be indicated in the first copy by a lacuna, but in subsequent copies all indication might
disappear. The most famous instance of a &ldquo;blot on the page&rdquo; is the Bodleian Greek MS. of Arrian's &ldquo;Dissertations
of Epictetus,&rdquo; where a large portion of the centre of a page (fol. 25 r.) has been made illegible
apparently by the pressure of some heavy weight, the leg of a chair perhaps. All other existing MSS. of the
&ldquo;Dissertations&rdquo; are copied, ultimately or immediately, from this archetype, and omit either the illegible words
alone or the whole passage, some with indication that there is a lacuna, others without any indication of the
kind. A photograph of the page in question is appended to the Teubner edition of the &ldquo;Dissertations&rdquo; (Leipzig 1894).</p></div2>
<div2 id="c3s8" type="paragraph" n="8">
<head>Omission due to hole in leaf of archetype</head>
<p>In the <title>Casina</title> we find in all or some of our minuscule MSS. blank spaces left at regular intervals,
indicating the omission of words. At the same intervals we find lines in which no lacuna is indicated
in our MSS., but which present a defective number of syllables, a word being patently omitted at the
beginning of one line and at the end of another. Omissions of this kind may be referred without
hesitation to a hole in the leaf of some archetype; and if we count the number of lines in these intervals, we
<pb n="44"/>can estimate the number of lines on a leaf and (by
halving that number) on a page of this archetype.<note anchored="yes">The &ldquo;gappy&rdquo; archetype of Plautus was not the minuscule
archetype <title>P</title>, but an earlier one. If we consider how soon indications
of a lacuna vanish in the transmission of a text, we may be disposed to believe that the archetype in question was that archetype in
capitals (p. 8) from which <title>P</title> was directly copied. It had from nineteen
to twenty-one lines on a page (<title>A</title> has nineteen lines on a page);
and it is not impossible that its gappy condition was due to its being a papyrus and not a vellum MS. (For details of these lacunae see
Schoell's Introduction to the <title>Casina</title> pp. x <foreign lang="la">sqq.</foreign>)</note></p></div2>
<div2 id="c3s9" type="paragraph" n="9">
<head>Causeless omission of a word</head>
<p>Where the omission of a word is not due to a blot on the page or a hole in the leaf of the archetype,
the omitted word may in the great majority of cases be supposed to be either (1) a word similar to a neighbouring
word or identical with it, as in the instances
quoted above (&lt;<foreign lang="la">magis</foreign>&gt; <foreign lang="la">magis, male</foreign> &lt;<foreign lang="la">malus</foreign>&gt;), or (2) an
unusual form, such as a Greek word, or (3) a small word unimportant to the sense of the sentence, as in
&lt;<foreign lang="la">ego</foreign>&gt; <foreign lang="la">meam operam perdidi.</foreign> But we must not forget
that a word is often omitted from no other apparent cause than the carelessness of the scribe. The omission
of <foreign lang="la">juris</foreign> in the original of <title>CD</title> in <cit><bibl n="Pl. Poen. 3.2">Poen. 586: </bibl>
<quote lang="la">h&oacute;die juris c&oacute;ctiores n&oacute;n sunt, qui lit&eacute;s creant</quote></cit>,
does not come under any of the classes which have been mentioned, and is probably a quite inexcusable
piece of negligence on the part of the writer. So in a passage of Nonius (21. 18) the scribe of the Laurentian
MS. has passed over the word <foreign lang="la">genus,</foreign> though it is written plainly in his original, the Leyden MS.</p></div2>
<div2 id="c3s10" type="paragraph" n="10">
<head>Confusion with similar words</head>
<p>The omission also of a syllable or a letter, though usually due to haplography (<ref target="c3s3" targOrder="U">&sect; 3</ref>) or to the
confusion of one word with another of similar appearance,
e.g. <foreign lang="la">filia</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">facilia</foreign> (ch. v), or to the fact that the
syllable was expressed by a contraction symbol, e.g.
<foreign lang="la">piratus</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">periratus</foreign> (<ref target="c7s2" targOrder="U">ch. vii. &sect; 2</ref>), is occasionally
merely a case of illiterate copying. In Virg. <bibl n="Verg. A. 4.491"><title>A.</title> iv. 491</bibl>,

<head>Omission of a line or passage</head>
<p>The omission of a word like <foreign lang="la">malus</foreign> or <foreign lang="la">magis</foreign> in
the examples <foreign lang="la">male</foreign> &lt;<foreign lang="la">malus</foreign>&gt;, &lt;<foreign lang="la">magis</foreign>&gt; <foreign lang="la">magis,</foreign> may have
been intentional. It was unintentional if the eye of the writer passed at the moment of writing from the
one group of letters to the other similar or identical group. But it was intentional if the writer regarded
<foreign lang="la">male malus</foreign> as a miswriting, left uncorrected in the
original (see <ref target="c4s3" targOrder="U">ch. iv. &sect; 3</ref>), and <foreign lang="la">magis magis</foreign> as an error
of dittography (<ref target="c4s4" targOrder="U">ch. iv. &sect; 4</ref>). About the omission of a
line or passage there is seldom this doubt. In the great majority of cases it is due to two lines having
had the same ending, so that the eye of the copyist, as he was finishing the one line, wandered to the ending
of the other. In the <bibl n="Pl. Mil. 2.6"><title>Miles Gloriosus</title> v. 554</bibl> ends with
the words <foreign lang="la">quod viderim,</foreign> and so does v. 556:
<quote lang="la"><lg type="senarii"><l>fate&oacute;r. Quid ni fate&aacute;re id ego quod v&iacute;derim?</l>
<l>Et ibi &oacute;sculantem meum h&oacute;spitem cum ista h&oacute;spita</l>
<l>vid&iacute;sti. Vidi: c&uacute;r negem quod v&iacute;derim?</l></lg></quote>
The consequence is that vv. 555-6 were omitted in <title>P,</title> and
would have been lost to us if we had not the testimony of <title>A</title> for this passage. The same thing has happened
in a passage of Horace, <cit><bibl n="Hor. Carm. 4.2.49"><foreign lang="la">C.</foreign> iv. 2. 49 sqq.:</bibl>
<quote lang="la"><lg><l>teque dum procedis, io Triumphe!</l>
<l>non semel dicemus, io Triumphe!</l>
<l>civitas omnis dabimusque divis
tura benignis,</l></lg></quote></cit>
where certain MSS. omit v. 50. And it is an error of very common occurrence in MSS. of all authors. St.
Jerome, commenting on a passage of the Prophet Jeremiah <cit><bibl n="Jeremiah 30.14">(xxx. 14):</bibl> <quote lang="la">propter multitudinem iniquitatis tuae,
dura facta sunt peccata tua. Quid clamas super contritione tua? insanabilis est dolor tuus; propter multitudinem
<pb n="46"/>iniquitatis tuae et propter dura peccata tua feci haec tibi</quote></cit>, explains the omission in the Septuagint
of the words from <foreign lang="la">quid clamas</foreign> to <foreign lang="la">iniquitatis tuae</foreign> in this
way, but supposes the omission to have been intentional
(<quote lang="la">videlicet quia secundo dicitur &ldquo;propter multitudinem,&rdquo;
etc., et qui scribebant a principio additum putaverunt</quote>).</p>
<p>It is extraordinary how trifling a case of homoeoteleuton may lead to a lengthy omission. For example, the mere
occurrence of the syllable <foreign lang="la">que</foreign> in two similarly-ending lines
(<bibl n="Pl. Bac. 3.4">v. 507</bibl> and <bibl n="Pl. Bac. 3.4">v. 509</bibl>) of the speech of an undutiful son in the
<title>Bacchides,</title>
<quote lang="la"><lg><l>nam j&aacute;m domum ibo atque &aacute;liquid surrupi&aacute;m patri.</l>
<l>id ist&iacute; dabo. ego istanc m&uacute;ltis ulcisc&aacute;r modis.</l>
<l>adeo &eacute;go illam cogam usque &uacute;t mendicet m&eacute;us pater,</l></lg></quote>
has been enough to occasion the loss of the intervening words in the Ambrosian Palimpsest, which presents the passage in this form:
<quote lang="la"><l>nam j&aacute;m domum ibo atque &uacute;t mendicet m&eacute;us pater</l></quote>,
&mdash;a line which, curiously enough, is metrically correct, and
which, so far as metre is concerned, offers no indication that anything has been lost.</p>
<p>The case of mere words or syllables being omitted through homoeoteleuton is almost as common. Manuscripts
of Aulus Gellius i. 4. 8 offer <foreign lang="la">enutabatque</foreign> for
<foreign lang="la">enodabat dijudicabatque.</foreign> And in <cit><bibl n="Hor. Carm. 4.6">Hor. <title>C.</title> iv. 6. 17:</bibl>
<quote lang="la"><l>sed palam <emph>captis</emph> <emph>gravis</emph>, heu nefas heu</l></quote></cit>,
the repetition of the syllable <foreign lang="la">-is</foreign> has caused the omission
of <foreign lang="la">captis</foreign> in some MSS.</p></div2>
<div2 id="c3s12" type="paragraph" n="12">
<head>Other causes for omissions</head>
<p>Of the causeless omission of a line, like the causeless omission of the word <foreign lang="la">juris</foreign> in the passage
quoted above (<ref target="c3s9" targOrder="U">&sect; 9</ref>), an example will be found in
<bibl n="Pl. Cas. 2.6">Cas. 376</bibl>&mdash;a line which was omitted, for no apparent
reason, in the original of <title>BD</title> (the archetype of <title>VEJ,</title> p. 7), and which would have remained unknown to
<pb n="47"/>us had not the corrector of <title>B</title> (<ref target="c3s4" targOrder="U">p. 41</ref>) added it in the margin.</p>
<p>A change of copyist may be accompanied by the omission of a line or lines. At <bibl n="Pl. Mer. 5.3">Merc. 961</bibl>, for example, one of the
copyists employed on the archetype ended his task. The new copyist began his task at v. 963 instead of v. 962, but
rectified his error immediately, with the result that in our MSS. v. 962 follows v. 963. If the original of <title>EJ</title> began a
new page, like <title>B</title>, at <bibl n="Pl. Epid. 2.2">Epid. 271</bibl> <foreign lang="la">nunc occasiost faciundi</foreign> etc.,
the omission in <foreign lang="la">EJ</foreign> of the preceding lines (four in our editions, between two and three in the archetype) may be
due to the fact that one of the copyists of the original laid down his pen too soon, before he had quite reached the end of the portion allotted to him.</p>
<p>Some editors have attempted to reconstruct the archetype of MSS. of authors on the supposition that accidentally-omitted
lines would naturally be the top or bottom lines of a page, lines occupying this position being liable to be over-looked
by a scribe, or to become stained and illegible, or to be cut off by a binder. But the correctness of this supposition is doubtful.</p></div2>
<div2 id="c3s13" type="paragraph" n="13">
<head>Omission of initial letter</head>
<p>The initial letter of a verse or chapter was
usually painted, and would be left by the scribe for the
<foreign lang="la">rubricator</foreign> or <foreign lang="la">miniator</foreign> to fill in. In many MSS.,
e.g. the Codex Ursinianus <title>(D)</title> of Plautus, these letters
were never supplied, with the result that a copyist
often wrongly emended the deficiency.<note anchored="yes"><p>The Renaissance MS., <title>F,</title> which is a copy of <title>D</title> (last twelve
plays), furnishes many examples. An amusing one is in <bibl n="Pl. Mos. 3.1">Most. 532</bibl>,
where a money-lender comes on the stage complaining of the bad times:
<quote lang="la"><lg><l>Scel&eacute;stiorem ego &aacute;nnum argento fa&eacute;nori</l>
<l>numquam &uacute;llum vidi, quam h&iacute;c mihi annus &oacute;btigit.</l></lg></quote>
The scribe of <title>F,</title> taking <foreign lang="la">celestiorem</foreign> of <title>D</title> for the word <foreign lang="la">caelestiorem,</foreign> supplies
as the initial letter of the line the interjection <foreign lang="la">O</foreign>: O celestiorem,
etc., completely reversing the sense of the passage.</p></note> This is why we
find in MSS. of <bibl n="Hor. Carm. 1.19">Hor. <title>C.</title> i. 19. 11</bibl> <foreign lang="la">Aversis</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">Versis</foreign> for

<head>Errors of Insertion</head>
<div2 id="c4s1" type="paragraph" n="1">
<head>Insertion of a gloss</head>
<p>The sense of the text was in MSS. often elucidated by writing an explanatory word, called
a gloss,<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="la">Glossa</foreign> (Gk. <foreign lang="greek">glw=ssa</foreign>), sometimes <foreign lang="la">glosa,</foreign> properly meant &ldquo;a
difficult word&rdquo; (cf. <foreign lang="la">glossema</foreign>), but is often used to mean &ldquo;the
explanation of a difficult word.&rdquo;</note> over the word of the text which required explanation, or
occasionally in the side margin. When an omission in the text had to be corrected the same course was
taken. The supplied word was written over the word before which it had to be inserted. It might also be
written in the margin, in which case a couple of dots were generally put at the place in the text where the
insertion was to be made. Small wonder then that a copyist was often at a loss to know whether an interlinear
or marginal jotting should be treated as an explanation or as a supplement. There was still a
third possibility, that it might be a correction designed to take the place of something wrongly written in the
text; for although the practice of careful scribes in this case was to place dots<note anchored="yes">Hence our word &ldquo;expunge.&rdquo;</note> under the wrongly written
word, syllable, or letter, this precaution was often omitted. A good example of the two wrong treatments
of a gloss is found in <bibl n="Pl. Cas. 3.1">Cas. 517</bibl>. The line should read:
<pb n="55"/>
<quote lang="la">c&uacute;r amem me c&aacute;stigare, id p&oacute;nito ad comp&eacute;ndium.</quote>
&ldquo;why do I like punishing myself? Well, we may dispense
with the explanation.&rdquo; In <title>P</title> the words <foreign lang="la">cur
amem me</foreign> were wrongly written <foreign lang="la">curam eme,</foreign> and this
phrase was in the original of <title>BVEJ</title> explained by the
suprascript gloss <foreign lang="la">curam exime.</foreign> The scribe of the
original of <title>VEJ</title> mistook the gloss for a supplement,
and wrote <foreign lang="la">curam eme curam exime castigare</foreign> etc.; the
scribe of <title>B</title> mistook it for a correction, and wrote
<foreign lang="la">curam exime castigare</foreign> etc.</p>
<p>A gloss may have been wrongly inserted from the
margin in <cit><bibl n="Pl. Truc. 1.1">Truc. 77 sqq.:</bibl>
<quote lang="la"><l>nam m&iacute;hi haec meretrix quae h&iacute;c habet, Phron&eacute;sium,</l>
<l>suum n&oacute;men omne ex p&eacute;ctore exmov&iacute;t meo.</l></quote></cit>
These lines are in the minuscule MSS. followed by an unmetrical line which most editors regard as a marginal gloss of the original:
<quote lang="la">Phronesium, nam phronesis est sapientia.</quote></p>
<p><bibl n="Pl. Epid. 3.3">Epid. 382</bibl> sqq. seems to be a very similar passage:
<quote lang="la"><l>non &oacute;ris causa m&oacute;do homines aequ&oacute;m fuit</l>
<l>sibi hab&eacute;re speculum, ubi &oacute;s contemplar&eacute;nt suom,</l>
<l>sed qu&iacute; perspicere p&oacute;ssent cordis c&oacute;piam,</l></quote>
where the minuscule MSS. insert between <foreign lang="la">possent</foreign> and
<foreign lang="la">cordis copiam</foreign> the words <foreign lang="la">cor sapientiae</foreign> (a corruption of
<foreign lang="la">cor sapientia est;</foreign> see <ref target="c7s5" targOrder="U">ch. vii. &sect; 5</ref>), <foreign lang="la">igitur perspicere ut
possint.</foreign></p></div2>
<div2 id="c4s2" type="paragraph" n="2">
<head>Glosses in the form of small explanatory words written between the lines</head>
<p>The insertion of interlinear glosses is especially common. The minuscule MSS. have over and over
again inserted in the text small words like <foreign lang="la">ego, tu, ut</foreign>
and the like, which originally were written between the lines, and served the purpose of facilitating the
reader's comprehension of the construction of the
passage. <bibl n="Pl. Mil. 3.1">Mil. 702</bibl> stands thus in <title>A</title>:
<quote lang="la"><l>s&iacute; istam semel am&iacute;seris</l>
<l>l&iacute;bertatem, haud f&aacute;cile in eundem r&uacute;sum restitu&iacute;s locum;</l></quote>
<pb n="56"/>
but in the minuscule MSS. the pronoun <foreign lang="la">te,</foreign> originally written between the lines to explain the construction
of <foreign lang="la">restitues,</foreign> has found its way into the text&mdash;though it still preserves a trace of its adventitious character
in that it stands not before but after <foreign lang="la">in:</foreign> <quote lang="la">haut facile
in te eundem rusum (rursum) restitues locum.</quote> An
example from the original of <title>CD</title> is <cit><bibl n="Pl. Ps. 1.5">Pseud. 459,</bibl>
<quote lang="la"><l>bene c&oacute;nfidenterque &aacute;dstitisse int&eacute;llego,</l></quote></cit>
where <foreign lang="la">te</foreign> stands in <title>CD</title> between <foreign lang="la">confidenterque</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">adstitisse,</foreign>
and spoils the metre of the line. Another is
<cit><bibl n="Pl. St. 3.1">Stich. 450,</bibl>
<quote lang="la"><l>est etiam hic &oacute;stium</l>
<l>ali&uacute;d posticum n&oacute;strarum harunc a&eacute;dium,</l></quote></cit>
where, for <foreign lang="la">aliud</foreign> of <title>AB,</title> in the original of <title>CD</title> stood
<foreign lang="la">aliud autem,</foreign> again spoiling the metre. The Ambrosian Palimpsest affords a good instance of the insertion of
a gloss, in the narrower sense of the word &ldquo;gloss&rdquo; (i.e.
the explanation of a difficult word), in <cit><bibl n="Pl. Truc. 2.2">Truc. 278,</bibl>
<quote lang="la"><l>noctem &iacute;n stramentis p&eacute;rnoctare p&eacute;rpetim,</l></quote></cit>
where it ends the line, not with <foreign lang="la">perpetim,</foreign> as <title>P</title> does,
but with <foreign lang="la">perpetim totam,</foreign> the second word being clearly
an explanation of the O. Lat. adjective <foreign lang="la">perpetim</foreign> (class. Lat. <foreign lang="la">perpetuam</foreign>).</p>
<p>Mention is made of this kind of corruption as
early as Galen (xvii. 1 p. 909), who says that the
words <foreign lang="greek">oi(=on o)du/nh o)du/nhn pau/ei</foreign> are not in the MSS.
<foreign lang="greek">kata\ *dioskori/dhn</foreign> of Hippocrates: <foreign lang="greek">fai/netai me\n ga\r w(s
e)xhgh/sei prosgrafe\n u(po/ tinos, au)=qis de\ ei)s tou)/dafos
u(po\ tou= bibliogra/fou metateqei=sqai.</foreign></p>
<p>One of the simplest instances is the insertion of the
interjection <foreign lang="la">o,</foreign> which was commonly written above a
vocative as a mere indication of the case. This interjection, usually written with an accent-stroke to
indicate the length of the vowel, is the origin of our
<pb n="57"/>sign of exclamation (!). It occurs in <title>B</title> at <bibl n="Pl. Cist. 4.2">Cist. 727</bibl>, etc.</p></div2>
<div2 id="c4s3" type="paragraph" n="3">
<head>Miswriting left uncorrected</head>
<p>Another common cause of insertion is that a word or syllable was wrongly written by a copyist, who then
left his miswriting uncorrected (cf. <ref target="c2s2" targOrder="U">ch. ii. &sect; 2</ref>). When a scribe wrote a word wrongly, he would, unless he
were an exceptionally conscientious scribe, leave the word as it stood, neither erasing it with a penknife, nor
deleting it with strokes through the letters, nor&mdash;the usual method of indicating an error in MSS.&mdash;putting
dots under (sometimes above) the wrongly written letters. He left all that to the &ldquo;corrector&rdquo; (<ref target="c3s4" targOrder="U">p. 41</ref>),
the senior who revised each MS. after the scribe had finished it, and whose duty it was to make the necessary
corrections and supply defective punctuation. A wrongly written word or syllable which escaped the
notice of the &ldquo;corrector&rdquo; would thus be left to stand side by side with the same word or syllable properly written</p>
<p>There is a curious instance of this in the Nonius MSS.
All our MSS. of Nonius have at the end of the paragraph on
<foreign lang="la">Mictilis</foreign> (p. 137 M.) the inexplicable word <foreign lang="la">meri.</foreign> The next
paragraph is headed by the word <foreign lang="la">Maestaret,</foreign> written in the
MSS. <foreign lang="la">mertaret;</foreign> and the explanation of the intrusion of <foreign lang="la">meri</foreign> is
simply this: &mdash; The scribe of the archetype, who read <foreign lang="la">mestaret</foreign>
of his original as <foreign lang="la">mertaret,</foreign> changed his mind as he was copying
the fourth letter and determined to write the word with
<foreign lang="la">rt</foreign> in ligature, since the word in his original was written with
a ligature &mdash; the ligature <foreign lang="la">st,</foreign> which in MSS. is often hardly
distinguishable from the ligature <foreign lang="la">rt</foreign> (<ref target="c6s1" targOrder="U">ch. vi. &sect; 1</ref>). Thanks to
his negligence in leaving his unfinished word as it stood, with the fourth letter wanting its cross-stroke, this adventitious
<foreign lang="la">meri</foreign> has kept its place in all subsequent copies, to the bewilderment of editors.</p>
<p>In <bibl n="Pl. Mil. 2.2">Mil. 203</bibl>, where <title>A</title> reads rightly
<quote lang="la">&eacute;cce avortit: n&iacute;xus laevo in f&eacute;mine habet laev&aacute;m manum,</quote>
<pb n="58"/>
the minuscule MSS. preserve an error of some early scribe,
who first wrote <foreign lang="la">autem</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">avortit,</foreign> and then, immediately discovering
his mistake, did not expunge <foreign lang="la">autem</foreign> but merely added <foreign lang="la">avorlit</foreign> in its proper form. They read:
<quote lang="la">ecce autem avortit nisus leva in femina habet levam manum.</quote>
Before the discovery of the Ambrosian Palimpsest editors
corrected the manifest corruption <foreign lang="la">leva in femina</foreign> to <foreign lang="la">laevo in
femine,</foreign> but did not venture to remove <foreign lang="la">autem,</foreign> preferring to
explain the scansion of the line by an unlikely theory that
<foreign lang="la">avortit</foreign> might be pronounced as a disyllable in Plautus. In
<bibl n="Pl. Mil. 2.2">Mil. 187</bibl> the word written correctly after the miswritten
word has unfortunately become assimilated to it, and so we find in all the minuscule MSS.:
<quote lang="la">ut eum qui hic se vidit verbis vincta vinetane esse viderit,</quote>
where <title>A</title> gives the true reading:
<quote lang="la">&uacute;t eum, qui se hic v&iacute;dit, verbis v&iacute;ncat, ne is se v&iacute;derit.</quote></p>
<p>In <bibl n="Pl. Truc. 2.2">Truc. 289</bibl> the error is harder to detect, because it is only
a syllable which has been wrongly written and allowed to
stand. The syllable <foreign lang="la">fo</foreign> of <foreign lang="la">foras,</foreign> in the phrase <foreign lang="la">ad foras,</foreign> has
been first written <foreign lang="la">eo</foreign> (on the confusion of <mentioned>f</mentioned> and <mentioned>e</mentioned>
see <ref target="c6s1" targOrder="U">ch. vi. &sect; 1</ref>),
so that <foreign lang="la">ad foras</foreign> (for which <title>A</title> gives, probably rightly, <foreign lang="la">ad foris</foreign>)
appears in the minuscule MSS. as <foreign lang="la">adeo foras.</foreign></p>
<p>This is an error whose ravages in the text of Plautus, and indeed of all Latin authors, have not, I
think, been sufficiently realised. In <bibl n="Pl. Ps. 4.7">Pseud. 1187</bibl> the reading of <title>P,</title>
<quote lang="la">quid domino quid socii quid somniatis mea quidem haec habeo omnia,</quote>
was taken by Ritschl as proof that two lines had been
fused into one by some such error as caused the fusion
into one of <bibl n="Pl. Men. 1.2">Men. 165</bibl>-6 and 278-9, already quoted
(<ref target="c3s14" targOrder="U">p. 52</ref>). But it is much more naturally explained as
a case of a miswriting, <foreign lang="la">quid socii</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">quid somniatis,</foreign> which
was not corrected, but was left to stand side by side with the true reading. Unfortunately we cannot
<pb n="59"/>decipher the whole line in <title>A</title>, but its beginning is plain:
<quote lang="la"><l>QVIDDOMINOQVIDSOMNIA,</l></quote>
and there is little doubt that the true form of the line is:
<quote lang="la">qu&iacute;d? domino? quid s&oacute;mniatis? m&eacute;a quidem haec habeo &oacute;mnia.</quote></p></div2>
<div2 id="c4s4" type="paragraph" n="4">
<head>Dittography</head>
<p>A special phase of this error is known as Dittography, where the mistake which has been left uncorrected
consisted in the writing of a word twice.
The word <foreign lang="la">inde</foreign> in <bibl n="Pl. Capt. 3.1">Capt. 490</bibl>, for example, is wrongly
repeated in <title>OJ</title>, <foreign lang="la">inde inde</foreign>;  the syllable <foreign lang="la">te</foreign> of <foreign lang="la">advorte</foreign>
(<bibl n="Pl. Ps. 1.3">Pseud. 277</bibl>) in <title>A</title>, which reads <foreign lang="la">advortite</foreign> (cf. <ref target="c5s8" targOrder="U">ch. v. &sect; 8</ref>).
Dittography is, however, not nearly so common an error in MSS. as haplography (<ref target="c3s1" targOrder="U">ch. iii. &sect; 1</ref>). The commonest
case is the repetition at the end of a word of the letter that begins the following word, e.g.
<foreign lang="la">quissim</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">qui sim (quisim).</foreign> A complicated example of
dittography in the ancient MS. of Cicero <foreign lang="la">de Republica</foreign>
is <foreign lang="la">SECUTUTUSECUTUS</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">secutus</foreign> (<bibl n="Cic. Rep.2.33.57">ii. 33. 57</bibl>).</p>
<p>Dittography of a word (or letter) most naturally occurs at the end of one page and the beginning of the next. Two
MSS. of the <title lang="la">Liber Glossarum</title> reproduce not merely the
pagination of their original but also this error, <foreign lang="la">in inteatro</foreign> for
<foreign lang="la">in theatro,</foreign> where the one <foreign lang="la">in</foreign> stands in the copies, as it did in
the original, at the end of one page, and the other <foreign lang="la">in</foreign> at the
beginning of the next (see Goetz <foreign lang="la">Lib. Gl.</foreign> p. 223). Dittography
of a letter is also a common occurrence in the transition from one line to another,
e.g. <foreign lang="la">Corneliaana</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">Corneliana</foreign>
in the Leyden MS. of Nonius (188 M. 24), where the three last letters stand at the beginning of a new line.</p></div2>

<head>Insertion of any marginal jotting</head>
<p>Finally, it should be noticed that not merely a gloss but any jotting in the margin (or elsewhere) may

occur on the following pages. Similarly a tenth-century MS. of St.

found in the margin opposite a corruption in the text, whether placed there by the scribe himself, by the corrector,
or by a subsequent scribe who made a copy of the MS. It has, however, other uses. Thus in a Bodleian MS. of Sidonius (Hatton 98),
opposite <foreign lang="la">laudibus imperatoris</foreign> of the text, we find in the margin
(fol. 118r) <foreign lang="la">require hujus imperatoris nomen;</foreign> opposite <foreign lang="la">Brictanos</foreign> (sic) of
the text stands in the margin (fol. 118v) <foreign lang="la">require de

for <foreign lang="la">non,</foreign> p. 76), <foreign lang="la">nota bene,</foreign> and expressions of admiration like
<foreign lang="la">mire, optime.</foreign> Index words, showing the contents of paragraphs,
were often written in the margin. For example, in the margin of the Laurentian codex of Nonius Marcellus,
opposite the paragraph (86 M. 10): <quote lang="la">Caecuttiunt. Varro
Gerontodidascalo: &ldquo;utrum oculi mei caecuttiunt? An ego
vidi servos in armis contra dominos?&rdquo;</quote> is written the index-heading
<foreign lang="la">Cecuttiunt, lipp&iacute;unt.</foreign> In the Harleian copy of this
MS. this marginal adscript has been treated as if it formed
<pb n="61"/>the first part of the line (beginning with <foreign lang="la">oculi</foreign>) opposite which
it stood in the margin, and the passage is copied in this way:
<quote lang="la">Caecuttiunt. Varro Gerontodidascalo: &ldquo;utrum caecuttiunt
lippiunt oculi mei caecuttiunt&rdquo;</quote> etc. The same Harleian MS. has sometimes incorporated in the text the marginal
adscript <foreign lang="la">quaere</foreign> (written in contracted form) of its Florentine
original. The <foreign lang="la">quae</foreign> inserted curiously into sentences (e.g.
107. 27 <quote lang="la">incideret <emph>quae</emph> in mortis malum</quote>; 114. 25 <quote lang="la">Cicero
Tusculanarum <emph>quae</emph> lib. v</quote>) in the copy is nothing but a misreading of this contraction (cf. <ref target="c7s5" targOrder="U">p. 96</ref> below).</p>

<head>Errors of Substitution</head>
<div2 id="c5s1" type="paragraph" n="1">
<head>Substitution of a gloss for the word it explains</head>
<p>We have seen in the last chapter that a gloss, or explanatory word, written in the original MS. over a
difficult word, has often in the copy been inserted in the text. In many cases it has been substituted for
the word which it was designed to explain (cf. <ref target="c4s1" targOrder="U">p. 54</ref>).
Thus in Virgil <cit><bibl n="Verg. Ecl. 6"><title>E.</title> vi. 40</bibl>
<quote lang="la"><l>rara per <emph>ignaros</emph> errent animalia montis,</l></quote></cit>
the <foreign lang="la">ignotos,</foreign> which is in some MSS. substituted for
<foreign lang="la">ignaros,</foreign> seems to be nothing but an explanation of
the unusual passive sense of <foreign lang="la">ignaros,</foreign> and its appearance
in the text is due to the error of some copyist, who found in his original:
<quote lang="la">rara per ignaros<hi rend="over">ignotos</hi> errent animalia montis,</quote>
and who wrongly imagined that the purpose with
which <foreign lang="la">ignotos</foreign> had been written above <foreign lang="la">ignaros</foreign> was to
correct a mistake and not to explain a difficult term.</p>
<p>The suprascript gloss was often preceded by the contraction
<foreign lang="la">i.</foreign> or <foreign lang="la">id</foreign> with cross-stroke through <mentioned>d,</mentioned> standing for
<foreign lang="la">id est.</foreign> In <bibl n="Pl. Capt. 4.2">Capt. 832</bibl>, a line quoted by Nonius as an instance
of the adverb <foreign lang="la">assulatim,</foreign> &ldquo;in splinters,&rdquo; from
<foreign lang="la">assula,</foreign> &ldquo;a splinter&rdquo;:
<quote lang="la">pr&iacute;usquam pultando &aacute;ssulatim f&oacute;ribus exitium &aacute;dfero,</quote>
<pb n="64"/>
we find <foreign lang="la">assulatim</foreign> replaced in the minuscule MSS. by the
two words <foreign lang="la">vel assultatim.</foreign> This may have been a suprascript
gloss, but was more probably a suprascript variant reading.
For a variant or emendation was usually preceded by <foreign lang="la">vel,</foreign>
written <foreign lang="la">vl</foreign> with cross-stroke through <mentioned>l</mentioned> (often mistaken for
<foreign lang="la">ut</foreign>), or <mentioned>l</mentioned> with cross-stroke (so here in <title>B</title>), or else by
<foreign lang="la">al.,</foreign>
standing for <foreign lang="la">alter</foreign> or <foreign lang="la">aliter</foreign> or <foreign lang="la">alius codex.</foreign><note anchored="yes">Thus
on the margin of a Bodleian ninth-century MS. of St.
Augustine (Laud. Misc. 120) we find on fol. 13v  <foreign lang="la">SICVT IN ALIO
CODICE</foreign>, on fol. 16v  <foreign lang="la">ALTER CODEX ALITER HABET</foreign>; in the
Harleian Nonius (ad 74 M. 5) <foreign lang="la">alter &ldquo;apeditones.&rdquo;</foreign></note> In
<bibl n="Pl. As. 3.3">Asin. 670</bibl> this
sign <foreign lang="la">al.</foreign> is miscopied <foreign lang="la">ADOL(escens)</foreign> in <title>D.</title></p>
<p>The practice of writing interlinear and marginal glosses was a very old one; and the substitution of the explanation
for the explained word is often of very early date. In the
description of the greedy guests in <bibl n="Pl. Mil. 3.1">Mil. 762</bibl> <title>P</title> has:
<quote lang="la">s&eacute;d procellunt se &eacute;t procumbunt d&iacute;midiati dum &aacute;ppetunt,</quote>
a line which scans perfectly, and has nothing about it to excite suspicion, were it not that it recurs fifteen lines below,
having been rewritten, probably in the bottom margin of the page in the proto-archetype (see above, p. 35), in this form:
<quote lang="la">sed procumbunt in mensam dimidiati petunt,</quote>
perhaps originally <foreign lang="la">sed procumbunt sed in mensam dum
dimidiati petunt</foreign> (or <foreign lang="la">dimidiati dum appetunt</foreign>). Now in the
dictionary of Festus we find the old word <foreign lang="la">procellunt</foreign> explained
by <foreign lang="la">procumbunt,</foreign> though in another passage of the
same dictionary this line is quoted as <foreign lang="la">sed procumbunt in
mensam.</foreign> This makes one suspect that the line as written by Plautus was:
<quote lang="la">s&eacute;d procellunt s&eacute;d<note anchored="yes">Class. Lat. <foreign lang="la">sc.</foreign> Both
<foreign lang="la">sed</foreign> the conjunction and <foreign lang="la">sed</foreign> the O. Lat.
pronoun might be written <foreign lang="la">set</foreign> (see <ref target="c1s7" targOrder="U">p. 21</ref>), whence perhaps the mistake
<foreign lang="la">se et.</foreign></note> in mensam d&iacute;midiati dum &aacute;ppetunt,</quote>
and that <foreign lang="la">procumbunt</foreign> is a gloss on <foreign lang="la">procellunt se in mensam,</foreign>
which at an early period found its way into the text.
<pb n="65"/></p>
<p>In early dictionaries, or &ldquo;glossaries,&rdquo;<note anchored="yes">The
&ldquo;Glossary of Placidus&rdquo; is especially useful to the student of
the text of Plautus, for it contains a number of the difficult words of
Plautus with their explanations. There is a recent edition of it by
Goetz in the <foreign lang="la">Corpus Glossariorum Latinorum</foreign> vol. v.</note> as they are called,
the stock interpretation of O. Lat. <foreign lang="la">oro tecum</foreign> is <foreign lang="la">rogo te.</foreign>
This gloss has ousted the Plautine word in <title>A</title> in <bibl n="Pl. Mos. 3.1">Most. 682</bibl>,
where <title>P</title> begins the line rightly with <foreign lang="la">bonum aequomque oras,</foreign>
but <title>A</title> destroys the metre with <foreign lang="la">bonum aequomque rogas.</foreign> The
same gloss appears in <title>P</title> in <bibl n="Pl. Per. 2.5">Pers. 321</bibl>, a line which in <title>A</title>
ends with <foreign lang="la">quod mecum dudum orasti,</foreign> but in <title>P</title> with <foreign lang="la">quod me
dudum rogasti.</foreign></p></div2>
<div2 id="c5s2" type="paragraph" n="2">
<head>Substitution of classical for archaic form</head>
<p>The substitution of the classical for an archaic
form, discussed in <ref target="c1s7" targOrder="U">chap. i</ref>, e.g. <foreign lang="la">&iacute;llic</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">illi</foreign> adv., may
often be really the substitution of a suprascript or marginal gloss. Thus in <bibl n="Pl. Am. 2.1">Amph. 631</bibl> the original of
<title>BDEJ</title> seems to have had, like <title>B,</title> the Plautine adverb
<foreign lang="la">s&ibreve;m&imacr;tu,</foreign> &ldquo;together,&rdquo; in the text explained by
<foreign lang="la">simul</foreign> in the margin. This <foreign lang="la">simitu</foreign> is retained by <title>E,</title> but <foreign lang="la">simul</foreign>
is substituted for it in <title>J,</title> while the scribe of <title>D</title> wrote
first <foreign lang="la">simitu,</foreign> then changed it to <foreign lang="la">simul.</foreign></p></div2>
<div2 id="c5s3" type="paragraph" n="3">
<head>Wrong treatment of correction in original:  good evidence that one MS is derived from another</head>
<p>This is the best place for mentioning a common cause of corruption in MSS., namely the wrong treatment
by the copyist of a correction which he found in his original. In <bibl n="Pl. Am. 5.1">Amph. 1083</bibl> the original of <title>BDEJ</title>
had <foreign lang="la">mea,</foreign> rightly corrected to <foreign lang="la">meorum</foreign> in this way:
<foreign lang="la">mea.<hi rend="over">orum.</hi></foreign> But none of the copies has got the word correctly.
<title>B</title> has <foreign lang="la">mearum, <title>D</title> morum,</foreign> while the common original of
<title>EJ</title>, another copy of the original of <title>BD,</title> had <foreign lang="la">mea.</foreign></p>
<p>Mistakes of this kind are usually the best evidence of the derivation of one MS. from another. The Harleian MS. of
Nonius is proved to be a copy of the Laurentian codex by proofs of this sort, as well as other evidence. For example,
the strange reading <foreign lang="la">baretere</foreign> (for <foreign lang="la">baetere</foreign>) of the Harleian in
Nonius 77 M. 19 is clearly due to a misconception of the
correction in the Laurentian, <foreign lang="la">bretere;<hi rend="over">a</hi></foreign> its <foreign lang="la">maulta</foreign>
(for <foreign lang="la">multa</foreign>)
<pb n="66"/>in 103 M. 25 is explained by the <foreign lang="la">mata<hi rend="over">ul</hi></foreign> of the older
codex; its <foreign lang="la">laum</foreign> (for <foreign lang="la">lanitium</foreign>) in 212 M. 20 is due to a
mistaking of the transposition signs for deleting signs in the
<foreign lang="la">lacinium</foreign> corrected to <foreign lang="la">lanicium</foreign> of its original (cf. <ref target="c2s3" targOrder="U">p. 32</ref>).</p></div2>
<div2 id="c5s4" type="paragraph" n="4">
<head>Substitution of word from context</head>
<p>A scribe often substituted for the true word a word from the immediate context, in a temporary
aberration of mind. In <bibl n="Cic. Orat. 98">Cicero <title>Orator</title> &sect; 98</bibl>, for example,

<foreign lang="la">acuteque</foreign> has been substituted for <foreign lang="la">arguteque;</foreign> and if we
seek for the cause, we find it in the previous occurrence
of the word <foreign lang="la">acuto</foreign> in the sentence: <quote lang="la">qui in illo subtili
et <emph>acuto</emph> elaboravit, ut callide <emph>arguteque</emph> diceret.</quote></p></div2>
<div2 id="c5s5" type="paragraph" n="5">
<head>Substitution of word from parallel passage</head>
<p>Often the substituted word comes from a parallel passage, which was in the mind of the scribe as he was
writing. In <cit><bibl n="Prop. 2.1">Propertius ii. 1. 58:</bibl>
<quote lang="la">solus amor morbi non <foreign lang="la">habet</foreign> artificem</quote></cit>,
has been written <foreign lang="la">non amat artificem,</foreign> through a reminiscence
of <cit><bibl n="Prop. 1.2">i. 2. 8:</bibl>
<quote lang="la">nudus amor formae non amat artificem.</quote></cit>
(On this error see also <ref target="c1s14" targOrder="U">ch. i. &sect; 14.</ref>)</p></div2>
<div2 id="c5s6" type="paragraph" n="6">
<head>Substitution of ecclesiastical or biblical words</head>
<p>The mediaeval scribes were monks; so it is not surprising that the parallel passage that occurred to
their minds was often a passage from the Bible. A
well-known example is Horace <cit><bibl n="Hor. Carm. 3.18"><title>C.</title> iii. 18. 11-12:</bibl>
<quote lang="la"><l>festus in pratis vacat otioso</l>
<l>cum bove <emph>pagus</emph>,</l></quote></cit>
where a whole class of MSS. substitutes <foreign lang="la">pardus</foreign> for
<foreign lang="la">pagus,</foreign> the scribe of their common original having
allowed his thoughts to revert to the passage of <cit><bibl n="Isaiah 11.6">Isaiah
(xi. 6):</bibl>  <quote lang="la">habitabit lupus cum agno et pardus cum haedo
accubabit.</quote></cit> Other substitutions that tell of monk-copyists are mentioned below.</p></div2>
<div2 id="c5s7" type="paragraph" n="7">
<head>Confusion of similar words</head>
<p>But the most widely extended error of substitution is the confusion of words that are similar in
appearance. Many cases of this confusion really
<pb n="67"/>belong to chap. vi (Confusion of Letters) or chap. vii
(Confusion of Contractions); for the substitution in a
Latin MS. of <foreign lang="la">lubet</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">jubet (iubet)</foreign> means that the
copyist has mistaken the letter <mentioned>i</mentioned> for the letter <mentioned>l</mentioned> (see
<ref target="c6s1" targOrder="U">ch. vi. &sect; 1</ref>), and the substitution of <foreign lang="la">quidem</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">quid est</foreign>
means that he has wrongly expanded the contraction
<mentioned>&emacr;</mentioned> (see <ref target="c7s2" targOrder="U">ch. vii. &sect; 2</ref>). Again, the substitution of
<foreign lang="la">tribus</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">tribubus</foreign> is, properly speaking, a case of Haplography
(see <ref target="c3s1" targOrder="U">ch. iii. &sect; 1</ref>); and so on. But it will be
convenient for practical purposes to treat in this chapter all cases of the confusion of words, whatever
the secret influence may have been. In most cases it is merely the general similarity of the words that has
caused the mistake, e.g. <foreign lang="la">militia</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">malitia.</foreign> Here too
the monk-copyist often betrays himself. In Horace MSS., for example, he has substituted <foreign lang="la">amen</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">amem</foreign>
with comical result in <cit><bibl n="Hor. Carm. 3.9"><title>C.</title> iii. 9. 24:</bibl>
<quote lang="la"><l>tecum vivere <emph>amem</emph>, tecum obeam libens</l></quote></cit>;
similarly <foreign lang="la">externa pacata</foreign> becomes <foreign lang="la">aeterna peccata, Hebrum</foreign>
is transformed to <foreign lang="la">Hebraeum,</foreign> etc.</p>
<p>In Plautus MSS. the case is common of an archaic word, unfamiliar to the scribe, having been replaced by a familiar
word of similar appearance; e.g. <foreign lang="la">fuant</foreign> (<title>B</title>), the subjunctive of O.
Lat. <foreign lang="la">fuo</foreign> (whence <foreign lang="la">fui</foreign>), has become <foreign lang="la">fiant</foreign> in
<bibl n="Pl. Ps. 4.3">Pseud. 1029</bibl> <title>(CD).</title>
Such substitution, however, is rather a case of deliberate
emendation, and belongs to chap. i.</p></div2>
<div2 id="c5s8" type="paragraph" n="8">
<head>Substitution through insertion or omission of syllable</head>
<p>Very commonly the substituted word differs from the genuine word in the insertion of a syllable.
Thus <foreign lang="la">infamia</foreign> becomes <foreign lang="la">in familia</foreign> (e.g. in MSS. of <bibl n="Liv. 45.38.10">Livy
xlv. 38. 10</bibl>), <foreign lang="la">consido</foreign> becomes <foreign lang="la">considero.</foreign> We must
excuse such mistakes when we consider that a mediaeval scribe was in the habit of finding in his
originals contractions like <foreign lang="la">aia</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">anima,</foreign> and syllables
like <foreign lang="la">er, us</foreign> etc. expressed by shorthand signs (see
<ref target="c7s1" targOrder="U">ch. vii. &sect; 1</ref>) which were often very faint and hardly
<pb n="68"/>discernible. The opposite error, of omitting a syllable,
by which, for example, <foreign lang="la">periratus</foreign> has become <foreign lang="la">piratus</foreign> in
<bibl n="Pl. Truc. 3.1">Truc. 656</bibl>, has been already mentioned in <ref target="c3s10" targOrder="U">ch. iii. &sect; 10</ref>.</p>
<p>Diminutives, it should be noticed, are often confused
with the simple word; e.g. <foreign lang="la">servolus</foreign> becomes <foreign lang="la">servus</foreign>
(<bibl n="Pl. As. prologue.0">Asin. Arg. 4</bibl>), <foreign lang="la">primulo</foreign> becomes <foreign lang="la">primo</foreign>
(<bibl n="Pl. Cas. prologue.0">Cas. 40</bibl>), <foreign lang="la">saccum</foreign> becomes
<foreign lang="la">sacculum</foreign> (<bibl n="Pl. Capt. 1.1">Capt. 90</bibl>). Similarly frequentatives with
simple verbs, e.g. <foreign lang="la">clamito</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">clamo</foreign> (cf. <bibl n="Pl. Mos. 1.1">Most. 6</bibl>); and
2nd singular with 2nd plural imperative, e.g. <foreign lang="la">intercludite</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">interclude</foreign>
(<bibl n="Pl. Mil. 2.2">Mil. 223</bibl>; see Leo's note).</p></div2>

<p>Special attention must be called to one cause of the confusion of words, namely Late Latin pronunciation.
In Late Latin, for example, <foreign lang="la">sci</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">si</foreign> had a
similar pronunciation, as we see from Italian, e.g. Ital.
<foreign lang="it">scimmia</foreign> for Lat. <foreign lang="la">simia</foreign> (cf. <foreign lang="la">scimia</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">simia</foreign> in our
minuscule MSS. in <bibl n="Pl. Mil. 2.2">Mil. 179</bibl>). To a scribe <foreign lang="la">sis</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">scis,
sitis</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">scitis</foreign> were more or less equivalent forms,
and the <foreign lang="la">sci</foreign>-forms of the original might appear as <foreign lang="la">si</foreign>-forms
in the copy and vice versa.  So with <foreign lang="la">sce</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">se,</foreign>
e.g. <foreign lang="la">quiesce</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">quiesse.</foreign> Again, the diphthong <mentioned>ae</mentioned> had
come to be a simple vowel like <foreign lang="la">e</foreign>; and a scribe wrote
<foreign lang="la">equus</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">aequus</foreign> of the original as readily as we might
write &ldquo;gaol&rdquo; for &ldquo;jail.&rdquo; The coincidence of the pronunciation
of <foreign lang="la">b</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">v</foreign> made <foreign lang="la">benefica</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">venefica</foreign>
equivalents (cf. <bibl n="Pl. Epid. 2.2">Epid. 221</bibl>, where <foreign lang="la">veneficam</foreign> is in the Palimpsest
<foreign lang="la">beneficam</foreign>), and led to the coining of a new word for
&ldquo;sorceress,&rdquo; viz. <foreign lang="la">malefica</foreign>. <mentioned>H</mentioned> was dropped in pronunciation,
and so its presence or absence in writing was a matter of little importance; <foreign lang="la">abeo</foreign> is substituted
for <foreign lang="la">habeo, ortus</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">hortus.</foreign> It would depend on the
amount of education a Carolingian copyist had received and on the amount of attention he paid to his textbooks
of orthography whether he left Late Latin misspellings untouched or altered them to the classical
form. But it is seldom safe to take such spellings in
Carolingian MSS. as <mentioned>e, ae,</mentioned> and <mentioned>oe; ch, ph, th,</mentioned> and <mentioned>c, p, t</mentioned> 
<pb n="69"/>in words like <foreign lang="la">letum, Bacchus</foreign>; <mentioned>y</mentioned> and <mentioned>i; ti</mentioned>
and <mentioned>ci</mentioned> before a vowel; <mentioned>f</mentioned> and <mentioned>ph,</mentioned> as evidence that this or that
spelling was found in the original MS. Much more is this true of varieties of spelling which we ourselves
regard as legitimate alternatives, such as <foreign lang="la">quidquid</foreign>
and <foreign lang="la">quicquid, nunquam</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">numquam, tingo</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">tinguo,
conjux</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">conjunx, -clum</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">-culum,</foreign> and the assimilation
or non-assimilation of a preposition in compound verbs,
e.g. <foreign lang="la">inlicio</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">illicio;</foreign> though of course one scribe differed
greatly from another in the fidelity with which the exact spelling of the original was reproduced.</p>
<p>In chap. i these Late Latin misspellings have been mentioned, in so far as they led to a wrong correction on the
part of Carolingian scribes. Here we are concerned rather with misspellings which had the form of other words and so
remained uncorrected. For a fuller account of them I refer
the reader to Schuchardt <title lang="de">Vokalismus des Vulg&auml;rlateins,</title> and
content myself here with enumerating a few of the more notable kinds:</p>
<p>(1) <hi rend="bold">a for au</hi> (cf. Late Lat. <foreign lang="la">Agustus</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">Augustus,</foreign>
Ital. <foreign lang="it">Agosto</foreign>). Hence substitutions like <foreign lang="la">catus</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">cautus</foreign> (cf.
<bibl n="Pl. Mil. 3.1">Mil. 603</bibl> <foreign lang="la">catalogos</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">cautela locus</foreign>), <foreign lang="la">fastus</foreign> for
<foreign lang="la">faustus.</foreign></p>
<p>(2) <hi rend="bold">b for v, v for b.</hi> &mdash; Hence confusions of <foreign lang="la">belle</foreign> and
<foreign lang="la">velle, abeo</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">aveho, jubet</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">juvet, -bit</foreign>
and <foreign lang="la">-vit, bibo</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">vivo.</foreign></p>
<p>In <bibl n="Pl. Truc. 1.2">Truc. 141</bibl> <foreign lang="la">Veneris publicum</foreign> is in <title>B</title> <foreign lang="la">bene respublicum</foreign>,
which has been changed in <title>CD</title> to <foreign lang="la">bene rempublicam.</foreign></p>
<p>(For examples in <title>A</title> see Studemund's Index.)</p>
<p>(3) <hi rend="bold">c for ch, c for q, ci and ti before a vowel.</hi> &mdash; Hence
<foreign lang="la">condam</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">quondam</foreign> are confused (cf. <foreign lang="la">postquam</foreign> for
<foreign lang="la">poscam</foreign> <bibl n="Pl. Mil. 3.2">Mil. 836</bibl>); <foreign lang="la">mecum</foreign> is written for <foreign lang="la">moechum,</foreign>
etc. <foreign lang="la">ch</foreign> came in parts of the Roman world (e.g. Italy) to represent the
&ldquo;hard&rdquo; or normal sound of <foreign lang="la">c,</foreign> while the letter <foreign lang="la">c</foreign> was used for
&ldquo;soft&rdquo; or palatalized <foreign lang="la">c</foreign> (cf. Ital. <foreign lang="it">chi</foreign> for
Lat. <foreign lang="la">qui</foreign> and <mentioned>ci</mentioned>). The
spelling <foreign lang="la">ka</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">ca,</foreign> recommended by some Latin grammarians,
was much affected by Carolingian scribes (e.g. <foreign lang="la">kaput,</foreign> p. 60).</p>
<p>(For examples of <foreign lang="la">c</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">ch</foreign> in <title>A</title> see Studemund's Index.)
<pb n="70"/></p>
<p>(4) <hi rend="bold">e and ae, oe.</hi> &mdash; Hence confusions of <foreign lang="la">fere</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">ferae, cedo</foreign>
and <foreign lang="la">caedo, queror</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">quaero, equus</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">aequus, atque (adque)</foreign>
and <foreign lang="la">ad quae, merens</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">maerens, letum</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">laetum.</foreign></p>
<p>(For examples of the confusion of <foreign lang="la">e</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">ae</foreign> in <title>A</title> see Studemund's Index.)</p>
<p>(5) <hi rend="bold">e for &ibreve;.</hi> &mdash; In the Medicean MS. of Virgil we find
the spelling <foreign lang="la">agmena</foreign> (<bibl n="Verg. A. 1.490"><title>A.</title> i. 490</bibl>; <bibl n="Verg. A. 2.683">ii. 683</bibl>).
In <cit><bibl n="Liv. 2.59.7">Livy ii. 59. 7</bibl> <quote lang="la">agmen e castris</quote></cit> has been wrongly changed to <foreign lang="la">agmine castris</foreign>
by some scribe who thought it a misspelling like that of
the Medicean Virgil. So in <bibl n="Tac. Hist. 5.2">Tac. <title>Hist.</title> v. 2</bibl> <foreign lang="la">nomen e suo</foreign> has
been wrongly corrected to <foreign lang="la">nomine suo.</foreign></p>
<p>(For examples in <title>A</title>, e.g. <bibl n="Pl. St. 4.2">Stich. 625</bibl> <foreign lang="la">emmortales,</foreign> see Studemund's Index.)</p>
<p>(6) <hi rend="bold">f for ph.</hi>&mdash;(For exx. in <title>A</title> see Studemund's Index.)</p>
<p>(7) <hi rend="bold">h dropped or added.</hi>&mdash;Lat. <foreign lang="la">h</foreign> ceased to be sounded
(cf. Ital., French, etc.), and so was on the one hand dropped in writing, or on the other wrongly added. Hence confusions
of <foreign lang="la">hostium</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">ostium, hortus</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">ortus, habeo</foreign> and
<foreign lang="la">abeo, hos</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">os, his</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">is, honos</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">onus, honestus</foreign> and
<foreign lang="la">onustus,</foreign> etc.</p>
<p>(For examples in <title>A</title> see Studemund's Index.)</p>
<p>(8) <hi rend="bold">i (and e) prefixed to initial sc, sp, st.</hi>&mdash;Hence confusions
of <foreign lang="la">i(n)specto</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">specto, e(x)specto</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">specto,</foreign> etc.</p>
<p>(9) <hi rend="bold">i for ii.</hi>&mdash;The pronunciation of <foreign lang="la">ii</foreign> as <foreign lang="la">yi</foreign> or
<foreign lang="la">&imacr;</foreign> may have
had something to do with the substitution of <foreign lang="la">regis</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">regiis,
sin</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">si in, sit</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">si id (it),</foreign> etc. So <foreign lang="la">hostiis</foreign>
takes the place of <foreign lang="la">hostis, coloniis</foreign> of <foreign lang="la">colonis,</foreign> etc. On <foreign lang="la">his</foreign> for
<foreign lang="la">(h)iis</foreign> see <ref target="c1s7" targOrder="U">p. 22.</ref></p>
<p>(10) <hi rend="bold">m inserted</hi> in words like <foreign lang="la">volu(m)ptas.</foreign> Hence the
frequent confusion of <foreign lang="la">voluptas</foreign> with <foreign lang="la">voluntas</foreign> in MSS.</p>
<p>(11) <hi rend="bold">m dropped.</hi>&mdash;Hence confusion of ablative singular with
accusative singular of 3rd declension, e.g. <foreign lang="la">patre</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">patrem.</foreign> The error is
often due to the neglect of the shorthand sign for <foreign lang="la">m</foreign> (<ref target="c7s1" targOrder="U">ch. vii. &sect; 1</ref>).</p>
<p>(12) <hi rend="bold">n dropped</hi> before <foreign lang="la">s</foreign> etc., e.g. <foreign lang="la">istruo</foreign> for
<foreign lang="la">instruo.</foreign> This omission of <foreign lang="la">n,</foreign> which may in some cases be due to the
neglect of the shorthand sign for the letter (<ref target="c7s1" targOrder="U">ch. vii. &sect; 1</ref>), has
led to substitutions like <foreign lang="la">struo</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">instruo,</foreign> etc., the seeming
<foreign lang="la">istruo</foreign> being deemed a misspelling of <foreign lang="la">struo</foreign> (cf. no. 8, above).
Thus in <bibl n="Cic. N.D. 1.1">Cic. Nat. Deor. i. 1</bibl> <foreign lang="la">scientiam</foreign> is substituted for <foreign lang="la">inscientiam.</foreign>
The endings <foreign lang="la">-as</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">-ans, -es</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">-ens</foreign> are often confused.
<pb n="71"/></p>
<p>(13) <hi rend="bold">o for &ubreve;, o for -um.</hi>&mdash;Hence the confusion of <foreign lang="la">creatur</foreign>
and <foreign lang="la">creator, ductus</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">doctus,</foreign> etc.</p>
<p>(For examples in <title>A</title> of <mentioned>o</mentioned> for <mentioned>u</mentioned> see Studemund's Index,
e.g. <bibl n="Pl. Mos. 3.2">Most. 794</bibl> <foreign lang="la">nom</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">num.</foreign>)</p>
<p>(14) <hi rend="bold">p for ph.</hi></p>
<p>(15) <hi rend="bold">si, se for sci, sce.</hi>&mdash;This was a result of the palatalization
of <mentioned>c</mentioned> before <mentioned>e, i,</mentioned> and led to substitutions like <foreign lang="la">quiesse</foreign>
for <foreign lang="la">quiesce.</foreign></p>
<p>(16) <hi rend="bold">tt (t) for ct, pt</hi> (cf. Late Lat. <foreign lang="la">autor</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">auctor,</foreign> Ital.
<foreign lang="it">otto, sette</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">octo, septem</foreign>). Hence, e.g., <foreign lang="la">littoris</foreign> for
<foreign lang="la">lectoris. Attatae</foreign> of <bibl n="Pl. Cas. 2.8">Cas. 478</bibl> is written <foreign lang="la">aptate</foreign> in <title>E.</title></p>
<p>(17) <hi rend="bold">t for th.</hi>&mdash;(For exx. in <title>A</title> see Studemund's Index.)</p>
<p>(On the older confusion of <mentioned>-d</mentioned> and <mentioned>-t</mentioned> in pronunciation,
whence confusions like <foreign lang="la">haud (haut)</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">aut, quod</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">quot,
nequid</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">nequit,</foreign> see <ref target="c1s7" targOrder="U">p. 21</ref>).</p>
<p>(18) <hi rend="bold">s for x.</hi>&mdash;Hence confusions like <foreign lang="la">auxerint</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">hauserint,
auxi</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">ausi.</foreign> Mistakes like <foreign lang="la">exiit</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">haec sit</foreign>
(Caesar <bibl n="Caes. Gal. 4.7"><title>B.G.</title> iv. 7. 3</bibl>), <foreign lang="la">fac sit</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">faxit</foreign>
(<bibl n="Ter. Ph. 3.3">Ter. <title>Phorm.</title> 554</bibl>) are to be referred
to the practice, prevalent in the Empire, of using <mentioned>cs</mentioned> for <mentioned>x.</mentioned>
Another spelling was <mentioned>cx,</mentioned> e.g. <foreign lang="la">ucxor.</foreign> On the early spelling
<mentioned>xs</mentioned> for <mentioned>x</mentioned> see <ref target="cas9" targOrder="U">p. 108.</ref></p>
<p>(19) <hi rend="bold">i and y.</hi>&mdash;(For exx. in <title>A</title> see Studemund's Index.)</p>
<p>(20) <hi rend="bold">Double letter for single</hi> and vice versa. &mdash; This leads
to confusions of words like <foreign lang="la">callidus</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">calidus, errat</foreign> and
<foreign lang="la">erat, reddit</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">redit.</foreign></p></div2>

<head>A clue to home of archetype</head>
<p>Misspellings and confusions of words often give us a clue to the home of the archetype of a MS.
Thus the use of a double consonant for a single is perhaps especially frequent in MSS. written by Irish
scribes; for in the Irish language a single consonant flanked with vowels had come to have a spirant sound,
while the true consonant-sound was retained only by the double consonant.</p>
<p>Similarly the use of <mentioned>f</mentioned> for <mentioned>v</mentioned> has been thought to indicate
a German original (cf. Germ. <foreign lang="de">Vater</foreign>, pronounced &ldquo;fater&rdquo;). In
the Lombard script a separate sign was sometimes used for
<pb n="72"/><mentioned>ti</mentioned> before a vowel (where the <mentioned>t</mentioned> was palatalized or assibilated)
and before a consonant (where <mentioned>t</mentioned> retained its ordinary sound).
So the absence of confusion between <mentioned>ci</mentioned> and <mentioned>ti</mentioned> may indicate
an Italian original (see Mommsen's edition of Solinus, preface p. civ, Berl. 1895). A peculiarity of Spanish MSS. is the
spelling <foreign lang="la">quum</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">cum;</foreign> and other &ldquo;Spanish&rdquo; misspellings
are <mentioned>d</mentioned> for <mentioned>t</mentioned> in words like <foreign lang="la">terridorium</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">territorium</foreign>,
<mentioned>g</mentioned> for <mentioned>c</mentioned>
in words like <foreign lang="la">vindigare</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">vindicare;</foreign> while forms like
<foreign lang="la">tenire, invinire</foreign> are called &ldquo;Frankish&rdquo; (see Hauler in <title lang="de">Sitzber. Wien. Akad.</title> 1888, p. 2 n.)</p>
<p>(On &ldquo;Spanish&rdquo; misspellings see Mu&ntilde;oz y Rivero <title lang="es">Palegrafia
Visigoda</title> 1881 p. 104; and on &ldquo;Irish&rdquo; misspellings

<div2 id="c5s11" type="paragraph" n="11">
<head>Mediaeval MSS. not written to dictation</head>
<p>Substitutions of this kind, it should be noticed, do not imply that the scribe wrote to dictation.
Dictation of MSS. was practised in ancient times, and came again into use when the book-trade revived. But
so long as the writing of books remained in the hands of monks, who were not intent upon turning out a
large number of copies of the same work, but rather on making a single copy for their own Monastery Library,
dictation was unknown. Usually the copy had to be made as quickly as possible from a MS. lent for the
purpose from another monastery. In such a case a number of monks might be set to work on it at the
same time, if the book was divisible into parts, so that dictation would be out of the question. All that we
can learn of the Monastery Scriptorium suggests to us rather a room where a number of copyists sat in
silence, each engaged on a different task. Witness the lines of Alcuin, which may have stood on the wall of
the Scriptorium of St. Martin's Monastery at Tours:
<quote lang="la"><l>hic sedeant sacrae scribentes famina legis,</l>
<l>nec non sanctorum dicta sacrata patrum.</l>
<l>his interserere caveant sua frivola verba,</l>
<l>frivola ne propter erret et ipsa manus, etc.;</l></quote>
<pb n="73"/>
also the description of the Scriptorium at Touruai: <quote lang="la">si claustrum ingredereris, videres plerumque xii monachos
juvenes in cathedris sedentes, et super tabulas diligenter et artificiose compositas <emph>cum silentio scribentes.</emph></quote> In fact
we are told of an elaborate code of signs being in use in the scriptorium to prevent the silence being broken.
A monk who wished to be supplied with a pagan work scratched his ear like a dog; if he wished a missal he made the sign of a cross; and so on.</p>
<p>These errors of substitution then in mediaeval MSS. are rather mistakes of eye than mistakes of ear.<note anchored="yes">Some regard
the omission of a final vowel in elision in poetry as a
proof that a manuscript has been written to dictation; e.g. <bibl n="Verg. A. 11.396">Virg. A.
xi. 396</bibl> <foreign lang="la">mexperti</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">me experti.</foreign> But the error here is rather the error
of haplography (<ref target="c3s3" targOrder="U">ch. iii. &sect; 3</ref>), and other cases admit of other explanations.</note></p></div2>

<p><cit><bibl n="Pl. Am. 1.prol">Amph. 73</bibl> <quote lang="la">sir&eacute;mpse legem j&uacute;ssit esse Juppiter</quote></cit>. (The MMS. have

<p>In <bibl n="Pl. Mil. 1.1">Mil. 24</bibl>, where the Parasite explains the reason of his
reluctance to quit the Soldier's service, the reading of <title>A</title> seems to be: <quote lang="la">nisi unum epityrum estur insanum bene.</quote>
But Varro quotes the line with <foreign lang="la">epityra estur,</foreign> which is more likely to have been the actual phrase used by Plautus,
<foreign lang="la">epityra</foreign> being accusative plural, governed by the impersonal
passive<note anchored="yes">This O. Lat. construction is known from Ennius' <foreign lang="la">vitam vivitur</foreign>
(see my <title>Latin Language</title> p. 521).</note> <foreign lang="la">estur,</foreign> so that the genuine line will be:
<quote lang="la"><l>nisi &uacute;num: epityra &eacute;stur insan&uacute;m bene,</l></quote>
&ldquo;but one thing I will say: (his) olive-salad is frantically good eating.&rdquo; Varro's reading appears to have been the original
reading of <foreign lang="la">P,</foreign> though in our minuscule MSS. between <foreign lang="la">epityra</foreign>
and <foreign lang="la">estur</foreign> stand the words <foreign lang="la">ut apud illa</foreign> (for <foreign lang="la">illum</foreign> probably).
If we suppose <foreign lang="la">ut</foreign> to be a corruption of <foreign lang="la">vel</foreign> (see above, <ref target="c5s1" targOrder="U">p. 64</ref>),
these words will be a gloss on some unusual form of the demonstrative
adverb, say <foreign lang="la">illi</foreign> or <foreign lang="la">ei,</foreign> &ldquo;there,&rdquo; &ldquo;at that house&rdquo;;
though a simpler explanation of them is that they are an example not of substitution but of insertion, <foreign lang="la">ut apud illum</foreign>
having been designed to explain the construction of the sentence &ldquo;how frantically good eating is the olive-salad at his house!&rdquo;</p>

<head>Confusion of Letters</head>
<div2 id="c6s1" type="paragraph" n="1">
<head>Letters confused in (1) capitals, (2) Caroline minuscules</head>
<p>The possibility of confusion of letters varies according to the character of writing in which a text has been
copied. In capital writing it is limited to certain letters, and in uncial to the same with a few exceptions
and additions. In minuscule writing quite a different set of letters are liable to be confused with one
another; and the possibility of confusion varies for Caroline, Visigothic, and Lombard minuscules. The text of
Plautus offers us examples of the confusion of letters in two styles only of writing, but these perhaps the
most important&mdash;capitals and Caroline minuscules.</p>
<p>Some letters are equally liable to confusion in
capital and Caroline minuscule script, such as I and L,
<mentioned>i</mentioned> and <mentioned>l.</mentioned> The minuscule form of <mentioned>i</mentioned> which is liable to
confusion with <mentioned>l</mentioned> is the &ldquo;tall&rdquo; form<note anchored="yes">For representations of the letters the reader may consult Sir E.
Maunde Thompson's <title>Handbook of Greek and Latin Palaeography</title>
(International Scientific Series), London 1893.</note> of <mentioned>i.</mentioned> Indeed, it
is often difficult to decide in a MS. written in early Caroline minuscule whether the scribe has written <mentioned>l</mentioned>
or an <mentioned>i</mentioned> of this form. This confusion has turned <foreign lang="la">inulta</foreign>
into <foreign lang="la">invita</foreign> in MSS. of Horace <cit><bibl n="Hor. Carm. 2.1"><title>C.</title> ii. 1. 26:</bibl>
<quote lang="la"><lg><l>Juno et deorum quisquis amicior</l>
<l>Afris <foreign lang="la">inulta</foreign> cesserit impotens</l>
<l>tellure, victorum nepotes</l>
<l>rettulit inferias Jugurthae,</l></lg></quote></cit>
<pb n="83"/>
and has changed <foreign lang="la">majorum</foreign> to <foreign lang="la">malorum</foreign> in <bibl n="Pl. Ps. 2.1">Pseud. 581</bibl>.
But a confusion of F and E is peculiar to majuscule writing. We may take as example Prof. Ellis' certain
emendation <foreign lang="la">ne frit quidem,</foreign> &ldquo;not even a grain,&rdquo; for the
<foreign lang="la">nec erit quidem</foreign> of the MSS. in <cit><bibl n="Pl. Mos. 3.1">Most. 595,</bibl>
<quote lang="la"><l>non d&aacute;t, non debet. N&oacute;n debet? Ne <foreign lang="la">fr&iacute;t</foreign> quidem</l>
<l>ferre h&iacute;nc potes.</l></quote></cit></p>
<p>A confusion of <mentioned>f</mentioned> and <mentioned>s,</mentioned> on the other hand, is peculiar
to minuscule, in which the two letters were as easily confused as their representatives are in early printed
books. To this confusion we owe the variants <foreign lang="la">sors</foreign> and
<foreign lang="la">fors</foreign> in Horace <cit><bibl n="Hor. S. 1.1.2"><title>S.</title> i. 1. 2:</bibl>
<quote lang="la"><lg><l>qui fit, Maecenas, ut nemo quam sibi sortem</l>
<l>seu ratio dederit seu <emph>fors</emph> objecerit, illa</l>
<l>contentus vivat, laudet diversa sequentes?</l></lg></quote></cit></p>
<p>Similarly the confusion of <mentioned>r</mentioned> and <mentioned>s</mentioned> is peculiar to early
minuscule; e.g. <foreign lang="la">urit</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">visit</foreign> in Horace <cit><bibl n="Hor. Carm. 1.4"><title>C.</title> i. 4. 8:</bibl>
<quote lang="la"><lg><l>dum graves Cyclopum</l>
<l>Volcanus ardens <emph>visit</emph> officinas.</l></lg></quote></cit></p>
<p>In minuscule MSS., as in careless printing, <mentioned>cl</mentioned> and <mentioned>d</mentioned> are often almost indistinguishable. Thus in Horace MSS.
we find <foreign lang="la">redimat</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">reclinat</foreign> in <cit><bibl n="Hor. Epod. 17.24"><title>Epod.</title> xvii. 24:</bibl>
<quote lang="la"><l>nullum ab labore me <emph>reclinat</emph> otium</l></quote></cit>;
<foreign lang="la">demens</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">clemens</foreign> in <cit><bibl n="Hor. Carm. 3.11"><title>C.</title> iii. 11. 46:</bibl>
<quote lang="la"><l>quod viro <emph>clemens</emph> misero peperci.</l></quote></cit></p>
<p>Often the possibility of confusion of letters of the same character of writing differed in process of time. In
early minuscule, for example, a prevalent form of <mentioned>a</mentioned> is
what is known as &ldquo;open&rdquo; <mentioned>a</mentioned>; and nothing is commoner
in MSS. than to find confusions, dating from the early minuscule stage of a text, of <mentioned>a</mentioned> and <mentioned>u.</mentioned> Alcuin,
in replying to a query of the Emperor Charlemagne
<pb n="84"/>about the proper gender of <foreign lang="la">rubus,</foreign> complains of the
liability of the terminations <mentioned>-um</mentioned> and <mentioned>-am</mentioned> to confusion
(<quote lang="la">possunt quaedam ex his exemplis vitio scriptoris esse
corrupta et &ldquo;u&rdquo; pro &ldquo;a&rdquo; vel etiam &ldquo;a&rdquo; pro &ldquo;u&rdquo;
posita</quote> &mdash; <title>Epist.</title> 162 in vol. iv of the <title lang="la">Epistolae</title> in the
<title>Mon. Germ. Hist.</title>) Between &ldquo;open&rdquo; <mentioned>a</mentioned> and ordinary <mentioned>a</mentioned>
came a transition-stage, in which a horizontal line is drawn connecting the two horns of &ldquo;open&rdquo; <mentioned>a.</mentioned> This
occasional transition-form is easily confused with <mentioned>ci.</mentioned>
Hence, e.g., <foreign lang="la">cispellam</foreign> has replaced <foreign lang="la">aspellam</foreign> in our MSS.
of <bibl n="Pl. Am. 3.4">Amph. 1000</bibl>. A later form of <mentioned>a,</mentioned> the &ldquo;high-backed&rdquo;
form, is often very like <mentioned>d.</mentioned> This has produced a confusion
of <foreign lang="la">aio</foreign> with <foreign lang="la">dico</foreign> in the <title>Captivi,</title>
<bibl n="Pl. Capt. 1.1">vv. 72</bibl>, <bibl n="Pl. Capt. 3.5">694</bibl>. (On
the confusion of Lombard <mentioned>a</mentioned> with <mentioned>cc</mentioned> see <ref target="c6s3" targOrder="U">&sect; 3</ref> below.)</p>

<p>In Nonius 133. 15 the Leyden MS. has <foreign lang="la">tune.</foreign> Whether the

<p>The confusion of <foreign lang="la">ct</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">tt</foreign> may be also a matter of pronunciation;

<p>In the Merovingian script the characters are so rudely and irregularly formed that the possibilities of
confusion are very numerous, as numerous almost as in the early Roman cursive hand which we find in the
<foreign lang="it">graffiti</foreign> of Pompeii. There is a great temptation for an
editor, puzzled with the variety of mistakes in the MSS. of a classical author, to solve the difficulty by
the hypothesis that the archetype, if a mediaeval MS., was in Merovingian script, or, if of much earlier date, was in early Roman cursive.</p></div2>
<div2 id="c6s4" type="paragraph" n="4">
<head>Inference of script of archetype</head>
<p>A word of caution must be added against overhasty inference about the script of an archetype from one or two
instances of the confusion of letters in a MS. What seems at first sight the confusion of one letter with another may
often really be the confusion of one word with another, e.g.
<foreign lang="la">militia</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">malitia</foreign> (see the preceding chapter). And in
many cases some accidental peculiarity in the archetype, quite unconnected with the general character of its script,
may give rise to the confusion. Thus in the Laurentian MS. of Nonius (181 M. 20), a MS. written in ninth- or early tenth-century
Caroline minuscules, the word <foreign lang="la">socordia</foreign> was first written
<foreign lang="la">cocordia,</foreign> then the letter <mentioned>c</mentioned> at the beginning of the word was
corrected to <mentioned>s.</mentioned> The correction has been made in such a way that the corrected letter looks as much like <mentioned>g</mentioned> as anything
else; and in the Harleian MS., which is a direct copy of the Laurentian, the word is copied <foreign lang="la">gocordia.</foreign> How mistaken in
this case would be the inference that since <foreign lang="la">socordia</foreign> has been written <foreign lang="la">gocordia</foreign> in the Harleian MS., it must have been
copied from an original in which <mentioned>s</mentioned> had habitually or frequently the form of <mentioned>c</mentioned>! We must be careful, too, to distinguish
miswritings which are due to Late Latin pronunciation, e.g. <mentioned>sci</mentioned> and <mentioned>si</mentioned> (see <ref target="c5s9" targOrder="U">p. 68</ref> above),
from those which arise from the similarity of one letter to another. The want of this
distinction is a fault in Hagen's <title lang="la">Gradus ad Criticen.</title>

<head>Confusion of Contractions</head>
<div2 id="c7s1" type="paragraph" n="1">
<head>Few contractions in capital and uncial MSS</head>
<p>In the capital and uncial MSS. preserved to us a very sparing use is made of contractions. In the Ambrosian
Palimpsest, for example, we find only <mentioned>B.</mentioned> for
<mentioned>-bus,</mentioned> e.g. <foreign lang="la">OMNIB. &ldquo;omnibus,&rdquo;</foreign> <mentioned>Q.</mentioned> for <mentioned>que,</mentioned>
e.g. <bibl n="Pl. Ps. 2.2">Pseud. 613</bibl> <foreign lang="la">ATQ.AMANT &ldquo;atque amant&rdquo;</foreign> (<foreign lang="la">atqamant</foreign> of <title>B</title>
curiously reproduces this), <bibl n="Pl. Per. 2.2">Pers. 194</bibl> <foreign lang="la">Q.ANTVR
&ldquo;queantur&rdquo;</foreign>; while a wavy line over the letter <mentioned>u</mentioned> indicates
an <mentioned>m,</mentioned><note anchored="yes">This line (over any vowel) for <mentioned>m</mentioned> is in early MSS. properly written
with an up-turned hook at one end and a down-turned hook at the other, while the line indicating the contraction of a word is a straight line.
But this distinction came to be dropped. The extension of one or other (or both) of these signs to indicate an <mentioned>n</mentioned> varied in usage at different
times. Often the contraction for <mentioned>n</mentioned> is limited to the end of a line, while
the contraction for <mentioned>m</mentioned> is used freely at any part of the line. But there
was always a possibility of a minuscule scribe being left uncertain whether to interpret a horizontal stroke over a vowel in a majuscule original
as an <mentioned>m</mentioned> or as an <mentioned>n.</mentioned></note> over the letter <mentioned>n</mentioned> indicates the word <foreign lang="la">non.</foreign>
It was scribes accustomed to these contractions who made mistakes like <bibl n="Lucr. 5.1071">Lucr. v. 1071</bibl> <foreign lang="la">desertibus aubantur</foreign>
for <foreign lang="la">deserti baubantur;</foreign> <bibl n="Verg. A. 11.572">Virg. <title>A.</title> xi. 572</bibl> <foreign lang="la">nutribus at</foreign> for
<foreign lang="la">nutribat</foreign>; <bibl n="Pl. Ps. 1.3">Pseud. 328</bibl> <foreign lang="la">queam</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">quam.</foreign></p>
<p>On inscriptions we find a large number of terms in common use expressed by contractions, sometimes by
the initial letter only, e.g. <foreign lang="la">S.C.</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">senatus consultum,
R.P.</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">res publica,</foreign> sometimes by the initial letters
<pb n="91"/>of syllables, e.g. <foreign lang="la">PF</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">praefectus,</foreign> sometimes with
the addition of the final letter, e.g. <foreign lang="la">SCDS</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">secundus,
DS</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">deus.</foreign><note anchored="yes">A collection of these contractions, or, to use the Latin term, <foreign lang="la">notae,</foreign>
<quote lang="la">quae in monumentis pluribus et in historiarum libris sacrisque
publicis reperiuntur</quote>, was made by the grammarian Valerius Probus
in the time of Nero. The surviving extracts from this work have been
published by Mommsen in vol. iv of the <title lang="la">Grammatici Latini,</title> ed. Keil.
Gitlbauer tries to explain some corruptions in MSS. of Livy by supposing
them to be due to the use of these <foreign lang="la">notae</foreign> in ancient texts.</note> A great many of these appear, sometimes
with majuscule, sometimes with minuscule characters, even in mediaeval MSS., and have occasionally been
misunderstood by copyists, as well as by modern editors.
Thus <foreign lang="la">s(enatus) c(onsultum)</foreign> in <bibl n="Cic. Att. 3.15.5">Cicero Att. iii. 15. 5</bibl> has
become <foreign lang="la">sic,</foreign> in Cicero <bibl n="Cic. Phil. 10.6">Phil. x. 6. 13</bibl> <foreign lang="la">se; c(larissimo) vi(ro)</foreign>
in Cicero <bibl n="Cic. Phil. 9.1.3">Phil. ix. 1. 3</bibl> has become <foreign lang="la">cui; M. Varro</foreign> in
Gellius ii. 25. 9 has become <foreign lang="la">Mauro; nam Ael(ius) Lam(ia)</foreign>
in Velleius ii. 116 has become <foreign lang="la">nam etiam; h(ora) i</foreign>
(i.e. <foreign lang="la">prima</foreign>) <foreign lang="la">s(emis)</foreign> in <bibl n="Cic. Att. 15.24">Cicero <title>Att.</title> xv. 24</bibl>
appears as <foreign lang="la">his;</foreign> and nothing is commoner than to find the conjunction
<foreign lang="la">que</foreign> for the name <foreign lang="la">Q(uintus).</foreign></p>
<p>Along with this system of contractions by means of single letters there was in ancient Rome a fully-developed
system of shorthand writing, the signs for which were known as the <foreign lang="la">Notae Tironis,</foreign> so called from Tiro, the
freedman of Cicero. Certain of these shorthand signs to express syllables were adopted for convenience of
writing by mediaeval scribes. Thus a curved stroke like an apostrophe indicated the syllable <mentioned>us,</mentioned> e.g.
<mentioned>t'</mentioned> &ldquo;<mentioned>tus</mentioned>&rdquo;<note anchored="yes">The same sign with <mentioned>p</mentioned> represented

other strokes represented the syllables <mentioned>er, ur, en, is</mentioned> etc.  If these shorthand strokes were accidentally omitted,
or made with a dry pen by the scribe of an original, or overlooked by the scribe of a copy, a corrupt reading was the result. Thus

<div2 id="c7s2" type="paragraph" n="2">
<head>Great number of contractions in sixth and seventh centuries</head>
<p>In the sixth and seventh centuries a host of
<pb n="92"/>contractions were in use in various scripts, and in many cases the same sign was capable of signifying
quite different words. Thus the letter <mentioned>s,</mentioned> with its
contracted use indicated by a horizontal stroke above or some other mark, stood for <foreign lang="la">si, sed, secundum, sunt,</foreign>
and on occasion also <foreign lang="la">sanctus, scriptum, supra, senatus,</foreign>
and so on; the letter <mentioned>n,</mentioned> with accompanying mark of
contraction, stood for <foreign lang="la">nam, non, nunc,</foreign> and also <foreign lang="la">nos, nobis,
noster, nomen</foreign> etc. So confusing a state of matters could not be allowed to last; and accordingly we find
the number gradually lessened by Carolingian and other scribes, and differentiating marks introduced to
distinguish, e.g., <foreign lang="la">sed</foreign> from <foreign lang="la">si, non</foreign> from <foreign lang="la">nunc.</foreign></p>
<p>But, as may be imagined, this change in the use of contractions was a fertile source of errors in MSS.
When a scribe accustomed to one set of contractions had to copy a MS. in which a different set of contractions
was used, he would inevitably make many mistakes; and even in transcribing contractions with
which he was familiar he might, if the same sign were used in more than one sense, expand it now and then
in a wrong way. We have many instances in our minuscule MSS. of Plautus. The identity of the signs
<mentioned>&emacr;</mentioned> for <mentioned>em</mentioned> and <mentioned>&emacr;</mentioned> for <foreign lang="la">est</foreign>
(also for <foreign lang="la">et</foreign>) has caused <foreign lang="la">quid est</foreign> in
<bibl n="Pl. Ps. 4.6">Pseud. 1066</bibl>, written <mentioned>quid&emacr;</mentioned> in the original of <title>CD,</title> to be
wrongly copied by the scribe of <title>C</title> as <foreign lang="la">quidem.</foreign> The
identity of the signs <mentioned>&nmacr;</mentioned> for <foreign lang="la">non</foreign> and <mentioned>&nmacr;</mentioned> for <foreign lang="la">nam</foreign> has led to
<foreign lang="la">nam</foreign> being substituted for <foreign lang="la">non</foreign> in <bibl n="Pl. Ps. 1.5">Pseud. 521</bibl>, <foreign lang="la">non</foreign> for
<foreign lang="la">nam</foreign> in <bibl n="Pl. Ps. 2.2">Pseud. 642</bibl>. Especially the contractions of the
relative pronouns and adverbs varied in use from time to time. We find <foreign lang="la">quoniam, quom (cum, qum)</foreign> and
<foreign lang="la">quando</foreign> confused over and over again in Plautus MSS.,
and similarly <foreign lang="la">qui, quid, quia</foreign> etc. etc.<note anchored="yes">These relative forms were confused even when not written in
contraction. (For examples in <title>A</title> see Studemund's Index.)</note></p>
<p>A contraction was often indicated by a suprascript
<pb n="93"/>letter. Thus <mentioned>m<hi rend="over">i</hi></mentioned> stood for <foreign lang="la">mihi</foreign>, <mentioned>m<hi rend="over">o</hi></mentioned>
for <foreign lang="la">modo</foreign>, <mentioned>p<hi rend="over">i</hi></mentioned> for the
syllable <foreign lang="la">pri</foreign>, <mentioned>p<hi rend="over">a</hi></mentioned> for the syllable <foreign lang="la">pra,</foreign> and so on. And
the <mentioned>u</mentioned> of the relative and other words was often suprascript
in a more or less conventional form (cf. <ref target="c2s7" targOrder="U">ch. ii. &sect; 7</ref>).</p></div2>

<head>Contractions give clues to history of text</head>
<p>A knowledge of the contractions used in Latin MSS. is of immense importance to every one who concerns himself
with the emendation of Latin texts. For a fuller account of them than can be given here the student may consult
Chassant <title lang="fr">Dictionnaire des Abr&eacute;viations,</title> or the larger and more
important work Walther <title lang="la">Lexicon Diplomaticum.</title> Neither of these books, however, provides us with a satisfactory
account of the limitations of particular contractions to particular centuries or particular scripts. When our
knowledge of these limitations is more complete, it will be possible to trace with more certainty the history of a text
than can be done at present. For the confusion of contractions is at least as important a clue to the date and
country of an archetype as the confusion of letters. A feature, for example, of Visigothic MSS. is their use of a
contraction for <foreign lang="la">per</foreign> (Thompson <title>Greek and Latin Palaeography</title>
p. 224), which in the minuscule of other countries would represent <foreign lang="la">pro.</foreign> Irish scribes, to whose labours both in
monasteries in Ireland and on the continent we owe the preservation of many texts of ancient authors, used a
peculiar set of contractions. One of these was <mentioned>h'</mentioned> for <foreign lang="la">autem,</foreign>
a sign resembling a sign used elsewhere for <foreign lang="la">hoc;</foreign> and it is
fairly safe evidence of an Irish or Anglo-Saxon original if
we find in a copy <foreign lang="la">hoc</foreign> substituted for <foreign lang="la">autem,</foreign> as in the Namur
MS. of Bede (see Plummer's edition, Introd. p. lxxxvii).  (In two British Museum fourteenth-century MSS. of Cicero
<title>Orator</title> we find <foreign lang="la">enim</foreign> substituted for <foreign lang="la">autem.</foreign> See Sandys <title>Introd.</title>)</p>
<p>The difficulty found by continental monks in reading and transcribing the numerous MSS. in Irish writing, or in that
variety of Irish writing known as Anglo-Saxon, is illustrated by a ninth-century MS. of St. Ambrose now at Florence
<pb n="94"/>(Laur. Ashb. 60 c. 55). This MS. is written in the Irish hand, but a subsequent hand has added over each peculiarly
Irish contraction its interpretation in the usual Caroline script; e.g. above <mentioned>h'</mentioned> is written <foreign lang="la">a&umacr;t</foreign>
or <foreign lang="la">a&umacr;</foreign> to represent <foreign lang="la">autem,</foreign>
and so on. (A photograph of a page of this MS. is given in the <title lang="it">Collezione Fiorentina</title> No. 40.)</p></div2>

<head>Signs for Numerals</head>
<p>The signs for Numerals<note anchored="yes">That is, the Roman numeral signs. The Arabic ciphers are unknown
in all except the later MSS.</note> have been productive
of many mistakes in MSS. Thus <foreign lang="la">DC</foreign> &ldquo;six hundred&rdquo;
<pb n="98"/>has been miscopied <foreign lang="la">de</foreign> in <bibl n="Liv. 27.18.11">Livy xxvii. 28. 11</bibl>, and <foreign lang="la">ad DC</foreign>
has occasionally become <foreign lang="la">ad haec; ad IIII</foreign> has become
<foreign lang="la">adivi</foreign> in Cicero <bibl n="Cic. Att. 15.11"><title>Att.</title> xv. 11</bibl>; <foreign lang="la">VII ante</foreign>
has become <foreign lang="la">uti ante</foreign> in Velleius ii. 10. 2. Conversely, <foreign lang="la">vi</foreign> has been misinterpreted
as <foreign lang="la">sex</foreign> in Cicero <bibl n="Cic. Fam. 15.4.9">Fam. xv. 4. 9</bibl>, and <foreign lang="la">ii</foreign> as <foreign lang="la">duo</foreign>
in Cicero <bibl n="Cic. Phil. 10.7">Phil. x. 7. 15.</bibl></p>
<p>For these and a number of other examples the student may consult Heraeus <title lang="la">Quaestiones de vett. codd. Livianis</title> p. 52.</p>
<p>A stroke was drawn above a numeral sign to indicate that
it was a numeral sign. Thus <foreign lang="la">vi</foreign> without this stroke will
mean &ldquo;by violence,&rdquo; but with it &ldquo;six.&rdquo; This stroke is often
mistaken for the stroke drawn above to indicate thousands,
so that in Cicero <bibl n="Cic. Leg. 2.23">Legg. ii. 23. 58</bibl> we find <foreign lang="la">in duodecim milia</foreign>
instead of <foreign lang="la">in duodecim</foreign> (sc. <foreign lang="la">tabulis</foreign>), and in <bibl n="Liv. 22.60.19">Livy xxii. 60. 19</bibl>
<foreign lang="la">sescentis</foreign> written in the original <foreign lang="la">DC</foreign> with a stroke above has
been wrongly expanded to <foreign lang="la">sescenta milia.</foreign></p>
<p>Bede complains of scribes' mistakes about numeral signs:  <quote lang="la">numeri . . negligenter describuntur et negligentius emendantur</quote>
(Opp. i. 149); and the author of the <title lang="la">Flores Temporum</title> (in Pertz xxiv. 231) appeals to the copyists of his work to
be careful in this respect: <quote lang="la">obsecro . . scriptores ut circa numeros annorum correcte scribendos adhibeant diligentiam
propter Deum; alioquin ego in quantum ad homines in vacuum laboravi, et ignaviae meae imputabitur error librarii
dormitantis.</quote> The custom of writing the last unit of a number with a taller I than the others, e.g. xxviI, may have
had something to do with the frequent omission of the last unit in MSS. Thus the sign for &ldquo;twenty-seven&rdquo; is often
miscopied as the sign for &ldquo;twenty-six.&rdquo; The Merovingian practice of writing <foreign lang="la">vi</foreign> &ldquo;six&rdquo; in ligature, so that it was capable
of being mistaken for <foreign lang="la">v,</foreign> may have led to the same mistake in
subsequent copies. But the addition of an extra unit is also a common error in MSS. The Laurentian MS. of Nonius has
miscopied the xviii of the Leyden MS. as xviiii (Non. 113 M. 7).</p>

<head>Appendix A:  The Archetype of the Palatine MSS. of Plautus</head>
<div2 id="cas1" type="paragraph" n="1">
<head>Page size can be determined from MS B:  33 lines per page</head>
<p>If the account given on p. 7 of the mutual relationship of the Palatine or minuscule MSS. is correct, we may expect
to find in the last twelve plays in the Codex Vetus (<title>B</title>) the best evidence about the form and writing of the immediate
archetype of all the minuscule MSS. For this part of <title>B</title> seems to have been copied directly from that archetype,
while all other MSS. and the first eight plays in <title>B</title> are copied from copies of the archetype, not from the archetype itself.</p>
<p>The size of the page in this archetype is indicated by a curious piece of conscientious copying on the part of the
German monk, who was charged with the writing of a part
of the <title>Poenulus</title> in <title>B.</title> In his anxiety not to omit a single
word of his task he has copied in the margin the very headings of the pages at the place where they stood in his
original. In the margin at <bibl n="Pl. Poen. 5.4">vv. 1222-3</bibl> he writes <foreign lang="la">plauti,</foreign> at
<bibl n="Pl. Poen. 5.4">vv. 1255-6</bibl> <foreign lang="la">paenulus,</foreign>
at <bibl n="Pl. Poen. 5.5">vv. 1288-9</bibl> <foreign lang="la">plauti,</foreign> and again at <bibl n="Pl. Poen. 5.6">vv.
1354-5</bibl> <foreign lang="la">plauti,</foreign> at <bibl n="Pl. Poen. 5.7">v. 1385</bibl> <foreign lang="la">penulus.</foreign> We can see that his
original had at the top of each left-hand page <foreign lang="la">Plauti</foreign> and at
the top of each right-hand page <foreign lang="la">Poenulus (Pen-, Paen-),</foreign> and
that each page had some 33 lines of Plautus. The transposition
in <title>B</title> of <bibl n="Pl. Poen. 1.2">vv. 285-352</bibl> and of <bibl n="Pl. Poen. 3.1">vv. 547-608</bibl> of this
play, which follow respectively <bibl n="Pl. Poen. 1.2">v. 217</bibl> and <bibl n="Pl. Poen. 2.1">v. 479</bibl>, is, as has
been pointed out on <ref target="c2s6" targOrder="U">p. 35</ref>, due to the transposition of the second and third sheets of a quaternion of the archetype.
The second leaf of the quaternion contained vv. 218-284, the third vv. 285-352, the fourth and fifth vv. 353-479, the
<pb n="102"/>sixth vv. 480-546, the seventh vv. 547-608. A similar size of page may be indicated for one of the first eight
plays, the <title>Asinaria,</title> by the transposition of <bibl n="Pl. As. 1.1">v. 51</bibl> to after
<bibl n="Pl. As. 1.1">v. 83</bibl>, if the true account of the transposition be that the
first line of the page, having been accidentally omitted, was
afterwards added in the bottom margin.<note anchored="yes">Notice that v. 40 came in the archetype between v. 55 and v. 56,
so that this page would have 33 lines of the play.</note></p></div2>
<div2 id="cas2" type="paragraph" n="2">
<head>Several copyists</head>
<p>That the archetype was the work of more than one copyist<note anchored="yes">To determine where one copyist of an archetype ended and where
another began, is seldom possible. Where it is possible, it is certainly worth doing; so great a difference of quality often exists between the
work of one copyist and the work of another. The <title>B</title>-copyists of
Most., Men. 1-381, of Men. 381-fin., Mil., Merc. 1-1013 are as bad as the copyists of the following plays are good. Their mistakes have
fortunately been effaced by a corrector up to the middle of the <title>Miles.</title>
But for the uncorrected portion, including the last half of the <title>Miles</title>
and nearly the whole of the <title>Mercator,</title> the testimony of <title>B</title> is of very
small repute--a fact not always realised by editors of Plautus. The
deplorable state of the <title>Truculentus</title>-text in the archetype may be partly
due to similar causes, either to the intervention of a new copyist, or the
absence of a corrector, or both.</note> may be proved, if proof be necessary, by the fact
that the scribe of <title>B</title> leaves a blank space of four lines after
<bibl n="Pl. Mer. 5.3">Merc. 961</bibl>, this line in the archetype being presumably the
last line of the task of one of the copyists, who failed to cover completely the whole quaternion. The writing of two
verses in the same line throughout a previous passage of the
play (<bibl n="Pl. Mer. 2.1">vv. 236-249</bibl>) points to a scribe, either of the archetype
itself or of its original, having been pressed for space at the end of his task. The numerous contractions of final syllables
in the <title>Miles</title> and <title>Truculentus</title>--contractions which have caused
great difficulty to the scribes of <title>B, C,</title> and <title>D</title> (e.g. <bibl n="Pl. Truc. 2.3">Truc. 349</bibl>
<foreign lang="la">confutaverim</foreign> edd., <foreign lang="la">confutaverunt</foreign> <title>B</title>,
<foreign lang="la">confutaver</foreign> <title>CD</title> with line above <mentioned>r</mentioned>;
<bibl n="Pl. Mil. 2.6">Mil. 543</bibl> <foreign lang="la">demum</foreign> <title>A</title>, <foreign lang="la">dem</foreign> <title>C D1</title>,
<foreign lang="la">idem</foreign> <title>B1</title>)--are probably the result of copyists having had to force an inconveniently
large number of lines into the vellum allotted to them.</p></div2>
<div2 id="cas3" type="paragraph" n="3">
<head>Where pages began</head>
<p>We may infer from the presence of marginal additions or corrections (see above, p. 35) that various pages of the
archetype (or its original) began at <bibl n="Pl. Mos. 2.1">Most. 412</bibl>, <bibl n="Pl. Mil. 4.6">Mil. 1273</bibl> (or
<pb n="103"/>1274), <bibl n="Pl. Men. 3.2">Men. 475</bibl>, 1029,<note anchored="yes">Between <bibl n="Pl. Men. 3.2">Men. 475</bibl> and 1029 come 554 verses and 11 scene-headings,
making about 17 pages of 33 lines to each.</note> <bibl n="Pl. Bac. 1.1">Bacch. 65</bibl> (the second page of this
play in the archetype, if the play began at the head of a

(? <bibl n="Pl. Poen. 5.7">1382</bibl>), <bibl n="Pl. Trin. 3.2">Trin. 706</bibl>; and either of the archetype or its
copy at <bibl n="Pl. Am. 1.1">Amph. 161</bibl>, <bibl n="Pl. Capt. 1.2">Capt. 126</bibl>. Apparently <bibl n="Pl. Ps. 4.7">Pseud. 1162</bibl>-1204
(42 verses, for <bibl n="Pl. Ps. 4.7">vv. 1189-90</bibl> make only one verse)

<div2 id="cas4" type="paragraph" n="4">
<head>Archetype written in early Caroline minuscules</head>
<p>If we look at the letters commonly confused in what were probably the three direct copies of the archetype: (1) <title>B</title>
(last twelve plays); (2) the original of <title>CD</title> (last twelve plays); (3) the original of <title>BD</title> (first eight plays), we find some reason
to believe that this archetype was written in early Caroline minuscule. Such a type of writing is indicated by confusions like:</p>
<p><mentioned>u</mentioned> and <mentioned>a</mentioned>: <bibl n="Pl. Poen. 4.2">Poen. 876</bibl> <foreign lang="la">mutae</foreign> edd.,

<p>Suprascript <mentioned>a,</mentioned> a feature of early minuscule, may be the

(<title>AB</title>) in <bibl n="Pl. Mil. 1.1">Mil. 71</bibl>.
Another feature of early minuscule, the ligature <mentioned>ex,</mentioned> has been
over and over again mistaken by the copyists of the archetype
for <foreign lang="la">et,</foreign> e.g. <bibl n="Pl. Aul. 4.10">Aul. 766</bibl>, <bibl n="Pl. Capt. 5.1">Capt. 924</bibl>. The ligature for <mentioned>-nt</mentioned>

<head>Other physical features of the archetype</head>
<p>Other features of the writing of the archetype may have been these:--</p>
<p>Marginal glosses were possibly indicated in the archetype (or the proto-archetype?) by a line above the glossed
word, a line which has been mistaken for the sign of a
contraction in <bibl n="Pl. Ps. 2.2">Pseud. 659</bibl>, where <foreign lang="la">diobolia re-</foreign> is written for <foreign lang="la">doliarem.</foreign></p>
<p>The presence of Greek characters is shown clearly, <foreign lang="la">e.g.,</foreign> in
<bibl n="Pl. Ps. 2.4">Pseud. 712</bibl> <foreign lang="greek">poiw=</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">po</foreign>l<foreign lang="greek">w</foreign> <title>B</title>,
noL<foreign lang="greek">w</foreign> <title>CD</title>); but <foreign lang="greek">nai\ ga/r</foreign> of <bibl n="Pl. Bac. 5.2">Bacch.
1162</bibl> must have been written <foreign lang="la">necar,</foreign> as it is in <title>BCD</title>,  for <title>B</title>
has a marginal conjecture <foreign lang="la">ne carpe.</foreign> In <bibl n="Pl. Ps. 484">Pseud. 484</bibl> <foreign lang="greek">kai\
tou=to</foreign> was written first in Latin, then in Greek form (see above, <ref target="c4s6" targOrder="U">p. 61</ref>).</p>
<p>The &ldquo;daseia&rdquo; (<ref target="c2s7" targOrder="U">p. 36</ref>), often found in our existing MSS. of Plautus, was probably a feature of the archetype too. How
often the omission of an initial <mentioned>h</mentioned> in our MSS. is due to the
<pb n="107"/>Late Latin spelling or to a neglect of this &ldquo;daseia&rdquo; in the original, is impossible to determine.</p>
<p>The two opening words of the <title>Menaechmi</title> were in uncials in the archetype, as they are in <title>B</title>, for they have a line to
themselves in <title>C</title>; and the same practice may have extended to other beginnings of plays or scenes.</p>
<p>On the use of capitals at the beginning of lines cf. <ref target="c7s6" targOrder="U">p. 99</ref>
(on the corruption <mentioned>D</mentioned> for <foreign lang="la">Pro</foreign> in <bibl n="Pl. Mil. 3.2">Mil. 824</bibl>), <ref target="c6s1" targOrder="U">pp. 85, 86.</ref></p>
<p>The &ldquo;apex&rdquo; over a long monosyllable has led to a corruption
in <bibl n="Pl. Am. 2.1">Amph. 632</bibl> (<foreign lang="la">ret</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">re</foreign>), and I think in <bibl n="Pl. Poen. 3.4">Poen. 737</bibl>,
where the archetype seems to have had <foreign lang="la">furti s&eacute;</foreign> (<foreign lang="la">furtis est</foreign> <title>B1</title>,
<foreign lang="la">furtis es</foreign> <title>B2</title>, <foreign lang="la">furtis es</foreign> <title>C1</title>,
<foreign lang="la">furtis e</foreign> <title>C2 D2</title>, <foreign lang="la">furtis &emacr;</foreign> <title>D1</title>). In  <bibl n="Pl. Poen. 1.1">Poen. 159</bibl>
<foreign lang="la">m&eacute; dato</foreign> of the archetype has become <foreign lang="la">mendato.</foreign></p>
<p>Of the absence of proper separation of words and of the attachment of prepositions and other small words to
neighbouring words, examples have been given on <ref target="cis2" targOrder="U">pp. 3</ref>, <ref target="c1s5" targOrder="U">16.</ref></p></div2>

<p>It is more important to determine another feature of the archetype, namely its retention of archaic words and forms.
We may safely infer on <foreign lang="la">a priori</foreign> grounds that a great number of archaisms existed in the archetype which have been
modernised in all the copies, without leaving a trace of the older form, and that in the archetype itself a number of
archaisms had disappeared which existed in its own original.<note anchored="yes">The change of <foreign lang="la">isti</foreign> to
<foreign lang="la">istic</foreign> in <bibl n="Pl. Mos. 3.2">Most. 721a</bibl> seems to have been made
in the original of the minuscule archetype; for the words <foreign lang="la">jam istic ero</foreign> were not rightly divided in that archetype.</note>
It is as a rule at the beginning of his task that a copyist most faithfully reproduces what is before him; and when we
find in the <title>Bacchides</title> in <title>B</title> such archaic forms as <cit><quote lang="la">istoc</quote> <bibl n="Pl. Bac. 1.1">43</bibl></cit>,
<cit><quote lang="la">vostrast</quote> <bibl n="Pl. Bac. 1.1">50</bibl></cit>, <cit><quote lang="la">opticuisti</quote> <bibl n="Pl. Bac. 1.1">62</bibl></cit>,
<cit><quote lang="la">ecferri</quote> <bibl n="Pl. Bac. 1.1">95</bibl></cit>, <cit><quote lang="la">quoi</quote> <bibl n="Pl. Bac. 1.2">126</bibl></cit>,
<cit><quote lang="la">vacivom</quote> <bibl n="Pl. Bac. 1.2">154</bibl></cit>, <cit><quote lang="la">fuam</quote> <bibl n="Pl. Bac. 1.2">156</bibl></cit>,

<cit><quote lang="la">disrumpit</quote> <bibl n="Pl. Bac. 3.3">441</bibl></cit>, <cit><quote lang="la">credaas</quote> <bibl n="Pl. Bac. 3.3">476</bibl></cit>,
<cit><quote lang="la">ipsus</quote> <bibl n="Pl. Bac. 3.3">478</bibl></cit>, <cit><quote lang="la">equm</quote> <bibl n="Pl. Bac. 3.3">488</bibl></cit>,

<cit><quote lang="la">possiem</quote> <bibl n="Pl. Bac. 4.5">762</bibl></cit>, <cit><quote lang="la">hasce</quote> <bibl n="Pl. Bac. 4.6">787</bibl></cit>,
<cit><quote lang="la">pacisce</quote> <bibl n="Pl. Bac. 4.8">871</bibl></cit>,
<cit><quote lang="la">ecfertur</quote> <bibl n="Pl. Bac. 4.9">1058</bibl></cit>, we may conclude that we get in this opening
play of the direct copy of the archetype a glimpse at the forms actually found in that archetype in other plays as
well as the <foreign lang="la">Bacchides.</foreign> For every one instance of an archaism
<pb n="108"/>preserved by a lucky chance in the copies, e.g. <cit><bibl n="Pl. Men. 5.5">Men. 942</bibl> <quote lang="la">ted
esse</quote></cit> (<foreign lang="la">te deesse</foreign> <title>B1</title>) (cf. <bibl n="Pl. As. 2.2">Asin. 299</bibl>), we may be sure that there
was a score of instances in the original. Sometimes the modernising process would be facilitated by the fact that the
word in the archetype had a gloss written above it or in the margin, as in <bibl n="Pl. Capt. 2.3">Capt. 380</bibl> <foreign lang="la">rebitas</foreign>
(&lsqb;<foreign lang="la">ve</foreign>&rsqb;<foreign lang="la">l redeas</foreign> <title>B</title>).</p>
<p>But usually the archaic form would be changed by the copyist himself without any guidance from his original.
Corruptions like <foreign lang="la">perditum sit</foreign> (<title>BD</title>; <foreign lang="la">perditum fit</foreign> <title>C</title>) for <foreign lang="la">perditum
se it</foreign>, <bibl n="Pl. Truc. 2.7">Truc. 559</bibl>, show us that the copyists were in the
habit of writing <mentioned>i</mentioned> for an <mentioned>ei</mentioned> of the original, and that in
addition to the cases where a trace of the older spelling has
been preserved (e.g. <bibl n="Pl. Mil. 4.2">Mil. 1085</bibl> <foreign lang="la">abeis</foreign> <title>B</title>,
<foreign lang="la">abis</foreign> <title>CD</title>), there must have been a large number of cases where all trace has disappeared.
The change of the future to the present of <foreign lang="la">dico</foreign>
in <bibl n="Pl. Ps. 5.2">Pseud. 1323</bibl> (<foreign lang="la">deices</foreign> <title>B</title>, <foreign lang="la">dicis</foreign> <title>CD</title>)
suggests the same of the archaic spelling <mentioned>e</mentioned> for <mentioned>i</mentioned> (cf. <bibl n="Pl. Mil. 4.4">Mil. 1141</bibl>,
<bibl n="Pl. Mil. 4.4">1161</bibl> <foreign lang="la">facite</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">facete</foreign>;
<bibl n="Pl. Mil. 4.5">Mil. 1206</bibl> <foreign lang="la">sinite</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">sine te</foreign>). The consideration of lines like
<list type="simple">
<item><bibl n="Pl. Men. 2.2">Men. 317</bibl> (<foreign lang="la">illoc</foreign> <title>B</title>, <foreign lang="la">illo</foreign> <title>CD</title>),</item>
<item><bibl n="Pl. Mer. 3.3">Merc. 570</bibl> (<foreign lang="la">illuc</foreign> <title>B</title>, <foreign lang="la">illo</foreign> <title>CD</title>),</item>
<item><bibl n="Pl. Mer. 1.2">Merc. 128</bibl> (<foreign lang="la">illuc</foreign> <title>C</title>, <foreign lang="la">illud</foreign> <title>BD</title>),</item>
<item><bibl n="Pl. Mil. 4.5">Mil. 1210</bibl> (<foreign lang="la">istuc</foreign> <title>B</title>, <foreign lang="la">istud</foreign> <title>CD</title>),</item>
</list>
shows us how wrong it is to infer from the agreement of our
MSS. that the archetype had, e.g., <foreign lang="la">illo</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">illoc</foreign> in <bibl n="Pl. Poen. 5.2">Poen. 1061</bibl>,
<foreign lang="la">illic</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">illi</foreign> in <bibl n="Pl. Ps. 2.4">Pseud. 758</bibl>, <foreign lang="la">istic</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">isti</foreign> in <bibl n="Pl. Per. 3.3">Pers. 405</bibl>, etc. etc. On the contrary, when we compare the number of archaic
forms preserved in <title>B</title> with the scantier number preserved in
<title>CD,</title> we are forced to conclude that the number of archaisms
in the archetype must have considerably exceeded the number preserved or indicated by the copies.</p>
<p>In how many instances <mentioned>b</mentioned> and <mentioned>v, d</mentioned> and <mentioned>t</mentioned> were interchanged
by the copyists we can only guess from relics of the archetype's
spelling like <foreign lang="la">curavit</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">curabit</foreign> <bibl n="Pl. Am. 1.2">Amph. 487</bibl>, <foreign lang="la">ludificavit</foreign>
for <foreign lang="la">ludificabit</foreign> <bibl n="Pl. Am. 4.3">Amph. 1041</bibl>, <foreign lang="la">quidve</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">qui tuae</foreign>
<bibl n="Pl. Truc. 2.4">Truc. 355</bibl>, where the scribes' misapprehension has saved them from change.</p>
<p>That <mentioned>xs</mentioned> of the archetype was tacitly changed to <mentioned>x</mentioned> we see
from <bibl n="Pl. Truc. 2.6">Truc. 530</bibl> <foreign lang="la">exuri</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">ex Suria.</foreign>
For <foreign lang="la">coenam faciam</foreign> (<bibl n="Pl. Mer. 3.3">Merc. 578</bibl>) the archetype had <foreign lang="la">oenum factam</foreign>;
and this <mentioned>oe</mentioned> was corrected by the copyists to <mentioned>u</mentioned> (<foreign lang="la">unum factam</foreign> <title>C,</title>
<foreign lang="la">unum factum</foreign> <title>B</title>, <foreign lang="la">unam factam</foreign> <title>D</title>), a correction doubtless made in many other
<pb n="109"/>lines where all means of detecting the older spelling are lost (cf. <bibl n="Pl. Truc. 1.2">Truc. 103</bibl> <foreign lang="la">oenus</foreign> <title>B</title>,
<foreign lang="la">unus</foreign> <title>CD</title>; and with <mentioned>o</mentioned> for <mentioned>oe</mentioned> <bibl n="Pl. Truc. 2.2">Truc. 310</bibl>

<head>Appendix C:   How to Collate a Latin MS</head>
<div2 id="ccs1" type="paragraph" n="1">
<head>What collation is</head>
<p>By &ldquo;collating&rdquo; a MS. we mean comparing it with the
received text of an author and taking note of the points in
which it differs from that received text. The first thing we
must do then when we take a MS. to collate is to get a copy
of that critical edition of the author which is provided with
the best and fullest critical apparatus. Suppose, for example,
we have a MS. of Martial to collate: we must use Schneidewin's
critical edition of Martial to compare it with; for
a MS. of Terence we must use Umpfenbach; and so on,
always taking care to state at the outset of our collation with
what edition (giving the name, place, and date of the book)
we are collating our MS. We set ourselves then to compare
line by line, word by word, letter by letter the MS. before
us with the printed edition of the author. Wherever we
come upon something in the MS. different from what is in
the printed edition, we write down side by side in parallel
columns the reading of the printed edition and the reading
of the MS. We shall find it most convenient to put the
readings of the printed edition in the first or left-hand
column on our page, and the readings of the MS. in the
second column, the column to the right of it; for by so
doing we shall be able to collate other MSS. of the same
author on the same paper by merely putting additional
columns to the right; and so we shall come to have on the
same pages a conspectus of the readings of a number of MSS.
of the same author side by side. For the same reason it is
<pb n="120"/>best to use the broad side of the page for writing on, so as to
have room for as many additional columns, and so for the
collation of as many additional MSS., as possible.</p>
<p>We shall have then in the first or left-hand column the
readings of the received text from which any of the collated
MSS. diverge, and in the columns to the right the divergent
readings of the various MSS. And of course we shall have
to give the reference to these words or lines that we take
note of as being different in the received text and in the
MSS. we have collated, so as to be able to find them when
we wish to consult them in the printed edition or in any of
the MSS. The reference to the reading of the printed book
will be given in the ordinary way, e.g. Martial bk. xiv,
epigr. i, v. 1 (<bibl n="Mart. 14.1.1">Mart. xiv. 1. 1</bibl>); but we cannot give a reference of
this kind to the reading in the MSS., because the epigrams and
lines there are not numbered as they are in our modern printed
editions. We give the whereabouts of a word or sentence
in a MS. in a different way, viz. by giving the number of
the page on which it is found. Or rather to be strictly
accurate I should substitute the word leaf, or its Latin
equivalent <foreign lang="la">folium</foreign>, for page; for in a MS. we do not
number the pages but the leaves, and what would be in a
printed book pages 1 and 2 will be in a MS. leaf one, or
<foreign lang="la">folium primum</foreign>. Page 1 is the obverse side of leaf one,
and is technically known as <foreign lang="la">folium primum rectum.</foreign>
Page 2, the reverse side, is technically known as <foreign lang="la">folium
primum versum</foreign>; page 3 in the same way will be <foreign lang="la">folium
secundum rectum</foreign>, page 4, <foreign lang="la">folium secundum versum</foreign>;
and for shortness' sake we shall write them &ldquo;fol. 1 r,&rdquo; &ldquo;fol.
1 v,&rdquo; &ldquo;fol. 2 r,&rdquo; &ldquo;fol. 2 v,&rdquo; and so on. A word then which
occurs on the third page of a MS. will be referred to
&ldquo;fol. 2 r.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But further, the page or side of a leaf in a MS is very
often written in two columns; so we shall want to state in
our reference in which column the word occurs, and we
shall have to add to our &ldquo;fol. 2 r&rdquo; something to show
whether it is in the first or the second column of &ldquo;fol. 2 r.&rdquo;
The neatest notation for the columns is by the Greek letters
<foreign lang="greek">a</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">b</foreign>. If our reading then be in the first column on
<pb n="121"/>the page we shall give the reference to it in the form
&ldquo;fol. 2 r <foreign lang="greek">a</foreign>,&rdquo; and we shall put this reference on the right
of the column in which the readings of the MS. are given,
and the reference to the reading in the printed edition on
the left of the left-hand column, so as to allow the two
contrasted readings to come as close as possible, that the eye
may note their divergence at a glance.</p>
<p>This that I have described is the full style of collating
a MS. Of course in most cases a much less troublesome
plan will serve, viz. to jot down on the margin of our
printed edition the readings of the MS. we are collating.
But if we do this, unless the margin is a very wide one,
it will be difficult to use the same book for the collation
of more than one MS.; and it will be difficult to keep the
readings of one MS. distinct from those of another, unless
we write the readings of one MS. in black ink, of
another in red ink, of another in purple ink, and so on;
so that it may really involve as much trouble in the long
run as the more detailed method of collation. Besides one
has not room on the margin of a printed book to write
remarks about the readings in the MS., such as whether
they are written by the writer of the MS., or by some one
who revised it afterwards, or by some one into whose hands
it came at a much later time; and this is a thing of the
utmost importance, and indeed is what makes the chief
difficulty in collating a MS. accurately.</p></div2>
<div2 id="ccs2" type="paragraph" n="2">
<head>Dealing with corrections in the MS</head>
<p>Our first object in collating a MS. is to take note of what
was actually written by the writer of the MS. But in
almost every MS. we look at we find this has been made
more or less difficult by the fact that there are readings
given in the margin or written above the words in the text
in different ink &mdash; I mean less faded &mdash; and in different handwriting
from that of the text. These have been added by
various owners of the MS. at various periods who found
lines here and there unintelligible or ungrammatical, and
corrected them according to their own fancy or according
to the text of some other MS. of the author that they managed
to get a sight of, just as people nowadays have a habit of
correcting errors of printing in any book they happen to be
<pb n="122"/>reading. Now such variants as are mere conjectural emendations
of Renaissance owners have as a rule little interest for
us. We might omit to notice them altogether; but it will be
safer, if we wish to make a complete collation, to give them
within brackets and with a note of their being due to some
one much later in date than the writer of the MS. If the
reading is in the margin, we shall put this note in the
form <foreign lang="la">rec. in marg.,</foreign> that is &ldquo;recent or by a later hand in
the margin&rdquo;; if it is written above the word in the text, we
shall write <foreign lang="la">rec. sup. scr.;</foreign> if, as is the commonest case, it is
written on the word in the text, if the word in the text has
been by a line here and a curve there corrected or transformed
into the new reading, so as to make it often difficult
to find out what the original reading was, we shall say <foreign lang="la">corr.
rec.,</foreign> that is &ldquo;corrected by a recent hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such corrections of a manifestly much later date than
the MS. itself have little interest for us, unless they let us
know the readings of another MS. which the owner of our
MS. had, but which has now been lost. But we very often
find corrections which are patently not so recent but of the
same date, or nearly of the same date, as the MS.; and
these are of great importance, for they must have been made
by the copyist of the MS. himself or by some one who
revised and corrected the MS. immediately or very soon
after it was copied. When we are quite sure the correction
has been made by the copyist himself, in other words, when
it is merely a correction of a slip of the pen, it is unnecessary
to notice the original reading, unless we are making an
extremely accurate collation; for our real aim is to find
out what was in the MS. which the scribe copied; and it
is usually needless to make record of the fact that our scribe
in a moment of forgetfulness wrote <mentioned lang="la">&ldquo;at&rdquo;</mentioned> instead of <mentioned lang="la">&ldquo;et,&rdquo;</mentioned> if
the next moment he saw his error and amended it by
correcting the <mentioned>&ldquo;a&rdquo;</mentioned> into an <mentioned>&ldquo;e.&rdquo;</mentioned> But where the correction
is or may possibly be by a different person, of the same or
not a manifestly much later date than the date of the MS.,
we must notice it; for it has probably been made by some
one who compared the copy which the scribe had made with
the original, and corrected it here and there where the
<pb n="123"/>scribe had departed from the original (cf. <ref target="c3s4" targOrder="U">p. 41</ref>). Whenever
there is a possibility of a correction being of this kind we
shall record it with the word <foreign lang="la">corr.</foreign> before it; and after we
have collated the whole MS. we shall generally find ourselves
able to tell what value these corrections as a whole have,
and how they came to be there.</p>
<p>There is one kind of correction that we cannot date, and
that is an erasure. We can tell by the look of the ink in an
ordinary correction whether the writing is old or recent, but
we cannot tell by the look of scraped vellum whether the
erasure was made on the one hand by the copyist or a contemporary,
or on the other by a later owner of the MS.
And still worse, we can with a little patience disengage the
original reading where a word has been rewritten, but we can
only rarely and with a great straining of our eyes read a
word that has been erased, especially if a new word has been
written in the space occupied by the erased one. An erasure
then is a thing that must always be taken note of, and in
collating a MS. our eyes must explore the vellum surface as well
as the writing; for a scrape on the vellum means that there
once was writing there. If we are fortunate enough to find
out by the help of a magnifying glass what the erased letter
or word was, we shall put it down as the reading of the MS.,
and add the emended form of the word after the note <foreign lang="la">corr,
ras.</foreign> (i.e. <foreign lang="la">rasur&amacr;</foreign>); if we cannot, we must take note of the fact
that there is a trace of a lost letter or word, and we must
indicate the position of this erasure by stating what written
word or letter it comes before or after. Thus if <foreign lang="la">demo</foreign> were
corrected by the erasure of <foreign lang="la">m</foreign> into <foreign lang="la">deo,</foreign> and if the <foreign lang="la">m</foreign> could
not be read, we must indicate the fact that only one letter
has been erased, and that before the letter <foreign lang="la">o,</foreign> by putting one
asterisk to represent the erased letter, thus <foreign lang="la">de*o.</foreign> Lastly, if
a word or letter has been erased and the space has not been
left vacant, but a new word or letter has been written on it,
we shall give as the reading of the MS. this new word or
letter, adding <foreign lang="la">in ras.,</foreign> i.e. &ldquo;standing upon or written over an
erasure&rdquo;; and if the new word or letter is plainly by a later
hand, we shall say <foreign lang="la">rec. in ras.</foreign></p>
<p>Where we are able to refer the various readings or corrections
<pb n="124"/>to distinct hands we should specify this by putting
<foreign lang="la">manus prima</foreign> (shorter <foreign lang="la">m.</foreign><hi rend="sup">1</hi>) for the work of the scribe himself,
<foreign lang="la">manus secunda</foreign> (<foreign lang="la">m.</foreign><hi rend="sup">2</hi>), <foreign lang="la">manus tertia</foreign> (<foreign lang="la">m.</foreign><hi rend="sup">3</hi>), and so on for the
several correctors; but it is not always possible, nor indeed
always necessary, to make these distinctions.</p></div2>
<div2 id="ccs3" type="paragraph" n="3">
<head>Which differences are significant</head>
<p>What sort then of divergences from the received text
should be noticed? Are we in a Latin MS., e.g., to notice
such a thing as <foreign lang="la">quamquam</foreign> instead of <foreign lang="la">quanquam</foreign>,
<foreign lang="la">coena</foreign> instead of <foreign lang="la">cena</foreign>, etc.? In most cases, unless the
MS. is of such an age that its spellings have some authority,
and unless our collation is to be an extremely minute one,
there is no need for burdening ourselves with a mass of useless
details like that. Only we must state at the outset of our
collation exactly what divergences of reading we do not profess
to take note of. In most Latin MSS., for example, we need not
record such divergences as <mentioned>h</mentioned> omitted or inserted; <mentioned>uu</mentioned> and <mentioned>uo</mentioned>;
<mentioned>e</mentioned> and <mentioned>ae</mentioned>; <mentioned>c, p, t</mentioned> for <mentioned>ch, ph, th</mentioned>;
<mentioned>y</mentioned> and <mentioned>i</mentioned>; <mentioned>ti</mentioned> and <mentioned>ci</mentioned>; <mentioned>f</mentioned> and <mentioned>ph</mentioned>;
<mentioned>c</mentioned> and <mentioned>qu</mentioned>; <mentioned>oe</mentioned> and <mentioned>e</mentioned> or <mentioned>ae</mentioned>;
the separation or fusion of words,
e.g. <foreign lang="la">sed et</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">sedet</foreign> or <foreign lang="la">sedet</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">sed et</foreign>;
capitals and small letters;
<mentioned>-is</mentioned> and <mentioned>-es</mentioned> in the plural; <mentioned>-em</mentioned> and <mentioned>-en</mentioned> in acc. sing. of Greek
names; <foreign lang="la">quidquid</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">quicquid; quamquam</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">quanquam;</foreign>
and so on, because they do not really testify to the spellings
of the original from which our MS. was copied. Although
the copyist saw <foreign lang="la">quamquam</foreign> in the MS. before him, it is quite
possible that he might prefer to write <foreign lang="la">quanquam,</foreign> or <foreign lang="la">febus</foreign>
instead of <foreign lang="la">Phoebus.</foreign> But it is inadvisable to lay down any
general rule as to what divergences are not worth noting.
That is a question to be decided according to the character of
the MS., the state of the text of the author, the aim of our
collation, and other considerations. The one essential thing
is that we state clearly at the outset what variants our collation
does not profess to take notice of.</p>
<p>It remains to mention some other formulae that we want,
such as <foreign lang="la">om.</foreign> when a word or line has been omitted, <foreign lang="la">bis</foreign> when
it has been repeated by mistake, <foreign lang="la">transp.</foreign> when the order of two
words or lines has been transposed. The rest can easily be
picked up from any critical edition of a classical author.
Without wasting time on enumerating them all, I shall pass
on to what is more important, viz. the way to describe a
<pb n="125"/>MS.; for at the outset of our collation we must give an
account of the MS. we are collating. If there is a catalogue
of MSS. in the library, one may copy the description given
of the MS. there; if not, one must make the description for
oneself, and in this way. First we give the title, home, and
press-mark of the MS., e.g. <foreign lang="la">Codex Martialis Oxonii in bibliothec&acirc;
Bodleian&acirc; Add. MSS. 12345</foreign>. Then must follow an account
of the material of which the MS. is composed, whether vellum
(<foreign lang="la">membran.</foreign>) or paper (<foreign lang="la">chart.</foreign>), of its size, whether folio, quarto,
or octavo, of its date, of the no. of its leaves, and of its state
of preservation. Thus: <foreign lang="la">codex chart(aceus) in iv<hi rend="sup">to</hi> majori,
saec. xi. in(euntis), foll. 100, pict(uris) orn(atus), mut(ilus)</foreign>.
Then an account of its contents:  <foreign lang="la">continet Martialis
Epigrammatum libros i-x, xii - xiv; desunt lib. xi et
Spectacula</foreign>. So much is absolutely necessary, and we may
add any details about the MS. that we think should be
mentioned.</p></div2>
<div2 id="ccs4" type="paragraph" n="4">
<head>Goal is the reconstruction of the original</head>
<p>The thing to be remembered in our description of the MS. and in all our collation is that our aim must be to find out
the readings and the character of the original MS. from which our MS. was copied. The textual emendation of an author
becomes a hopeful thing as soon as we are able to classify the MSS. of the author, to say that so many have all been
copied from one archetype, so many from another, so many from a third, and so on; when we can reduce the host of
existing MSS. of the author to two or three groups, and determine from the readings of the individual MSS. the text
of the two or three archetypes from which they have all come. The number of fifteenth-century MSS. of our author
may appear unwieldy at first, but it is possible in time so to manipulate them as to elicit from them the readings of, let
us say, three ninth-century MSS. which have been lost to us, but which we can reconstruct, as it were, can put together piece
by piece, from the traces which the later MSS. supply. And that is where the advantage appears of minute collation, of
noting each and every divergence or peculiarity of a MS. In tracing the pedigree of a MS. these minutiae are extremely
helpful. The mere similarity of text is not sufficient of itself to enable us to tell that one MS. has been copied from
<pb n="126"/>another. But if a peculiarity in the reading of one can be explained from some little accidental circumstance of another,
such as the cases mentioned on p. 65, we have tangible proof of the connexion of the two. The safest rule to follow in
collating a MS. is therefore to take note of as much as our time will permit, to deem unworthy of notice as little as
possible. The fact that a scribe first wrote <foreign lang="la">at,</foreign> then immediately
corrected it to <foreign lang="la">et</foreign> (p. 122 above) may, for example,
indicate some peculiarity of his original, whether that the
form of its <foreign lang="la">a</foreign> was like an <foreign lang="la">e,</foreign> or that it had <foreign lang="la">at</foreign> corrected in the
margin or elsewhere to <foreign lang="la">et,</foreign> or that its reading was <foreign lang="la">at,</foreign> while <foreign lang="la">et</foreign>
is an emendation due to the scribe of the copy. It may equally be due to a mere clerical error that has no such significance.</p></div2></div1>
