<p>The history of these documents during the classical period may be recovered by two methods, the linguistic and the historical. The former is treated below <!-- AEM:  said "p. lxiii f."-->, the latter consists almost entirely in such evidence as is afforded by quotations.</p>

<p>This citation, which was possibly intended as a reply to Herodotus' appeal to Olen's hymn (also with regard to Delos) <bibl n="Hdt. 4.35">iv. 35</bibl> (see further p. lvi), evidently recognises the <title>Hymn to Apollo</title> as Homeric. Thucydides calls it <quote lang="greek">prooi/mion</quote>, the designation used by Pindar, who (<bibl n="Pind. N. 2"><title>Nem.</title> ii. 1</bibl>) alludes to a hymn to Zeus as <quote lang="greek">*dio\s e)k prooimi/ou</quote>.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="TWA">Plutarch (<title>de mus.</title> 1133c) uses the word of Terpander. Empedocles (<bibl n="D. L. 8.2.3">Diog. Laert. viii. 2. 3</bibl>) wrote a <quote lang="greek">prooi/mion</quote> to Apollo. There seems no reason, however, with Welcker <title>Ep. Cycl.</title> i. 328 to limit the word to the worship of Apollo. Cf. Plato's words <cit><bibl n="Plat. Laws 722d"><title>Laws</title> 722 D</bibl> <quote lang="greek">kai\ dh/ pou kiqarw|dikh=s w)|dh=s legome/nwn no/mwn kai\ pa/shs mou/shs prooi/mia qaumastw=s e)spoudasme/na pro/keitai</quote></cit>. See further p. lxi. An analogous word is <quote lang="greek">proau/lion</quote> (<cit><bibl n="Plat. Crat. 417">Plato <title>Cratylus</title> 417 fin.</bibl> <quote lang="greek">w(/sper tou= th=s *)aqhna/as no/mou proau/lion stomaulh=sai</quote></cit>).</note> Thucydides' words have been used <note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="TWA">First by Ruhnken <title>Ep. crit.</title> i. p. 7, 8; cf. Guttmann <title>l.c.</title> p. 16.</note> to support the view that the document as we have it contains two hymns, one of which ended at this point; but the natural interpretation of the passage is that the words <quote lang="greek">e)teleu/ta tou= e)pai/nou</quote> mean &ldquo;he ended his compliment&rdquo; to the Delian women, after which he returned to his account of the God. (Cf. the introduction to the Hymn.) The variants (<title>J. H. S.</title> xv. 309, Gemoll <title>ad loc.</title>) seem independent, and not necessarily preferable one to the other. In a text which depends throughout on the MSS. we have not departed from them here. In two places the Thucydidean version seems to have preserved a reading which was common to the MSS. also, but has been corrupted in them; 165 <quote lang="greek">a)ll' a)/geq' i(lh/koi me\n</quote> where the MSS. <quote lang="greek">a)ll' a)/ge dh\ lhtw\</quote>  <quote lang="greek">me\n</quote> gives no construction, and may easily be accounted for on graphical grounds (through <quote lang="greek">lhtoi=</quote>); 171 <quote lang="greek">a)fh/mws</quote> of the older MSS. of Thucydides appears to be the parent of the <title>voces nihili</title> of the younger Thucydides-MSS. and all the Hymn-MSS. <quote lang="greek">a)f' h(me/wn, a)f' u(me/wn, a)f' u(mw=n</quote>.

<p>Antigonus, like every other scientist and antiquarian, seeks a support for his opinion in Homer. He quoted this verse because it contained the word <quote lang="greek">qhlute/rwn</quote>, and the view<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="TWA">Held by Franke, Baumeister, Gemoll.</note> that he <title>conjectured</title> it is evidently preposterous. The translation of the phrase <quote lang="greek">o(/qen ktl.</quote> will be &ldquo;and one may suppose this was the reason why Homer said.&rdquo; Similar expressions in Antigonus are c. xxv. <quote lang="greek">o(/qen dh\ kai\ o( poihth\s to\ qrulou/menon e)/grayen</quote>, c. xix. <quote lang="greek">w(=| kai\ fai/netai *filhta=s prose/xein, i(kanw=s w)\n peri/ergos</quote>. It might rather be questioned if <quote lang="greek">sumfw/nous</quote>, which is far the earliest instance of the word, were not an interpretation of <quote lang="greek">qhlute/rwn</quote>, based upon the same belief which is stated in Antigonus. <quote lang="greek">qhlu/teros</quote> in Homer is applied only to women or goddesses, except in the curious reading of the <quote lang="greek">politikai/ *f 454 nh/swn qhlutera/wn</quote> for <quote lang="greek">thledapa/wn</quote>.

</p>
<p>The fact that two out of Diodorus' quotations are in the indirect narrative (in long paragraphs introduced by <quote lang="greek">fasi/</quote>), and are of the identical two lines, which also are quoted by the scholiast on Apollonius Rhodius (below no. 12) in apparent connexion with the mythographer Herodorus, suggest that in both places Diodorus took the quotation from his sources. Of these he mentions by name only Dionysius (<bibl n="Apollon. 3.66">iii. 66</bibl> <quote lang="greek">*dionusi/w| tw=| suntacame/nw| ta\s palaia\s muqopoii/as, ou(=tos ga\r ta/ te peri\ to\n *dio/nuson kai\ ta\s *)amazo/nas e)/ti de\ tou\s *)argonau/tas kai\ ta\ kata\ to\n *)iliako\n po/lemon praxqe/nta kai\ po/ll' e(/tera sunte/taktai, paratiqei\s ta\ poih/mata tw=n a)rxai/wn, tw=n te muqolo/gwn kai\ tw=n poihtw=n</quote>), who is apparently the same as the Dionysius of Mitylene, whose <quote lang="greek">*)argo/nautai</quote> are as frequently utilised as those of Herodorus in the scholia on Apollonius (cf. Suidas s.v., M&uuml;ller <title>F. H. G.</title> ii. 6 f., Susemihl <title>l.c.</title> ii. 45 f.). Without denying Diodorus the credit of possible original quotation, especially at iii. 65, it seems likely that the <title>Hymns</title> were excerpted and utilised by both Herodorus and Dionysius, antiquaries.

Considering this, it is remarkable that he uses only the <title>Hymns to Demeter</title> and <title>to Apollo</title>, and the latter only in one place; he ignores the <title>Hymn to Hermes</title> which he might have quoted (<bibl n="Paus. 8.17">viii. 17</bibl> or <bibl n="Paus. 9.26">ix. 26</bibl>), and in treating <quote lang="greek">*tu/xh</quote> (9 above) neglects <bibl n="HH 11"><title>h.</title> xi.5</bibl>. It is impossible to give an even plausible reason for this inconsistency: possibly the humorous character of the Hermes hymn detracted from its antiquarian authority; or  Pausanias drew from Apollodorus and the other prose accounts of the story; or the Homeric hymn was overshadowed by Alcaeus (whom he quotes on the theft of Apollo's oxen, <bibl n="Paus. 7.20">vii. 20</bibl>).</p>

<p>The coincidence of the quotation with <bibl n="Thuc. 3.104">Thucydides iii. 104</bibl> is too marked for one to suppose Aristides to be making an original citation; the clause <quote lang="greek">dialego/menos ga\r tai=s *dhlia/si kai\ katalu/wn to\ prooi/mion</quote> closely follows Thucydides' <quote lang="greek">to\n ga\r *dhliako\n xoro\n tw=n gunaikw=n u(mnh/sas e)teleu/ta tou= e)pai/nou</quote>, and the rhetor, hastily excerpting from Thucydides, mistook the meaning of <quote lang="greek">e)teleu/ta tou= e)pai/nou</quote>. This point is well made by Gemoll, p. 114<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="TWA">Ruhnken's view (see <title>ante</title> p. xliv) is maintained with needless subtlety by Guttmann <title>Hist. crit.</title> p. 16 f. It is certain that in Aristides' time there was but one hymn to Apollo; this appears from any fair interpretation of the manner in which Pausanias and Athenaeus cite it. (That Athenaeus cited the hymn as <quote lang="greek">e)n toi=s ei)s *)apo/llwna u(/mnois</quote> is as much a legend as that the MS. titles of the hymns <quote lang="greek">o(mh/rou u(/mnoi</quote>, etc., imply a plurality.) Aristides therefore can have derived his <quote lang="greek">katalu/wn</quote> only from an interpretation of the wording of Thucydides. (Cf. the introduction to the Hymn.)</note> in his edition; see Introd. to the Hymn p. 61. Aristides, therefore, is not to be used as evidence to prove that two hymns to Apollo existed in his day. He is the last author, to whom a certain date can be assigned, that quotes the <title>Hymns.</title></p>
<p>The following testimonies are less easy to date:</p>
<p>13. Schol. <bibl n="Apollon. 2.1211">Apoll. Rhod. ii. 1211</bibl> <quote lang="greek">peri\ de\ tou= to\n *tufw=na e)n au)th=| kei=sqai kai\ *(hro/dwros i(storei= e)n w(=| kai\ th\n *nu/san i(storei=:</quote>
</p>
<p><quote lang="greek">e)/sti de\ tis *nu/sh u(/paton ke/ras a)nqe/on u(/lh| thlou= *foini/khs sxedo\n *ai)gu/ptoio r(oa/wn</quote>.</p>
<p>This important testimony is unfortunately vague in its bearing. Herodorus, who is largely quoted in the scholia to Apollonius, sometimes as <quote lang="greek">e)n toi=s *)argonau/tais</quote> or <quote lang="greek">*)argonautikoi=s</quote>, is considered by C. F. M&uuml;ller (<title>F. H. G.</title> iii. 27 f.) to be the same as the father of <quote lang="greek">*bru/swn</quote> the sophist, and therefore of about 400 B.C. The scholion is incomplete and there is no indication of what is missing; the construction of the second <quote lang="greek">i(storei=</quote> seems to demand such an addition as <quote lang="greek">peri\ th\n *ai)/gupton gene/sqai</quote>, cl. Diodor. i. 15. There is nothing to show whether Herodorus' work on the Argonauts was in prose or verse (his other work, on Heracles, was in prose, as the quotation <bibl>fr. 30, 39</bibl> shows); if Herodorus, like   Ionof Chios in his own century, practised both prose and verse, the lines might well be a quotation from his poem, and the apparent variant <quote lang="greek">ke/ras</quote> (for <quote lang="greek">o)/ros</quote>) would thus be explained, and the more naturally that <quote lang="greek">ke/ras</quote>, according to the Lexica, is a late usage for a part of a mountain; in this case Herodorus would have copied the hymn. On the other hand Herodorus' work may have been in prose (as we are explicitly told of the <quote lang="greek">*)argonautika/</quote> of another source of the Apollonian scholia, Dionysius of Mitylene; see Suidas s.v., ante p. xlvi), in which case, as is usually supposed, the omission has taken place after the first <quote lang="greek">i(storei=</quote>, and <quote lang="greek">kai\ *(/omhros</quote> or <quote lang="greek">kai\ o( poihth/s</quote> have fallen out. (But that Diodorus is nowhere quoted in these abundant scholia, it would be possible that the words were <quote lang="greek">kai\ o( *dio/dwros</quote>, or again <quote lang="greek">*)apollo/dwros</quote>, as Guttmann <title>l.c.</title> p. 6 thought, where the identical ending <quote lang="greek">-wros</quote> would explain the omission.)</p>
<p>If the quotation can be connected with Herodorus, a very ancient testimony&mdash;as good as that of Thucydides to the <title>Hymn to Apollo</title>&mdash;is gained to the Dionysus hymn, but the conclusion is far from certain. (Cf. Gemoll p. 361, 2.)</p>
<p>14. Stephanus of Byzantium; <quote lang="greek">*teumhsso/s: o)/ros *boiwti/as. *(/omhros e)n tw=| ei)s *)apo/llwna u(/mnw|. a)/stu, w(s *dhmosqe/nhs e)n tri/tw| *biquniakw=n:</quote></p>

<p>According to the wording of the passage, the line seems to  be quoted from the <quote lang="greek">*biquniaka/</quote> of Demosthenes, which, as we see from the lines quoted by Stephanus s.vv. <quote lang="greek">*)arta/kh, *(hrai/a</quote>, was a poem. Then Demosthenes would have appropriated the line of the hymn, and the case is somewhat parallel to that of Herodorus. Demosthenes' date is uncertain (M&uuml;ller <title>F. H. G.</title> iv. 384-6), but Stephanus s.v. <quote lang="greek">*xalkei=a</quote> (=<bibl><title>fr.</title> 15</bibl>) quotes Polybius as disagreeing with him, and Susemihl (<title>Gesch. d. gr. Lit. in d. Alex.</title> i. 404) accepts him as of the Alexandrine age.</p>
<p>15. Schol. Genev. on <bibl n="Hom.

<p>The word <quote lang="greek">fere/sbios</quote> does not occur in the <title>Iliad</title> or <title>Odyssey</title>, and the reference is presumably to the <title>Hymns</title>, in which it is frequent.

<p>The age of any particular portion of the Pindaric scholia can probably not be fixed, but in general they go back to good sources, and quotations perhaps would not have been added later than Herodian's age. The point is of importance, as the quotation (which is unique) of the minor hymns tends to disprove a very late origin for xvi. and its neighbour. <note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="TWA"><cit><bibl n="HH 25"><title>h.</title> xxv.2-3</bibl> <quote lang="greek"><lg type="hexamter"><l>e)k ga\r *mousa/wn kai\ e(khbo/lou *)apo/llwnos</l>

<p>Hippostratus was a Sicilian chronicler, frequently cited in the Pindaric scholia ( <bibl n="Pind. P. 6"> <title>Pyth.</title>vi. 4</bibl>,  <bibl n="Pind.

<p>The date (ol. 69=B.C. 504) has long been recognised to be wrong, and must be so, since the hymn takes no account of the Pythian games, the burning of the first temple at Delphi, the temple of Apollo and the <quote lang="greek">troxoeidh\s li/mnh</quote> at Delos (see the introduction to the <title>Hymn</title>).

<p>This is all the testimony explicit and implicit, which can be gathered from ancient literature. Compared to the vast mass of quotation from the <title>Iliad</title> and <title>Odyssey</title> it is slight, and the impression of neglect which we gather from it is supported by another class of evidence&mdash;the omission to quote the <title>Hymns</title> in contexts where they would naturally have been appealed to. This is most strikingly the case in the scholia to the <title>Iliad.</title> Thus <bibl n="Hom. Il. 1.176">Il. 1.176</bibl> the scholl. quote <bibl n="Hes. Th. 94">Hesiod <title>Theog.</title> 94, 5</bibl> but not <bibl n="HH 25"><title>h.</title> xxv.2</bibl>, 3 where the same words occur; B 144 <quote lang="greek">o(/ti *zhno/dotos gra/fei fh\ ku/mata. ou)de/pote de\ *(/omhros to\ fh/ a)nti\ tou= w(s te/taxen, *c 499 . . . o(/ti o( poihth\s ou)de/pote oi)=de to\ fh/ a)nti\ tou= w(s, oi( de\ met' au)to/n, w(/sper *)anti/maxos kai\ oi( peri\ *kalli/maxon</quote>; this ignores  <bibl n="HH 4 241"> <title>Herm.</title>241</bibl> where <quote lang="greek">fh/ r(a</quote> for <quote lang="greek">qh/ r(a</quote> is almost certain.

These passages might be increased, but they suffice to show that the learning of the Alexandrian school made no appeal to the <title>Hymns</title> on points where, if they were genuine, they would have affected Homeric usage; and therefore, however singular the absence of any reference to them in the whole body of extant scholia (except in the possible case of Apollodorus, above no. 15) may be, this silence is doubtless to be interpretated as Wolf formulated it (<title>Prol.</title> 266), that the Alexandrines considered the <title>Hymns</title> non-Homeric.</p>
<p>The same conclusion may be drawn from the usage of writers who follow the Alexandrian view of Homer&mdash;Strabo and Apollonius the Sophist. Strabo, whose orthodoxy is more than scholastic, and contrasts strongly with the other geographers and antiquarians, ignores the <title>Hymns</title> in more than one important passage. Europe is unknown to Homer (Strabo p. 531), but <quote lang="greek">*eu)rw/ph</quote> occurs <title>Apoll.</title> 251, 291; <quote lang="greek">a)/lfi</quote> (560) is un-Homeric and found only in Antimachus; he ignores  <bibl n="HH 2 208"> <title>Dem.</title>208</bibl>; <bibl n="Hom. Il. 2.591">Il. 2.591</bibl> and <bibl n="Hom.

The consequence is that when in two places Strabo cites as after <bibl n="Hom. Od. 15.294"><title>Odyssey</title> 15.294</bibl> a line which is not found in our <title>Odyssey</title> MSS., but which occurs (with a variant) <title>Apoll.</title> 423, we conclude not that Strabo is acknowledging the <title>Hymn</title> or even quoting it by a slip, but that his copy of the <title>Odyssey</title> contained this extra line. In Apollonius it is enough to mention that his article <quote lang="greek">knw/dalon</quote> takes no account of  <bibl n="HH 4 188"> <title>Herm.</title>188</bibl> and that under <quote lang="greek">*filomhlei/dhs</quote> he says <quote lang="greek">ou) ga\r *lhtoi/dhn ei)=pe to\n *)apo/llwna</quote> (<bibl n="HH 4.505"><title>h. Herm.</title> 505</bibl>, 510, 521). Among later authors Lydus <title>de mensibus</title> iii. 18 and Macrobius v. 168 (the latter an extensive quoter of Homer) state roundly that Homer has not the word <quote lang="greek">tu/xh</quote>, notwithstanding  <bibl n="HH 2 420"> <title>Dem.</title>420</bibl>, <bibl n="HH 11"><title>h.</title> xi.5</bibl>.</p>
<p>It results from all this evidence positive and negative, that the <title>Homeric Hymns</title> were not included in the Homeric corpus by the grammarians of Alexandria nor wirters who took their tone from them; that they were considered Homeric and used as evidence of Homeric usage and history by historians and antiquarians from Thucydides downwards, in some cases with a qualification; and that by the public generally they were little read.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="TWA">This is especially shewn by the proportions in which MSS. of the three Homeric works have survived. Of the <title>Iliad</title> there are over 200 MSS., of the <title>Odyssey</title> about 70, of the <title>Hymns</title> 28. Papyri tell an even clearer tale; in six volumes published by Messrs.

<p>The neglect of these poems, so abundantly attested, seems to account for the many uncorrected corruptions which have propagated themselves in one or other of the families of MSS., especially in M; for the unsupplied loss of two hymns in all but one MS., and of nearly the whole of one in M; and for that absence of ancient commentaries which makes the interpretation of the longer hymns so difficult.

<head>THE NATURE OF THE HOMERIC HYMNS</head>
<p>Ancient hymns fall into the classes of rhapsodic or hexameter and melic. The greater part of what we know about the former comes from Pausanias. It may therefore be well first to collect the references to them in him, and then to add the few allusions in other authors.</p>
<p>Pausanias, who quotes a very large range of epic literature, uses five hymn-writers: Olen, Pamphos, Homer, Musaeus, and Orpheus; and, singular as it may seem to us, he does not give the preference either in age or in merit to Homer. Of Olen he quotes a hymn to Eilithyia (i. 18. 5, viii. 21. 3, ix. 27. 2), which was on the subject of the birth of Apollo and Artemis; it was written as his other hymns for the Delians (viii. 21. 3), who used it in the worship of Eilithyia (i. 18. 5); to Hera (ii. 13. 3); to Achaia (v. 7. 8); this described her journey, as that of  Eilithyia, from the Hyperboreans to Delos. He calls Olen a Lycian and regards him as the most ancient of the hymn-writers, older than Pamphos and Orpheus (ix. 27. 2); and quotes the Delphian poetess <quote lang="greek">*boiw/</quote> (x. 5. 7) as saying that Olen was the first to use oracles and to build the strain of hymns:
</p>

<p>Pausanias' statements are confirmed by the much older testimony of Herodotus iv. 35. After saying that Arge and Opis came to Delos from the Hyperboreans, bringing offerings to Eilithyia, he continues <quote lang="greek">th\n de\ *)/arghn te kai\ th\n *)=wpin a(/ma au)toi=si toi=si qeoi=si a)pike/sqai le/gousi kai/ sfi tima\s a)/llas dedo/sqai pro\s sfe/wn: kai\ ga\r a)gei/rein sfi ta\s gunai=kas e)ponomazou/sas ta\ ou)no/mata e)n tw=| u(/mnw| to/n sfi *)wlh\n a)nh\r *lu/kios e)poi/hse, para\ de\ sfe/wn maqo/ntas nhsiw/tas te kai\ *)/iwnas u(mne/ein *wpi/n te kai\ *)/arghn o)noma/zonta/s te kai\ a)gei/rontas. ou(=tos de\ o( *)wlh\n kai\ tou\s a)/llous tou\s palaiou\s u(/mnous e)poi/hse e)k *luki/hs e)lqw\n tou\s a)eidome/nous e)n *dh/lw|</quote>. He appears therefore strictly associated with Delos, and to have written poems to contain the account of the divinities worshipped there.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="TWA">We may add the allusion in <cit><bibl n="Call.

<p>Pamphos is quoted for his hymn about Demeter (i. 38. 3, 39. i, viii. 37. 9, ix. 31. 9), and it is not clear that he wrote anything else; for allusions quoted from him to Poseidon ( <bibl n="Paus. 7. 21. 9">Paus.vii. 21. 9</bibl>), Artemis <quote lang="greek">*kalli/sth</quote> (viii. 35. 8), the Graces (ix. 35. 4 <quote lang="greek">*pa/mfws me\n dh\ prw=tos w(=n i)/smen h)=|sen e)s *xa/ritas</quote>), Eros<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="TWA">If there were no hymn, Plato's credit is saved when he says (<title>Sympos.</title> 177 B) that no poet had written hymns or paeans to Eros; but it is perhaps as probable that he ignored Pamphos.</note> (ix. 27. 2), and Zeus (Philostratus <title>Heroic.</title> 693=301) may have been contained in the account of Demeter. The statement in Philostratus, however, rather suggests a hymn to Zeus, and that Pamphos' verse was of a mystical and didactic character: <quote lang="greek">*pamfw\ sofw=s me\n e)nqumhqe/ntos o(/ti *zeu\s ei)/h to\ zw|ogonou=n kai\ di) ou(= a)ni/statai ta\ e)k th=s gh=s pa/nta, eu)hqe/steron de\ xrhsame/nou tw=| lo/gw| kai\ katabeblhme/na e)/ph e)s to\n *di/a a)/|santos: e)/sti ga\r ta\ tou= *pamfw\ e)/ph</quote>

<p>Pausanias regards him as we have seen as younger than Olen, older than Homer (viii. 37. 9) and Sappho (ix. 29. 7); his hymns were written &ldquo;for the Athenians&rdquo; (vii. 21. 9, ix. 29. 7) and (ix. 27. 2) &ldquo;for the Lycomidae in their ritual,&rdquo; <quote lang="greek">i(/na e)pi\ toi=s drwme/nois *lukomi/dai kai\ tau=ta a)/|dwsin</quote>.

Pausanias seems to express doubt even of this hymn (<bibl n="Paus. 1.14.3">i. 14. 3</bibl>), and states (<bibl n="Paus. 10.7.2">x. 7. 2</bibl>) that in character the Musaeus hymn closely resembled the Orphic. The verses that went under Musaeus' name he thinks were written by Onomacritus (<bibl n="Paus. 1.22.7">i. 22. 7</bibl>, an opinion he may have taken from <bibl n="Hdt. 7.6">Herodotus vii. 6</bibl>). <bibl>Kinkel <title>Epic. graec. fragg.</title> p. 218</bibl> gives other titles of Musaeus' supposed works.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="TWA">Aristides the rhetor, whose authority cannot compare with that of Pausanias, recognises a hymn to Dionysus by Musaeus.

Laws 829e"><title>Laws</title> 829 E</bibl>) implies the existence in his day of hymns under the names of Orpheus and Thamyris; and both he ( <bibl n="Plat.

Frogs 1032"><title>Frogs</title> 1032-33</bibl>) mention Orpheus and Musaeus as religious teachers, and the latter implies they were earlier than Homer (an opinion usual in later times, cf. e.g. Aelian <title>V.H.</title> xiv. 21,  Hephaest. Ptol. in   <bibl n="Phot. Bibl. 149b.22">Phot. <title>Bibl.</title>149</bibl>B 22); their names are also coupled by Euripides (<title>Rhesus</title> 944); in  <title>Protag.</title> 316 D they are among the sophists. Androtion (ap.  <title>V.H.</title> vii. 6) doubted Orpheus' title to <quote lang="greek">sofi/a</quote> on the ground that the Thracians were unacquainted with letters.</note></p>
<p>From these notices we may draw conclusions as to the light in which the <title>Homeric Hymns</title> were regarded by a learned antiquarian such as Pausanias. The four other hymnographers are all connected with some place of worship, Olen with Delos, Pamphos, Orpheus and Musaeus, and especially the two latter, with Attica, and Phlya, and the hymns are said to have been &ldquo;written for&rdquo; them. The <title>Homeric Hymns</title> are not associated in this way with a particular locality, nor composed for the service of a particular temple, even if in later times the <title>Hymn to Apollo</title> hung on the walls of the temple of Artemis at Delos. The Orphic and Musaean poems were mystical, directly connected with <quote lang="greek">teletai/</quote>, they were also brief and without literary pretension. The <title>Homeric Hymns</title> were more literary and less devotional, and the ascription of them to Homer, of which Pausanias has no doubt, implies that in his mind they had the same origin as the rest of the epic corpus.</p>
<p>In earlier literature information about rhapsodic hymnwriting is not abundant. Demodocus' lay of Ares and Aphrodite (<bibl n="Hom. Od. 8.266">Od. 8.266</bibl>-366) bears a resemblance to one of the greater Homeric hymns, in so far as it is sung by a rhapsode, and is an episode in the history of divine beings, such as the Homeric <title>Hymn to Hermes</title> or <title>Aphrodite.</title> It wants, however, the formulae of invocation and farewell, and the addresses to the deity and reference to his qualities which are frequent in the real hymns. Still it may be conceded that it is a representation or adaptation, to suit his purposes, of a contemporary form of literature, by the author of  <quote lang="greek">q</quote>. As a &ldquo;play within a play,&rdquo; it is naturally brief (100 lines), and an imperfect equivalent of its original.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="TWA">Gruppe <title>die griechische Culte und Mythen</title> i. 520-542 thinks that the greater hymns did not originally conclude with the formulae of transition, but that these were added when the use of the &ldquo;rhapsodichymn&rdquo; was forgotten; further that as the epic &ldquo;G&ouml;tterlied&rdquo; preceded the &ldquo;Heldenlied,&rdquo; the <title>Hymns</title> are developed out of a stage of poetry earlier than the epic. There is of course no real evidence for or against such a view.</note> Historically the earliest mention of the recital of a hymn is in the autobiographical passage  <title>O. D.</title> 650 f. There Hesiod declares he has crossed the sea once in his life, from Aulis to Euboea:
</p>
<p><quote lang="greek">e)/nqa d' e)gw\n e)p' a)/eqla dai+/fronos *)amfida/mantos *xalki/da t' ei)s e)pe/rhsa: ta\ de\ propefradme/na polla\ a)/eql' e)/qesan pai=des megalh/tores: e)/nqa me/ fhmi u(/mnw| nikh/santa fe/rein tri/pod' w)tw/enta</quote>.</p>
<p>The hymn was recited at games in honour of a departed prince, in competition, and was rewarded by a prize.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="TWA">Local tradition asserted that Amphidamas fell in the Lelantine war (Lesches in  <title>Conv. Sept. Sap.</title> 153 F=c. 10, Proclus on <title>O. D.</title> 650= Plut. ed. Bernadakis vii. p. 82); this would fix the story to the somewhat vague date of that event. In any case it may well be historical as of a member of the Heliconian or Boeotian school at the period of its prosperity.</note> The subject was probably divine, to judge from the next quotation <bibl>Hes. <title>fr.</title> 265</bibl> (schol.   <bibl n="Pind. N. 2">Pind. <title>Nem.</title>ii. 1</bibl>, derived perhaps from Nicocles, who may be the antiquarian <title>F. H. G.</title> iv. 464, Susemihl ii. 395), where the poet says:
</p>
<p><quote lang="greek">e)n *dh/lw| to/te prw=ton e)gw\ kai\ *(/omhros a)oidoi\ me/lpomen, e)n nearoi=s u(/mnois r(a/yantes a)oidh/n, *foi=bon *)apo/llwna xrusa/oron, o(\n te/ke *lhtw/</quote>.</p>
<p>We see clearly the Heliconian and Ionian schools meeting halfway between the Greek East and West; and an imaginative historian might fancy the Homerid declaiming the Delian, the Hesiodean the Pythian hymn. The subjects in any case must have been the same. These passages, together with <bibl n="HH 3.169"><title>h. Apoll.</title> 169</bibl> f., seem to shew the &ldquo;Homeric&rdquo; hymn in the light of a <quote lang="greek">pa/rergon</quote> of the professional bard or rhapsode, and as delivered at an <quote lang="greek">a)gw/n</quote>, whether at a god's festival, or in honour of a prince. One hymn, that to Apollo, is explicitly attributed to a rhapsode, Cynaethus of Chios (see ante p. lii and Introd. to the hymn); and there is no more reason to doubt this ascription than that of the various Cyclic poems to Arctinus, Stasinus, Eugammon etc. Similarity of language, style and subject led to the other long hymns being  regarded as Homeric, from whatever school they had actually sprung; and this is the view of our oldest authority Thucydides and his contemporary Herodorus (p. xlix). As new forms of art appeared, the rhapsodic hymn lost its dignity and importance, and its place was taken by different forms of melos; the hexameter hymn continued to be written for private rites and mysteries, or on a smaller scale in unworthy hands, for the public service of the cult-centres. A glorified specimen of the latter sort was inserted by Theocritus into his xvth Idyll, a hymn to Adonis, sung at the Adonia at Alexandria. The existence of short ritual hymns in the good classical period has been shewn, from imitations in fifth-century literature, by Adami <title>Jahrbb. f. class. Phil.</title> 1901, pp. 213-262, and a few notices remain of their writers, e.g. Plesirrous <quote lang="greek">o( *qessalo\s o( u(mnogra/fos</quote>, a contemporary of Herodotus, and Matris <quote lang="greek">o( *qhbai=os u(mnogra/fos</quote>, perhaps his contemporary ( Hephaest. Ptol. in  <title>Bibliotheca</title> 148 A 38 f.).</p>

<p>When and how the Homeric hymns were recited has been much disputed, and without a certain result. The generic name for them is <quote lang="greek">prooi/mia</quote> (first in Pindar  <bibl n="Pind. N. 2"> <title>Nem.</title>ii.</bibl> below, then in  <bibl n="Thuc.  3. 104">Thuc.iii. 104</bibl> of the <title>Hymn to Apollo</title>; for other instances see p. xliv n. 1). It is natural to infer from this word that they were &ldquo;preludes,&rdquo; and <bibl n="Pind. N. 2">Pindar <title>Nem.</title> ii. 1</bibl> distinctly states that the Homerids prefaced their rhapsodising with a prooemium to Zeus; <quote lang="greek"><lg type="lyric"><l>o(/qenper kai\ *(omhri/dai</l>

The minor hymns, both by these expressions and by their brevity, suggest that they were not used independently; two of greater length, those to Pan and Dionysus, rather belong to a religious ceremony in honour of those gods, and either is longer than the Adonis hymn in Theocritus xv. The twenty-sixth hymn (also to Dionysus) explicitly talks of the recurrence of the festival &ldquo;next year.&rdquo; These three hymns, therefore, seem to have no necessary connexion with recitations of Homer; and the same is even more the case with viii., xi., xii., xvii., xxii. (see the Introductions to these hymns). The usual view, therefore (expressed by Wolf <title>Prolegomena</title> p. cvi), that all the hymns were preludes to the recitation of <quote lang="greek">r(ayw|di/ai</quote>, cannot be maintained. This belief rested (besides on the passage of Pindar quoted above) on (i.) the meaning of the word <quote lang="greek">prooi/mion</quote>; this word, like many terms in music and the arts, may have shifted its significance, and like &ldquo;prelude&rdquo; in modern music have been used of an independent composition which bore a technical resemblance to an actual prelude. It is difficult to believe that the five greater hymns can have &ldquo;preluded&rdquo; a rhapsody not necessary longer than one of them. Wolf also relied (ii.) on Plutarch <title>de Mus.</title> 1133 C <quote lang="greek">ta\ ga\r pro\s tou\s qeou\s w(s bou/lontai a)fosiwsa/menoi e)ce/bainon eu)qu\s e)pi/ te th\n *(omh/rou kai\ tw=n a)/llwn poi/hsin. dh=lon de\ tou=t' e)sti\ dia\ tw=n *terpa/ndrou prooimi/wn</quote>. The passage, however, refers not to rhapsodes at all, but to <quote lang="greek">nomoi/</quote>, as a little before, 1132 B Plutarch says: <quote lang="greek">ou) lelume/nhn d' ei)=nai tw=n proeirhme/nwn th\n tw=n poihma/twn le/cin kai\ me/tron ou)k e)/xousan, a)lla\ kaqa/per *sthsixo/rou te kai\ tw=n a)/llwn melopoiw=n, oi(\ poiou=ntes e)/ph tou/tois me/lh perieti/qesan: kai\ ga\r to\n *te/rpandron, e)/fh, kiqarw|dikw=n poihth\n o)/nta nomw=n, kata\ nomo\n e(/kaston toi=s e(autou= kai\ toi=s *(omh/rou me/lh peritiqe/nta a)/|dein e)n toi=s a)gw=sin</quote>.</p>
<p>That is, he says that the sequence of the nome was fixed;  after a sufficient invocation, the poet proceeded to melic variations upon an epic theme. (So the Deliades in their paean, <bibl n="HH 3.158"><title>h. Apoll.</title> 158</bibl> f.) The statement, therefore, that the <title>Homeric Hymns</title> were preludes to recitations of Homer must be corrected so as to apply only to certain of the minor hymns; and when Thucydides calls the Apollo hymn a prooemium, we must suppose him to be using a consecrated technical term like &ldquo;Pr&eacute;lude&rdquo; or &ldquo;Ballade,&rdquo; which had lost its proper meaning.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="TWA">As a metaphor the word is common in literature from Pindar and Aeschylus onwards, especially in Plato ( <bibl n="Plat.

Rep. 532"> Rep., 532</bibl>D, <title>Timaeus</title> 29 D, and often in the  <title>Laws</title>), in the sense of &lsquo;introduction&rsquo; to something. This, however, proves nothing against a change in the technical meaning.</note> The presence of the formulae of opening and conclusion marks the <title>Hymns</title> as belonging to the same <title>genre</title>, and there is nothing incongruous in supposing Homerid rhapsodes at one time prefacing their recital of portions of Homer with invocatory verses of their own, and at another reciting, at <quote lang="greek">a)gw=nes</quote> and festivals, longer independent compositions in honour of the god of the place.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="TWA">The story of Homer reciting the <title>Hymn to Apollo</title> upon the <quote lang="greek">keratw/n</quote> at Delos may, as Welcker <title>Ep.

The various opinions that have been held upon the origin and function of these hymns are summarised by Gemoll p. 101 f., and in the histories of literature. Mr. F.  Jevons B. (&ldquo;The Rhapsodising of the Iliad&rdquo; <title>J. H. S.</title> vii. 291 f.) thinks the minor hymns were invocations of a deity in whose honour a rhapsode was about to recite that portion of Homer in which the God was mentioned. That rhapsodies were performed in honour of gods we learn not only from the well-known instance of the Panathenaea but from <bibl n="Plat.

But the author does not state that the rhapsody was one in which the god appeared, and it would have been difficult to find a rhapsody to mention each of the gods in an honorific light. Further, the usual invocations of rhapsodes according to the schol.  Pind. above were to Zeus and the Muses.</note></p></div1></body>

<head>HYMN TO DIONYSUS</head>
<p>The loss of one quire and a leaf in M, and probably of more in its archetype (p. xv), has deprived us of all but the last twelve verses of this hymn. The lines quoted by Diodorus, which were first connected with the hymn by Ruhnken, came apparently from the beginning; there is no reason to doubt, with Baumeister, the connexion of the two fragments. Another line is perhaps preserved by Athenaeus 653 B <quote lang="greek">*kra/ths e)n deute/rw| *)attikh=s diale/ktou e)n toi=s u(/mnois toi=s a)rxai/ois fa/skwn a)nti\ tou= bo/truos th\n stafulh\n kei=sqai dia\ tou/tou au)th=|si stafulh=|si melai/nh|sin komo/wntes</quote>  (p. 65 Wachsmuth). On the source of the quotation in the scholia to <bibl n="Apollon. 2.1211">Apollonius <title>Arg.</title> B 1211</bibl> see p. lxix.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Date.</hi>&mdash;From its position in M it is probable that this was a long hymn, on the scale of those to Dem. , Apoll., Hermes and  OtherwiseHH Aphr., plainly, it would have been placed among the short preludes. Space is allowed for a hymn of such size by the probable loss of much matter in the archetype of M (see p. xv).</p>
<p>There is hence the presumption that in age it was equal to the four greater hymns. Diodorus attributed it to Homer (iv. 2 <quote lang="greek">kai\ to\n *(/omhron de\ tou/tois marturh=sai e)n toi=s u(/mnois</quote>). The other hymn to Dionysus in the collection (<bibl n="HH 7">vii</bibl>) is in a different style, and comparisons between the two are not helpful; but it is probable that the seventh hymn is later, and that its composer borrowed the concluding formula <quote lang="greek">ou)de/ ph| e)/sti</quote> from <bibl n="HH 1">18, 19</bibl>. There is nothing, either mythological or linguistic, in the fragments of this hymn which suggests a late period.</p>
<p>That there were various hymns to Dionysus, of this class, may be inferred from Menander <quote lang="greek">peri\ e)pideikt</quote>. ch. 6 (Walz <title>Rh. Gr.</title> ix. p. 144) <quote lang="greek">fasi\n . . . o(/ti kai\ xwri\s tw=n genealogikw=n ei)/hsa/n tines muqikoi\ u(/mnoi, oi(=on o(/ti *dio/nusos *)ikari/w| e)pecenw/qh</quote>.

Hermann and others therefore hold that <quote lang="greek">*)ika/rw|</quote> could not refer to the island, as the whole would include the part. But, although there were several other places of the name (Pliny <title>N. H.</title> iv. 23,  Byz. Steph. s.v.), Icaros is here undoubtedly the island near Samos. The poet might mean &ldquo;either on Dracanon or (elsewhere) in Icaros.&rdquo; But Maass (<title>Hermes</title> xxvi. 1891, p. 178 f.) is probably right in identifying Dracanon with a cape of the same name in Cos, an island which had some connexion with Dionysus. For this cape see Strabo 657, where it is spelt <quote lang="greek">*dre/kanon</quote> (other variations are <quote lang="greek">*dra/konon, *draka/nion, *dra/kanos</quote>; the forms in <quote lang="greek">a</quote> and <quote lang="greek">e</quote> are equally sound, being perhaps from &root;<quote lang="greek">drak, &root;drek</quote>, in <quote lang="greek">de/rkomai, e)/drakon</quote>).

<p><title>Subject.</title>&mdash;Persephone, while gathering flowers on the Nysian plain, is carried off by Hades, with the connivance of Zeus. Her cry reaches the ears of Hecate and Helios; Demeter, too, hears her voice, but does not see the rape, or know the name of the ravisher. Distracted with grief, the mother wanders for days seeking news of her daughter. She meets Hecate, who does not know that Hades has done the deed; but the two goddesses go together in quest of Helios, from whom they learn the truth.  Then Demeter, angry with Zeus, leaves Olympus and visits the earth in the guise of an old woman. Reaching Eleusis, she meets the daughters of King Celeus, and is engaged to nurse their brother Demophon. She would make the child immortal, but is thwarted by the curiosity of his mother Metanira. She reveals herself to the Eleusinians, commands them to build her a temple, and departs from Eleusis. But she is still wrathful with the gods, and causes a great dearth, so that mankind is in danger of perishing from famine. So Zeus sends Hermes to bring back Persephone from the underworld. Hades, however, has given the maiden a pomegranate seed to eat, which binds her to him; and Demeter, after a joyful meeting with her daughter, tells her that she must now stay with Hades for a third part of every year. The wrath of Demeter is now appeased; she makes the fruits of the earth to grow again, and instructs the chiefs of Eleusis in the performance of her rites, the knowledge of which is necessary for the happiness of men in the nether world.</p>
<p>The Rape and Return of Persephone is a favourite theme in classical poetry. The version of Pamphos is several times mentioned by Pausanias (see <ref target="cp2l8" targOrder="U">on 8</ref>, <ref target="cp2l99" targOrder="U">99</ref>, <ref target="cp2l101" targOrder="U">101</ref>); it seems to have been essentially similar to the Homeric hymn, though differing in details, perhaps owing to Athenian influence. Pindar devoted an ode to the subject (<bibl n="Paus. 9. 23. 2">Paus.ix. 23. 2</bibl>), and Euripides tells the story in a choral song (<bibl n="Eur. Hel. 1301"> <title>Hel.</title>1301-1368</bibl>). There are references to it in Alexandrian literature (<bibl n="Call. Cer. 6">Callim. <title>h. Dem.</title> vi.</bibl>, <bibl>Nicand. <title>Ther.</title> 483-487</bibl>), and in Nonnus (<title>Dion.</title> vi. 1-168) and the Orphic <title>Argonautica</title> (1197-1201). It was especially popular with the Roman poets: Ovid has two accounts in full (<bibl n="Ov. Fast. 4. 419"> <title>Fast.</title>iv. 419-616</bibl>, <bibl n="Ov. Met. 5.385"><title>Met.</title> 385-661</bibl>); Statius alludes to the myth (<bibl n="Stat. Ach. 2.149"><title>Achill.</title> ii. 149-151</bibl>), and Claudian composed a whole epic <title lang="la">de raptu Proserpinae.</title><note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="TWA">For a complete list of full accounts of the myth, or shorter allusions, both in poetry and prose, see F&ouml;rster <title lang="de">der Raub und die R&uuml;ckkehr der Persephone</title> (1874), pp. 29-98. The list includes Hesiod (<bibl n="Hes. Th. 913"><title>Theog.</title> 913-914</bibl>), Archilochus, Lasus , Sophocles (<title>Triptolemus</title>), Panyasis, Pherecydes, among early poets. For prose cf. especially  <bibl n="Diod. 5. 3">Diod.v. 3</bibl>-5.</note></p>
<p>The distinctive features of various ancient poems concerned with Demeter generally, and the rape of Persephone in particular, have been analysed by Pater in his <title>Greek Studies.</title> He pays a warm tribute to the merits of the hymn to Demeter, noting especially its pathetic expression and descriptive beauty. Many readers of the hymn will agree with Prof. Mahaffy (<title>Greek Class.</title>  <title>Lit.</title> i. p. 151) in calling it &ldquo;far the noblest&rdquo; of the collection. Foreign critics, as a rule, are less favourable; some of the German commentators, and recently Puntoni, among the Italians, have been so much occupied in dissecting the hymn into parts that they appear to have had no time to appreciate its excellence as a whole.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="TWA">See below, p. 13.</note></p>
<p><title>Relation of the hymn to the Mysteries.</title>&mdash;Great as is the poetical value of the hymn, perhaps its chief interest lies in the fact that it is the most ancient and the most complete document bearing on the Eleusinian mysteries. There is nothing esoteric or official in its tone; the writer was not a priest, but a poet, whose primary object was to describe, in fitting language, the pathetic and beautiful story of Demeter and Persephone. But he was an orthodox believer, who had undoubtedly been initiated; and he was at pains to prove that the rites observed at Eleusis were derived from the actual experiences of the divine founders of the mysteries. We can thus reconstruct from his narrative a picture, more or less complete, of the early Eleusinian ritual at a period anterior to the intrusion of Bacchic and Orphic elements. Thanks to the work of Mannhardt and Frazer, much light has now been thrown on the primitive meaning of this ritual&mdash;a meaning which had become obscured, if not altogether lost, by the time of the hymn itself.</p>
<p>It seems probable that the early Eleusinian ceremonies were purely agrarian<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="TWA">Jevons' account of the primitive rites at Eleusis is here followed in the main outlines (<title>op. cit.</title> p. 365 f.); see also Lenormant, p. 852.</note>: the corn was worshipped under two forms&mdash;the ripe ear or Corn-Mother (Deo, Demeter), and the new blade or Corn-Maiden (Core).<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="3" resp="TWA">See Mannhardt <title>Myth. Forsch.</title> p. 224 f., Frazer <title>G. B.</title> ii. p. 168 f. On the duplication of Demeter and Persephone see especially <title>G. B.</title> ii. p. 218 f. This view explains the relation between Demeter and Core at Eleusis more easily than the old theory that Demeter was the Earth. It is not denied, of course, that Demeter became an Earth-goddess, at an early period. For the meaning of the name see Prellwitz <title>Wiener Studien</title>, 1902, xxiv. p. 525, who concludes for &ldquo;Mutter Da,&rdquo; <quote lang="greek">*da-mathr</quote>. Cf. also A.  Cook <title>Class. Rev.</title> 1903, p. 176 f., Harrison <title>Proleg.</title> p. 271.</note> When the time of sowing was past and the Maiden was underground, it was thought necessary to propitiate the Mother, or rather, perhaps, to influence her by sympathetic magic, in order to secure the reappearance of the Maiden. Hence the Eleusinians prepared themselves by various acts of ritual to hold communion with the Corn-goddess. During the period of preparation (<quote lang="greek">ka/qarsis</quote>), the adults fasted (cf. <bibl n="HH 2.49">49</bibl>),  and perhaps abstained from bathing (<bibl n="HH 2.50">50</bibl>). To prevent a failure of the crops, complete purification was required, for their fields, their children, and themselves. They cleansed and fertilised the land by running over it with lighted torches (<bibl n="HH 2.48">48</bibl>). So also they purified their children by making them pass over the fire (<bibl n="HH 2.239">239</bibl>). The women, who in the earliest times seem to have been mainly, if not exclusively, concerned with these rites, held a <quote lang="greek">pannuxi/s</quote> or holy vigil (<bibl n="HH 2.292">292</bibl>). In order, probably, to unite themselves more closely with the goddess, her worshippers pelted one another with stones, until the blood flowed, an offering acceptable to Demeter, as to the gods of many peoples (<bibl n="HH 2.265">265</bibl>). Finally they broke their fast by partaking sacramentally of the body of the Corn-goddess, in the form of a <quote lang="greek">kukew/n</quote>, or mixture of wheat and water (<bibl n="HH 2.208">208</bibl>).</p>
<p>The development of this primitive Eleusinian religion is a matter of speculation. The simple agrarian ritual may have remained unaltered for centuries; but it is plain that the ideas underlying the ceremonies must have been greatly changed before the age of the hymn. As has been already remarked, an elaborate myth had obscured the meaning of the ceremonies which it purported to explain. The mimetic ritual (to secure the renewal of the crops) had come to be thought a commemoration of the story of Persephone, whose loss and recovery was represented by a sacred play.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="TWA">  <title>Protrept.</title> ii. p. 12. For details see Lenormant and Ramsay. Many such dramatic exhibitions were developed from magical ceremonies intended to secure the revival of vegetation; see Frazer <title>G. B.</title> i. p. 227 f., iii. p. 164 f.</note> The old agricultural magic had been transformed into a Mystery, and the Maiden had become a great goddess of the underworld, with power to reward or punish mankind after death (see <bibl n="HH 2.480">480-482</bibl>).</p>
<p><title>Date of the hymn.</title>&mdash;These ideas of future happiness for the souls of the initiated are, of course, quite foreign to Homeric eschatology, and furnish a <title>terminus a quo</title> for the date of the hymn. And there are landmarks in the later history of the Eleusinian cult which supply us with a <title>terminus ante quem.</title> The hymn makes no mention of Iacchus, who played so important a part in the ritual of Eleusis, as known to us from the   <title>Frogs</title>of Aristophanes.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="TWA"> <bibl n="Aristoph. Frogs 316"> <title>Frogs</title>316</bibl> f. See Rohde <title>Psyche</title> p. 261 f. who holds the view that Iacchus was introduced by the Athenians.</note> It is true that arguments <title>ex silentio</title> are dangerous, and we cannot be sure that Iacchus was altogether absent from the mysteries when the hymn was composed. There may have  been a <quote lang="greek">dai/mwn</quote>, perhaps also known as Plutus (<bibl n="HH 2.489">489</bibl>), connected with the great goddesses from very early times (Lenormant p. 856; Dyer p. 174).<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="TWA">This <quote lang="greek">dai/mwn</quote> is not to be confused with the male god of the Eleusinian triad&mdash;Hades, Demeter, Core. See on 2. On such triads see Usener <title>Rhein. Mus.</title> 58 (1903) p. 1 f.</note> But we may safely conclude that Iacchus, who was either the brother of Persephone, or her son by Hades, was of little importance until a period subsequent to the age of the hymn (Gardner p. 385, after Lenormant). It follows that the hymn certainly preceded the introduction of Dionysiac rites at Eleusis, when Iacchus was identified with Dionysus (Bacchus). The procession of Iacchus from Athens to Eleusis was established by the time of the Persian war ( <bibl n="Hdt. 8. 65">Herod. viii. 65</bibl>); Lenormant is therefore probably correct in assigning the commencement of Dionysiac influence to the first half of the sixth century B.C. The insignificance of Triptolemus and Eumolpus, who are merely two of the Eleusinian chiefs, is also a sign of antiquity (see 153). On these grounds the hymn appears to belong to a date at least not later than the beginning of that century; Lenormant himself (p. 852) assigns it to the end of the eighth or the beginning of the seventh century. Most scholars are substantially in agreement with the view that the hymn is the work of the seventh century; e.g. F&ouml;rster (p. 39), who suggests the first half, and Duncker (<title>Griech. Gesch.</title> iii. ch. 14), who favours the middle of the century. So Francke (<title>de hymn. in Cer. compositione</title> etc., 1881), following Voss (between Hesiod and Solon).</p>
<p>We may therefore reject the theory of a later date, held by Baumeister (the period of the Pisistratids) and Fick (<title>B. B.</title> xvi. p. 27), who places the hymn <dateRange from="-540" to="-504">between 540 and 504 B.C.</dateRange></p>
<p>Linguistic evidence is inconclusive, but does not negative the theory of a seventh-century date. Gemoll (p. 279) quotes a number of forms (e.g. <quote lang="greek">o)/xoisin, qusi/aisin, ko/rh</quote>) and words (e.g. <quote lang="greek">a)dikei=n, threi=n</quote>) which are not Homeric, and which seem to him to belong to later <note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="TWA">For Attic. fuller lists see Gutsche <title>Quaest. de hymn. in Cer.</title> 1872, p. 19 f., Francke <title>op. cit.</title> p. 10 f.</note> But we cannot arbitrarily fix a time for their first appearance; we can at most call them post-Homeric. For the evidence of the digamma see p. lxix f.</p>
<p><title>Place of composition.</title>&mdash;Many critics, since Voss, have attributed the hymn to an Attic writer. If the word &ldquo;Attic&rdquo; is taken to imply &ldquo;Athenian,&rdquo; there is little to be said for the view. The  Athenians are nowhere mentioned (the emendation introducing the name in 268 is now abandoned), and there is no hint of the famous procession from Athens to Eleusis. The mysteries appear to be still purely parochial. This silence about any Athenian interest seems to refute the conjecture of Preller (adopted by Baumeister) that the hymn was composed for recitation at the Panathenaea. It is highly probable, in fact, as has often been suggested, that at the time of composition Eleusis was still independent of Athens. Unfortunately the date of the political fusion of Eleusis with Athens is uncertain, although it was undoubtedly not later that Solon,<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="TWA">Jevons (p. 363) is not justified in inferring from  <bibl n="Hdt. 1. 30">Herod.i. 30</bibl> that Eleusis held out until the time of Solon. Ramsay (p. 128) suggests that the <title>religious</title> systems of Athens and Eleusis were largely consolidated by Solon.</note> and probably took place at least a generation earlier. If this argument is sound, we have also a confirmation from history to support the theory of considerable antiquity for the hymn.</p>
<p>Although the claim for an Athenian origin seems to fail, there is reason to believe that the hymn is &ldquo;Attic&rdquo; in the broadest sense of the word, i.e. Eleusinian (Grote <title>Hist. Greece</title>, part ii. ch. 10, F&ouml;rster, p. 24). The author was clearly familiar with the mythology and topography of Eleusis, and must have been initiated into the mysteries. In no early Greek document, perhaps, is &ldquo;local colour&rdquo; so clearly marked. The Eleusinian origin of the hymn has nevertheless been denied by various scholars, whose arguments, however, are not very cogent.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="TWA">The language is of no help in determining the place of composition, although there appear to be a few Atticisms; Francke shews that there are also words proper to Ionic, Aeolic, and even Doric (p. 25).</note> The principal objection is perhaps the fact that, in the hymn, the descent of Persephone to the underworld takes place at Nysa, whereas local tradition laid the scene at Eleusis itself.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="3" resp="TWA">See Maass <title>Orpheus</title> p. 178; his suggestion that the hymn belongs to North Greece has nothing to commend it. Fick (<title>B. B.</title> ix. p. 201) thinks that the author, if not an Athenian, was a Parian; the latter alternative has no probability.</note> But this tradition is mentioned by no authors earlier than Phanodemus and Pausanias (see on 17), and we need not suppose that it was primitive. When the Athenians became interested in the mysteries, they localised the scene in Attica itself (Schol. on  <bibl n="Soph. OC 1590"><title>O. C.</title> 1590</bibl>; see Preller-Robert i.^{2} p. 759 n. 1); and this implies that there was no rigid and orthodox belief in a <quote lang="greek">kata/basis</quote> at Eleusis.</p>
<p><title>Influence of the hymn.</title>&mdash;Extant literature shews little or no trace of any imitation of the hymn. Callimachus may have known it, but there is practically no evidence to be extracted from his poem (see on 49 f.), and he differs from the Homeric version in some particulars (cf. on 200); see Gutsche <title>op. cit.</title> p. 28 f. Apollonius Rhodius may have adapted the episode of Demophon (237 f.) to his account of the childhood of Achilles; but there is nothing in the passage (<bibl n="Apollon. 4.869">4.869 f.</bibl>) which may not be independent. Apollodorus, however, must have been acquainted with the hymn, as his own account of the myth (i. 5) is identical in its main outlines. He disagrees in some details: e.g. Demeter discovers the name of the ravisher from the men of Hermione, not from Helios; Demophon is consumed by the fire; the mission of Triptolemus is narrated. Apollodorus mentions Panyasis and Pherecydes as authorities for the genealogy of Triptolemus; he must therefore have collated their accounts, at least, with the Homeric hymn, and have adopted a composite version of the myth. Actual citations of the hymn appear in Philodemus (see on 440) and Pausanias, who mentions it in three places (i. 38. 2 f., ii. 14. 2, iv. 30. 3).</p>
<p><title>Diction.</title>&mdash;In language, the poem is more closely connected with the hymn to Aphrodite than with any other in the collection (see <title>h. Aphr.</title> Introd. p. 198). The writer was evidently a close student of Hesiod; Francke (p. 11 f.) collects a large number of words and forms in the hymn, which are wanting in Homer, but occur in Hesiod. A passage containing the names of Ocean nymphs is borrowed from the <title>Theogony</title> (see on 417).</p>
<p><title>Integrity of the hymn.</title>&mdash;There is no reason to suspect the presence of any interpolated passages; there is indeed no single line which may not have been original. The story moves in a simple and straightforward way from beginning to end, and all the episodes fall into their proper places. A summary of the various attempts to disintegrate the hymn (by Matthiae, Preller, Hermann, Wegener, and B&uuml;cheler) is given by Gemoll (p. 278), and need not be repeated here. The latest editor, Puntoni, while criticising the previous efforts of the &ldquo;higher critics,&rdquo; has added a theory, no less unconvincing, to the number. He believes that the hymn as it stands is a fusion of two distinct poems, one of which narrated the rape of Persephone without alluding to Eleusis and the mysteries, while the other treated the mourning  of Demeter and the institution of the Eleusinian cult (p. 2, 111). Puntoni apportions the lines of the hymn between these two earlier poems and the additions of a later editor. The grounds for this elaborate and minute dissection are quite illusory; they consist mainly in the supposed unsatisfactory position held by Hecate, and in a number of grammatical and logical incongruities in the text. The most tangible of these are in 53 and 58. It appears unnecessary to refute Puntoni's long argument in detail; his method is inapplicable to early poetry, and perhaps to imaginative literature in any age; some of his objections betray a want of familiarity with epic usage, and even with Greek as a language.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="TWA">To give an example, we are told that <quote lang="greek">e)/peita</quote> in 47 implies that Demeter made two journeys.</note> The conclusion of Baumeister and Gemoll, that the hymn is practically untouched and uncontaminated, is adopted in the present edition.</p>
<p>That no inference can be drawn from the plural <quote lang="greek">u(/mnoi</quote> in the title (a misapprehension of B&uuml;cheler's, ed. p. 3) is plain from its appearance before the other hymns. It is to be read <quote lang="greek">tou= au)tou= u(/mnoi. ei)s th\n dh/mhtran</quote>.</p>

The presence of Hades in the myth suggests an early chthonian triad, Demeter, Core and Zeus Chthonius (Hades, Pluto); see references in Pauly-Wissowa 2754.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">*nu/sion a)\m *pedi/on</lemma>: on the various places called Nysa see i. 8. Whether the Nysian plain is here purely mythical, or whether the poet was thinking of a particular place, it is impossible to say. F&ouml;rster (p. 268 f.) argues for the Carian Nysa; Preller-Robert (i.^{2} p. 758 n. 3) for the Thracian. The poets generally speak of Nysa as a mountain (e.g.   <bibl n="Soph.

Hesiod does not localise the myth, but the schol. on <title>Theog.</title> 913 lays the scene by the Ocean.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)lai=ai</lemma>: this is usually held to be corrupt, but no emendation is at all satisfactory; the conjectures, apart from their graphical eccentricity, err in endeavouring to introduce a person or persons (Demeter or the nymphs). But the categories <quote lang="greek">a)qa/natoi</quote> and <quote lang="greek">qnhtoi\ a)/nqrwpoi</quote> are exhaustive, with the exception specified in 24. Any title of Demeter is peculiarly out of place: she heard the second and louder cry 38, 39, which sets her in motion. The reading of M <quote lang="greek">e)lai=ai</quote> runs counter to the usual notions of Greek poetical taste. This, however, is no reason for suspecting the text. In late, especially Latin, poetry inanimate nature is often personified (e.g.   <bibl n="Verg. Ecl. 1">Verg. <title>Ecl.</title>i. 38</bibl><bibl n="Verg. Ecl. 10">Verg. Ecl., x. 13</bibl>, and many instances given by Forbiger). We have to learn that the idea was earlier than has been supposed. The sense here would be: &ldquo;neither gods nor men heard her; and the trees were deaf&rdquo; (<title>J. H. S.</title> xvii. p. 50). The nearest analogies in Greek poetry are  <bibl n="Bion 1.31">Bioni. 31</bibl><quote lang="greek">ta\n *ku/prin ai)ai=</quote></p>

<p>188-189. Objection has been needlessly raised to this account of Demeter's miraculous entrance, in spite of which Metanira does not seem to recognize her divinity (cf. 213 - 215). She seems, indeed, to suspect that her visitor is something out of the common (190), just as Demeter appears <quote lang="greek">qeoei/kelos</quote>, i.e. &ldquo;noble,&rdquo; to the girls (159). But when her momentary fear has gone, she is ready to accept Demeter as a mortal. Compare Anchises' original scruples (<bibl n="HH 5.92"><title>h. Aphr.</title> 92</bibl>f.), and his acceptance of Aphrodite's denial of divinity. Even more striking is the indifference to a miracle shown by the Tyrrhenian captain in the hymn to Dionysus; see vii. Introd. p. 228, and notes on <bibl n="HH 2.159"><title>h. Dem.</title> 159</bibl>, <bibl n="HH 3.465"><title>h. Apoll.</title> 465</bibl>.

M.</title> and Hesych. s.v. The scholia on Nicand. <title>l.c.</title>, Hephaest. p. 169, Eustath. p. 1684 attribute the invention of the iambic metre to Iambe. The connexion is absurd, although it may have been present in the mind of the writer of this hymn. As Gemoll notes, there is no proof that the Eleusinian raillery was uttered in iambic or any other metre; it was no doubt <title>impromptu.</title> The schol. on Nicand.  <bibl n="Nic. Ther. 484"> <title>Ther.</title>484</bibl> mentions Ambas as a son of Metanira who laughed  at the sacred rites; this suggests a connexion with Iambe, whose similarity to <quote lang="greek">i)/ambos</quote> must be accidental. Iambe's jesting is here a mythological explanation of the banter which was a feature of the Eleusinia. No doubt the jesting was part of the primitive festival, although the literary references mostly mention the practice in connexion with the Athenian period of the Eleusinia. According to the schol. on  <title>Plut.</title> 1014 the Athenian women abused one another, on their way to Eleusis in carriages; cf. also Suidas s.v. <quote lang="greek">ta\ e)k tw=n a(macw=n</quote>. There was a similar custom at the <quote lang="greek">sth/nia</quote> (Athens): see Preller-Robert i.^{2} p. 778. So Epidaurian women railed at each other at the parallel festival of Damia and Auxesia ( <bibl n="Hdt. 5. 83">Herod.v. 83</bibl>; cf. Frazer on  <bibl n="Paus. 2. 30. 4">Paus.ii. 30. 4</bibl>). In these cases the raillery was peculiar to women, who were so intimately connected with agricultural rites. But at the Eleusinia there was also a custom known as <quote lang="greek">gefurismo/s</quote>, in which men and women alike seem to have abused and jested with the procession at a bridge on the Eleusinian road. See  <title>Ran.</title> 384 f., Strabo ix. p. 400, <title>E. M.</title> p. 229, Hesych. s.v. <quote lang="greek">gefuristai/</quote>, Svoronos p. 297. There was a general <quote lang="greek">ai)sxrologi/a</quote> in the Sicilian festival ( <title>l.c.</title>). The custom is probably due to the widespread idea that abuse of a person or his belongings brings good luck (by avoiding the <quote lang="greek">fqo/nos qew=n</quote> or the evil eye, etc.). Frazer (<title>G. B.</title> i. p. 97 and on  <bibl n="Paus. 1. 37. 3">Paus.i. 37. 3</bibl>) quotes, among other examples, Theophr. <title>Hist. Plant.</title> viii. 3,  <title>Quaest. Conv.</title> vii. 2. 2; a Greek sower of cummin must curse to avoid failure of the crop.</p>
<p>The raillery of Iambe is akin to the indecencies associated with Baubo (Babo), who was actually worshipped at Paros (see inscr. quoted on 491) and certainly figured in the Eleusinian cult of Demeter ( Harp. s. v. <quote lang="greek">*dusau/lhs</quote>,   <title>Protrept.</title> ii. 77).

It may therefore be suggested that the <quote lang="greek">u(pota/mnon</quote> and <quote lang="greek">ou)loto/mos</quote>, or gum-cutter, is a worm, which, according to the belief of many peoples, causes toothache. Although teething itself could hardly be attributed to a worm, the incidental aches could be referred to that agency, i.e. the absence of a worm would result in easy teething. This explanation would be more certain, if we accept the correction <quote lang="greek">ou)loto/moio</quote>, but it may still hold good with the retention of <quote lang="greek">u(loto/moio</quote> (a general word for a worm), as suggested above.</p>
<p>For the worm as the cause of toothache cf. Shakespeare <title>Much Ado</title> iii. 2. 28; the belief is very common, e.g. in Scotland, <title>County Folk-Lore</title> iii. (Orkney), p. 140; India, Crooke <title>Popular Religion and Folk-Lore of N. India</title> i. p. 151 (where women of the gipsy tribes know charms to extract the worm); Finland, Abercromby <title>Pre- and Proto-historic Finns</title> i. p. 328. Dyer <title>Folklore of Shakespeare</title> p. 273 f. gives parallels from Germany and China. In the <title>Geopon.</title> xii. 27 and 35 the same remedies are assigned to worms and toothache.

It was supposed that the lost passage or passages referred to the death of Demophon, or to his leadership in the war, or mediation between the parties. This supposition is quite gratuitous; 265 simply marks the time, &ldquo;when he has grown to manhood,&rdquo; and has no closer connexion with the preceding or succeeding lines. There is no trace in myth or history of an Eleusinian civil war; hence Matthiae (followed by Baumeister) substituted <quote lang="greek">*)aqhnai/oisi</quote> for <quote lang="greek">e)n a)llh/loisi</quote>, assuming that Demophon was the leader of the Eleusinians in their war against Athens. The corruption is most improbable, not to mention the further difficulty that tradition made Eumolpus, not Demophon, the leader of the Eleusinians ( <bibl n="Thuc.  2. 15">Thuc.ii. 15</bibl>, Isocr. <title>Paneg.</title> 19,  <bibl n="Apollod. 3.15.4">Apollod.iii. 15. 4</bibl>,  <title>in Leocr.</title> 24,  <bibl n="Paus. 1. 38. 3">Paus.i. 38. 3</bibl>). There are so few allusions to early Eleusinian history in Greek literature,  that it would not be surprising if mention of a civil war were found in this passage only. But Creutzer was no doubt right in explaining the lines by reference to the <quote lang="greek">ballhtu/s</quote>, or sham fight, which is expressly connected with Demophon by Hesychius s.v., <quote lang="greek">e(orth\ *)aqh/nhsin e)pi\ *dhmofw=nti tw=| *keleou= a)gome/nh</quote>. Lobeck (<title>Aglaoph.</title> p. 206) quotes an anonymous verse in  <bibl n="Artem. 1.8">Artemid.i. 8</bibl><quote lang="greek">tau/rois e)n *)iwni/a| pai=des *)efesi/wn a)gwni/zontai kai\ e)n *)attikh=| para\ tai=s qeai=s e)n *)eleusi=ni: kou=roi *)&lt;*&gt;aqhnai=oi peritellome/nwn e)niautw=n</quote>; but it is not clear whether this line has any connexion with the  <quote lang="greek">ballhtu/s</quote>. According to A. Mommsen and Lenormant the <quote lang="greek">ballhtu/s</quote> took place at the end of the festival. It may, however, have been a ceremony during the initial stage of purification (see Introd. p. 10). The rite was like that at Troezen ( <bibl n="Paus. 2. 32. 2">Paus.ii. 32. 2</bibl>, called <quote lang="greek">liqobo/lia</quote>). See Gruppe <title>G. Myth.</title> p. 901. Similar customs are quoted by Bather in <title>J. H. S.</title> xiv. 253, Jevons p. 292. It need not be supposed that the origin of such <quote lang="greek">liqobo/lia</quote> was always the same; in the present case the mystae may have stoned one another to draw blood as a means of communion with the Corn-goddess, or the blood may have been thought to increase the fertility of the land. The latter idea is probably at the root of some, if not all, of the numerous parallel examples which shew that fights, either sham or more serious, have taken place to ensure a good harvest. This, as a European custom, was first clearly demonstrated by Mannhardt <title>B. K.</title> p. 548 f.; for instances from savage tribes see Frazer on  <bibl n="Paus. 2. 30. 4">Paus.ii. 30. 4.</bibl>As often, the meaning of the rite was lost at Eleusis, where the mock-battle was supposed to commemorate an early civil war.

<p> There is no proof that there was a &ldquo;temple&rdquo; of Demeter at Eleusis, apart from the hall of initiation, which cannot properly be called a <quote lang="greek">nho/s</quote>. Strabo, it is true, speaks of a <quote lang="greek">i(ero/n</quote> as well as the <quote lang="greek">mustiko\s shko/s</quote> (ix. p. 395), but the word <quote lang="greek">i(ero/n</quote> need not imply a building; it may=<quote lang="greek">te/menos</quote>. As Frazer remarks (on  <bibl n="Paus. 1. 38. 6">Paus.i. 38. 6</bibl>, p. 511) &ldquo;no later writer&rdquo; (than the hymn) &ldquo;and no inscription yet discovered speaks of such a temple.&rdquo; Various attempts have been made to identify this supposed temple with some of the pre-Persian remains discovered by the excavations of the Greek Archaeological Society. Frazer (<title>l.c.</title> p. 509) doubtfully suggests that it may have been on the site of the later hall of initiation, where walls of Eleusinian marble have been unearthed. Remains of another early building, probably a temple, have been discovered north of the hall, and separated from it by a rock-cut staircase, leading up to the terrace. This building has also been thought to be the old temple of Demeter. It is possible that the <quote lang="greek">nho/s</quote> served also as a hall of initiation, which would of course be sacred to Demeter. In this case the building may be identified with the walls abovementioned, which belong to a building older than the age of Pisistratus; but it is impossible to judge of the form of this building from these scanty remains, or to conjecture how far it was a prototype of a later hall (probably built by Pisistratus), and of the enlarged Periclean hall. See Philios p. 65, 74, who also identifies the <quote lang="greek">nho/s</quote> with the primitive <quote lang="greek">telesth/rion</quote>; Svoronos (p. 345 f.) places the <quote lang="greek">nho/s</quote> on the brow of the hill, but this seems negatived by <quote lang="greek">u(pai\ po/lin</quote>.

Gemoll notes that the ignorance of Celeus as to what has happened until the morning points to a mystery. Most of the sacred ceremonies  during the whole course of the Eleusinia were carried on at night. In the very earliest period the worship of Demeter Thesmophoros at Eleusis, as elsewhere, was probably confined to women (Foucart p. 78, Jevons p. 379, Ramsay p. 127); and the hymn clearly shews the important part played by the women, even in a later stage of the Eleusinian religion. For women as mainly or exclusively concerned in agriculture see Jevons p. 239-242. Even when a share in agriculture falls to the lot of the men, the place of women in festivals concerned with sowing, reaping, etc. is often predominant; for examples see Frazer <title>G.

Met. 5. 535">Ov. <title>Met.</title>v. 535</bibl> f. Persephone of her own accord picks the fruit in a garden, and eats seven seeds. There is a widespread belief that the living may visit the underworld and return safely, provided that they abstain from the food of the dead. The Finnish hero W&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen refuses to drink in Manala, the place of the dead (<title>Kalevala</title> xvi. p. 293). In  Africa S. there is a similar story: a man visits spiritland and is warned to return before he meets one who will give him food (Leslie <title>Among the Zulus and Amatongas</title> p. 121). In New Zealand a Maori woman was thought to have come back from the dead, having by the advice of her father refused the food which the dead people offered her (Shortland <title>Traditions of New Zealand</title> p. 150). The last story is quoted by Tylor <title>Prim. Cult.</title> ii. p. 51, who gives a parallel among the Sioux of N. America. Several similar tales are collected by Hartland <title>Science of Fairy Tales</title>, ch. iii. (among the ancient Danes, in the Banks islands, and in the Hervey islands). Hartland remarks that there is the same objection to eating the food of the fairies (cf. Rhys <title>Celtic Folklore</title> i. p. 290; see also <title>Folk-Lore</title> viii. p. 380; <title>County Folk-Lore</title> iii. (Orkney and Shetland), p. 25, 27). Some other references are given by Frazer on  <bibl n="Paus. 8. 37. 7">Paus.viii. 37. 7</bibl>; cf. also <title>Folk-Lore</title> x. p. 300 f. (Japan). The basis of the belief is the idea that a  common meal unites the partakers in a close bond; hence the sanctity of the relation between host and guest in primitive society. By eating any food in the underworld, Persephone established a bond with the dead. But there is no doubt a special significance in the particular food&mdash;a pomegranate&mdash;although its precise meaning has been disputed. According to one view, the fruit, from the blood-red colour of the inside, is a symbol of blood and death. A pomegranate tree was planted over the graves of Menoeceus, a suicide ( <bibl n="Paus. 9. 25. 1">Paus.ix. 25. 1</bibl>), and the unlucky Eteocles (in the latter case by the Erinyes,  <title>Imag.</title> ii. 29, i. 4). It was believed to have sprung from the blood of Dionysus Zagreus (  <title>Protrept.</title> ii. 19). The fruit was therefore appropriate to the dead. Probably, however, it is here rather symbolical of marriage and fertility, from the multitude of its seeds; cf.  <bibl n="Hdt. 4. 143">Herod.iv. 143</bibl><quote lang="greek">o(/soi e)n th=| r(oih=| ko/kkoi</quote>. It was the emblem of Hera, probably as goddess of marriage; the fruit expedited birth,  <title>N. H.</title> xxiii. 107; cf. <foreign lang="la">ib.</foreign> 112 (of its flowers) <title>sistunt potu menses feminarum.</title> It was an attribute of Aphrodite (see Murr <title>die Pflanzenwelt in d. Gr. Myth.</title> p. 50 f., <bibl>Roscher <title>Lex.</title> 2090</bibl>, Preller-Robert i.^{2} p. 763). Pausanias (ii. 17. 4) refuses to discuss the meaning of the fruit in the hand of the Argive Hera. The mystae at Eleusis abstained from eating it (Porphyr. <title>de Abstin.</title> iv. 16) as did the Thesmophoriazusae (  <title>l.c.</title>), and the banqueters at the Haloa (schol. Lucian <title>dial. meretr.</title> vii. 4; see Harrison <title>Proleg.</title> p. 148). The Arcadians would not bring the pomegranate into the temple of Despoina ( <bibl n="Paus. 8. 37. 7">Paus.viii. 37. 7</bibl>). According to this view, the pomegranate would symbolise, not so much Persephone's general union with the dead, as her special union with Hades. In actual custom, the Greeks made wedding-cakes of sesame (<quote lang="greek">dia\ to\ polu/gonon, w(/s fhsi *me/nandros</quote> schol.   <bibl n="Aristoph. Peace 869"> <title>Pax</title>869</bibl>).</p>
<p>For the pomegranate as an attribute of Persephone and Pluto in art see Preller-Robert i.^{2} p. 763 n. 2, B&ouml;tticher <title>Baumkultus</title> ch. 38.</p>
<p>It does not appear, however, that the writer of the hymn attached any particular meaning to the pomegranate (unless, like Pausanias, he was afraid to divulge a mystery). Apollodorus does not offer any explanation, while Ovid ( <bibl n="Ov. Met. 5.532"> <title>Met.</title>v. 532</bibl>) simply says <title>sic Parcarum foedere cautum est.</title>

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)mfi\ e(\ *nwm/hsas</lemma>: the sense is obscure, owing to the peculiar use of <quote lang="greek">nwma=n</quote>. The meanings of the verb fall mainly under two heads (1) &ldquo;distribute,&rdquo; of food etc., (2) &ldquo;wield&rdquo; or &ldquo;handle&rdquo; (<quote lang="greek">a</quote>) weapons etc., (<quote lang="greek">b</quote>) of the mind, &ldquo;turn over.&rdquo; Hermann first read <quote lang="greek">a)mfi\s nwmh/sas</quote> (after Santen) translating <foreign lang="la">seorsum tribuens</foreign>, i.e. apart from Hermes. Gemoll follows this view. Hermann afterwards retained <quote lang="greek">a)mfi/</quote> (with <quote lang="greek">e(</quote> for <quote lang="greek">e(\</quote> after Ruhnken) and understood &ldquo;dividing it into two parts&rdquo; (one of which he himself ate). Either <quote lang="greek">a)mfi/s</quote> or <quote lang="greek">a)mfi/ e(</quote> might bear this sense, but the participation by Hades in the food is not mentioned elsewhere in this or any other version of the myth. Nor is such participation required according to folklore; the living have only to eat the food offered by the dead, not share it with them, to prevent their return. Voss's explanation <title>dum eam prope se traheret</title>, is quite impossible; nor can we assume <title>tmesis</title>, &ldquo;embracing her,&rdquo; a sense which <quote lang="greek">a)mfinwma=n</quote> could not bear, although it might be used of a nurse &ldquo;handling&rdquo; a baby.</p>

The meaning might be &ldquo;as (abundantly as) the crocus.&rdquo; This, however, would be very prosaic; nor is there reason to suppose, with Ilgen, that the crocus was so much more abundant than the narcissus as to serve for a literary comparison. On the contrary, Aristotle (<title>Mir. Ausc.</title> 111) instances the local profusion of crocus on the promontory of Pelorias in Sicily as exceptional. Probably, therefore, the reference is to the colour of the miraculous flower, the hymn-writer having in mind the yellow Narcissus <title>tazetta</title> (see on 12).

Farnell (<title>Cults</title> ii. p. 511 f.) thinks that the connexion is due, in part at least, to her chthonian character. This is very probable; it is to be noted, however, that the moon is widely thought to influence vegetation (see Frazer <title>G.

In this passage, as in Pindar, Sophocles, Euripides and others, it seems to be distinctly claimed that mere initiation procures happiness in a future state; nothing, at all events, is said about the necessity of a virtuous life. Foucart (<title>Recherches</title>, etc. p. 65 f.) thinks that the object of the mysteries was essentially practical: the mystae were taught how to avoid the  dangers which beset the soul in its descent to Hades. He proves that such practical instructions formed part of the Orphic religion (p. 66 f.); but it is a most improbable hypothesis that the <quote lang="greek">a)po/rrhta</quote> at Eleusis were a kind of &ldquo;guide to Hades.&rdquo; Orphic doctrines did not obtain a hold on the Eleusinia until a later period than the date of this hymn. In any case, however, it is clear that, in the general opinion of the early mystae, actual communion with the deities of the underworld was the main, if not the only, essential to salvation. That this belief persisted, is evident from the criticism of Diogenes: <quote lang="greek">ti/ le/geis, e)/fh, krei/ttona moi=ran e(/cei *pataiki/wn o( kle/pths a)poqanw\n h)\ *)epameinw/ndas, o(/ti memu/htai</quote> (Plutarch <title>de aud. poet.</title> 4). See Rohde p. 271 f. The belief could, of course, be paralleled from the history of other religions. Serious and educated thinkers, at least in later times, believed that initiation in the Eleusinian or other mysteries was an incentive to virtue (e.g. <bibl n="Andoc. 1.31">Andoc. <title>Myst.</title> 31</bibl>,  <bibl n="Diod. 5. 49">Diod.v. 49</bibl>; see Ramsay p. 125, Gardner p. 401); but Rohde (p. 275) considers that the language of Andocides (<title>l.c.</title> <quote lang="greek">memu/hsqe . . . i(/na timwrh/shte me\n tou\s a)sebou=ntas, sw/|zhte de\ tou\s mhde\n a)dikou=ntas</quote>) is quite exceptional.</l>

<p>I. <title>Subject.</title>&mdash;The poet sings of Apollo, at whose approach even the gods tremble; but Leto rejoices in her strong son. She visited many isles and cities before his birth, but all feared to receive her, except Delos, to whom Leto promised that Apollo should love the island beyond all others. Leto's delivery was stopped by the jealousy of Hera; but finally Eilithyia came, and the goddess brought forth her son, who forthwith burst his swaddling-clothes and claimed his prerogatives&mdash;the lyre, the bow, and the gift of prophecy. Many cities and lands are his, but chiefly he delights in Delos, where the Ionians are gathered together with song and dance in his honour. Most famous is the chorus of Delian women, whom the blind Chian poet begs to remember him; he will never cease to sing of Apollo, Leto's son.</p>
<p>Apollo went to Pytho; and thence to Olympus, where he accompanies on his lyre the dance of the gods. His success in love could furnish many themes for song, but the singer chooses the story of the god's search for an oracular temple. He left Olympus and passed southward through many peoples until he  reached the spring of Telphusa, near Haliartus. There he wished to found his oracle, but the nymph dissuaded him and suggested Crisa; he complied, and his temple was built beneath Parnassus. Hard by was a fountain, where he met a dragon which ravaged the place. This monster had reared Typhaon, whom Hera bare in wrath with Zeus. Apollo slew the dragon and gained his title of Pythius. Angry with Telphusa for her treachery in sending him to a place infested by the dragon, he returned to her and stopped her water with a shower of rocks from an overhanging cliff. Then he bethought him of a priesthood, and saw Cretans sailing from Cnossus. He met them in the form of a dolphin, and diverted the course of their ship to Crisa, where he revealed himself as a god. The Cretans built an altar on the shore and followed him to Pytho. Apollo promised that they should live on the offerings of pilgrims, but warned them that if they fell into evil ways they would be subjected to the dominion of others.</p>
<p>II. <title>The composition of the hymn.</title>&mdash;The hymn to Apollo, in its present form, may be read as a continuous poem. But the continuity lies only on the surface, and even the most casual reader cannot fail to be struck by the abrupt transition at v. 179, after a passage in which the Chian poet appears to take leave of his audience and to finish his theme. Accordingly, from the time of Ruhnken, the hymn has been divided into two parts, commonly known as the &ldquo;Delian&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pythian&rdquo; hymns. Gemoll very properly refuses to bisect the document, on the ground (1) that it was considered a single poem at least as early as the second century A.D.; (2) that many of the arguments against its original unity must be discounted; and (3) that even if there has been a conflation, the division into <title>two</title> parts is unscientific, as the present hymn may well contain more than two fragments or complete poems. Gemoll indeed allows that the hymn does not convey the impression of unity; but, as his arguments are mainly directed against its disintegration by Ruhnken and subsequent editors, it is necessary to examine the evidence afresh, and to consider how far Ruhnken's position is sound.</p>
<p>A. <title>External evidence.</title>&mdash;Thucydides (iii. 104) cites lines 146-150 as <quote lang="greek">e)k tou= prooimi/ou *)apo/llwnos</quote>, and adds <quote lang="greek">e)teleu/ta tou= e)pai/nou e)s ta/de ta\ e)/ph</quote> (quoting 165-172). Here the <quote lang="greek">e)/painos</quote> may obviously mean, not the whole hymn, but that part of it which contains the eulogy on the Delian women. Aristides,  however (ii. 558), quotes 169 f., using the words <quote lang="greek">katalu/wn to\ prooi/mion</quote>; and, if he quoted at first-hand, it would be a clear proof that in the second century A.D. there was a hymn to Apollo, which ended with the invocation of the Delians by the blind Chian. Against this Hermann reasonably argues that Aristides was simply quoting from Thucydides (compare <quote lang="greek">prooi/mion</quote> in both authors), and wrongly took <quote lang="greek">tou= e)pai/nou</quote> in Thucydides to mean <quote lang="greek">tou= prooimi/ou</quote>.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="TWA">For a parallel in language cf. [Dem. ] <title>Erot.</title> 33 <quote lang="greek">au)tou= katalu/sein moi dokw= to\n e)/painon</quote>, followed by twenty-four chapters.</note> The probability that Aristides did not know the hymn at first-hand is increased by the fact, observed in connexion with the <quote lang="greek">*)aqhnai/wn politei/a</quote>, that all his quotations from Solon are found in that treatise (see Sandys p. liv); there is thus a strong presumption that he was generally unfamiliar with the less-known early poetry. Moreover, that the hymn was a single document by the time of Aristides is proved by the citations of his contemporaries, i.e. Pausanias (x. 37. 5 <quote lang="greek">*(/omhros e)/n te *)ilia/di o(moi/ws kai\ u(/mnw| ei)s *)apo/llwna</quote>) and Athenaeus (22 C, quoting v. 515, <quote lang="greek">*(/omhros h)\ tw=n *(omhridw=n tis e)n tw=| ei)s *)apo/llwna u(/mnw|</quote>).<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="TWA">So Kaibel's text without variant. On a false reading <quote lang="greek">u(/mnois</quote> an argument, quoted even by Gemoll (p. 114), was based for the existence of two separate hymns as late as the second century A.D.</note> The testimony of later writers (Eustath. 1602. 25, and  Byz. Steph. 618 <quote lang="greek">e)n tw=| ei)s *)apo/llwna u(/mnw|</quote>) confirms the earlier authorities.</p>
<p>There is therefore nothing in the language of Thucydides to suggest that he knew of a &ldquo;Delian&rdquo; hymn ending at line 178, and on the other hand, as Gemoll observes, the historian would hardly have written <quote lang="greek">tou= prooimi/ou *)apo/llwnos</quote>, if he had been acquainted with more than one Homeric hymn to Apollo. As the so-called &ldquo;Pythian&rdquo; hymn is certainly much older than Thucydides, the inference is that the unity of the document extends back to the end of the fifth century B.C. at the latest. Gemoll further suggests that Aristophanes, as he seems to quote from both the first and last parts of the hymn (see on 114 and 443), recognised a single hymn. This argument is of little value in itself, for Aristophanes might, of course, have cited from two hymns as much as from one;<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="3" resp="TWA">The same criticism may be applied to Gemoll's argument based on <title>h.</title> xxvii. (xxvi. in his ed.), in which there are reminiscences from both parts of the hymn to Apollo. But as <title>h.</title> xxvii. is almost certainly older than Thucydides (Gemoll is too cautious in placing it merely &ldquo;before Alexandrine times,&rdquo; p. 116), the argument and the criticism of it are alike needless.</note> but it may be conceded that, if  Thucydides was unaware of the existence of separate Delian and Pythian parts, his contemporary and fellow-countryman was equally ignorant.</p>
<p> <title>Internal evidence.</title>&mdash;(1) The separatists assume that vv. 165 f. are obviously the end of one hymn, and 179 f. belong to another. This view is accepted in the present edition for the reasons stated on p. 63 f.; but, as Gemoll points out, the arguments commonly brought forward are not in themselves conclusive. The &ldquo;farewell&rdquo; to the Delian women (<quote lang="greek">xai/rete d' u(mei=s ktl.</quote> 166) might mark the close of a digression in the hymn, not the end of the whole hymn; cf.  <title>Theog.</title> 963 where a similar formula marks a transition to another subject. Again, vv. 177178 <quote lang="greek">au)ta\r e)gw\n ou) lh/cw ktl.</quote> are not necessarily a formula of conclusion, although, of course, they are quite appropriate to that position;<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="TWA">Gemoll strangely thinks the lines impossible for an ending, as the poet expressly says <quote lang="greek">ou) lh/cw</quote>. But the natural meaning will be that Apollo will be the theme of many hymns on other occasions; cf. <bibl n="HH 1"><title>h.</title> i.17</bibl> f. See also Abel in <title>Zeitschr. f. Oester. Gymn.</title> xxviii. (1887) p. 23 f.; and Weiss <title>de digammo</title> p. 42.</note> the two lines might have served to introduce Apollo's later exploits, after the digression on the Delians.</p>
<p>(2) Kiesel and Baumeister favour the theory of an early Delian and later Pythian hymn, on the ground of a similarity of structure and subject matter which they detect in the two parts. For example, Baumeister compares 1-13 with 182-206, 19 f. with 207 f., the wanderings of Leto with the journey of Apollo, the jealousy of Hera with that of Telphusa, the Delian with the Pythian festival. Of these &ldquo;pairs,&rdquo; only the first (1-13 and 182-206) is at all striking; and, in any case, it need not follow that these parallel passages are by different authors; a poet may repeat himself, as well as copy another.</p>
<p>(3) The unity of the hymn has been denied on artistic and literary grounds. One fact is certain, that the earlier part of the hymn was recited at a Delian festival to an Ionian audience. But at 182 the poem leaves Delos, which is not mentioned again, and passes to quite different episodes in Apollo's career, chief of which is the foundation of the Dorian oracle at Pytho. It may be argued that there is no reason why the Chian bard should not have dealt with these later achievements; he need not have been so parochial as to exclude from his Delian hymn all myths which do not bear on the god's connexion with the island. Again, if it be urged that some final reference to Delos might be expected at  the end of the whole poem, an answer is ready that such criticism is purely subjective, and that we must not force ancient documents to comply with modern ideas of artistic propriety. Even if there is a natural break at 178, the same author (i.e. the Chian poet) may have composed the rest of the hymn as a separate rhapsody; in this he handled myths, foreign, it is true, to Delos, but not foreign to his subject, which is after all not Delos, but Apollo.</p>
<p>But, when all these conservative arguments have been allowed their due weight, it is still practically impossible to reverse the judgment of Ruhnken and his followers. The fatal objection to the theory of unity rests on historical and mythological grounds. As has been conceded above, there is no prima facie impossibility in supposing that a bard at Delos handled the theme of Apollo's victory over the dragon at Pytho. But the circumstances of the Delian <title>panegyris</title> must be borne in mind: it was an assembly of Ionians (152); a certain non-Ionic element was indeed present, but these aliens came chiefly from the Aegean islands (see on 157), and the festival was, in fact, essentially insular. The character of the &ldquo;Delian&rdquo; part of the hymn is entirely in keeping with this insularity; Phoebus has many temples, and travels far and wide (141 f.); but his heart is in Delos (146), which he loves more than any other island, and more than the <title>mainland</title> (139). It is difficult to agree with Dr. Verrall's theory as to the meaning of the whole hymn (see below, p. 68); but he is undoubtedly right in laying stress on the fundamental difference between the Ionian religion of Apollo at Delos, and the Dorian religion at Pytho. In Dr. Verrall's words (p. 17), the Delian hymnist's &ldquo;range of view, and the government of his god are strictly limited, according to his own full and exact description (30-44, 142-145), to the Aegean archipelago. Even the coast of the surrounding land he treats merely as a framework enclosing the beloved islands; he mentions scarcely a point in the coast which is not peninsular, and within the sea-line knows nothing except what might be seen from the sea. His Ionians are mariners exclusively (155), and have a deity like themselves.&rdquo;<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="TWA">See further on 20-24.</note> Moreover, the Delian cult was not only Ionian and insular, but also in part oracular (see on 81); and it is barely conceivable  that a poet, who adopted the exclusive standpoint of the Delians, should have devoted the rest of his hymn (three times as large as the first part) to the praises of a rival Dorian oracle. At the present day we are apt to take a wrong perspective of early Apolline religion&mdash;a perspective natural enough, inasmuch as it rests on authority which, though not so old as the hymn, is still ancient. Callimachus composed a catholic and eclectic hymn to Apollo, in which local and racial distinctions are blurred; still earlier, in the age of faith, Pindar and Aeschylus honoured Delos and Delphi equally, and tried to harmonise the two rival cults,<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="TWA">See on 214.</note> following, perhaps, the example of statesmen like Pisistratus and Polycrates, who respected both the shrines ( Suid. s.v. <quote lang="greek">*pu/qia kai\ *dh/lia, *pu/qion</quote>, and <quote lang="greek">tau=ta/ soi</quote>). But we cannot look for a quixotic spirit in a poet who must have preceded the age of Pindar by several generations, and who sang to an Ionian audience assembled in honour of a local and tribal god.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Pythian&rdquo; part of the hymn, on the other hand, is Dorian and continental in its outlook (see below, p. 67 f.). Without laying undue stress on the niceties of style, a critic cannot fail to notice its inferiority; and few will probably dissent from the judgment of Mr. Lang, who sees in the hymn to Apollo &ldquo;the work of a good poet, in the earlier part; and in the latter part, or second hymn, the work of a bad poet, selecting unmanageable passages of myth, and handling them pedantically and ill&rdquo; (p. 19). His theme&mdash;the foundation of the most famous oracle in the world&mdash;offered a splendid opportunity; but the hymn shows, by sins of omission and commission alike, that its writer could not rise to the level of his subject. Dr. Verrall (p. 6 f.) remarks that he passes over in silence almost everything characteristic of Pytho&mdash;the chasm, the tripod, the omphalos, the crowds of worshippers, the priestess herself. To these omissions may be added the silence of the hymn on the purification of Apollo from blood-guiltiness, which was a primitive and important article of the Pythian religion.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="TWA">On the sacred drama representing this idea see Frazer on  <bibl n="Paus. 2. 7. 7">Paus.ii. 7. 7.</bibl></note> There is no explicit reference to the preApolline worship of Gaea or Themis (see on 300), and no word of Poseidon, who, unlike Dionysus, was at Pytho at an early date. This neglect of opportunities is ascribed by Dr. Verrall to the insincerity of the &ldquo;compiler&rdquo; of the present document; but it  may rather be due to the taste, or want of taste, of a writer who seems to have been chiefly interested in miracles and etymological speculation. Very different is the spirit of the blind Chian, who describes the birth of Apollo and the glories of the Delian festival with so much strength and vivacity.</p>
<p>It therefore follows that the hymn is a compilation of <title>at least</title> two originally independent poems. Some scholars (as Baumeister) are content with this bisection; but they eliminate from the second hymn the episode of Typhaon (305-355), which is sometimes regarded as a later addition. The passage, however, bears no signs of late workmanship: it is a fragment of genuine antiquity, although it has been forced into its present context with some violence.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="TWA">See on 305 f.</note> The hymn has thus been pieced together from three different sources; and, this being its history, there is of course a possibility that its component parts may have been even more numerous. Various German critics, from the time of Groddeck, have argued for this disintegration. None of these speculations, however, are more than plausible at best; nor are they recommended by any historical or mythological difficulties. Groddeck, for example, considered 1-13 to be a separate poem or fragment. But there is absolutely no reason why the Chian poet should not have composed this passage as the exordium of his hymn at Delos. Again, Baumeister rightly rejects Hermann's view that the latter part of the hymn (from 207) is the product of two interwoven poems, in honour of Apollo Pythius and Telphusius respectively. Baumeister's criticism of Hermann is to the point: <title>librarios castigat</title>, <title>ubi poeta erat castigandus.</title> Other attempts to dismember the hymn will be noted in the commentary.</p>
<p>IV. <title>Date.</title>&mdash;The hymn to Apollo (or at least the Delian part) is probably the oldest in the collection, but its age cannot be fixed with exactness. The date and authorship are, indeed, expressly mentioned by the scholiast on   <bibl n="Pind. N. 2">Pind. <title>Nem.</title>ii. 2</bibl>, where the hymn is attributed to Cynaethus of Chios, who &ldquo;first rhapsodized the poems of Homer at Syracuse, in the sixty-ninth Olympiad&rdquo; (504 B.C.). The blind Chian may have been Cynaethus; we have, at all events, no reason to doubt the correctness of the scholiast's tradition in this respect; but the date is certainly far  too low. The evidence of history in connexion with the Ionian assembly, is usually brought forward as an argument for an early period; and this argument is of some weight, though not in itself conclusive. The <title>panegyris</title> must have become famous by the beginning of the eighth century B.C., when the Messenians are said to have sent a secret embassy to Delos, and a hymn was composed for them by Eumelus of Corinth ( <bibl n="Paus. 4. 4. 1">Paus.iv. 4. 1</bibl>). The Delian hymn to Apollo might therefore belong to this century, in which case it would be contemporary with some of the rejected epics. At this time, the Ionians on the coast of Asia Minor and in the islands attained the height of their prosperity. Duncker (<title>History of Greece</title> vol. ii. ch. 9) thinks that the hymn must be earlier than 700 B.C., when the Ionians suffered a shock from the invasion of Cimmerians. But the invaders did not reach the islands, although they ravaged a great part of Asia Minor; the festival was not apparently interrupted, and its splendour was even increased in the time of Polycrates and Pisistratus. It was not before the defeat of the Ionians by Persia that it declined in prestige, until it was revived by the Athenians at the beginning of the Peloponnesian war.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="TWA">On the festival see Grote part ii. ch. 12, who dates the (Delian) hymn before 600 B.C.; Abbott part i. ch. 16; Gilbert <title>Deliaca</title> p. 42; BurckhardtBiedermann <title>der homer. Hymnus auf d. Del. Apoll.</title> p. 19. The dedicatory inscriptions found at Delos (collected by Hoffmann <title>der ionische Dialekt</title> i. pp. 19, 20, 30, 31) appear to go back to 600 B.C.</note> History, therefore, would allow any date to the Delian hymn between the eighth century (or even earlier) and the time of Pisistratus. But the lower limit is impossible on other grounds; for, as we have seen, &ldquo;the hymn to Apollo&rdquo; is attributed to Homer by Thucydides, and probably also by Aristophanes. The first part of the hymn must thus be considerably older than the fifth century. This conclusion is supported by archaeological evidence, which points to a date not subsequent to 600 B.C.  The language, which has been exhaustively treated by various German scholars,<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="TWA">Windisch <title>de hymnis Hom. majoribus</title> p. 5 f.; Christensen <title>de hymno in Apoll. Hom.</title>; Priem <title>der hom. Hymn. auf den delisch. Apoll.</title>; Eberhard <title>die sprache der hom. Hymnen</title>, and <title>Metrische Beobach. zu d. hom. Hymnen.</title></note> has words and forms which do not occur in Homer; but on the whole it is &ldquo;Homeric&rdquo; in character, and seems to belong to a period when epic literature, if in its decline, was still a living force. On the question of a &ldquo;living&rdquo; digamma see p. lxxi.</p>
<p>The age of the non-Delian part is equally uncertain. The episode of Typhaon has been thought later than Stesichorus, as he, and not the author of the hymn, is mentioned in the <title>E. M.</title> 772, in connexion with the genealogy of Typhaon. This argument, however, is quite worthless (see p. liii, and note on 306). The fragment is in the style of the <title>Theogony</title>, and, as far as can be judged from style, may belong to the early Hesiodean school. The &ldquo;Pythian&rdquo; part may be later than the Delian, but here again the evidence is inconclusive. On the other hand Fick (<title>B. B.</title> xvi. p. 21) holds that Cynaethus, the author of the Delian hymn, probably took the Pythian hymn as his model. An early date is required by the absence of the place-name Delphi, and by the fact that chariot-races seem to have been still unknown at Pytho.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="TWA">Mahaffy (<title>Greek Lit.</title> i. p. 147) rejects this argument on the ground that chariot-races were never held at Delphi itself, but on the plain; so it may always have been supposed that Apollo chose Delphi to avoid disturbance. But when chariot-racing was instituted, it must have been done by favour of the god, who could not have been thought to object to any part of his own festival. The argument is therefore valid.</note> The <title>terminus ante quem</title> must therefore be placed at 586 B.C., when these races were instituted (see further on 542). The temple built by Trophonius and Agamedes was standing in the poet's time (cf. 299); it was burned in 548 B.C. ( <bibl n="Paus. 10. 5. 5">Paus.x. 5. 5</bibl>). The Pythian hymn cannot therefore be later than the beginning of the sixth century, and may be much older.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="TWA">Verrall accepts the old theory that v. 542 alludes to the First Sacred War, in which case the date would be not earlier than 586 B.C., nor much later. But the passage, if not a late addition, may be otherwise explained (see note <title>ad loc.</title>).</note></p>
<p>V. <title>Place of composition.</title>&mdash;The locality is settled for the Delian hymn by the statement of the poet himself, who was an Ionian from Chios, and recited at Delos (172). This, of course, proves nothing for the rest of the hymn, since its unity cannot be accepted. According to the common view (see Baumeister p. 115), the first hymn is the work of a Homerid, the second belongs to the Hesiodean school. Gemoll, on the other hand, very properly remarks that there are reminiscences of Hesiod in the Delian part, and that the whole document shows the influence of Homer.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="3" resp="TWA">Gemoll quotes v. 121; there are also possible reminiscences at 62, 81, 93, 169 f. The Pythian part is full of Homeric formulae; see Windisch p. 11.</note> All that can be inferred from internal evidence is, that the author of the Pythian part was familiar with Delphi, whose situation is accurately described (283); further, the episode of Telphusa and the reference to the curious custom at Onchestus  are distinctly local, and seem to prove that the poem was composed on the mainland, and probably in central Greece. Its nearest analogy is the <title>Shield of Heracles</title>, which, if not genuinely &ldquo;Hesiodean,&rdquo; is certainly Boeotian. The tone of this poem is thoroughly Apolline; the contest takes place in the precinct of the Pagasaean Apollo (<title>Scut.</title> 70); the god favours Heracles, and finally causes the bones of the vanquished Cycnus to be washed away, because he plundered pilgrims on their way to Pytho (<title>Scut.</title> 480). As the Pythian hymn is so much concerned with Apollo's progress along the sacred way from Euboea to Delphi (see 214 f., 280), the local and religious interest of the two poems seems parallel. No stress can be laid (as against this view) on the misplacement of Boeotian localities (239 f.), whether this is due to ignorance or carelessness.</p>
<p>VI. <title>Present state of the hymn.</title>&mdash;As has been shown above, the hymn in its present composite form was known to the Greeks in the time of Pausanias and probably even of Thucydides. It would be interesting to know the date and nationality of the &ldquo;editor&rdquo;; and in this connexion Dr. Verrall has suggested an ingenious theory. In his view the hymn is a cento, divisible into at least four distinct parts, of which the oldest was a Delian hymn; an Athenian, under the dynasty of Pisistratus, collected from other sources, or added from his own pen, materials to form the present document. The compiler was influenced by religious and political motives, his object being to diminish the dignity of the Pythian oracle, and magnify the Delian cult of Apollo. The whole hymn, as there arranged, was an anti-Delphian &ldquo;religious pasquinade.&rdquo; This hypothesis cannot here be fully criticised; but most readers of Dr. Verrall's article will probably fail to be convinced that the hymn is not a genuine attempt to honour the Pythian, as well as the Delian, Apollo. At the same time, it is quite possible that the compiler was an Athenian in the age of Pisistratus. If we could unhesitatingly accept the tradition that the tyrant ordered a recension of &ldquo;Homer,&rdquo; the hymn to Apollo might have been edited, as well as the genuine Homeric poems, being itself classed as Homeric by common opinion. But the tendency of modern scholarship is to reject the tradition as unfounded.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="TWA">The tradition is accepted by Leaf (  <title>Il.</title>vol. i. p. xvii f.), but Monro (  <title>Od.</title>vol. ii. p. 402 f.) brings strong arguments on the other side.</note> It is perhaps more natural to look for the editor in  a place where the two great myths of Apollo&mdash;the birth at Delos and the fight with the Pythian dragon&mdash;were first united. This place was possibly Tegyra (see on 16); and Hiller von G&auml;rtringen (in Pauly-Wissowa 2538) suggests that not only was the Pythian hymn of Boeotian origin, but that the whole composition was put together in Tegyra or elsewhere in Boeotia.</p>
<p>VII. <title>The hymn in relation to later literature.</title>&mdash;While the other hymns in the collection were very generally neglected by ancient authors, the hymn to Apollo must have been widely known and appreciated from early times. It seems to have served as a model for more than one of the shorter Homeric hymns (see xxvii and xxviii). In the sixth century B.C., Theognis shows the influence of at least the Delian part (see on 117 and 118). Pindar has possible reminiscences of both parts, but this is more doubtful.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="TWA">The passages quoted by Gemoll from Pindar may be quite independent; see on 73, 189.</note> The hymn had become a classic by the end of the fifth century, when Thucydides treats it as historical evidence of value, and Aristophanes' quotations imply that it was familiar to an Attic audience. The Alexandrian poets made free use of it in their revival of hymn-writing: the chief debtor was perhaps Callimachus, in his own hymns to Apollo and Delos (see on 19, 119, 135, 383, 396), but Apollonius and Theocritus also laid it under contribution (see on 119, 487). The seventeenth idyll of Theocritus is clearly inspired by the Delian hymn.</p>
<p>1-13. See Introd. p. 65. Apollo enters the presence of the gods with bended bow; see on 4. This seemingly threatening attitude has been variously interpreted; according to Baumeister he is returning from the chase; Hermann assumes that the god is angry. But probably the poet merely wished to express the majesty of Apollo (Ilgen).

<p>30-44. Many, though by no means all, of the places mentioned in this geographical list were famous for the worship of Apollo. It has been thought that they were named for this reason; the poet perhaps meant to recount a number of cities and islands which afterwards received Apollo, although each feared to become his birthplace. But, if this view is correct, it is remarkable that Rhodes, one of the chief seats of Apollo-worship, is not mentioned, although the neighbouring island of Carpathos, which was far less important, occurs in the catalogue. The list, taken as a whole, is purely geographical, and is compiled to show the extent of Leto's wanderings round the coasts and islands of the Aegean. The places are enumerated in a more or less orderly sequence; Leto starts from Crete, moves northwards by Aegina, Athens, and Euboea to Athos and Samothrace; she then returns southward, visiting Ida and taking on her way the chief islands of the Aegean and places in Asia Minor, until she reaches the most southerly group of islands; from Carpathos she moves in to Delos by way of Naxos, Paros, and Rheneia.

<p> The history of the gradual reconstruction of this line is instructive. The key was given by the members of the <title>x</title> family, and the problem was therefore beyond the older editors.

Ion 919">Eur. <title>Ion</title>919</bibl>,  <bibl n="Eust. 1557">Eust. 1557</bibl>, Leto clasped the palm with one hand, a laurel with the other. Euripides (<title>I. T.</title> 1097) adds an olive to the other trees. In the Delian hymn (<title>B. C. H.</title> xviii. p. 345 f., Smyth <title>Melic Poets</title> p. 533) the olive alone takes the place of the palm: <quote lang="greek">o(\n e)/tikte *latw\ ma/kaira pa[ra\ li/mna|] kluta=| xersi\ glauka=s e)lai/as qigou=s)</quote>.

The names <quote lang="greek">*)elai/a</quote> and <quote lang="greek">*foi=nic</quote> were given to two streams near the temple of Apollo at Tegyra (see on 16).</l>
<p>The legend suggests a Greek belief in the efficacy of the palm or olive to ensure a safe or quick delivery. Traces of the custom have survived in modern Greece, where an olive-branch, called the Virgin's hand, and sacred to  Eleutherios  St.or Panaghia Vlastike, is sometimes grasped by women (Bent <title>Cyclades</title> p. 182, Rodd <title>Customs and Lore of Modern Greece</title> p. 141).

Elsewhere, however, Coronis is called the daughter of Phlegyas (xvi. 2 and see reff. in Pauly-Wissowa 30; Isyllus <title>Inscr. Pelop. et insul. vicin.</title> 1902, i. 950). It is not impossible that here another legend is followed, in which she is the daughter of Azan (so Preller-Robert i.^{2} p. 520 n. 3). Martin reads <quote lang="greek">*)azani/da</quote>, i.e. Arcadian; but Phlegyas is not known to have any connexion with Arcadia. For the various references to his home see Gemoll; according to one version ( <bibl n="Paus. 9. 36. 3">Paus.ix. 36. 3</bibl>) he was a Phocian; hence <quote lang="greek">*)abanti/da</quote> (from Abae) has been suggested, but the first vowel should be short. According to another version the mother of Asclepius, by Apollo, was not Coronis but Arsinoe, whose father Leucippus was descended from Atlas ( <bibl n="Apollod. 3.118">Apollod.iii. 118</bibl>, cf. 110,  <bibl n="Paus. 2. 171">Paus.ii. 171</bibl>). This would support M's <quote lang="greek">*)atlanti/da</quote>, which seems, however, either a conjecture or a graphical corruption of <quote lang="greek">*)azanti/da</quote>.

<p> Apollo starts from Olympus in search of a place for his oracle. It is to be noted that there is no mention of Delos as a starting-point; the continental poet has no interest in the island. Later, when the Delian and Pythian myths were systematised, Apollo was supposed to have journeyed from Delos to Delphi (first in <bibl>Pind. <title>fr.</title> 286</bibl> = schol. on   <bibl n="Aesch. Eum. 11">Aesch. <title>Eum.</title>11</bibl>); Pindar made Apollo alight at Tanagra. This was thought a mistake for Tegyra (see on 16) by O.

According to   <bibl n="Aesch. Eum. 9">Aesch. <title>Eum.</title>9</bibl> f. and the Delphian hymn (<title>B. C. H.</title> xviii. p. 345 f. <title>v.</title> 14 f.)

<p> The geography is here accurate. From Iolcus (N. of the gulf of Pagasae) Apollo passes, either along the coast of Phthiotis or across the gulf, to Cenaeon, a promontory at the extreme NW. of Euboea (see   <bibl n="Soph. Trach. 752">Soph. <title>Trach.</title>752</bibl>). He thus reaches the Lelantine plain, which lay between Chalcis and Eretria. This district became famous about 700 B.C. as the bone of contention between the two cities. See Duncker iii. ch. viii., Holm i. ch. xxi.

<p> Baumeister, who holds the poet (of this part of the hymn) to have been a Boeotian, understands the reason for the supposed non-existence of Thebes to be due to feelings of patriotism. A Boeotian could not allow the chief city of his country to be passed over by Apollo without honour. Possibly, however, the poet wished to lay emphasis on the extreme antiquity of the Pythian oracle by claiming for it a greater age than for Thebes, which was itself reputed to be a very ancient city. Tradition held that there were other inhabited towns in Boeotia before the foundation of Thebes (cf. Conon 's <quote lang="greek">dihgh/seis</quote> ap.   <bibl n="Phot. Bibl. 137b.27">Phot. <title>Bibl.</title>137</bibl><title>b</title> 27). The Catalogue (<bibl n="Hom. Il. 2.505">Il. 2.505</bibl>) mentions <quote lang="greek">*(upoqh=bai</quote> only.

On the site see Frazer on  <title>l.c.</title></p>
<p>231-238. The custom at Onchestus is puzzling, as the account in the hymn is obscurely worded, and is our sole authority. Most scholars have followed B&ouml;ttiger in explaining the custom as a mode of divination: if the horses entered the <quote lang="greek">a)/lsos</quote> the omen was favourable; see Bouch&eacute;-Leclercq <title>Divination</title> i. p. 150. This and similar views, however, depend on Barnes' emendation <quote lang="greek">a)/gwsin</quote>, which cannot be accepted (see on 235). Ilgen first gave a clue, by a suggestion that there is a reference to Poseidon <quote lang="greek">tara/cippos</quote>. A bolting or shying horse was often thought to be panic-stricken by that god (see  <bibl n="Paus. 6. 20. 15">Paus.vi. 20. 15</bibl> with Frazer's note). The present editors have discussed the passage in <title>J. H. S.</title> xvii. p. 274 f. (T. W. A.) and <title>J. H. S.</title> xix. p. xxxix f. (  S. ). It is possible that the custom was the ordinary rule of the road: Poseidon was offended at wheeled traffic which passed his home; but the horses were allowed a chance; if they bolted and broke the carriage, the driver had to leave the wreckage in the precinct. In any case the owners kept the horses (see note on <quote lang="greek">kome/ousi</quote> 236).</p>
<p>It is hard to believe, however, that this inconvenient practice was a regular &ldquo;rule of the road&rdquo;; moreover <quote lang="greek">neodmh\s pw=los</quote> is forcible and scarcely looks like a poetic expression for any horse. The custom may rather have been practised with newly broken colts. All horses belonged to the horse-god Poseidon, who might refuse to allow his sacred animals to bear the yoke. The colts were passed before the god; if they drew the carriage safely through, or past, his precinct, they might be driven by men; if they broke away from the chariot, Poseidon claimed them for his own. The owners could indeed retain them, but not for the indignity of a yoke; the chariot was left in the grove, as being marked by Poseidon's displeasure.

<p>240 sq. The geography here is difficult. Haliartus lies between Onchestus and Ocalea, and the Cephissus or Melas flowed across the northern part of the Copais lake, and would not be crossed at any point by the road from Thebes to Panopeus. We can hardly with Ilgen suppose Apollo to have gone round the whole lake (e.g. to Tegyra) turning N. at this point; and the transpositions and excisions of other editors are even less available. The writer, like the author of the Catalogue, was indifferent to the order of places on a route (cf. his lists of places 30 f., 422 f.), and may therefore be allowed to have transposed Haliartus and Ocalea; but it is hard to imagine a poet whom there are grounds for calling Boeotian (Introd. p. 67 f.) making the stream which actually separates Onchestus and Haliartus (usually identified with the Lophis) into the Cephissus. By the date of the hymn no doubt the old Minyan system of drainage had broken down, and Copais had become, as it remained till a few years ago, in the winter a sheet of water, in the summer a dry swamp intersected by various rivers and canals. It may therefore be suggested (1) that the writer meant <quote lang="greek">*khfiso/s</quote> for the lake, somewhat as in 280 he locates Panopeus <quote lang="greek">*khfisi/dos e)ggu/qi li/mnhs</quote>, while it was in reality near the river; (2) or that the entire water-system, rivers and canals, may have been considered branches of the Cephissus, and that the southernmost canal with its tributaries (which came close to Haliartus and Onchestus, and actually joined the Melas at the NW. corner of the lake) may have been known by that name. Strabo 407 says distinctly that the Melas flows through the land of Haliartus. There was much confusion of names in this submerged country; even a resident antiquary like Plutarch (<title>Sulla</title> 20, <title>Pelop.</title> 16) mistook the Cephissus for the Melas, and Strabo 412 accuses Alcaeus of misplacing Onchestus and misspelling the name of a river.

<p>300-304. The slaying of the dragon. If the account of Typhaon is an insertion (see on 305 f.) line 304 would be naturally followed by 356. The episode of the dragon is doubtless part of the original myth; but the hymn-writer turns it to account, in order to explain the supposed etymology of <quote lang="greek">puqw/</quote> (372 f.), which he may have himself invented (Pauly-Wissowa 2527).</p>
<p>The dragon is now generally supposed to represent an earlier Pythian cult, dispossessed by Apollo. As a snake is regularly the symbol or actual embodiment of earth-deities, it is probable that it here stands for the older cult of Gaea (followed, according to some ancient traditions, by that of Themis). For this early oracle of Pytho cf.   <bibl n="Aesch. Eum. 2">Aesch. <title>Eum.</title>2</bibl><quote lang="greek">th\n prwto/mantin *gai=an</quote>,  <bibl n="Paus. 10. 5. 5">Paus.x. 5. 5</bibl><quote lang="greek">fasi\ ga\r dh\ ta\ a)rxaio/tata *gh=s ei)=nai to\ xrhsth/rion</quote>, Plutarch <title>de Pyth. or.</title> 17. 402 C,  <title>I.

The snake was no doubt originally the giver  of the oracle (Miss Harrison compares the oracular snake at Epirus,  <title>de nat. anim.</title> xi. 2), and afterwards became merely the guardian of the well; for the latter idea cf.  <title>l.c.</title> 1249,  <bibl n="Paus. 10. 6. 6">Paus.x. 6. 6</bibl><quote lang="greek">e)pi\ tw=| mantei/w| fu/laka u(po\ *gh=s teta/xqai</quote>,  <bibl n="Apollod. 1.4.3">Apollod.i. 4. 3</bibl><quote lang="greek">o( frourw=n to\ mantei=on *pu/qwn o)/fis e)kw/luen ktl.</quote> In later times the  Python reappears as <quote lang="greek">profh/ths</quote>; cf.   <bibl n="Hyg.

On the grave of the  Python see Harrison <title>l.c.</title> p. 225 f.</p>
<p>For the common idea that the water of a spring or well is guarded by a serpent see Frazer on  <bibl n="Paus. 9. 10. 5">Paus.ix. 10. 5.</bibl>In many cases, of course, there is no suggestion that the snake was oracular, as at Delphi.</p>
<p>The conflict between a dragon or other monster and a god, hero, or saint is too wide a subject for discussion in a note. Here, again, the causes of the myth may be various; see Crooke (&ldquo;The Legends of Krishna&rdquo; in <title>Folk-Lore</title> xi. p. 11 f.) who accepts the view that the Pythian myth represents a conflict of cults. The subject is exhaustively discussed by Hartland <title>Legend of Perseus</title> (in iii. p. 66 f. he rejects the common theory that these stories are traditions of gigantic saurians). It may be conceded that some cases are pure nature-myths (e.g. the struggle of Indra with Ahi or Vitra).

<p>305-355. The episode of Typhaon is reasonably suspected by most commentators, as foreign to the context. The connexion of the <quote lang="greek">dra/kaina</quote> with Typhaon is very forced; nothing is said about the fate of this monster, for it is the dragon that is slain by Apollo, 356 f. The passage should not be called a &ldquo;later addition,&rdquo; for, as Farnell (<title>Cults</title> i. p. 183) remarks it is &ldquo;a genuine though a misplaced fragment.&rdquo; The snake-form of Typhoeus (see PrellerRobert i. p. 65 n. 1) would help to associate or confuse him with the dragon.

The parentage here given is evidently later than the Hesiodean account, from which, however, the author of the hymn is not altogether free, as Hera asks for a son from Earth and Heaven and the Titans, but especially from the Earth (cp. 340 f.). On the connexion of Hera and Typhoeus see Farnell <title>Cults</title> i. p. 183 f., who rightly explains it as due to the character of Hera, the jealous goddess of the epic drama. She is not here to be regarded as a Chthonian deity.

<p>The birth of Athena from the head of Zeus is Homeric (<bibl n="Hom. Il. 5.875">Il. 5.875</bibl>, 880). Homer, it is true, does not mention the head, but <bibl n="Hom.

The lameness of  Hephaestus is accounted for by   <bibl n="Verg. A. 8. 414"> <title>Aen.</title>viii. 414</bibl><title>quia per naturam numquam rectus est ignis.</title> Modern mythologists of the older school have accepted the explanation (e.g. Preller-Robert i. p. 175). It seems more reasonable to suppose that, as the trade of the smith was particularly suited to the lame, the divine smith was himself imagined to be lame. The Norse V&ouml;lundur and the Teutonic Wieland were lame.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">o(\n te/kon au)t/h</lemma>: an emphatic amplification of <quote lang="greek">pai=s e)mo/s</quote>, &ldquo;my very own child.&rdquo; There are two traditions as to the parentage of Hephaestus: according to  <title>Theog.</title> 927 Hera was his sole parent, having borne him to avenge herself for the birth of Athena. Matthiae assumed that the hymn followed this version, and translated <quote lang="greek">au)th/</quote> &ldquo;alone.&rdquo; But Franke replied that in this case Hera would have already been even with Zeus, without the birth of the monster. Clearly the hymn adopts the other version, that Hephaestus was the son of Zeus, as well as of Hera (<bibl n="Hom. Il. 14.338">Il. 14.338</bibl>); he speaks of two parents also in <bibl n="Hom. Od. 8.312">Od. 8.312</bibl>, a passage probably in the poet's mind (cf. n. on 312 <title>supra</title>). On the birth of Hephaestus see Usener <title>Rhein. Mus.</title> 1901 p. 180 f.</p>
<p>After this line a lacuna, as Demetrius saw, seems required. It could indeed be avoided, by placing a full stop at <quote lang="greek">au)th/</quote>, and taking <quote lang="greek">r(i/y)</quote> as an asyndeton; the abruptness might be thought to suit Hera's rage (cf. <bibl n="HH 2.227"><title>h. Dem.</title> 227</bibl>). But the style would be so extremely harsh that this view is unlikely. The words <quote lang="greek">o(\n te/kon au)th/</quote> are not to be touched, and to read <quote lang="greek">de/</quote> for <quote lang="greek">a)na/</quote> in 318 (with the correction of <quote lang="greek">*g</quote> followed by Abel) is to give up the problem. In <title>J. H. S.</title> xv. p. 278 a line was suggested <quote lang="greek">ai)=sxos e)moi\ kai\ o)/neidos e)n ou)ranw=|, o(/n te kai\ au)th/</quote>, it being there assumed that the line was lost through assonance; but of course such lacunae may be due to other causes.</p>
<p>With regard to the fall of Hephaestus there are again two versions, both Homeric: in <bibl n="Hom. Il. 1.590">Il. 1.590</bibl> he is thrown from heaven by Zeus; in <bibl n="Hom. Il. 14.395">Il. 14.395</bibl> this is done by Hera, in disgust at his lameness. (So  <bibl n="Paus. 1. 20. 3">Paus.i. 20. 3</bibl>, <title>Mythogr. Graec.</title> ed. Westermann p. 372.)

A difficulty has been found in the line: according to the text, Hera threatens to be &ldquo;far from Zeus,&rdquo; but to mingle with the other gods (<quote lang="greek">mete/ssomai</quote>). Yet she departs from the gods 331, and spends a year in her temples. In the seclusion of his own temple a deity was thought to be withdrawn from all intercourse with fellow-gods; cf. <bibl n="HH 2.304"><title>h.

The transposition of these lines, with the futures <quote lang="greek">r(e/cousi, a)ggele/ousi</quote> (first made by Matthiae), to follow 390 would be plausible but that 393 is left incomplete, which involves further violence.

<p>402, 403. The difficulty in these two lines is so great that Gemoll may be pardoned for giving up the passage as hopeless. We have first to decide between <quote lang="greek">ou)/ tis . . . e)pefra/sato</quote> of M and and <quote lang="greek">o(/s tis . . . e)pifra/ssaito</quote> of other MSS. The objection to the reading of M is that it is hard to understand how the sailors could have failed to see the dolphin, which lay on the deck; in fact lines 415 f. distinctly state the contrary. This seems to dispose of Matthiae's <quote lang="greek">e)pefra/sat' ou)d' e)no/hse</quote>, apart from the graphical difficulty of that emendation. We must therefore accept <quote lang="greek">o(/s tis e)pifra/ssaito noh=sai</quote>, which can mean &ldquo;whoever thought to observe the dolphin.&rdquo; <quote lang="greek">e)pifra/zesqai</quote> takes an infinitive, <bibl n="Hom. Od. 5.183">Od. 5.183</bibl> <quote lang="greek"> e)pefra/sqhs a)goreu=sai</quote>. With this reading it would be just possible to dispense with the theory of a lacuna; we might understand &ldquo;whoever observed him, him he threw down, and shook the ship.&rdquo; The dolphin would upset any one who approached him. But <quote lang="greek">pa/ntos' a)nassei/aske</quote> will hardly bear this interpretation. The verb seems to mean &ldquo;shake up&rdquo; or &ldquo;shake to and fro,&rdquo; and the object must be the ship or the <quote lang="greek">dou=ra</quote>. Hermann's lacuna may therefore be accepted, the sense being &ldquo;whoever saw the dolphin [tried to throw it overboard, but the monster] made [the ship] rock all ways&rdquo;; e.g. we may supply a verse like <quote lang="greek">e)kba/llein e)/qelen delfi=n), o( de\ nh=a me/lainan</quote>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)*nassei/aske</lemma> is an anomalous form, but may be defended by <bibl n="Hom. Il. 8.272">Il. 8.272</bibl> <quote lang="greek"> kru/ptaske, *o 23 r(i/ptaskon, q 374 r(i/ptaske</quote>.</p>
<p>405, 406. The sailors were at first too much afraid to <title>stop</title> the ship, as they afterwards attempted to do (414). Hence <quote lang="greek">e)/luon</quote> is right in both lines. The repetition of the verb, to which Baumeister objects, is not more offensive than that  of <quote lang="greek">nh=a, nho/s</quote>. Baumeister's <quote lang="greek">e)/lkon</quote> would give a wrong sense, &ldquo;hoist sail,&rdquo; cf. <bibl n="Hom.

Moreover <quote lang="greek">*(/elos</quote> is at the head of the Laconian gulf, and it is difficult to see why the <quote lang="greek">*no/tos</quote> carried the ship first N. and then  S. again to Taenarum instead of crossing the mouth of the gulf from point to point. This latter argument cannot, however, be pressed; for (1) the hymn-writer is careless on points of geographical accuracy (see 239 f., 419 f., 425), and (2) the ship might be said to pass Helos, even if it kept a fairly straight course from Malea to Taenarum.</p>
<p>With the manuscript reading, <quote lang="greek">ptoli/eqron</quote> would refer to Taenarum: &ldquo;first they went by Malea, and then past the Laconian land they arrived at the seagirt town and fields of the sun.&rdquo;  <bibl n="Paus. 3. 25. 9">Paus.iii. 25. 9</bibl> mentions a town once called Taenarum, in his own day <quote lang="greek">*kainh/polis</quote>, forty stades from the cape; so  Byz. <quote lang="greek">Steph. *tai/naros . . . a)f' ou)= kalei=tai h( po/lis kai\ h( a)/kra kai\ o( limh/n</quote>. The hymn-writer may either have identified the cape and town, or may refer to the town only. The epithet <quote lang="greek">a(liste/fanos</quote> is true of the Taenarian peninsula; cf.   <bibl n="Pind.

<p>412, 413. Groddeck quite unreasonably ejects these verses. There is no other record of the sacred flocks at Taenarum, but there were cults of Helios in various parts of Laconia, e.g. at Taleton (Taygetus) where horses were sacrificed,  <bibl n="Paus. 3. 20. 4">Paus.iii. 20. 4.</bibl>Other reff. in Wide <title>Lakon. Kulte</title> p. 215 f. Herodotus (ix. 93) mentions sacred flocks of Apollo at Apollonia in Epirus. In any case, the author had in mind the herds and flocks of the Sun in Thrinacria, <bibl n="Hom. Od. 12.128">Od. 12.128</bibl> f. The subject is discussed by <bibl>O. M&uuml;ller <title>Proll.</title> pp. 224, 368</bibl>; H. D. M&uuml;ller <title>Myth.</title> ii. 338; v. Wilamowitz <title>Hom.

<p>The meaning of the flocks or herds of  the Sun has exercised commentators from the time of Eustathius, who gives Aristotle's explanation that they are an allegory of the lunar year (see Roscher <title>Hermes</title> p. 43 f.). Modern &ldquo;solar&rdquo; mythologists see a reference to physical phenomena&mdash;the clouds, or rays of the sun; see reff. in Preller-Robert i. p. 394, n. 1. That there is a physical basis to the idea of divine flocks, at least in the case of Helios, is very probable. The cattle of Apollo may also be &ldquo;solar&rdquo;; but it should be remembered that Apollo was the protector of all cattle, and, as <quote lang="greek">*no/mios</quote>, he would naturally have his own peculiar herds.

It is, however,  S. of Elis; so that, by adopting the reading of Aristarchus, we should be charging the author with another geographical inaccuracy. Gemoll wisely retains <quote lang="greek">*fera/s</quote>, as there may very well have been a place of that name in W. Greece, as well as in Thessaly (<bibl n="Hom.

Steph. s.v. mentions a Pherae in Aetolia; or more probably the hymn-writer may have meant the Achaean Pharae ( <bibl n="Paus. 7. 22">Paus.vii. 22</bibl>, Strabo 388) which is not much east of Dyme,  and not further from the sea than Elis.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">*(=hsqon tetiho/tes</lemma>: the use of the dual for the plural seems quite established for this hymn; cf. 487 <quote lang="greek">ka/qeton lu/sante, 501 i(/khsqon</quote>. Zenodotus, with Eratosthenes and Crates (schol. A on <bibl n="Hom. Il. 24.282">Il. 24.282</bibl>) recognised this use in Homer (e.g. <bibl n="Hom. Il. 1.567">Il. 1.567</bibl> <quote lang="greek">, *e 487, *q 74, *o</quote> 346), while Aristarchus denied its possibility, arguing that in the text of Zenodotus such dual forms had their proper force, or that the readings were incorrect. Some modern scholars, following Buttmann, have sided with Zenodotus; but general opinion agrees with Aristarchus. The false readings in Homer probably arose, as Monro (<title>Odyssey</title> vol. ii.  App. p. 438) explains, from the fact that the dual number disappeared from the <quote lang="greek">koinh\ dia/lektos</quote>. Hence dual forms in Homer came to be considered as &ldquo;poetic licences,&rdquo; mere equivalents of the plural. Late poets, e.g. <bibl n="Arat. 968">Aratus 968</bibl>, <bibl n="Arat. 1023">1023</bibl>, <bibl n="Apollon. 3.206">Apollonius <title>Arg.</title> 3.206</bibl> (see below 487) and perhaps <bibl n="Hom.

As the duals in the three passages of this hymn cannot be emended without great violence, we must assume that the writer, like Aratus and others, regarded the dual as an archaic variety of the plural.</p>

But lines 464, 465 are merely complimentary; Apollo is now disguised as a young man of noble appearance (449), and the Cretans do not know that he is a god, or that he has any connexion with the previous miracles.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">delfini/w|</lemma>: the cult of Apollo <quote lang="greek">delfi/nios</quote> is certainly old, but its original home is uncertain. The hymn points to a Cretan starting-place, and many scholars have accepted its authority, as the Cnossian cult of Apollo <quote lang="greek">*delfi/nios</quote> (locally <quote lang="greek">*delfi/dios</quote>) is established by inscriptions (see on 393). &ldquo;Mycenean&rdquo; remains have been found at Delphi; and these have been thought to support the theory of a Cretan origin, as such remains are common in Crete (Homolle <title>B. C. H.</title> xviii. p. 195; for Mycenean buildings in Aegina in connexion with the traditional Cretan origin of Aphaea see Bosanquet <title>J. H. S.</title> xxi. p. 347). Even if the particular cult of Apollo <quote lang="greek">*delfi/nios</quote> were proved to be Cretan, it would by no means follow that the worship of Apollo at Delphi was introduced by Cretans; they may have found the god, and have merely added a title. However, it seems improbable that Apollo <quote lang="greek">*delfi/nios</quote> was originally Cretan; A. Mommsen (<title>Heortologie</title> i.) believes that the cult was Chalcidian; and this view has won favour (see v. Wilamowitz in <title>Hermes</title> xxi. p. 105, Maass <title>ibid.</title> xxiii. p. 71, Preller-Robert i. p. 257 n. 4, Frazer on  <bibl n="Paus. 10. 5. 5">Paus.x. 5. 5</bibl>).</p>
<p>We may assume that there is no historical truth in the Cretan theory; as Verrall (p. 11) remarks, the probabilities of migration are all the other way. There were Dorian settlers both at Delphi and in Crete, and the origin of rites or customs, common to both places, would naturally be assigned to Crete, the home of a very old civilization.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">delfi/nios</lemma>: <quote lang="greek">de/lfeios</quote> is an unknown word, the form of which is hardly supported by a Thessalian inscr. <quote lang="greek">tes belfaio</quote>=<quote lang="greek">ta es delfaio</quote> (<title>Ath. Mitth.</title> xxi. p. 249); it may be explained as due to the metrical difficulty in <quote lang="greek">delfi/nios</quote>, just as in Nicand.  <bibl n="Nic. Ther. 238"> <title>Ther.</title>238</bibl><quote lang="greek">qami_no/s</quote> has become <quote lang="greek">qameio/s</quote>. With regard to <quote lang="greek">delfi/nios</quote> the editors raise two objections: (1) that it is unmetrical, (2) that it is unsuitable to the context, and cannot be paired with <quote lang="greek">e)po/yios</quote>. There are two possible solutions of the first difficulty. We may assume <quote lang="greek">delfi^/nios</quote>, in spite of the preceding <quote lang="greek">delfi_ni/w|</quote>: adjectives formed from nouns with gen. in <quote lang="greek">-i=nos</quote> vary in quantity; <quote lang="greek">*)eleusi^/nios</quote> is short, as in <bibl n="HH 2.266"><title>h. Dem.</title> 266</bibl>,   <bibl n="Soph. Ant. 1120">Soph. <title>Ant.</title>1120</bibl>; cf. <bibl n="HH 2.105"><title>h. Dem.</title> 105</bibl> <quote lang="greek">*)eleusi^ni/dao</quote>, while <quote lang="greek">*salami_/nios *traxi_/nios</quote> appear to be always long (see Schulze <title>Quaest. Ep.</title> p. 11). The doubtful quantity of <quote lang="greek">delfi_^/nios</quote> is not therefore impossible; the Doric form is presumably <quote lang="greek">delfi^/dios</quote>, and, although this can hardly be substituted, it may help to account for <quote lang="greek">delfi^/nios</quote>. More probably, however, the <quote lang="greek">i</quote> preserves its length, as in 495, and there is a synizesis of <quote lang="greek">-io-</quote>, which is not very uncommon; cf. <bibl n="Hom. Il. 2.811">Il. 2.811</bibl> <quote lang="greek"> po/li_o_s</quote> (as in <title>Anth. Pal.</title> ix. 569. 4) and other exx. in Christ <title>Metrik</title> p. 29. In 495 <quote lang="greek">delfini/w|</quote> is no doubt quadrisyllabic, as the synizesis forming the quantity - - would be very harsh in the fourth foot, before a pause; but the variation in the two lines is not worse than <quote lang="greek">qeo/s, qe^ou/s</quote> in the same line of Euripides (<title>Troad.</title> 1280).</p>
<p>(2) <quote lang="greek">delfi/nios</quote> and <quote lang="greek">e)po/yios</quote> are not incompatible in sense: the latter is usually translated by &ldquo;conspicuous,&rdquo; but it may rather be active, the &ldquo;over-seer,&rdquo; a title transferred from Apollo himself to his altar, like <quote lang="greek">delfi/nios</quote>. Cf. <quote lang="greek">proo/yios</quote> as a title of Apollo  <bibl n="Paus. 1. 32. 2">Paus.i. 32. 2</bibl>, <quote lang="greek">e)po/pths</quote> of the Sun <title>C. I. G. addend.</title> 4699. The wording of the passage suggests that the altar is to have the same name or names as the god. A harbour of Oropus was also called <quote lang="greek">delfi/nios</quote> (<quote lang="greek">o( i(ero\s limh\n o(\n kalou=si delfi/nion</quote> Strabo 403, see Lolling in <title>Ath. Mitth.</title> x. p. 350 f.), which is a further argument for applying the adj. to the altar on the shore.</p>
<p>On Apollo Delphinius see PrellerRobert <title>l.c.</title>, Pauly-Wissowa art. &ldquo;Apollon&rdquo; 5 and 47, art. &ldquo;Delphinios&rdquo; 2513 f. There can be little doubt that the title is here rightly connected with the dolphin. Apollo, as the patron of mariners and colonization, travelled over many seas in the form of a dolphin; cf.  <title>oneir.</title> ii. 35. As <quote lang="greek">*delfi/nios</quote> he reached Pytho, which drew its later name Delphi from the title.

<p> This verse no doubt contains a &ldquo;prophecy after the event,&rdquo; but the precise allusion has been disputed. It would be natural to see (with Franke) a reference to the First Sacred War. This ended in the destruction of Crisa and its port Cirrha (586 B.C.); see Frazer on  <bibl n="Paus. 10. 7. 2">Paus.x. 7. 2</bibl> and x. 37. 5. But athletic games were then added to the old musical contests (see on 517) by the Amphictyonic League, who assumed the management of the <title>Pythia</title>; and it is scarcely credible that these later games should have been so completely ignored, if they had been known to the hymnwriter. Indeed lines 264 f. prove that chariot-races were then unknown at Delphi. We must therefore either assume that the passage was a later addition to the hymn, or look for some other parties to a conflict. It is possible that there may be an allusion to quarrels between the inhabitants of Delphi (reputed Cretans) who served the temple, and the Crisaeans. According to Strabo 421, in early times the temple was managed by the &ldquo;Delphians&rdquo;; and probably their place was gradually usurped by the Crisaeans, who finally roused the wrath of the Amphictyons, by levying excessive tolls on pilgrims.</p>
<p>Ilgen supposes that the <quote lang="greek">shma/ntores</quote> were the Amphictyons, who had relations with the Delphic oracle at a time certainly preceding the First Sacred War, although the actual date of the beginning of their influence is not recorded; see Holm i. ch. xix. The &ldquo;prophecy&rdquo; would then refer to the loss of prestige and power sustained by the priests, through the interference of the League.

<p>I. <title>Subject and motive.</title>&mdash;The theme is more varied than those of the other great hymns. There is a unity of time, for the action is continuous, taking place in the first two days of Hermes' life; but there is no close unity of subject: the several episodes are not integral parts of a single myth, and the commentators have vainly puzzled themselves to discover one underlying <title>motif</title> to connect the different parts of the hymn. The connexion lies simply in the fact that the episodes all deal with the first exploits of the infant god, and shew how, by his cunning and dexterity, he vindicated his birthright, and won the attributes which distinguished him in maturity.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="TWA">See  II.App. , where the explanation is given at fuller length.</note> Hermes has perhaps the most complex character of any deity in Greek mythology, and the poet has tried to do justice to some, at least, of the god's many qualities. Of these, one of the most characteristic was thievishness. To the Greeks, who too often prided themselves on successful deceit, and who had made lying a fine art, a patron-deity of cunning came natural. Even in the later parts of the <title>Iliad</title> Hermes is known as the Thief; cf. <bibl n="Hom. Il. 24.24">Il. 24.24</bibl>, where the gods urge him to steal the body of Hector. Autolycus is in Homer (<bibl n="Hom. Il. 10.267">Il. 10.267</bibl>) the human representative of the Masterthieves who figure largely in folk-tales; but he learnt his craft  from the divine thief Hermes (cf. <bibl n="Hom.

Additional force is given to these stories of trickery and mendacity, when the rogue is a new-born babe, or is otherwise insignificant; and Mr. Lang well remarks that &ldquo;the poet chiefly revels in a very familiar subject of savage humour (notably among the Zulus), the extraordinary feats and tricks of a tiny and apparently feeble and helpless person or animal, such as Brer Rabbit.&rdquo;<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="TWA">See  II.

Ambrosia</title> 1883); but most of his arguments are of little weight (see on 19, 146, 512), and the origin of Hermes is still a mystery. For the hymn-writer, at all events, Hermes had no connexion with any natural phenomenon; he is purely anthropomorphic.</note> The poet emphasises the deceitful ways of Hermes at the outset of the hymn, in a string of epithets, <quote lang="greek">polu/tropon, ai(mulomh/thn . . . nukto\s o)pwphth=ra, pulhdo/kon</quote> (13 f.). In the same language he sums up the god's character at the end: <quote lang="greek">pau=ra me\n ou)=n o)ni/nhsi ktl.</quote> (577 f.).</l>
<p>The theft of the cattle of Apollo was the most striking myth which exemplified these knavish tricks; and the poet takes this to form the main thread of his narrative. But Hermes was by no means a mere thief; in his higher and more Olympian province he was the messenger of the gods, and a great pastoral deity, especially in local cult. These divine conceptions are recognised at the beginning of the hymn (2 f. <quote lang="greek">*kullh/nhs mede/onta kai\ *)arkadi/hs polumh/lou</quote>,</p>
<l> <quote lang="greek">a)/ggelon a)qana/twn</quote>; and 331 <quote lang="greek">fuh\n kh/rukos e)/xonta</quote>).

<p>But, while Hermes had many specific attributes which differentiated him from all other deities, he had also many points of contact with one member of the Olympian circle&mdash;Apollo.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="TWA">See note on 508.</note> Both were pastoral gods; both were patrons of music, and had prophetic powers, although in this respect the place of Apollo was superior. This close connexion undoubtedly impressed the poet, who gave an explanation common in Greek mythology, that the similarity of attributes was due to an exchange of gifts. Apollo presented Hermes with cattle, and in his turn received  the cithara (498 f.). The poet, too, felt that all forms of prophecy rightly belonged, under Zeus, to the Lord of Delphi. But he knew that, in common superstition, certain processes of divination were under the patronage of Hermes, the god of luck.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="TWA">On Hermes as a god of divination see  <bibl n="Paus. 7. 22. 2">Paus.vii. 22. 2</bibl><bibl n="Paus. 7. 22. 3">Paus., vii. 22. 3</bibl><bibl n="Paus. 9. 11. 7">Paus., ix. 11. 7.</bibl>Preller-Robert i. p. 399 n. 3, Roscher i. 2379 f.: on the Thriae see  III.</note> He App. therefore naturally assumed that these lower powers had been delegated to Hermes from the abundance of Apollo's higher prerogative. Apollo still remained the keeper of the knowledge which Zeus possessed; but he transferred to Hermes the Thriae, with whom he had served an apprenticeship in prophecy (533566).</p>
<p>II. <title>The theft of the cows of Apollo.</title>&mdash;The myth was very ancient, and has been assigned by the &ldquo;solar&rdquo; school of mythologists to the stock of Indo-European stories belonging to the undivided Aryan race.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="TWA">Compare the Vedic parallel, in which Ahi steals the cattle of Indra; PrellerRobert i. p. 394 n. 1. For representations of the theft in art see Roscher i. 2429.</note> It is known to have been related by Hesiod, in the <quote lang="greek">*mega/lai *)hoi=ai</quote>, but no fragment is preserved. Alcaeus handled the same story in a hymn to Hermes, of which only one stanza is extant (<bibl><title>fr.</title> 5</bibl>; cf. <bibl n="Hor. Carm. 1.10">Hor. <title>Od.</title> I. x.</bibl>). In later Greek, the most important version of the myth is in Apollodorus iii. 10. 2. The mythographer deals with an account much resembling the hymn; for the events are the same, although not in the same order. He differs from the hymn in the following details:&mdash;
</p>
<p>(1) Hermes eats some of the flesh: <quote lang="greek">ta\s me\n bu/rsas pe/trais kaqh/lwse, tw=n de\ krew=n ta\ me\n kathna/lwsen e(yh/sas, ta\ de\ kate/kause</quote>.
</p>
<p>(2) Hermes finds the tortoise <title>after</title> stealing the cows. He makes the strings of the lyre <quote lang="greek">e)c w(=n e)/quse bow=n</quote>, not from sheep-gut, as in the hymn.
</p>
<p>(3) Apollo inquires at Pylos, not Onchestus.
</p>
<p>(4) Apollo discovers the thief <quote lang="greek">e)k mantikh=s</quote>.
</p>
<p>(5) Maia shows Hermes to Apollo.
</p>
<p>(6) Apollo desires the <quote lang="greek">su=rigc</quote> also, and exchanges it for <quote lang="greek">th\n dia\ yh/fwn mantikh/n</quote>.</p>
<p>Apollodorus names no authority, and his precise debt to the hymn has been disputed. According to the general view (see Gemoll p. 191), he used the hymn, but supplemented its account  from another (unknown) source. Greve (<title>de h. in Merc. Homerico</title> p. 37) thinks that Apollodorus drew little from the hymn. Some scholars, on the other hand, argue that the hymn was the sole ultimate authority, and that the variations of detail are the invention of the mythographer. Gemoll, who supports this view, believes that these variations partly proceed from carelessness, as (3), partly from a desire to explain or amplify the hymn; e.g. the variant (2) is due to Apollodorus' wish to utilise the cows, and so connect the two incidents of the cithara and the cattlestealing. Gemoll also assumes, with no adequate reason, that Apollodorus used a text with the present lacunae in the hymn. The differences between the two accounts seem too wide to admit the theory that Apollodorus used no other source; indeed, it may be doubted whether he was even at all acquainted with the actual text of the hymn, although he may have borrowed from sources (written or oral) which were ultimately drawn from the Homeric version.</p>
<p>The version of Antoninus Liberalis 23 is confined to the incident of Battus. Hermes steals 12 <quote lang="greek">po/rtias, 100 bo/as a)/zugas</quote>, and a bull from Apollo, and ties branches (<quote lang="greek">u(/lh</quote>) to the tail of each, <quote lang="greek">w(s a)\n ta\ i)/xnh tw=n bow=n a)fani/sh|</quote>. Battus, who was paid by Hermes not to tell, proved false, and was changed into a stone. Ovid ( <bibl n="Ov. Met. 2.676"> <title>Met.</title>ii. 676</bibl> f.) also narrates the story of Battus. The popularity of the myth (in its different forms) is shewn by the list of sources quoted by Antoninus: <quote lang="greek">*ni/kandros e(teroioume/nwn a/, *(hsi/odos e)n mega/lais h)oi/ais, *didu/marxos metamorfwse/wn g/, *)anti/gonos e)n tai=s a)lloiw/sesi, kai\ *)apollw/nios o( *(ro/dios e)n e)pigra/mmasin</quote>.</p>
<p>The geographer Philostephanus, a disciple of Callimachus, dealt with the subject in his <quote lang="greek">peri\ *kullh/nhs</quote> (<title>F. H. G.</title> iii. 28), a book which might have given us much information of which we stand in need. Another Alexandrian, Eratosthenes, in an unnamed work, narrated the birth of Hermes and his theft of his mother's and her sister's clothes, and of Apollo's cows (schol. on <bibl n="Hom. Il. 24.24">Il. 24.24</bibl>), and interpreted the Homeric <quote lang="greek">*(ermei/as a)ka/khta</quote> (Immerwahr <title>l.c.</title> p. 72).</p>
<p>The geography of the two versions represented by the hymn and Antoninus Liberalis is quite different. In the hymn, Hermes passes Onchestus, where he finds the nameless old man corresponding to Battus; thence, by an undefined route, he reaches  the Alphean Pylos (139, 398), near which place he slaughters the cows. Antoninus gives a long itinerary, starting from Phthiotis and ending at the Messenian Pylos; there Hermes hides the cattle in a cave at Coryphasium in which  Nestor had housed his booty (<bibl n="Hom. Il. 11.677">Il. 11.677</bibl>,  <bibl n="Paus. 4. 36. 2">Paus.iv. 36. 2</bibl>). The meeting with Battus took place near Maenalus. Thus a Pylos is mentioned in both versions as in the neighbourhood of Hermes' cave. Probably the original account referred to the Triphylian place of that name; the neighbourhood of the Alpheus is a natural route along which to retire to Cyllene.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="TWA">Cf. <title>Anth. Pal.</title> vii. 390, where a traveller from Pisa to N. Greece is killed by lightning on Cyllene.</note> The view that the Messenian Pylos is original (Preller-Robert i. p. 392 n. 2) rests on O. M&uuml;ller's very doubtful theory that the stalactites in a cave at this place were thought to be the skins of the beasts slaughtered by Hermes (see on 124 f.). The cave, on the northern slope of Coryphasium, is described by Frazer (who accepts M&uuml;ller's explanation) on  <title>l.c.</title> But it is clear from 398 that Hermes' cave was near the Alpheus. The cave of Hermes is mentioned also in  <title>Lithica</title> 18 and 55.</p>
<p>The site of the Triphylian Pylos is unidentified, but is defined by Strabo 343 fin. <quote lang="greek">kata\ tau=ta de/ pws ta\ i(era\</quote> [that of Poseidon at Samicum and of Athena at Scillus] <quote lang="greek">u(pe/rkeitai th=s qala/tths e)n tria/konta h)\ mikrw=| plei/ous stadi/ois o( *trifuliako\s *pu/los o( kai\ *lepreatiko/s, o(\n kalei= o( poihth\s h)maqo/enta</quote>. The coast south of the Alpheus is sandy and largely covered by lagoons (see the references given on <bibl n="HH 3.424"><title>h. Apoll.</title> 424</bibl>), and this suits the wording of the hymn.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="TWA">If the poet was a Boeotian, or an Eretrian, his geography of the northern part of Greece ought not to be merely imagination: and the &ldquo;sandy shore of the sea&rdquo; along which Hermes passed after leaving Olympus should correspond to something in reality. The coast between Pieria and the sea southward to the Peneius appears from Leake <title>Northern Greece</title> iii. c. 30 to possess quicksands and lagoons in places. The description, however (in the hymn), would suit any flat coast; see on 79 f.</note> The town, with its cave, was obscured in later days by the Messenian Pylos.</p>
<p>III. <title>Place of composition.</title>&mdash;As in the case of nearly all the hymns, the place of composition is doubtful. There are a certain number of Atticisms, and usages of forms and words which approach to the style of the Attic tragedy.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="3" resp="TWA">Baumeister (p. 203) and Gemoll (p. 193) quote, amongst others, <quote lang="greek">o)/rh 95, e)ma/rane 140, e)/doca 208, e)du/nw 405, filw=</quote> 382. None of these forms need be exclusively Attic; at least one (<quote lang="greek">qa=tton</quote> 255) is known to be also Boeotian; see note <title>ad loc.</title></note> Some of these forms  may be due to scribes familiar with the Attic dialect; others may be common to other dialects, and only testify to a comparatively late time of composition. There is really nothing in the hymn which suggests Athenian composition, and much which distinctly negatives such an idea. Besides numerous reminiscences of Homer, which are a feature in all the hymns, there are many lines which show the influence of Hesiod in a marked degree (cf. 10, 19, 30, 36, 67, 76, 80, 98, 106, 110, 120, 124, 236, 243, 415).</p>
<p>Possibly the commentators have been too chary of suggesting a locality; at all events, a very good case can be made out in support of a Boeotian origin. The influence of Hesiod points in this direction, although of course this fact is inconclusive, as Hesiod, like Homer, early became the property of all the Greeks. But the part played by Onchestus, which does not appear in the other versions, is more striking; the mention of this place seems motiveless, except on a supposition of Boeotian influence. There appear to be traces of local dialect in <quote lang="greek">a)qro/a^s</quote> 106, the elision of <quote lang="greek">i</quote> in <quote lang="greek">per' i)gnu/si 152, qa=tton</quote> 255, and in <quote lang="greek">h(xou=</quote> 400, on the analogy of <quote lang="greek">h(xoi=</quote> in an Oropian inscription.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="TWA">See Pref. p. lxxiii, where this theory is advanced on philological and other grounds. Fick <title>B. B.</title> xxii. 272, principally on account of <quote lang="greek">h(xou=</quote>, calls the writer an Euboean Ionian.</note></p>
<p>In any case we may reject Fick's earlier suggestion (<title>B. B.</title> ix. p. 201) that the poem was originally composed, in old Ionic, at Colophon in Asia, for the festival of Apollo Clarius. His view that Apollo, not Hermes, is the real &ldquo;hero&rdquo; utterly misconceives the spirit of the hymn.</p>
<p>IV. <title>Date.</title>&mdash;The date is equally uncertain, but there is every reason to believe, with the consensus of scholars, that the poem is later than the rest of the longer hymns. Hermann and Baumeister point out that there is no living digamma, although, as usual, there is often hiatus in the case of words originally digammated (Hermann <title>Orph.</title> p. 689). See also Eberhard <title>die Sprache der hom. Hymn.</title> ii. p. 34 f., and n. on 92; Pref. p. lxix. Definite evidence of date has been sought for in the mention of the seven-stringed cithara (51). The adoption of seven in place of four strings is usually ascribed to Terpander (see Flach <title>Gr. Lyr.</title> i. 195), who was an old man in  <bibl n="Pind. O. 26"> Ol.26</bibl>=676 B.C.; Smyth <title>Melic Poets</title> p. 165 (but see Timotheus  <bibl n="Aesch. Pers. 237"> <title>Pers.</title>237</bibl>). Even  if this form of the cithara is older than Terpander, who probably only modified the scale (Smyth <title>l.c.</title>), it is highly probable that the hymn is much later than that poet. As Gemoll remarks (p. 193), the hymn-writer could not have attributed the seven strings to Hermes, had not the cithara been long established in that form. On the other hand, the hymn does not approach the childishness of the <title>Batrachomachia</title> (attributed to Pigres, <date value="-480"><foreign lang="la">circ.</foreign> 480</date>, by Plutarch and Suidas), nor to the comic effects of fourth-century parody; still less is it Alexandrian. It is excellent and vigorous literature of an early period, and its cynical and quasi-parodic style make it unique. Its language is in places prosaic,<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="TWA">See on <ref target="cp4l313" targOrder="U">313</ref>, <ref target="cp4l316" targOrder="U">316</ref>.</note> but a high flight of poetic fancy would be foreign to the theme. The moral tone appears low when judged by modern standards&mdash;as low, perhaps, as that of the Lay of Demodocus (see <title>h. Aphr.</title> Introd.). But this was no stumbling-block to the average Greek, who acquiesced in gods made after his own image. The hymn-writer, in fact, frankly represents the popular religion; he is no opponent of it, like Euripides, nor scoffer, like Lucian. His Hermes may be akin, in some respects, to the gods of Comedy; but the character is far removed from the sorry figure of the Aristophanic Hermes in the <title>Plutus.</title></p>
<p>V. <title>Influence on later literature.</title>&mdash;With all its merits, the hymn seems to have made little or no impression on later Greek literature, and it is rarely cited as an authority, even where some reference might be expected. Pausanias, who quotes from the hymns to Apollo and Demeter, ignores it, and in referring to the myth of cattle-lifting, mentions only the hymn of Alcaeus (viii. 20. 4). The silence of Apollodorus is still more significant; it appears that the authority of the Homeric hymn was overshadowed by Alcaeus and Hesiod in the <title>Eoae.</title> The account of the invention of the cithara is equally neglected.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="TWA">See also on 24 f., 47 f.</note> Euripides speaks of the lyre as the gift of Hermes to Apollo; it by no means follows, however, that he knew the hymn, as Gemoll supposes (see on 416). In Alexandrian times, Aratus and Nicander mention the myth, but their accounts seem independent of the hymn, and the scholia on Nicander make no allusion to it. Callimachus, who certainly knew the hymn to Apollo, appears to owe  nothing to the style and language of the present hymn.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="TWA">Ruhnken <title>ep. crit.</title> i. p. 28 instances 524 (where see note); Guttmann <title>de h. Hom. historia</title> p. 7 f. can only add 20, which has practically no resemblance to <bibl n="Call. Dian. 25">Callim. <title>h. Art.</title> 25</bibl>.</note> The direct citation of a line (51) by Antigonus of Carystus (iii.-ii. cent. B.C.) is quite exceptional.</p>
<p>As an example of modern appreciation, it may suffice to mention Shelley's well-known translation, which, of course, does full justice to the poetry of the original, although, as Prof. Mahaffy remarks (<title>Greek Lit.</title> i. p. 150), it perhaps accentuates the comic element too strongly.</p>
<p>V. <title>State of the Text.</title>&mdash;The usages of its language make the hymn very difficult; there are a certain number of verbal corruptions, but not a single line need be omitted or transposed. The ingenuity of the higher criticism is largely wasted, although the commentators have been particularly active in dissecting the document. On the other hand, the interruption of sense in several places requires lacunae; and this is in itself more probable on graphical grounds than theories of interpolation or addition, not to say transposition.</p>
<p>1-9. These lines, with a few unimportant variations, form a short hymn to Hermes (xviii), where see note.

<p>47-51. Invention of the lyre. The word <quote lang="greek">lu/rh</quote>, which is not Homeric, only once occurs in the hymn (423), which elsewhere uses <quote lang="greek">ki/qaris</quote> (499 etc.) and <quote lang="greek">fo/rmigc</quote> (64, 506). Moreover the expression in 423 <quote lang="greek">lu/rh| d' e)rato\n kiqari/zwn</quote> shews that at this time the three names could be applied indifferently to one instrument. For the difference between the lyre and cithara see Guhl and Koner (Engl. Trans. p. 201 f.), Smith <title>Dict. Ant.</title>, art. &ldquo;Lyra&rdquo; (Monro). The later cithara seems to have been developed about the time of Pindar. It is curious that the more recent word <quote lang="greek">lu/ra</quote> was afterwards confined to the primitive tortoise-shell instrument; according to Monro, &ldquo;the later form of the cithara was developed gradually, retaining the original name, which therefore included all varieties, until the new word <quote lang="greek">lu/ra</quote> came into vogue for the commoner and more primitive kind.&rdquo;</p>

<l>. Neither account need have been borrowed from the hymn; and Lucian's version (<title>dial. deor.</title> vii.) is almost certainly unconnected with it, as he makes Apollo a lyre-player before Hermes found the tortoise.  <bibl n="Bion 9.8">Bionix. 8</bibl><quote lang="greek">w(s xe/lun *(erma/wn, ki/qarin w(s a)/nus' *)apo/llwn</quote>, also differs from the hymn; so <bibl n="Call.

Schulze points out that <quote lang="greek">kata\ d' e)/mpalin</quote> is only relative to the cows: &ldquo;he walked the reverse way (to them)&rdquo;; cf. <quote lang="greek">katenanti/on</quote>. That the explanation is correct is proved by 211 <quote lang="greek">e)copi/sw d' a)ne/erge ka/rh d' e)/xon a)nti/on au)tw=|</quote>. Ilgen compares the behaviour of Commodus, Herodian v. 6. Again, Hermann very needlessly objects to the cows walking backwards, as they were driven &ldquo;by crooked ways.&rdquo; However the &ldquo;backing&rdquo; of the cows is undoubtedly genuine; cf. 211, 221, 345. Hermes is trying to make assurance doubly sure. For this device cf. the story of Cacus,   <bibl n="Verg. A. 8. 210">Verg. <title>Aen.</title>viii. 210</bibl>, Livy i. 7, Auct. orig. gent. vi. 2,   <bibl n="Ov.

<p>79, 80. The principal difficulty in these lines is that the MSS. give two finite verbs (<quote lang="greek">e)/riyen</quote> 79, and <quote lang="greek">die/pleke</quote> 80) without connexion. To introduce this, <quote lang="greek">au)ti/ka</quote> has usually been attacked, as it was omitted in the archetype of <title>x</title>; the lacuna, however, is purely clerical, and gives no ground for suspicion. <quote lang="greek">e)/riyen</quote> is further difficult to explain, for Hermes was not now casting off his shoes, as in 139, but putting them on. Hence Matthiae conjectured <quote lang="greek">e)/rayen</quote>, an excellent word, were it not identical with <quote lang="greek">die/pleke</quote>. Postgate's brilliant suggestion <quote lang="greek">r(iyi/n</quote> supplies a word very suitable to the context, and at the same time abolishes the first verb. The Homeric form is <quote lang="greek">r(i/pessi, e</quote> 286. The word and form are sufficiently rare to make corruption easy. These <title>skis</title> had a real use along the sandy coast between the mouth of the Alpheus and the Triphylian Pylos (for this district see on <bibl n="HH 3.424"><title>h. Apoll.</title> 424</bibl>). So on his return journey (139) Hermes throws them into the Alpheus. The writer, however, whether from imperfect geographical knowledge or from natural epic vagueness, imagines the route between Pieria and Onchestus (79) and the neighbourhood of Cyllene to be sandy; and Apollo states that the first part of Hermes' journey was <quote lang="greek">dia\ yamaqwde/a xw=ron</quote> (350). By this he may have meant the coast below Olympus or nearer Boeotia (Introd. p. 132). For a historical parallel see Arrian quoted on 83.

<p> The editors find difficulties in these lines, and eject either 97, 98 or 99, 100. Gemoll objects that morning cannot be breaking while Hermes has still so much to do: he steals the cattle at sundown 68, comes to the Alpheus at moonrise 99, and finally reaches home in the early morning 143 (cf. 155 <quote lang="greek">po/qen to/de nukto\s e)n w(/rh| e)/rxh|</quote><title>;</title>). Moreover, the German scholars argue that one of these two pairs of verses must be spurious, as the moon would not rise in the early morning on the fifth of the month, the day after Hermes was born (cf. 19). This minute criticism may be chronologically and astronomically correct, but it is of no great value in dealing with a hymn in which the blame for such inconsistencies is to be laid on the writer, rather than on a supposed interpolator. Wolfe's poem on <title>The Burial of Sir John Moore</title> affords an exact parallel: the line <title>By the struggling moonbeam's misty light</title> has been shewn to be inaccurate, as the moon was invisible at the time of the burial (Ball <title>Story of the Heavens</title> p. 51); but it has yet to be suggested that the line was &ldquo;interpolated.&rdquo; See further on 141.

<p> The genealogy of Selene, daughter of Pallas, the son of Megamedes, is confined to this hymn. According to  <title>Theog.</title> 371 f., Selene is the daughter of Hyperion and Theia.</p>
<p>With regard to Pallas, Gemoll rightly rejects a connexion with Arcadian myths, in the person of Pallas the founder of Pallantium ( <bibl n="Paus. 8. 3. 1">Paus.viii. 3. 1</bibl>). This hero was son of Lycaon ( <bibl n="Apollod. 3.8.1">Apollod.iii. 8. 1</bibl>), and could scarcely be related to Selene. The Hesiodean Pallas (a Titan) was son of Crius (<title>Theog.</title> 375 f.) and grandson of Uranus (<title>Theog.</title> 134). The brother of this Pallas, Perses, was father of Hecate (cf. <title>Theog.</title> 377 and 409), and Gemoll suggests that, if Pallas is related to Hecate, he may also be readily connected with Selene. This is probable enough, although the two goddesses are quite distinct in Hesiod. Nothing is known of Megamedes, who here takes the place of the Hesiodean Crius, but there seems no reason to deny his existence; see Mayer <title>die Giganten</title> p. 67.

On his return (139) he throws his shoes into the river, when they ceased to be useful. The mention of the Alpheus fixes Pylos as the Triphylian or Lepreatic. The site of this place was lost even in antiquity, but it is generally placed on the hills looking over the lagoons and sandhills which extend from the mouth of the Alpheus southwards.

<p> O. M&uuml;ller thinks that the writer refers to a stalactite cave, now called <quote lang="greek">to\ sph/laion tou= *ne/storos</quote>, near the Messenian Pylos, the formation of which suggested the skins. The view is attractive, and is accepted by Baumeister and Frazer. In one of the caves at Cheddar there is a stalagmite configuration which closely resembles a curtain; at Adelsberg (Austria) there are stalactites in the form of drapery. But the theory breaks down if the reference is to the Triphylian, not to the Messenian Pylos (see Introd. p. 132); at least there is no known stalactite cave in that region. D'Orville first suggested (see <title>J. P.</title> xxv. p. 254) that these were actual skins, preserved as relics. As Gemoll notes, the skins were probably exhibited <title>outside</title> the cave, which would negative the theory of stalactites (see below). Instances of such relics are quoted in <title>J. H. S.</title> xvii. p. 257 (e.g. the skin of Marsyas,  <bibl n="Hdt. 7. 26">Herod.vii. 26</bibl>); to these may be added  <title>Quaest.

<p>The reason why Hermes, although <quote lang="greek">kreiw=n e)rati/zwn</quote> (64), refrains from eating is not evident. Robertson Smith (<title>Rel. Sem.</title> rev. ed. p. 306) remarks that Hermes is called <quote lang="greek">boufo/nos</quote> (436, where see note), and that &ldquo;the story seems to be one of the many legends about the origin of sacrifice.&rdquo; The present passage, however, appears only to allude to the institution of sacrifice to the twelve gods, with special reference to Hermes' inclusion in the number (see on 128). Further, although Robertson Smith proves the sanctity of oxen in early times, it does not seem that the idea is present here. The sanctity would be violated by killing as well as by eating oxen; whereas Hermes has no scruple in killing, but only refrains from  eating. The passage may imply that Hermes was unwilling to eat the flesh of <title>any</title> animal; he was honoured <quote lang="greek">libanwtoi=s kai\ yaistoi=s kai\ popa/nois</quote> Theopomp. ap. Porphyr. <title>de abst.</title> ii. 16 (at Methydrion); milk and honey were offered to him (cf. <title>Anth. Pal.</title> ix. 72, 318 and 744). It is true that animals were also sacrificed to Hermes, e.g. a ram (Sauppe <title>die Myster. von Andania</title>, ausgew&auml;hlte Schrift. p. 274), and a goat at Eleusis (<title>C. I. A.</title> i. 5), cf. a vase in the  B. M. (Cat.ii. B 362), and victims were offered at Cyllene (Gemin. <title>elem. astr.</title> i. 14); so in Homeric times <bibl n="Hom. Od. 19.398">Od. 19.398</bibl> (lambs and goats); but the local ritual recorded by the writer may have demanded a bloodless sacrifice. Otherwise we must accept Gemoll's explanation that Hermes is humorously placed in an awkward predicament: he has sacrificed to the twelve gods, and is now about to begin his meal, like a human sacrificer; but he remembers in time that he is himself one of the twelve, who have to be content with the savour of sacrifice, without its substancc.</p>

<p>157-159.

    <p> If this line is corrupt, as is usually supposed, no convincing emendation has yet appeared. The commentators (except Gemoll) assume that <quote lang="greek">knw/dalon</quote> disguises an adjective, with <quote lang="greek">ge/ronta</quote>, or a substantive, as object of a participle after <quote lang="greek">eu(=re</quote>. With regard to this participle, it is clear that <quote lang="greek">ne/monta</quote> will stand if <quote lang="greek">knw/dalon</quote> is sound; if not, some other verb is required, as <quote lang="greek">ne/mein e(/rkos</quote> makes no sense. In <title>J. H. S.</title> xvii. p. 259 the manuscript reading was defended: <quote lang="greek">knw/dalon</quote> usually connotes some sort of monster (e.g. a serpent), but it is used of beasts in general in  <title>Theog.</title> 582, and of beasts of burden or draughtanimals in  <title>P. V.</title> 478,   <bibl n="Pind. P. 10">Pind. <title>Pyth.</title>x. 36.</bibl>It is not out of keeping with the style of this hymn to take it here of &ldquo;his ox or his ass,&rdquo; probably of the latter. While the old man was at work (<quote lang="greek">batodro/pe 190, e)/skapton</quote> 207), he let graze (<quote lang="greek">ne/monta</quote>) his &ldquo;beast&rdquo; by the roadside <bibl n="Pind.

Gemoll, who alone of the editors defends the text, understands <quote lang="greek">ne/mein</quote> to take a double acc., &ldquo;letting his beast graze on the fence,&rdquo; which may have been a hedge (cf. <quote lang="greek">batodro/pe</quote>), although in <bibl n="Hom.

Cyrop. 3. 2. 20">Xen. <title>Cyr.</title>iii. 2. 20</bibl> is no parallel. The alternative (suggested in <title>J. H.

The parody is not a more violent perversion of Homeric usage than <quote lang="greek">pi/ona e)/rga</quote> 127. Possibly, however, <quote lang="greek">e(/rkos</quote> is a corruption of <quote lang="greek">e)kto/s</quote> (cf. <bibl n="HH 5.159"><title>h.

Cf.   <bibl n="Aristoph. Kn. 639"> <title>Eq.</title>639</bibl>(with Neil's note). An <title>accidental</title> sneeze would also be lucky; the humour lies in the fact that it is intentional.

Il. 2.99">Il. 2.99</bibl> (Ariston. <quote lang="greek">e)n ta/xei</quote>), v. 279. This sense suits the passage: Hermes now wishes to get done with the business; cf. 320. The words could not imply his haste in keeping pace with Apollo, <title>non passibus aequis</title>; at least in 321 Hermes leads. Possibly, however, <quote lang="greek">spoudh=|</quote> may mean &ldquo;seriously,&rdquo; no longer in jest, as often in post-Homeric Greek; cf. <quote lang="greek">spoudai=on</quote> (332), a &ldquo;serious&rdquo; thing.</p>
<p>305, 306. The lines are difficult; <quote lang="greek">e)ligme/nos</quote> is a <title>vox nihili</title>, and <quote lang="greek">e)elme/nos</quote> cannot be regarded as certain. The editors mostly correct to <quote lang="greek">e)elme/non</quote> or another acc. partic., agreeing with <quote lang="greek">spa/rganon</quote>; but it is most improbable that an original acc. should become a nom. It is just possible to take <quote lang="greek">e)elme/nos</quote> absolutely: Hermes &ldquo;pushed with his hands the clothes up to both his ears, round his shoulders, huddled up&rdquo; (in the wraps). The clothes had fallen off his head while he was being carried by Apollo; they are now rearranged. On the whole it seems almost necessary to alter <quote lang="greek">e)elme/nos</quote>. The variant <quote lang="greek">e)ligme/nos</quote> points to a corruption; the original may have been <quote lang="greek">ei)lume/nos</quote>, which, however, has escaped alteration in 245, <bibl n="HH 3.450"><title>h. Apoll.</title> 450</bibl>; <quote lang="greek">spa/rganon</quote> would be taken <quote lang="greek">a)po\ koinou=</quote> with <quote lang="greek">e)w/qei</quote> and <quote lang="greek">ei)lu/menos</quote>. In any case <quote lang="greek">par)</quote> must mean &ldquo;up to&rdquo;; not, as suggested in <title>J. H. S.</title> xv. p. 290, &ldquo;<title>down</title> past,&rdquo; as if Hermes now uncovers his head. This sense of <quote lang="greek">para/</quote> is not justified by such passages as   <bibl>Plat. <title>Symp.</title> iv. 23</bibl><quote lang="greek">para\ ta\ w)=ta a)/rti i)/oulos kaqe/rpei</quote>, where the meaning is really inherent in the verb.</p>
<p>It would be possible to suggest that <quote lang="greek">par' . . . e)w/qei</quote> = <quote lang="greek">parew/qei</quote>, governing <quote lang="greek">a)/mfw ou)/ata</quote>, i.e. he &ldquo;pushed back both his ears,&rdquo; by rubbing his cheeks; cf. <bibl n="Hom.

<l> <quote lang="greek">kai/ r() a)pomo/rcato xersi\ pareia\s fw/nhse/n te</quote> (see below 361). But the expression, if physically accurate (the flat of the hands being moved away from the eyes across the cheeks), is at least curious, without some further explanation to shew that rubbing the eyes is intended. Otherwise the sense would be excellent: Hermes now pretends to wake up at last. With this translation <quote lang="greek">spa/rganon</quote> must be governed by the participle <quote lang="greek">ei)lume/nos</quote> (<quote lang="greek">e)elme/nos</quote> would be less suitable); for the construction cf. 151.

<p>541-549. Matthiae and others have curiously assigned this passage to Hermes; Ludwich prints it after 474. At first sight, indeed, the lines appear more suited to the character of Hermes, as described in 576 f. But the view is certainly wrong; the sentiment is quite appropriate in the mouth of Apollo. No objection should have been raised to the futures <quote lang="greek">dhlh/somai</quote> etc.: Apollo means to do as he has always done; the tenses refer to the frequent deception of the oracles, down to the hymn-writer's own day. The tone of his speech sounds like a frank confession of deceitfulness; and, as such, would not be inconsistent with the general spirit of the hymn. The poet need not have been more careful of Apollo's morality than he was in the case of Hermes. But the explanation of the occasional deception in oracles is probably meant to be serious; it might stand as an official vindication of the god in his dealings with men. Stress is laid on the observance of the proper ritual, without which inquirers approach the god at their risk. If they are duly accredited with the right omens, a true answer is obtained; cf. (of Dodona) <bibl>Hes. <title>fr.</title> 134</bibl>. Rzach=schol. ap.   <bibl n="Soph.

<p><title>Subject.</title>&mdash;Aphrodite has power over gods and men alike, and over all the birds of the air and the creatures that move on the earth or in the waters. Athene, Artemis, and Hestia alone are free from her influence. But she constrains even Zeus to love mortal maids. He therefore, in his turn, set passion in her heart, so that she might love a man, and might not boast of her conquest over the gods. So she loved Anchises, who tended the flocks on Ida. First she went to Paphos, and adorned herself in her temple; thence she came to Ida, followed by a train of wild animals in whom she inspired passion. The hymn then describes her meeting and union with Anchises, the subsequent revelation to him of her divinity, and her announcement that a son would be born whose name should be Aeneas. She prophesies that this child and his descendants shall sit upon the throne of Ilium. After warning Anchises not to boast of her love, lest Zeus should strike him with a thunderbolt in anger, she departs to heaven.</p>
<p><title>The myth of Aphrodite and Anchises.</title>&mdash;The germ of the story handled by the hymn-writer is found in Homer <bibl n="Hom. Il. 2.820">Il. 2.820</bibl> <quote lang="greek"> *ai)nei/as</quote>,  <quote lang="greek">to\n u(p' *)agxi/sh| te/ke di=) *)afrodi/th</quote>,</p>
<l> <quote lang="greek">*)/idhs e)n knhmoi=si qea\ brotw=| eu)nhqei=sa</quote>. Hesiod (<title>Theog.</title> 1008-1010) follows Homer. Compare also <bibl n="Hom. Il. 5.313">Il. 5.313</bibl>, where the statement is added that Anchises was tending the herds; this is copied by later accounts (<bibl n="Theoc. 20">Theocr. xx. 34</bibl>, <bibl n="Prop. 2.32">Prop. ii. 32</bibl>, <bibl n="Prop. 2.35">35</bibl>,  <title>Dion.</title> xv. 210 f.). The myth was related by Acusilaus ap. schol. <bibl n="Hom. Il. 20.307">Il. 20.307</bibl> (who makes Anchises elderly, <quote lang="greek">parhkmakw/s</quote>, at the time) and Apollodorus (iii. 142), who seems to have ignored the hymn; in his version Aphrodite visits Anchises <quote lang="greek">di) e)rwtikh\n e)piqumi/an</quote>, while the hymn-writer lays stress on the agency of Zeus (45 f.). The mythographer names two children of the union&mdash;Aeneas and Lyros. In the same passage (iii. 141) Apollodorus follows the later account that Ganymede was carried off <quote lang="greek">di) a)etou=</quote><title>;</title> in the hymn (202 f.) a whirlwind takes the place of the eagle. See further Rossbach in Pauly-Wissowa s.v. Anchises (2107 f.). It is remarkable that so graceful a hymn should have made little or no impression on later literature;<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="TWA">For its possible influence on the hymn to Demeter see below, p. 198.</note> it is not cited by any ancient writer, nor is there any certain mark of imitation by the Alexandrines.</l>
<p><title>Character of the poem.</title>&mdash;The hymn has often been compared with the &ldquo;Lay&rdquo; of Demodocus on the love of Ares and Aphrodite (<bibl n="Hom. Od. 8.266">Od. 8.266</bibl> f.). There can be no doubt that the author was acquainted with the lay (see notes on 58 f., 234). But the resemblance is confined to language; for the moral tone of the hymn is far higher than that of the Olympian society depicted by Demodocus. Baumeister (p. 250) misunderstands the character of the hymn in remarking that Aphrodite is represented as <title>Vulgivaga</title>, a lascivious goddess who rejoices in the base love with which she inspires the gods. Against this view Gemoll (p. 258) rightly points out that Aphrodite shews shame and modesty. Her passion for Anchises is no wantonness, but has been forced upon her by Zeus. The poet treats the adventure with considerable frankness, indeed, but not without dignity; and the note of humour and raillery, which is sounded in the Odyssean lay and the hymn to Hermes, is entirely absent. The merits of the poem have been perhaps extravagantly lauded by some critics, but have been unfairly depreciated by others. There may be some inelegance (according to modern taste) in repetitions such as that of <quote lang="greek">e)/rgon</quote>, used five times in 1-16; but these blemishes,  which are collected by Suhle,<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="TWA"><title>De hymn. Homerico iv</title>, 1878, p. 23. A. and M. Croiset (i. p. 590) think the poem too long for the subject.</note> do not justify that scholar's verdict that the writer is a <title>permediocris poeta.</title> It is true that there is little originality in work which follows the Homeric language so closely (see below, p. 198); but credit at least is due to an imitator who has successfully caught the spirit as well as the letter of the old epic. The scene of Aphrodite's progress to Ida (67 f.) is finely picturesque; and the whole poem, in Mr. Murray's words,<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="TWA"><title>Anc. Greek Lit.</title> p. 50.</note> &ldquo;expresses perhaps more exquisitely than anything else in Greek literature that frank joy in physical life and beauty which is often supposed to be characteristic of Greece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poet's conception of Aphrodite is simple. She is mistress over the whole world of animal life (2-6); but the hymn gives no hint of a deity who inspires the whole Cosmos&mdash;an Aphrodite Urania, by whose agency

<p><bibl>Aesch. <title>fr.</title> 41.</bibl></p>
<p>Such an idea of the universal love-goddess doubtless grew up, as Mr. Farnell remarks (p. 699), on eastern soil; but in Greek literature it found no full expression until the time of Attic tragedy (e.g. <bibl>Eur. <title>fr.</title> 89</bibl>), and later, of the Orphic hymns (cf. <title>Orph. h.</title> lv. 4).</p>
<p><title>Date.</title>&mdash;The date of the hymn, as of the others, is very doubtful. Hermann calls it <title>Homeri nomine dignissimum</title>, and some have even thought it contemporary with the <title>Iliad</title> and <title>Odyssey.</title> Windisch<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="3" resp="TWA"><title>De hymnis Homericis maioribus</title>, 1867 (p. 68).</note> thinks it as old as the later parts of the <title>Odyssey</title>; Thiele<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="4" resp="TWA"><title>Prolegomena in h. in Ven.</title>, 1872 (p. 49).</note> assigns it to the time of the <title>Cypria.</title> Others (e.g. Eberhard<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="5" resp="TWA"><title>Sprache der hom. Hymnen</title> ii. p. 34.</note>), without urging so early a date, consider the hymn to be the oldest in the collection. On the other hand, Suhle<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="6" resp="TWA"><foreign lang="la">  Op.cit.</foreign> p. 27.</note> believes that the author may have been a contemporary of the Pisistratids, or even of Sophocles. This view is extreme; but it will hardly be disputed at the present day that the hymn is later than the earliest parts of the <title>Odyssey.</title> The theory of great antiquity rests mainly on the fact that the hymn is <quote lang="greek">o(mhrikw/tatos</quote> in diction. As many as twenty verses are taken from Homer  with little or no variation; and the poem abounds in epic hemistiches and formulas. But this only proves that the author was a diligent student of the Homeric poems, while there are a number of words and usages which are not Homeric (a full list is given by Suhle p. 16 f.).</p>
<p>Reminiscences of Hesiod are scattered through the poem (5, 14, 29, 108, 258, etc.). Still more remarkable is the close connexion between this hymn and that to Demeter. The two hymns have, in common, several words, or uses of words, which do not occur elsewhere in extant Greek literature: 31 <quote lang="greek">tima/oxos</quote> (<bibl n="HH 2.268"><title>h. Dem.</title> 268</bibl>), 157 <quote lang="greek">eu)/strwtos</quote> (<bibl n="HH 2.285"><title>h. Dem.</title> 285</bibl>), 257 <quote lang="greek">baqu/kolpos</quote>, applied to nymphs (<bibl n="HH 2.5"><title>h. Dem.</title> 5</bibl>), 284 <quote lang="greek">kalukw=pis</quote> (<bibl n="HH 2.8"><title>h. Dem.</title> 8</bibl>), which only reappears in the Orphic hymns. Some striking expressions are also confined to the two hymns: 156 <quote lang="greek">kat' o)/mmata kala\ balou=sa</quote> (<bibl n="HH 2.194"><title>h. Dem.</title> 194</bibl>), 173 <quote lang="greek">mela/qrou ku=re ka/rh</quote> (<bibl n="HH 2.188"><title>h. Dem.</title> 188</bibl>). Unfortunately, scholars are not agreed as to the question of borrowing. Some (e.g. Abel) hold that the writer of the hymn was the imitator; Gemoll and others think it scarcely doubtful that the hymn to Aphrodite is the older. The latter view seems the more probable. In that case, it may well be at least as old as the seventh century B.C.</p>
<p><title>Place of composition.</title>&mdash;If the date of the poem is uncertain, the place of composition is not less obscure. According to Groddeck, who is followed by various scholars, including Abel and Fick (<title>B. B.</title> ix. p. 200), the hymn is Cyprian. It is pointed out that Aphrodite is called the goddess of Cyprus in 2, 292, and the rare word <quote lang="greek">sati/nas</quote> in 13 is supposed to be Cyprian. No argument, however, can be based on the occurrence of the title <quote lang="greek">*ku/pris</quote>, which is Homeric, and, like <quote lang="greek">*kuqe/reia</quote>, belongs to the common stock of divine epithets (cf. vi. 2 and 18; x. 1 <quote lang="greek">*kuprogenh= *kuqe/reian</quote>). The Cyprian origin of <quote lang="greek">sati/nh</quote> is also very dubious (see on 13); and in any case a word used by Anacreon and Euripides need not be considered distinctly &ldquo;local,&rdquo; even in early poetry.</p>
<p>Others (Matthiae, O. M&uuml;ller, etc.) place the home of the author in Asia Minor, and believe the poem to have been recited in honour of a chieftain who claimed descent from Aeneas. But the hymn bears no trace of having been composed for a definite occasion, or in honour of a particular person. The allusion of the revived Trojan kingdom in 196 f. is quite vague, and is  merely a reminiscence of the Homeric tradition. Many, without committing themselves to the &ldquo;Trojan&rdquo; theory, believe that the author was an Ionian, or at least lived in Asia Minor. This is as likely as the Cyprian view, and as equally incapable of proof. The myth handled by the poet is not local, but Homeric; the love of Aphrodite and Anchises was famous wherever Homer was known. The language may be &ldquo;very pure Ionic&mdash;almost Homeric-Greek,&rdquo; but it does not follow that the composer was an Asiatic, as Prof. Mahaffy argues (<title>Hist. Greek Lit.</title> i. p. 148). At a time when the epics had become the property of the whole Greek-speaking world, the author of such a hymn might have belonged to any branch of the Hellenic stock. The further argument of those who see a contamination of Aphrodite with the Asiatic Cybele is unsound. It is true that Aphrodite was probably, in the Troad, another form of Cybele (Farnell p. 641), and as a nature-goddess had power over all the brute creation; but the hymn-writer is influenced by the Homeric conception of the goddess, and for Homer Aphrodite is far removed from Cybele. As Gemoll observes, the goddess is called a daughter of Zeus, and her train of beasts is a mere imitation of the animals which follow Circe (see on 69).</p>
<p><title>State of the text.</title>&mdash;The general unity of the hymn is so obvious that it has suffered little from the &ldquo;higher criticism.&rdquo; The Germans, for the most part, have been content to expunge isolated lines. One passage&mdash;the description of the nymphs&mdash;was suspected by Groddeck and Ilgen (260-274). The lines are perhaps the most interesting in the poem, and there is absolutely no valid ground for denying them a place in the original document. Hermann's theory of a double recension cannot be neglected; but such a recension, if it existed, has left but slight traces; cf. notes on 97 f., 274 f.

But there is no good reason for suspicion; the poet alludes to the legend of Cronus, who disgorged his children in an order inverse to that in which he had swallowed them ( <title>Theog.</title> 495 f.) Hestia, who was the eldest child, was swallowed first and disgorged last. She could be said to have a second birth, as much as Dionysus, who was born again from the thigh of Zeus. This curious mention of Hestia as the &ldquo;eldest and youngest&rdquo; is perhaps connected with the custom of pouring libation to her at the beginning and end of a feast; see xxix. 5.

<p> The wooing of Hestia by Poseidon and Apollo is not elsewhere mentioned. The myth, as Gemoll suggests, may be an invention of the poet himself. There is no ground for supposing any physical meaning with Preller and Baumeister. Welcker's explanation is more satisfactory, that Poseidon and Apollo stand for the highest suitors; Hestia would not accept any proposal. There was a group of Poseidon, Amphitrite, and Hestia at Olympia ( <bibl n="Paus. 5. 26. 2">Paus.v. 26. 2</bibl>), a conjunction of deities which may have a physical origin, but has certainly nothing to do with the present myth.

<div2 id="cp5l188" type="commline" n="188">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)men*hno/n</lemma>: the idea that union with a goddess would deprive a man of his vigour is perhaps, as Gemoll suggests, borrowed from the story of Circe, <bibl n="Hom. Od. 10.301">Od. 10.301</bibl> <quote lang="greek"> mh/ s' a)pogumnwqe/nta kako\n kai\ a)nh/nora qei/h|</quote> and <foreign lang="la">ib.</foreign> 340 f. There, however, Circe is a sorceress, not an ordinary goddess. In Homer, the lovers of goddesses have to fear the jealousy of the gods, not danger from the goddesses themselves. Calypso, who is not married to a god, does no harm to Odysseus. But Artemis and Zeus slay  Orion and Iasion the lovers of Eos and Demeter (<bibl n="Hom. Od. 5.121">Od. 5.121</bibl> f.). Tithonus, too, is the victim of divine jealousy. In folklore the same notion appears in the jealousy with which the fairies regard one of their own number who has loved a mortal.</p>
<p>In these cases the underlying idea is that union with a mortal is disgraceful for a goddess, as the superior being. But the explanation of a <quote lang="greek">fqo/nos qew=n</quote> does not apply to many instances of the wide-spread belief that these mixed unions are disastrous. Probably the superstition often springs from a vague fear of the supernatural, like the belief &ldquo;that no man may see God and live.&rdquo; In northern Europe the love of a nymph or giantess was thought to bring death or misfortune to a mortal (EltonPowell <title>Saxo</title> p. lxiv); the natives of New Caledonia think that intercourse with a supernatural being is deadly (see Lang in Kirk's <title>Secret Commonwealth</title> p. xxxi and other exx. in his trans. of the hymns p. 42). Istar's lovers come to an unhappy end; Gilgamesh therefore rejects her overtures (Jastrow <title>Religion of Babylonia</title> p. 482, Sayce <title>Religion of Anc. Egypt and Bab.</title> p. 434). According to Frazer <title>G. B.</title> iii. p. 162 f. the story of Gilgamesh points to the union of a divine pair, of which the male died every year. But this explanation is inapplicable to many examples of the superstition.</p>
<p>In the present passage the writer adopts the Homeric view of the <quote lang="greek">fqo/nos qew=n</quote>, as is plain from 288. But he may also have a confused idea of the essential danger in such a union, as he makes Aphrodite promise that <title>neither she</title> nor any of the gods will hurt Anchises (194 f.).

<head>HYMN TO APHRODITE</head>
<p>THIS slight hymn was composed for a contest (19, 20), but there are no distinctive marks either of date or locality. Baumeister's theory of a Cyprian origin is as likely as any other, but cannot be proved from line 2, <quote lang="greek">h(\ pa/shs *ku/prou krh/demna le/logxen</quote> (see <title>h. Aphr.</title> Introd. p. 198). The mention of the Cyprian Aphrodite is purely literary, and the title would be familiar to any Greek audience. The rhapsodist was certainly acquainted with Hesiod (see on 1, 3, 5, 12, 19), and no doubt also with the <title>Cypria</title>, where there occurs a similar description of the adornment of the goddess (see on 5). Indeed it would have been remarkable if the author of a hymn to Aphrodite had not been influenced by an epic in which she played so large a part. On the other hand, as Gemoll notes, there is no clear trace of any debt to the longer hymn to Aphrodite. The writer also obviously borrows from <quote lang="greek">*c</quote> (see on 8, 14) and other parts of Homer, so that Baumeister is hardly too severe in speaking of him as <title>rhapsodus inops ingenii.</title> No great originality was looked for in a short and formal prelude.

<p><title>The myth in literature and art.</title>&mdash;The story of Dionysus and the pirates, which is the subject of this hymn, was a favourite theme in classical literature. There is an allusion to the myth in   <bibl n="Eur. Cycl. 11">Eur. <title>Cycl.</title>11</bibl>, where the Tyrrhenians are said to be inspired by Hera. Ovid (<bibl n="Ov. Met. 3.582"><title>Met.</title> iii. 582-691</bibl>) and Nonnus (<title>Dion.</title> xlv. 105-168) describe the adventure of Dionysus at considerable length; and shorter accounts are given by Apollodorus iii. 5. 3, Hyginus  <bibl n="Hyg. Fab. 134"> <title>fab.</title>134</bibl>, <title>poet. astron.</title> ii. 17 (after the <title>Naxica</title> of Aglaosthenes), Seneca  <bibl n="Sen. Oed. 449"> <title>Oed.</title>449</bibl>-466, and Nonnus <title>Dion.</title> xliv. 240-249. Servius on   <bibl n="Verg. A. 1. 67">Verg. <title>Aen.</title>i. 67</bibl> closely follows Hyginus. Oppian (<bibl n="Opp. H. 1.650"><title>Hal.</title> i. 650</bibl>) mentions the transformation of men into dolphins by Dionysus. It cannot be proved that any of these versions depend on the Homeric hymn; Ovid and Nonnus handle the legend after their characteristic methods, and certain similarities of expression (noted in the commentary) are probably due to the choice of subject, the broad outlines of which did not admit much variation of treatment.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="TWA">For a full discussion of the various versions see Crusius p. 218 f.

With regard to extant monuments, the metamorphosis of the pirates (the culminating point of the myth) does not appear in any vase-paintings; for, as Miss Harrison shews (after Gerhard), the celebrated <title>cylix</title> of Execias has no connexion with the Tyrrhenians. On this vase Dionysus is depicted as sitting in a ship, from the mast of which springs a vine loaded with grapes. The vacant space round the ship is filled by seven dolphins. But the vine simply indicates the sacred ship which played a part in the cult of Dionysus, while the dolphins are a conventional indication of the sea, as often on coins.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="TWA">See Harrison <title>op. cit.</title> p. 252; the vase is reproduced on p. 251, and by Lang p. 213; first in Gerhard <title>A. V.</title> pl. xlix.</note> The god of wine, whose cult spread over all the Aegean and its coasts, was early associated with the sea,<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="TWA">On Dionysus <quote lang="greek">pela/gios</quote> see PrellerRobert i.^{2} p. 678; Maass <title>Hermes</title> xxiii. p. 70 f.; Roscher 1084; Crusius p. 215; Frazer on  <bibl n="Paus. 9. 20. 4">Paus.ix. 20. 4.</bibl></note> and it was his journey from isle to isle that doubtless suggested the possibility of his capture, and the consequent manifestation of his might by sea as well as on land. The dolphins, which Greek sailors often saw sporting round their vessels (see <bibl n="HH 3.496"><title>h. Apoll.</title> 496</bibl>), would readily suggest a metamorphosis of actual sailors who had offended the god.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="3" resp="TWA">For other explanations of the myth see Voigt in <bibl>Roscher's <title>Lex.</title></bibl>, and Crusius (p. 217), who thinks that it refers to the victory of Dionysus over fish-like seagods, with an accretion of historical elements united at Brauron.</note></p>
<p>In painting, there is a record by Philostratus (<title>Imag.</title> i. 19) of a picture in which a Tyrrhenian ship is attacking the sacred vessel of Dionysus and his Maenads. The metamorphosis has begun, and the god's ship is covered with ivy and vines. The introduction of a naval battle is evidently a later invention, when the myth was accommodated to other stories of Dionysus' prowess in war; cf. Lucian <title>dial. mar.</title> 8 (Crusius p. 223).</p>
<p>It appears, therefore, that the well-known choregic monument of Lysicrates (B.C. 334) is the sole extant work of art illustrating the myth. A detailed description of the frieze is unnecessary; it may be sufficient to point out that artistic requirements have considerably modified the myth. The scene is laid, not in a ship, but on the sea-shore; there is thus no place for the pilot or for the vines and ivy. Dionysus sits at ease on a rock playing with a panther, while the Tyrrhenians are punished by a band of Satyrs. Some of the pirates are being beaten with the  <title>thyrsus</title>, others are leaping into the sea, half transformed into dolphins.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="TWA">The frieze has been frequently reproduced, e.g. M&uuml;ller- Wieseler <title>Denkm&auml;ler</title> i. pl. 37; Harrison p. 248; Mitchell <title>Anc.

<p><title>Style of the hymn.</title>&mdash;Groddeck and Baumeister, followed by Abel, trace the influence of dithyrambic poetry in the theme and treatment of the hymn; but the debt, if any, is not easily estimated. The formula <quote lang="greek">a)mfi/ tina a)ei/dein</quote> is not confined to the dithyramb (see on 1), and the harsh transitions, in which Baumeister sees a mark of dithyrambic haste (44, 54), are due rather to unpolished workmanship. For, although the hymn is a valuable and interesting document, it is hard to dissent from Gemoll's judgment that its artistic merits have been generally overrated. Gemoll remarks on the carelessness of the writer in using the particle <quote lang="greek">de/</quote> seven times in 4-10.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="TWA">Crusius, however, notes that this repetition of <quote lang="greek">de/</quote> has many parallels; e.g. it occurs seven times in as many lines, <bibl n="HH 2.38"><title>h. Dem.</title> 38</bibl>-44; add xxxiii. 8-17 (seven times).</note> Nothing is said about the scene of the event; the description of the bear created by Dionysus (46) is at least clumsy, even if it is partly justified as one of the signs by which the god shews his power. It may be added that there is an obvious improbability in the indifference shewn by all the crew, except the steersman, after the god has miraculously freed himself from his bonds (see on <bibl n="HH 2.188"><title>h. Dem.</title> 188</bibl>). Ovid, more careful of artistic propriety, makes the steersman conjecture the divinity of the captive from his general appearance only; Bacchus performs no miracle until it is too late for repentance.</p>
<p><title>Date of the hymn.</title>&mdash;The general uncertainty in dating most of the hymns is strikingly exemplified in the case of the present poem, for the composition of which the critics have suggested various periods down to the third or fourth century A.D. This late date has been advocated by Ludwich, who believes the hymn to be a work of the Orphic school and closely related to the <title>Argonautica</title>, which passed under the name of Orpheus. Ludwich draws attention to the following points of similarity between the two poems: (1) both are characterised by extreme rapidity of diction, and by numerous words expressing haste (e.g. <quote lang="greek">ta/xa&mdash;qow=s&mdash;ta/xa&mdash;ai)=ya</quote>, <title>Hom. h.</title> 6-9; <quote lang="greek">ma/l' w)=ka&mdash;qoh/&mdash; e)peigome/nh</quote>, <title>Arg.</title> 268-270. For a full comparison see Ludwich p. 61-67). It may be replied that adverbs, etc., denoting haste  or swift transition, are common in epic poetry (e.g. <bibl n="Hom. Il. 18.525">Il. 18.525</bibl>-532, compared by Crusius), and <quote lang="greek">ta/xa, au)ti/ka, ai)=ya</quote>, and the like are especially frequent in hymnic literature; the hymn to Hermes affords many examples (see on <bibl n="HH 4.70"><title>h. Herm.</title> 70</bibl>). (2) Ludwich remarks on a general resemblance in diction between the hymn and the <title>Argonautica</title> (p. 68, 69). None of these parallels, however, are very striking, and all are &ldquo;Homeric,&rdquo; and may therefore have been modelled independently on epic originals (see further on 2).</p>
<p>(3) The position of the hymn in the collection&mdash;next to the hymn to Ares&mdash;is thought to be a sign of Orphic origin. The eighth hymn is undoubtedly late, but not necessarily Orphic (see Introd.); in any case the argument is of little value, as it would apply equally to the ninth hymn, which is certainly not Orphic. The style of the hymn to Dionysus, which is a pure narrative poem, is quite foreign to the religious tone of the hymn to Ares. The latter cannot be adduced as evidence for the date or origin of any other hymn.</p>
<p>If there is no strong argument in support of Ludwich's theory, there is equally little reason to follow Gemoll, who places the hymn (doubtfully) in the Alexandrine period. As evidence of lateness he instances <quote lang="greek">au)to/n</quote> (22), the use of <quote lang="greek">o(/de</quote> (19, 27), <quote lang="greek">e)rei=</quote> (30), <quote lang="greek">e)ka/qhto</quote> (14), the dat. plur. in <quote lang="greek">ois</quote> (5, 12, 16, 21), the art. in <quote lang="greek">tw=| e)mw=|</quote> (55). Some of these usages are perfectly regular, at least in the later parts of the genuine epic (see on 22, 55); and there is nothing in the language which need not belong to a date far higher than that of the Alexandrines. The double title <quote lang="greek">*dio/nusos h)\ lhstai/</quote> (in DELIIT) reminds us of similar alternatives in Theocritus and Herondas; but this title is not given by M, and is probably a later addition. Nor is there any proof that such titles were first adopted by the Alexandrines. In style, the hymn has little in common with the works of Callimachus or the hymnic idylls of Theocritus; its simplicity and directness of expression, which often pass into abruptness, differentiate it from any characteristic product of the Alexandrine age. This will appear from a comparison between the hymn and the idyll of Theocritus, which deals with the fate of Pentheus (xxi); the subject&mdash;the might of Dionysus and the punishment of Pentheus&mdash;is similar to the theme of the hymn; but the latter is quite free from the affectation of rare or &ldquo;precious&rdquo; words (<quote lang="greek">malopa/rhos, e)quma/rei</quote>, etc.) that mark the  Alexandrine work. The hymn-writer's disregard of all superfluous details is in strong contrast to the fuller and more &ldquo;literary&rdquo; compositions from which Ovid drew his inspiration.</p>
<p>The hymn has also been referred to the fifth or fourth century, with no great probability.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="TWA">So Murray (<title>Anc. Gr. Lit.</title> p. 50), who curiously miscalls the hymn a &ldquo;fragment.&rdquo;</note> The chief argument for this date, based on the youthful form of Dionysus, is of no value (see on 3). There is, in a word, no reason to separate the hymn from the rest of the collection (the hymn to Ares and possibly one or two others being excepted), or to deny it a place in the literature of the sixth or even the seventh century B.C.</p>
<p><title>Place of composition.</title>&mdash;There is no internal evidence pointing to any special country, and the efforts to localise the hymn have not been fruitful. Several scholars, however (Welcker <title>Ep. Cycl.</title> i. p. 367; Baumeister p. 339; Chudi&nacute;ski p. 9; Christ <title>Handbuch der klass. Alt.</title> vii.^{2} p. 63), have argued for an Attic origin, and this view has been upheld with some confidence by Crusius (p. 204 f.). It is suggested that the hymn served as a prelude at the Brauronian festival of Dionysus, in which rhapsodists recited the <title>Iliad</title> (Hesych. s.v. and  Clearch. ap. Athen. vii. 275 B=<title>F. H. G.</title> ii. p. 321). Crusius lays stress on the legend that Tyrsenian pirates carried off Attic women from Brauron ( <bibl n="Hdt. 6. 138">Herod.vi. 138</bibl>), and he sees in the sole extant representation&mdash;the monument of Lysicrates&mdash;a proof that the myth was peculiarly  He Attic. suggests that the bear created by Dionysus is Brauronian, as Attic maidens at the festival were called <quote lang="greek">a)/rktoi</quote> (but see on 46). The arguments may be plausible, but there is really no more reason to attribute the hymn to the Athenians than to almost any other branch of the Hellenic race. The myth itself may have arisen in Naxos; later accounts, at least (Aglaosthenes, Apollodorus, Ovid), connect it with the island; and it is not impossible that the hymn is also Naxian.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="TWA">Chudi&nacute;ski (p. 9) holds that the hymn, though Athenian, was due to Naxian influence.</note>

In any case the present passage is no indication of lateness, for, as Bergk notes, the god only assumes the form of a youth for the occasion; the transformation is on Homeric analogy. Moreover it is probable that the young Dionysus was familiar to poetry for many years before the art-type was created (see Sandys,   Eur. <title>Bacch.</title>p. xcix f.). The hymnwriter does not conceive of the god as effeminate and voluptuous, but as the ideal of a young Greek athlete with broad shoulders (5) like Telemachus, <bibl n="Hom.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">*tursh*noi/</lemma>: first in a suspected passage of Hesiod (<title>Theog.</title> 1016). According to  <bibl n="Hdt. 1. 57">Herod.i. 57</bibl> and 94, the Tyrsenians were ancient Pelasgic inhabitants of Thrace; Thucydides (iv. 109) places them in Lemnos and Athens. They had a reputation as corsairs, if we may judge from their rape of women at Brauron; Crusius notes that a similar story was told at Samos (Athen. xv. 672). Most scholars assume that the hymn refers to these obscure Tyrsenians, who are rarely mentioned in ancient literature. It is barely possible that the Etruscans are meant (as Chudi&nacute;ski holds, p. 9); pirates from Etruria were a terror to the early colonists in Italy and Sicily, from the seventh century (probably) down to their defeat by   Hieroin 474 B.C. (Mommsen i. ch. x.). But, although their name became proverbial for piracy, it is difficult to account for their presence in an early Greek hymn, which appears to have no connexion with the colonies of Sicily or Magna Graecia. It seems therefore better to follow the common explanation. Nonnus (<title>Dion.</title> xv. 104) naturally understands the Tyrsenians to be Etruscans, and Philostratus (<title>Imag.</title> i. 19) speaks of <quote lang="greek">*turrhnoi/</quote>, obviously Etruscans; but this proves nothing for the original myth.

<head>HYMN TO ARES</head>
<p>IT is evident that this hymn is quite removed from the style and tone of the other hymns in the collection. Ruhnken, Hermann, and a large majority of the older scholars assigned it a place among the Orphic poems. Matthiae, indeed, thought it to be nearer akin to the philosophic works of Cleanthes and Proclus; and parts of the hymn seem to shew the influence of the latter poet (see on 6, 10). Recent students of the <title>Orphica</title> refuse to class it in the Orphic category (Maass <title>Orpheus</title> p. 198, Abel <title>Hom. Hymns</title> p. 91, who dates it as &ldquo;in or after the age of Nonnus,&rdquo; Adami p. 223 f.). The accumulation of epithets is of course a marked characteristic of the Orphic school; but it is pointed out that this feature is not confined to the <title>Orphica</title> (Maass and Adami, <title>l.c.</title>; see on <bibl n="HH 2.18"><title>h. Dem.</title> 18</bibl>). There is, however, little or nothing in the hymn to distinguish it from the acknowledged works of the Orphics; as Gemoll remarks, the first half is exactly in their style, and the prayer that Ares may remove <quote lang="greek">kako/ths</quote> is really a prayer for peace, similar to that in <title>Orph. h.</title> lxv (see on 12, 16). The inference is that the writer, if not a genuine &ldquo;Orphic,&rdquo; was at least steeped in the literature of that sect.</p>
<p>The cause which led to the inclusion of this hymn among &ldquo;Homeric&rdquo; poems is by no means evident. According to one view, the compiler of the collection was ignorant of the very plain distinction between an Orphic and an Homeric hymn. In this case Gemoll argues that the present form of the collection must belong to a very late age; for the Alexandrines, who knew some of the short hymns, would have had more critical acumen than to confuse the two kinds of hymns, even if the hymn to Ares  were not later than the Alexandrine period. According to another theory, the presence of the hymn is caused by the juxtaposition of Homeric and Orphic poems in a manuscript, which led to the misplacement of one hymn.</p>
<p>If the presence of the hymn is not due to this purely accidental cause, the compiler of the collection must have had some reason for the choice of this particular hymn. It may be suggested that he was influenced by mythological considerations. The cult of Ares was of so little importance, that it would not be surprising if no genuine Homeric prelude in honour of the god were ready to hand. The compiler, however, may have been anxious that his collection should not lack mythological completeness; he was therefore compelled to search further afield for recognition of Ares' claims. On this supposition, it is not necessary to argue that he was destitute of critical ability; he may have allowed a sense of religious obligation to outweigh literary fitness.

<p>THE hymn is no doubt Ionic, and it is obvious to suggest that the composer was a rhapsodist at Claros.

Nor is it impossible that the prelude was recited at a common festival of Apollo and Artemis (Baumeister); but we have no proof that such a festival existed, although there are Colophonian coins of Apollo <quote lang="greek">*kla/rios</quote> and Artemis <quote lang="greek">*klari/a</quote>, dating from imperial times (Head <title>Hist.

The two deities, however, are not represented together on this coinage (see also Farnell <title>Cults</title> ii. p. 532); and the reference to the Clarian Apollo may have a mythological rather than a ritualistic significance (see on 5 and xxvii. 13 f.).</p>

<head>HYMN TO ATHENA</head>
<p>THIS and the following hymn have no formula of transition to a rhapsody. Hence it is very doubtful whether the hymn was a prelude at a recitation at Athens or elsewhere. The cult of Athena <quote lang="greek">polia/s</quote> or <quote lang="greek">poliou=xos</quote> was common to many Greek states (Farnell <title>Cults</title> i. p. 299).

The suggestion (Ebeling, Gemoll) that the word is <title>non boni ominis</title>, &ldquo;making cities to fall,&rdquo; cannot be entertained. The first part of the word must be connected with <quote lang="greek">e)ru/omai</quote>, &ldquo;protect,&rdquo; although Leaf suggests that the original form was <quote lang="greek">r(usi/ptolis</quote> (so schol.

<p>The epithet recalls Athena <quote lang="greek">poliou=xos</quote> (Pauly-Wissowa &ldquo;Athena&rdquo; 1946). The reference to <quote lang="greek">perqo/menai po/lhes</quote> (3) does not negative this view; Athena goes forth with her own people (4) to sack the enemy's city.

<head>HYMN TO THE MOTHER OF THE GODS</head>
<p>THE goddess commonly identified by the Greeks with Rhea and the Asiatic Cybele was almost certainly in her origin Hellenic, and was widely worshipped, from early times, as simply <quote lang="greek">mh/thr qew=n</quote>. At Athens, for example, her cult was important, in the <quote lang="greek">*mhtrw=|on</quote> (see Frazer on  <bibl n="Nep. Paus. 1. 3. 5"> <title>Paus.</title>i. 3. 5</bibl>, Harrison <title>M. M. A. A.</title> p. 43 f.). The absence of a personal name (Rhea or Cybele) is therefore no indication of a late date. Nor is there any question of Orphic influence in the hymn. Two Orphic hymns are dedicated to the goddess; one (xiv) mentions <quote lang="greek">*(re/a</quote> by name, the other (xxvii) calls her the Mother of the Gods. Whatever the date of the present hymn, it is far removed from the spirit of the Orphic compositions, and, as Baumeister remarks, is quite &ldquo;Homeric.&rdquo;

<head>HYMN TO HERACLES THE LION-HEARTED</head>
<p>As the epithet <quote lang="greek">leonto/qumon</quote> is not elsewhere known in classical literature, Baumeister thinks that the present title is due to the Byzantines.

The variations in the titles of other hymns (xiii, xiv, xxiii, xxv, xxx, xxxiii) may have originated at a much earlier period. In any case the possible lateness of the title would prove nothing for the hymn itself, the date of which is quite uncertain.</p>
<p>Baumeister's view that the hymn is Attic (as Heracles was first worshipped in Attica,  <bibl n="Diod. 4. 39">Diod.iv. 39</bibl>) is a mere hypothesis.

<head>HYMN TO HERMES</head>
<p>THE shorter hymn to Hermes is merely an abstract from the longer, as is the case with the preceding hymn to the Dioscuri. Gemoll notices that the subject of both these abbreviated versions is confined to the birth of the gods. Further, as the hymn to Asclepius (xvi), which also stops at his birth, must be old (see Introd.), Gemoll concludes that xvii and xviii belong to the same age as xvi. This reasoning seems to be sound, and we may therefore reject Baumeister's theory that the present hymn was compiled <title>a grammatico nescio quo ingenioli ostentandi causa.</title></p>
<p>The three hymns are to be considered as equally genuine products of antiquity, although their precise date cannot be decided. But the reason for the existence of the two abbreviations (xvii and xviii) is not obvious. The original hymn to Hermes (iv) is of course far too long to have served as a prelude to an ordinary recitation of epic poetry; it would therefore be natural to suppose that xviii was an abstraction for the use of rhapsodists. But the original hymn to the Dioscuri (xxxiii) hardly exceeds the limits of the usual preludes, and it is hard to see why it should have been further shortened. Perhaps even a hymn of moderate compass came to be thought excessive by rhapsodists who were anxious to begin the actual recitation. The prelude had become a mere convention, just as a few bars of <title>God save the King</title> are now taken to represent the entire national anthem at the conclusion of a play.</p>

<p><title>Subject and style.</title>&mdash;The hymn to Pan, with its keen appreciation of Nature and its sympathy with the free open-air life of the field and mountain, has a freshness and charm peculiarly attractive to a modern reader. The poem, though a hymn in form, is an idyll in spirit&mdash;a picture, or rather a series of pictures, with landscapes of snowy peaks and rocky ways, and meadows where the crocus and fragrant hyacinth are intermingled with the grass. In all the scenes Pan is the central figure, alone, or with his attendant nymphs: Pan the hunter, roaming over the snowy hills, or among the thick bushes, or along the gentle streams; Pan the musician, making sweet melody beside the dark fountain in the dusk, or joining in the dance of Oread nymphs. Nowhere, perhaps, in Greek literature has the love of the country found clearer expression than in this hymn, which challenges comparison with the chorus to Pan in the <title>Helena</title>,<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="TWA">  <bibl n="Eur. Hel. 167">Eur. <title>Hel.</title>167</bibl>-190.</note> or with the seventh idyll of Theocritus. &ldquo; Eur. Itis assuredly&rdquo;&mdash;to quote a fine critic&mdash;&ldquo;the voice of no small poet which breathes through this lovely hymn.&rdquo;<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="TWA">Palgrave <title>Landscape in Poetry</title> p. 16.</note></p>
<p><title>Date of the hymn.</title>&mdash;It is to be regretted that so interesting a poem cannot be dated with any certainty. On one point, however, scholars are substantially agreed&mdash;that the hymn is one of the latest in the collection, and that it could hardly have been composed before the age of Pindar at the earliest. The evidence of mythology, if not conclusive, strongly supports this consensus of opinion. It is true that Pan is one of the oldest creations of Greek folklore, being (as Mannhardt has shewn) the representative in Greece of the numerous wood-spirits who appear in a semi-caprine form.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="TWA">Mannhardt <title>A. W. F. K.</title> ch. iii.; Frazer <title>G. B.</title> ii. p. 261 f. The old theory, recently revived by Immerwahr (<title>Kulte u. Myth. Ark.</title> i.) and B&eacute;rard (<title>de l'Origine des cultes Arc.</title>), that Pan was a sun-god, cannot be accepted; see a review of the latter work in <title>Class. Rev.</title> ix. p. 71, <bibl>Roscher <title>Lex.</title> 1405</bibl>. Pan is simply a shepherd-god made by the Arcadians with their own characteristics.</note> But the old Arcadian woodspirit and shepherd-god had no place in the &ldquo;higher mythology&rdquo; of Homer and Hesiod, and scarcely won any recognition in literature before the Persian wars. Until that period he was probably ignored by cultivated Greeks (outside Arcadia), and hence Herodotus was led to infer that Pan was one of the most recent of Hellenic deities (ii. 145). In Pindar he is a mere attendant of the <quote lang="greek">*mega/lh *mh/thr</quote> ( <bibl n="Pind. P. 3"> <title>Pyth.</title>iii. 77</bibl>, <bibl><title>fr.</title> 6. 1</bibl> <quote lang="greek">*matro\s mega/las o)pade/</quote>). The first reference to the god is quoted from Epimenides, who called Pan and Arcas the twin-sons of Zeus and Callisto (schol. on <bibl n="Theoc. 1">Theocr. i. 3</bibl>, schol. on <bibl n="Eur. Rh. 36"><title>Rhes.</title> 36</bibl>). It is difficult to believe that a hymn which shews so developed a conception of Pan's nature and of his place in the Greek mythological system could have been the product of the seventh or early sixth century, in which all other literature passes over the god in silence. Pan is equally neglected in Greek art until the beginning of the fifth century (<bibl>Roscher <title>Lex.</title> 1407</bibl>).</p>
<p>On the other hand, the hymn does not appear to be Alexandrine, as various critics have suggested.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="TWA">Guttmann (<title>de Hymn. Hom. hist. crit.</title>), Sittl <title>L. G.</title> i. p. 199, Gemoll (p. 334), Murray <title>Anc. Greek Lit.</title> p. 50.</note> Forms such as <quote lang="greek">ti/sh</quote> (2), <quote lang="greek">to/qi</quote> (25), <quote lang="greek">*(ermei/hn</quote> (28), <quote lang="greek">w)/n</quote> (32), <quote lang="greek">xe/ra</quote> (40) are instanced by Gemoll as &ldquo;late&rdquo;; they are of course foreign to the oldest epic, but there is little or nothing in the language which cannot be paralleled in the genuinely ancient hymns. Usages such as <quote lang="greek">nu/mfh</quote> for &ldquo;daughter&rdquo; (34), <quote lang="greek">tiqh/nh</quote> &ldquo;mother&rdquo;  (38), are also unknown in Homer; but there is no reason to see in them a mark of Alexandrine affectation. There are a large number of <quote lang="greek">a(/pac lego/mena</quote> (<quote lang="greek">filo/krotos 2, xoroh/qhs 3, a)glae/qeiros, a)nake/klomai 5, au)xmh/eis 6, mhlosko/pos 11, ligu/molpos 19, teratwpo/s</quote> 36); all these, however, are simple and straightforward, and may well belong to an early stage of the language. The hymn reads like the product of a good period (perhaps the fifth century), and Ludwich is probably correct in refusing to see any traces of Alexandrine workmanship.</p>
<p><title>Place of composition.</title>&mdash;The hymn treats of an Arcadian god, and mentions his birth on Cyllene; but the cult of Pan became the common property of the Greeks from the beginning of the fifth century, or a little earlier, so that there is no internal evidence of locality. Baumeister and Wilamowitz (<title>aus Kydathen</title> p. 224) suggest an Athenian origin; all that can be said in favour of this theory is the fact that Pan became a favourite at Athens after the battle of Marathon, when his cult, if known before to the Athenians, was first officially organised.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="TWA"> <bibl n="Hdt. 6. 105">Herod.vi. 105</bibl>, <bibl>Simonid. <title>fr.</title> 133</bibl>; Harrison <title>M. M. A. A.</title> p. 538 f. ; Milch&ouml;fer <title>A. Z.</title> 1880, p. 214.</note></p>
<p>The further suggestion of Baumeister, that the hymn served as a proem to Homeric recitations at the Panathenaea, is mere guess-work. It may be sufficient to remark that, if the hymn is Athenian, it could not have been composed at a time when the memory of the Persian defeat was fresh. There is no mention of the familiar part which the god played in the war, or of the &ldquo;panic&rdquo; which he caused at Marathon. His character in the hymn is entirely pacific; he is a hunter, but no warrior.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="TWA">Barnes' <quote lang="greek">ai)xmhth/n</quote> for <quote lang="greek">au)xmh/enq)</quote> (6) scarcely deserves record as an emendation.</note></p>
<p><title>Integrity of the hymn.</title>&mdash;The unity of the poem is sufficiently obvious, although the <title>motif</title> does not lie in a single episode, as in the hymns to Demeter, to the Delian and Pythian Apollo, and to Aphrodite (see  II. App. p. 311); and there is no question of interpolated lines. An attempt to disintegrate the hymn was made by Groddeck, who divided it into two parts, the first (1-27) relating to Pan and the Nymphs, the second (28-47) describing the birth of the god. Groddeck thought that the narrative languished in the latter half; to this Ilgen rightly replied that the comparative failure of interest is due to the subject, not to a different composer. Further, Groddeck argued that the birth of Pan should have  been described at the beginning; he did not realise that the birth was the subject of the nymph's song, and that the Homeric hymns afford two exact parallels to the order of the narrative. In <bibl n="HH 4.59"><title>h. Herm.</title> 59</bibl> Hermes sings of his own birth, and in <title>h. Art.</title> (xxvii) an account of Artemis at the chase is followed by a mention of the song describing the birth of Apollo and Artemis, while the goddess herself, like Pan, directs the chorus.</p>
<p>Peppm&uuml;ller divides the hymn into &ldquo;nomic&rdquo; parts: <quote lang="greek">a)rxa/</quote> (1-7), <quote lang="greek">katatropa/</quote> (8-26), <quote lang="greek">o)mfalo/s</quote> (27-47), <quote lang="greek">e)pi/logos</quote> (48-49).

<head>HYMN TO HEPHAESTUS</head>
<p>THE fact that Hephaestus and Athena were joined in a common cult at Athens, and (as far as is known) in no other Greek city, gives colour to Baumeister's suggestion that this hymn is Athenian. The two deities were worshipped together as patrons of all arts and crafts; the shops of braziers and ironmongers were near the temple of Hephaestus, in which stood a statue of Athena ( <bibl n="Paus. 1. 14. 6">Paus.i. 14. 6</bibl>), and the festival called Chalceia was sacred to both (see Frazer <title>l.c.</title>, Harrison <title>M. M. A. A.</title> 119 f.; Preller-Robert i.^{1} p. 180 and 209). According to Plato (<title>Critias</title> 109 C), Athena and Hephaestus, <quote lang="greek">filosofi/a| filotexni/a| te e)pi\ ta\ au)ta\ e)lqo/ntes</quote>, became joint patrons of Attica; cf. <bibl>Solon <title>fr.</title> 13</bibl> (quoted <ref target="cp20l5" targOrder="U">on 5</ref>) and other references in Farnell <title>Cults</title> i. p. 409 f. Athena was <quote lang="greek">*)erga/nh</quote>, the Worker; but in a wider sense she was the giver of all civilization; Hephaestus, the Fire-god and the divine smith, gave men the skill (<quote lang="greek">kluto/mhtin 1, klutote/xnhn</quote> 5) which differentiated them from wild beasts. Aeschylus, indeed, attributes these gifts of civilization to Prometheus; but the importance of the Titan was mainly mythological; in practical cult Hephaestus appropriated most of the credit (see Sikes and Willson on  <title>P. V.</title> p. xix f.).</p>
<p>But this aspect of Athena and Hephaestus was by no means exclusively  Athena Attic. was the patron of arts in Homer (<bibl n="Hom. Il. 5.61">Il. 5.61</bibl> <quote lang="greek">, u</quote> 78), and under titles such as <quote lang="greek">*)erga/nh, *kalli/ergos</quote>, and <quote lang="greek">*maxani=tis</quote>, she was worshipped in many parts of Greece (Farnell <title>Cults</title> i. p. 314 f.). In Hesiod she instructs Pandora, the creation of Hephaestus, in weaving ( <bibl n="Hes. WD 60"> <title>Op.</title>60</bibl> f.); see further <bibl n="HH 5.12"><title>h. Aphr.</title> 12</bibl> f. We may therefore fairly look for Epic rather than Athenian influence in the mythology of this hymn.

<head>HYMN TO ZEUS</head>
<p>IN this hymn Baumeister sees Orphic influence, comparing <title>Orph. h.</title> lxii. 2 (of <quote lang="greek">*di/kh</quote>), <quote lang="greek">h(\ kai\ *zhno\s a)/naktos e)pi\ qro/non i(ero\n i(/zei</quote>,</p>
<l> <quote lang="greek">ou)rano/qen kaqorw=sa bi/on qnhtw=n polufu/lwn</quote>. But the close connexion of Zeus with Dike or Themis is frequent in Greek poetry, and this hymn appears to be not less &ldquo;Homeric&rdquo; than its predecessors (xx-xxii).</l>
<p>The introduction of Themis gives the keynote of the hymn; the poet entreats for the favour of Zeus, the god of Law and Righteousness. For the Homeric conception of Themis see <bibl n="Hom. Il. 15.87">Il. 15.87</bibl> <quote lang="greek">, *u 4, b</quote> 68. Her relation with Zeus is prominent in later myth and cult. In Hesiod (<title>Theog.</title> 901) she is the wife of Zeus; cf. <bibl>Pind. <title>fr.</title> 30</bibl> (this was the Theban belief; cf.  <bibl n="Paus. 9. 25. 4">Paus.ix. 25. 4</bibl>). At Aegina she was worshipped as <quote lang="greek">*dio\s ceni/ou pa/redros</quote>,   <bibl n="Pind. O. 8">Pind. <title>Ol.</title>viii. 21</bibl>(the title <quote lang="greek">pa/redros</quote> is applied by  <bibl n="Bacchyl. Ep. 11.51">Bacchyl.xi. 51</bibl> to Hera as the wife of Zeus). Cf. also   <bibl n="Aesch. Supp. 360">Aesch. <title>Supp.</title>360</bibl>,   <bibl n="Soph. El. 1064">Soph. <title>El.</title>1064</bibl>; Preller-Robert i.^{2} p. 475 f.</p>
<p>It is a question whether Themis is here the wife or merely the adviser of Zeus. In the latter case her position would be similar to that of Dike in Hesiod, who sits by the side of Zeus and complains when men work injustice (  <bibl n="Hes. WD 258">Hes. <title>Op.</title>258</bibl>, cf. <title>Orph. h.</title> lxii quoted above). But the passage in the <title>Theogony</title> and the language in line 3 suggest the former interpretation.

<head>HYMN TO HESTIA</head>
<p>HESTIA is here invoked to make her home, with Zeus, in a building, the nature of which cannot be determined. According to Baumeister, it was probably a private house or a palace, in which rhapsodists recited epic at a feast. But there is weight in Gemoll's criticism, that Hestia and Zeus would not be invoked into a private house with so much solemnity. The occasion is rather to be sought in the dedication of a temple.</p>
<p>No stress can be laid on the words <quote lang="greek">*puqoi= e)n h)gaqe/h|</quote>, which certainly need not imply that the hymn was Delphian; the reference is, as often, literary, being due to the fame of Hestia's connexion with Delphi and the Pythian Apollo. There was a Hearth at Delphi in the Prytaneum, at which a perpetual fire was kept up by widows (see references in Frazer on  <bibl n="Paus. 8. 53. 9">Paus.viii. 53. 9</bibl>). The allusion in the present passage is, however, to a hearth actually in the temple at Delphi, which is frequently mentioned; cf.  <title>Choeph.</title> 1038;  <bibl n="Aesch. Eum. 282"> <title>Eum.</title>282</bibl>;  <title>O. T.</title> 965;   <bibl n="Eur. Ion 462">Eur. <title>Ion</title>462</bibl>;  <bibl n="Paus. 10. 24. 4">Paus.x. 24. 4</bibl> etc.</p>
<p>In view of the abrupt style, many commentators believe it to be a fragment from a longer hymn; Matthiae marks a lacuna after 3. A lacuna is also probable after 4; but we need not suppose that the original form of the hymn was widely different from the present tradition.

<p>The line is abrupt and frigid, unless there was some peculiar propriety in the mention of the oil. Baumeister thinks that the reference may be to an actual statue of Hestia, which was sprinkled with oil by the worshippers. Oil was often poured on sacred stones; cf.  <bibl n="Paus. 10. 24. 6">Paus.x. 24. 6</bibl>, Lucian <title>Alexand.</title> 30,  <title>Flor.</title> 1. 1 etc. In the case of a statue, a dressing of oil was part of the <quote lang="greek">ko/smos</quote>, like the decoration with jewels etc.; cf.  <title>oneir.</title> ii. 33 <quote lang="greek">qew=n a)ga/lmata . . . a)lei/fein</quote>. There were statues of Hestia (e.g. in the Prytaneum at Athens  <bibl n="Paus. 1. 18. 3">Paus.i. 18. 3</bibl>), but as a rule her cult was aniconic, at least in early times. Possibly the line is merely an anthropomorphic description of a sacred hearth or lamp, which maintained a perpetual oil-fed flame (<quote lang="greek">ai)ei/</quote>). Probably every Greek city had a perpetual fire in its Prytaneum; this was sometimes in a lamp (<bibl n="Theoc. 30">Theocr. xxx. 36</bibl>, Athen. xv. 700 D; see Frazer on  <bibl n="Paus. 8. 53. 9">Paus.viii. 53. 9</bibl> and his article in <title>J.

<head>HYMN TO ARTEMIS</head>
<p>THE hymn to Artemis, which gives a pleasing picture of the youthful goddess returning from the chase to take part in the dance at Delphi, seems to belong to a good period. The writer was almost certainly influenced by the hymn to Apollo; Gemoll compares lines 5 f. with the opening scene of that hymn, and 15 f. with <bibl n="HH 3.189"><title>h. Apoll.</title> 189</bibl> f. It does not, however, follow as a matter of course that the writer knew the hymn to Apollo as an undivided document, for he might have borrowed from two separate hymns. The prelude may have been used at Delphi, where portions of ancient poetry, bearing on Delphi and the god, were recited (Dittenberger <title>Sylloge</title> 663); but it is very possible that the scene at that place (13 f.) is simply introduced for literary effect.

<p> The lines do not prove that the writer had any idea of a common cult of Apollo and Artemis at Delphi. The goddess simply visits her brother to take part in the chorus of Muses and Graces  (see ix Introd. and <foreign lang="la">ib.</foreign> note 5). Artemis, however, has some connexion with Delphi, although she is not mentioned in the earliest myths of the oracle and temple. This connexion gave her the cult-names <quote lang="greek">*delfini/a</quote> (Attica, Thessaly) and, in imperial times, <quote lang="greek">*puqi/h</quote> (Miletus). At Delphi itself, as Farnell (<title>Cults</title> ii. p. 467) remarks, we have few traces of her cult; an inscr. (379 B.C.) records an Amphictyonic oath to Apollo, Leto, and Artemis (<title>C. I. G.</title> 1688), and slaves (? female) were sometimes emancipated in the name of Apollo and Artemis (Collitz <title>Dial. Inschr.</title> 1810). The eastern pediment of the Delphian temple represented Apollo, Artemis, Leto, and the Muses, but no trace of this sculpture has been discovered.</p>
<p>In extant art, the most familiar representation of Artemis at Delphi is the archaistic relief in the Villa Albani. In this Artemis stands by Leto, while Nike pours a libation to Apollo as Citharoedus. The Delphian temple in the background gives a setting to the scene. In the majority of representations of the two deities the connexion is simply mythological, with no bearing on the Delphian cult.

<head>HYMN TO ATHENA</head>
<p>THE style of this hymn is so similar to that of the preceding, that Gemoll confidently attributes both to the same composer. For coincidences of language he points to 3, 10 in this hymn (see notes). More striking is the fact that the influence of the hymn to Apollo is probably to be seen here, as in the hymn to Artemis. Gemoll compares 15 with <bibl n="HH 3.7"><title>h. Apoll.</title> 7</bibl>, and 16 with <bibl n="HH 3.12"><title>h. Apoll.</title> 12</bibl>.</p>
<p>According to the earliest detailed version of the myth ( <title>Theog.</title> 886-900), Zeus swallowed Metis, who was already pregnant with Athena. The goddess then sprang from the head of Zeus (<foreign lang="la">ib.</foreign> 924-926). Hesiod says nothing of the agency of Hephaestus (or other god who assisted Zeus<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="TWA">As Prometheus,   <bibl n="Eur. Ion 452">Eur. <title>Ion</title>452.</bibl></note>) nor of an armed Athena. The schol. on <bibl n="Apollon. 4.1310">Apoll. <title>Arg.</title> 4.1310</bibl> remarks that Stesichorus (whose poem is lost) first mentioned the panoply of the goddess at her birth. The scholiast passes over the hymn, of whose existence he was probably unaware, as he could hardly have had enough critical acumen to place a &ldquo;Homeric&rdquo; hymn later than the time of Stesichorus. The myth next appears in Pindar ( <bibl n="Pind. O. 7"> <title>Ol.</title>vii. 38</bibl>), who describes the agency of Hephaestus, and the terror of Heaven and Earth at the loud cry of Athena.</p>
    <p>For later accounts of the birth see Pauly-Wissowa s.v. &ldquo;Athena&rdquo; 1895 f.; Farnell <title>Cults</title> i. p. 280 f., and (from the &ldquo;anthropo-logical&rdquo; standpoint) Lang <title>Myth Ritual and Religion</title> ii. p. 242 f. It seems clear that the mention of the panoply, which is elaborated in the hymn (5, 6, and 15), is not part of the primitive myth; but this early became prominent in literature and art (cf.  <title>dial. deor.</title> 8:  <title>imag.</title> ii. 27). On archaic vases, down to the time of Pheidias, the usual type represents Zeus as sitting  in the midst of gods, while Athena, a small armed figure, issues from his head (see vases in Brit. Mus. <foreign lang="greek">*b</foreign> 147, 218, 244, 421, <foreign lang="greek">*e</foreign> 15, 410). Pheidias probably represented Athena as already born, either standing by the side of Zeus, or moving away from him, as in the well-known relief at Madrid (reproduced by Baumeister <title>Denkm.</title> fig. 172, and Frazer on  <bibl n="Paus. 1. 24. 5">Paus.i. 24. 5</bibl>, where references to the recent literature on the subject are given).

The upheaval of Nature is simply due to this stupendous scene. Later Greek rationalists gave a physical explanation of Athena's birth, and some modern mythologists (of the school of Preller, Max M&uuml;ller, and Roscher) interpret Athena as a personification of thunder or lightning, or some other natural phenomenon; but it is certain that Hesiod, Pindar, and the hymn-writer have no idea of reading a physical interpretation into the myth (see Farnell <title>l.c.</title>).

<head>HYMN TO HESTIA</head>
<p>ALTHOUGH primarily addressed to Hestia, the hymn is equally in honour of Hermes. If the order of lines 9 f. is correct, Groddeck's inference is probably right, that <quote lang="greek">nai/ete dw/mata kala/</quote> alludes to the cult of the two deities in a common temple. Gemoll further supposes that here, as in xxiv, the hymn was sung at the dedication of a new temple. Baumeister's view, that the occasion was a feast in a private house, depends on the adoption of Martin's order of the lines, by which <quote lang="greek">dw/mata kala/</quote> is joined to <quote lang="greek">e)pixqoni/wn a)nqrw/pwn</quote>; but see on 9 f.</p>
<p>For the close connexion of Hestia and Hermes see PrellerRobert i. p. 423, <bibl>Roscher <title>Lex.</title> i. 2649 f.</bibl> Pheidias represented them as a pair on the basis of Olympian Zeus ( <bibl n="Paus. 5. 11. 8">Paus.v. 11. 8</bibl>). There was a hearth (<quote lang="greek">e(sti/a</quote>) in front of a statue of Hermes at Pharae, on which incense was offered before Hermes was consulted for omens ( <bibl n="Paus. 8. 22. 2">Paus.viii. 22. 2</bibl> f.).</p>
<p>The origin of this connexion is not very clear; Preller sees a link in their relation to human life, Hestia representing quiet family life at home, while Hermes is the patron of the streets and ways, a god of active pursuits. According to others (e.g. Campbell <title>Religion in Greek Lit.</title> p. 119), the connexion is mainly local: Hermes, as the god of boundaries, is akin to the goddess of the house.</p>
<p>It is difficult to see why Gemoll should call the style of the hymn more lyric than epic; his theory of strophic arrangement (in stanzas of four lines) is also very dubious, and indeed breaks down, if we assume a lacuna after 9.</p>

It is a genuine prelude in the Homeric style.

<head>HYMN TO HELIOS</head>
<p>THE resemblance of this and the following hymn is striking. If the two are not the work of a single author, as Gemoll and (less confidently) Baumeister suppose, the writer of one hymn must have taken the other as his model. The description of the bright Sun is closely parallel to that of the Moon, and the language is in several places identical; cf. 10, 13, and see further on 15 f. In both hymns there appears to be a search after recondite mythology (Euryphaessa 2, Pandia xxxii. 15). The concluding formulae of the hymn shew that they were preludes to recitation. There are no distinctive marks of date, except the mention of Selene as winged, in xxxii. 1. This literary conception seems to belong to the decadence of mythology, perhaps not before the Alexandrine period; cf. the winged Dioscuri in xxxiii. 13. The two hymns, though rather turgid in style, are written in the &ldquo;Homeric&rdquo; manner; Baumeister has no reason in attributing them to the Orphic school of Onomacritus, and they have nothing in common with the extant Orphic hymns (viii and ix) to the same deities.</p>
<p>The place of composition cannot be recovered; the cult of Helios was widespread, especially in the Peloponnese, and was of course famous at Rhodes; see Preller-Robert i.^{2} p. 429 f.

<head>HYMN TO THE DIOSCURI</head>
<p>Although placed last in the collection, this hymn is no doubt older than <bibl n="HH 17">xvii</bibl>, which seems merely an abstract of it. The poem is a vigorous piece of writing, and may well belong to a period at least as early as the fourth or third century B.C. The reference to the Dioscuri as winged (<bibl n="HH 33">13</bibl>) seems a mark of lateness; on the other hand the hymn appears to be pre-Alexandrine, for there is little doubt that it was imitated by Theocritus,<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="TWA">Of recent editors, Baumeister, Gemoll, and Abel agree on this point; see also Crusius in <title>Philolog.</title> xlviii. (1889) p. 202.</note> whose description of the storm lulled by the Dioscuri is more elaborate than the simple language of the hymn (<title>idyl.</title> xxii, see on 6, 15).</p>
<p>In this hymn, as often, the Twin Brethren are identified with the lights (of an electric nature) which appear on the masts or sails of a ship during a storm; cf. <bibl n="Eur. Orest. 1636">Eur. <title>Or.</title> 1636 f.</bibl>;  <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 2.101">Plin. <title>N. H.</title> ii. 101</bibl>, <bibl n="Diod. 4.43">Diod. iv. 43</bibl>, <bibl>Plut. <title>de def. or.</title> 30</bibl>; Lucian <title>dial. deor.</title> xxvi. 2: <bibl n="Sen. Nat. 1.1.13">Seneca <title>Q. N.</title> 1. 1. 13</bibl>; <bibl n="Ov. Fast. 5.720">Ov. <title>Fast.</title> v. 720</bibl>. Two lights were a sign of safety; a single light (identified with Helen = <quote lang="greek">e(le/naus</quote>) betokened the worst. From the middle ages the lights have been called the fire of  Elmo  St.(Telmo). Frazer on <bibl n="Paus. 2.1.9">Paus. ii. 1. 9</bibl> gives references for the mediaeval and modern belief.</p>
<p>The editors do not notice the similarities of language between this hymn and vii (to Dionysus); cf. <bibl n="HH 33">1</bibl> (<quote lang="greek">a)mfi/</quote>) = <bibl n="HH 7.1">vii. 1</bibl>; <cit><bibl n="HH 33">8</bibl> <quote lang="greek">a)po\ nhw=n</quote></cit> = <cit><bibl n="HH 7.6">vii. 6</bibl> <quote lang="greek">a)po\ nho/s</quote></cit> (a rare use); <cit><bibl n="HH 33">12</bibl> <quote lang="greek">e)fa/nhsan</quote></cit> = <cit><bibl n="HH 7.2">vii. 2</bibl> <quote lang="greek">e)fa/nh</quote></cit>; <cit><bibl n="HH 33">14</bibl> <quote lang="greek">a)rgale/wn a)ne/mwn</quote></cit> = <cit><bibl n="HH 7.24">vii. 24</bibl> <quote lang="greek">a)rgale/ous a)ne/mous</quote></cit>; <cit><bibl n="HH 33">16</bibl> <quote lang="greek">sh/mata</quote></cit> = <bibl n="HH 7.46">vii. 46</bibl>;  <cit><bibl n="HH 33">16</bibl> <quote lang="greek">oi( de\ i)do/ntes</quote></cit> = <bibl n="HH 7.42">vii. 42</bibl>; see also <ref target="cp33l10" targOrder="U">on 10</ref>. These resemblances, taken singly, are slight; but their number suggests the possibility that this hymn was influenced by that to Dionysus, which is probably much older.
