<head>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.</head>
<p>Since the appearance of the first edition of this volume in
<date value="1871">1871</date>, I have, with Mr. Long's assistance, revised the whole of
the commentary on the last six books of the Aeneid. Mr.
Conington's notes have been left untouched, except where a
correction was absolutely necessary or an additional illustration
appeared not out of place. My own commentary on Books 10
and 12 has been somewhat enlarged, and, I hope, considerably
improved. I have also entirely recast the index, and added to
it (at the suggestion of a kindly critic in the <title>Athenaeum</title>) a
list, which will, I hope, prove fairly complete, of all the
passages in the last six books of the Aeneid in which <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> has
imitated Ennius, Lucretius, and Catullus. At the end of the
volume I have inserted a few remarks on some difficult passages
in <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> which have suggested themselves to me in the course
of reading since the appearance of the first edition, and which
have partly appeared in the <title>Academy</title> and the <title>Journal of
Philology</title>. I have also added a few notes on the last six books
of the Aeneid which occurred to me after the sheets had been
sent to press.</p>
<p>The most important contribution to <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>ian criticism which
<pb n="vi"/>
has appeared since <date value="1871">1871</date> is, so far as I know, the chapter of
emendations published by Madvig in the second volume of his
<title>Adversaria Critica</title>. Upon these emendations some detailed
remarks will be found at the end of this volume. I venture to
doubt whether Madvig's proposals, acute and suggestive as they
often are, will be considered, as a whole, to be sufficiently in
accordance with the spirit of <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>ian usage. They appear to
me to afford a fresh illustration of the fact so well and so often
insisted upon by Mr. Conington, and recognized in general terms
by Madvig himself, that <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> is, partly from the general
excellence of his MS. tradition, partly from the original
character of his diction, one of those authors in whose text
emendation is but seldom likely to prove convincing.</p>

<head>PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.</head>
<p>THE publication of this volume has been long delayed, owing
partly to the fact that for a considerable part of the time
during which he was writing his commentary Mr. Conington
was engaged upon other works, partly to the labour of
seeing the sheets through the press, partly to the lamentable
event which devolved upon me the duty of bringing out the
book.</p>
<p>I must briefly explain what has been my share in the work.
In <date value="1863">1863</date> Mr. Conington first proposed to me that I should
assist him in the third volume of his edition of <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> by writing
the notes on the last three books of the Aeneid. I did not
begin my part of the work until <date value="1864">1864</date>; and on my finding that
I could not keep pace with him, we agreed ultimately that he
should write the notes on Book 11, and that I should confine
myself to Books 10 and 12. The notes on Books 7, 8, 9, and
11 are accordingly the work of Mr. Conington, while for those
on Books 10 and 12 I am mainly responsible. I say mainly,
for Mr. Conington made considerable additions to the notes
which I had originally written on Book 10. He had not,
however, read through the notes on more than about three
<pb n="viii"/>
hundred lines of Book 12 before his death. The rest of the
notes on Book 12 have been looked through by Professor Munro,
to whose kindness I owe some valuable remarks, some of which
have been embodied in the notes, and others printed among
the Addenda<note anchored="yes" n="1">These remarks have all been embodied in the Second Edition of the Commentary.</note>.
To the notes on Book 11 I myself made a
few additions, besides writing the introduction. Two Essays
on parts of Ribbeck's Prolegomena, originally published
by Mr. Conington in the Cambridge Journal of Philology,
are printed at the end of the volume, which, like the two
preceding ones, has had the benefit of Mr. Long's revision
throughout.</p>
<p>Mr. Conington's death deprived a large circle of intimate
friends of one whose powers of sympathy were never exhausted,
and in whom succession after succession of students found a
centre of encouragement for their talents and industry: while
to philological study was lost a scholar whose gifts were
of a singular and representative order, deserving the more
to be dwelt upon as they are unlikely to be replaced. Mr.
Conington was, in a striking manner, a representative of that
kind of criticism which is supported rather by acuteness of the
linguistic and literary sense than by width of reading, and
which rests on the study of the formal rather than of the real
side of Philology. This is the side of scholarship which, as is
well known, has been chiefly cultivated in <placeName key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> during the
present century: it is in this direction that the main effort of
our classical education has been made. From this point of view
Mr. Conington approached his favourite authors, the Greek
tragedians and <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>. Three points in his method of study
deserve notice, all depending upon the general character of it
<pb n="ix"/>
which I have endeavoured to sketch. First, he turned his
attention mainly to a few authors, with whose characteristics
his great powers of memory and swift critical insight readily
gained him an astonishing familiarity. This comparative
confinement of range, which would be dangerous to a student
of inferior capacity, was in his case to a great extent prevented
from exercising a narrowing influence by the singular energy
which he brought to bear upon his chosen field, the energy of
a mind endowed with first-rate ability and no mean creative
power. Those who, like myself, enjoyed his intimacy, will recall
the fruitful way in which a few first-class authors were employed
in his hands for the illustration of points of literature, or the
philosophy of language, outside their immediate circle; the way
in which his mind, readily seizing on principles of criticism,
would draw with rare judgment and insight far-reaching
and suggestive inferences; the penetration with which he
would seem at once to comprehend the range of a train of
thinking, and the prudence with which he would point out its
slimits.</p>
<p>Connected with this limitation of his studies to a few authors
was the concentration of his energies upon the linguistic as
opposed to the real side of their writings. The predominance
in his mind of the literary and grammatical, as opposed to the
antiquarian interest, might be considered almost an advantage
when the object of his study was <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>, a poet in whose
thoughts, however stored his memory might be with antiquarian,
historical, and philosophical reminiscences, there can
hardly be a question that the literary interest occupied the chief
place. Here Mr. Conington was assisted by the thoroughly
poetical bent of a mind intimately familiar with the masterpieces
of English literature. It will, I think, be generally
<pb n="x"/>
acknowledged that the language of <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> has received new and
valuable explanation and illustration from his commentary. To
do over again for this century what Heyne did for the last,&mdash;to
draw into focus all the light which contemporary study, critical,
historical, antiquarian, and linguistic, could throw upon the
works of the most learned and allusive of ancient poets,&mdash;would
require a combination of gifts not usually found in a single
mind.</p>
<p>Thirdly, though Mr. Conington had a singular talent for conjectural
emendation, as his work on the fragments of the Greek
tragedians sufficiently shows, his interest lay, on the whole,
rather in interpretation than in textual criticism. It may be
that this bias was encouraged by labouring on an author like
<persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>, whose text is comparatively well established, and the
nature of whose writing makes emendation in it extremely
perilous, while it stimulates the utmost efforts of the interpreter.
It was the very rare combination, which his friends so much
admired in him, of subtle and acute insight with a kind of
Johnsonian sense and shrewdness, that made his remarks on
any point connected with interpretation peculiarly valuable.
On this ground his sight seemed clearest and his tread
firmest.</p>
<p>Mr. Conington's name has so long enjoyed the recognition
and deep respect of the public, that the separate testimony of
a single friend might seem superfluous, if not affected. But, in
bringing out the work to which he devoted so much of his best
labour, I have been unable to refrain from thus doing something
towards paying my own tribute to the memory of one with the
graces of whose character and intellectual gifts an intimate
friendship of several years brought me into inner and continual
contact, from whom I received my first introduction to the
<pb n="xi"/>
methods of classical study, and to whose sympathy, encouragement,
and guidance I, in common with many others who take
an interest in that study, am so deeply indebted.</p>

<head>A E N E I D O S</head>
<head>LIBER SEPTIMUS.</head>
<div2 type="Introduction" n="intro">
<p>THE Seventh Book of the Aeneid introduces us to the second half of the poem, the
<title>Iliad</title> of war which succeeds the Odyssey of travel. Its subject is the landing of the
Trojans in <placeName key="tgn,7003080">Latium</placeName>, and the causes of the native rising which threatened to exterminate
the new settlers.</p>
<p>As in other cases, we know that there were other versions of the story, substantially
agreeing with <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s while circumstantially differing from it: as in other cases, we
have no means of judging how far the differences in <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s account are attributable to
his own fancy, how far to his having followed yet other accounts, now lost. The first
event after the landing, the casual fulfilment of the prophecy that the Trojans should
eat their tables, seems in one form or other to have been a prominent part of the
legend. Ancient authors related it variously, even <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s own account of the prophecy
as given here being inconsistent with that given in the Third Book: modern
critics have seen a philosophical meaning in it, of which <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> may safely be pronounced
never to have dreamed, and with which therefore a commentator on <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>
has no occasion to trouble himself. The interview of Ilioneus with Latinus perhaps
reminds us too much of his interview with <persName>Dido</persName> in the First Book: but the effect
on Latinus' own mind, prepared as it had been by omens and predictions, is well and
forcibly portrayed. The interposition of <persName>Juno</persName> and the introduction of Allecto are
apparently original, and quite in the style of epic poetry. It is not impossible that
<persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s whole account of the relations between <persName>Aeneas</persName> and Latinus may be the result
of his desire to harmonize the stories which he found current into a consistent poetical
narrative. As we learn from Livy and others, one version spoke of the settlement of
the Trojans as effected by conquest, another as brought about by agreement: <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>
may have imagined that the conception of an old king, swayed one way by the voice of
oracles and by hospitable feeling, another by regard for his wife and his kinsman, and
his subjects, presented a solution of the discrepancy.</p>
<p>No attempt has been made to estimate the historical value of the catalogue with
which <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>, in imitation of <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName>, introduces the story of the war. An annotator
on a poet is not obliged to be an historical critic: an annotator on the Aeneid may be
pardoned for suspecting that when <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> invokes the Muses to supplement the defects
of human tradition, he simply asserts a poet's licence to deal with his materials in the
way which he judges to be most poetically effective.</p>

given in a review in the G&ouml;ttingen
Gelehrt. Anzeig. for <date value="1804">1804</date>, p. 1672, was
<quote lang="la">Albunea aqua, quae sonat fonte sacro,

<bibl n="Verg. G. 2.15">G. 2. 15</bibl>, <quote lang="la">nemorumque Jovi
quae maxuma frondet Aesculus</quote> is not
nearly so strong. Wagn., following Bonstetten's

derniers livres de l'En&eacute;ide (p. 205), takes
Albunea as a wood, which removes some
difficulties, but leaves <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">lucos sub alta
Albunea</q> to be explained. It is however
not yet determined where Albunea itself
is. Serv. places it <quote lang="la">in altis montibus

it with the fall of the sulphurous
waters of the Albula into the Anio at

it in the sulphurous spring of

here and <quote lang="la">resonantis</quote> in Hor. seem to
imply a waterfall. Mr. Long has no doubt
that the Albunea was the sulphur lake (or
nymph of the lake) from which issues the
canal of the Albula. Virg., he says, has
confused the lake and the woods round
the lake. The difficulty (he continues) is
that the lake is not at <placeName key="perseus,Tibur">Tibur</placeName>, but at least

her case with that of Minerva, who had

well remarks that she here chooses instances
of destruction by war as there by
shipwreck. The quarrel between the Centaurs
and Lapithae at the marriage of
Peirithous (in which the Lapithae were
victorious) is generally, and by Virg. himself
(<bibl n="Verg. G. 2.456">G. 2. 456</bibl>), ascribed to the influence
<pb n="32"/>
of Bacchus. The only light on this passage
seems to be derived from Serv., who
has a story that Peirithous invited all the
gods but Mars to the marriage feast, and
that Mars in revenge for the slight
brought about the quarrel: but this looks
suspiciously like an adaptation of the very
similar story of Diana's vengeance on
Oeneus of Calydon, who had omitted to
sacrifice to her when he sacrificed to all
the other gods, Il. 9. 533 foll. The ascription
of a bloody quarrel to Mars is natural
enough, as the Greeks made him the author

<p>The reading of this line is not
certain. In Priscian's time, as appears
from his words p. 1081, there were three
readings, <q direct="unspecified">Lapithas&mdash;Calydona merentem,</q>
<q direct="unspecified">Lapithis&mdash;Calydone merente,</q> and
<q direct="unspecified">Lapithis&mdash;Calydona merentem.</q> Priscian
thinks that the third can be explained
as a double construction, but prefers
the first or second. Serv. is for the
second, as the only one which will make
sense, but as he does not expressly mention
the two others, merely objecting to reading
<q direct="unspecified">Calydona,</q> it is not clear whether he is
arguing against one or both. Of the MSS.
Rom. is for the second, unequivocally;
fragm. Vat. is for the third, though its
original reading was <q direct="unspecified">Calydo;</q> Med. was
originally for the second, except that it
read <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">merentes,</q> but its second reading
is for the first; Gud. was originally for the
third, but <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">merentem</q> has been altered
into <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">merente.</q> Heins. restored the first,
and subsequent editors have followed him:
Ribbeck however recalls the second. The
first is decidedly to be preferred to the
second, as at once neater and more difficult,
while in external authority they appear
to be equal. If the third could be explained,
it might easily be defended on
external grounds, as the original reading
which was altered in two ways for the
sake of symmetry: but there is nothing
in the context to supply any construction
for <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Lapithis,</q> and to understand it as an
abl. abs., borrowing <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">merentibus</q> from
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">merentem,</q> would be quite impossible.
The most probable view then seems to be
that the first was the original reading, that
the second was introduced by some one
who did not understand the construction
(<seg lang="la">Pomponius Sabinus</seg>, retaining the accusatives,
attempts to supply <quote lang="la">vidisti</quote>), and
that the third is simply a mixture of the
two. Ribbeck imagines that Virg. himself
left a choice of readings, the first and
second. The inferior MSS. multiply the
variations almost indefinitely. <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Quod scelus

<q direct="unspecified">You will suffer, not I: for</q> &amp;c. The
difficulty of <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">omnisque in limine portus</q>
is well known. Serv. renders it
<quote lang="la">securitas omnis in promptu est,</quote> taking
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">portus</q> as the nom., and so it seems
to have been understood by Paullinus,
Carm. 12. 31, who evidently imitates
Virg., <quote lang="la">Inque tuo placidus nobis sit limine
portus.</quote> Ruhkopf interprets it similarly,
<quote lang="la">omne auxilium mihi ante pedes et paratum
est seni,</quote> and Wagn. and Forb. concur.
On the other hand Heyne makes
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">portus</q> gen., paraphrasing the words
<quote lang="la">ego omnis, totus, sum in limine, aditu,
portus; in portu iam tantum non navigo;</quote>
and so Gossrau, <quote lang="la">iam prope absum
a portu, iam sum ad limen portus, quem
introeam.</quote> The objection to the former
view seems to be the apparent confusion
of metaphor between <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">portus</q> and <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">limine</q>
(<q direct="unspecified">in limine</q> not having been yet
shown to be a current synonyme for <quote>in
promptu</quote>), and the application of <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">omnis</q>
to <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">portus,</q> which, though it may very
well be used simply for <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">rest</q> in a context
for this, like our <q direct="unspecified">haven,</q> could hardly be
generalized by <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">omnis,</q> while the order
of the words is rather against taking <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">omnis</q>
as a predicate, i. q. <quote lang="la">omnino in limine.</quote>
The objection to the latter is the omission
of <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">sum,</q> and generally the want of specification
of the subject of the clause. This
would be removed by taking away the
stop after <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">portus,</q> so as to make <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">spolior</q>
the principal verb: but the sense would
then seem scarcely to cohere, Latinus saying
in one breath that he has rest in store for
him and that he loses a happy death.
Ladewig attempts to bring the clause into
harmony by adopting a variant in the
Codex Minoraugiensis, <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">non</q> for <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">nam,</q>
Latinus being made to say that he had
lost his prospect of peace. A better way
of expressing this would be to read <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">rapta</q>
for <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">parta,</q> just as in 8. 317 <quote lang="la">rapto</quote> for
<quote>parto</quote> is one of the readings of Med.
But this is clearly not what Virg. means:
the gist of Latinus' speech is not that
Turnus and the Latins will suffer for disturbing
the quiet of his last days, but
that retribution for the war will fall on
them, not on him; all that he can lose is
a death of quiet, his final rest being assured.
Possibly this may be expressed by
the sentence punctuated as proposed above,
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">omnisque in limine portus Funere felici
spolior,</q> if we suppose the main stress to
fall on the first words, <q direct="unspecified">it is only when just
on the harbour's verge that I am robbed
of a happy death:</q> but the sentence then
would be inconveniently loaded. On the
<pb n="59"/>
whole it seems best to accept the ellipse of
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">sum,</q> awkward as it is, supposing that
Virg. trusted to the proximity of <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">spolior</q>
to make the subject of the clause
clear. Canon. has a remarkable reading,
<quote lang="la">somnusque in limine partus:</quote> but though
this would remove all difficulty, it seems
hardly in the style of Virg., who would
scarcely have repeated <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">partus</q> from <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">parta</q>
except as substitute for <quote lang="la">quae:</quote> see on <bibl n="Verg. Ecl. 4">E.
4. 6</bibl>. Wordsworth on Theocr. 2. 126 had
already conjectured <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">somni</q> for <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">omnis,</q> a
very plausible change if we were dealing

show that Niebuhr (Hist. vol. 1. p. 211

more ordinary custom being to have the

represented the sons of Thestius, Meleager's

merely commending Virg. for his
learning in transferring an Aetolian custom
to the Hernici, who, according to
Hyginus, were a Pelasgian colony. Serv.'s
solution, adopted by Heyne, is that these
Italians carried a shield (<quote lang="la">scutum</quote>)
which would protect their left foot, which
he supposes to be the one advanced in
battle: but this is contrary to v. 686, unless
we press the word <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">clipeus</q> as indicating
only one sort of shield. The simplest
solution would seem to be this: the
unshod foot would have the disadvantage
of being unprotected, but it would have
the advantage of being disencumbered. It
is of this latter point that Virg. is thinking
here, like Eur. and Aristot., though with
the Romans generally (see Heyne, Excursus
8) the former seems to have been the
prominent consideration. But Vegetius
1. 20 (cited by Lersch &sect; 33) lays down
the rule that in discharging missiles the
left foot is to be advanced, in using the
<quote lang="la">pilum</quote> and sword the right. In representing
then these slingers and darters as
having their left foot naked, Virg. is not
open to Aristot.'s censure, the left in their
case being <foreign lang="greek">o( h(gou/menos</foreign>. For 10. 587, which
might be alleged to show that Virg. does
not recognize the distinction of Vegetius,

<p>THE Trojans having become embroiled with the inhabitants of <placeName key="tgn,7003080">Latium</placeName>, and a confederacy
having been made against them, it was natural that <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> should wish to
<seg lang="la">provide <persName>Aeneas</persName></seg> with Italian allies. The legend of Evander offered itself opportunely
to meet the want. He was supposed to have settled in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> about sixty years before
the Trojan war, so that it was possible that his old age should have coincided with the
arrival of <persName>Aeneas</persName>: while the traditional character of the Arcadian prince, the mythical
introducer of a foreign civilization, pointed him out as the friend rather than the
enemy of the pious hero of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>. It was reasonable too that <persName>Aeneas</persName> should be sent to
visit Evander in his own home, that home being on the spot which was afterwards to
be made illustrious by the foundation of the Eternal City. The narrative of Hercules
and Cacus and the description of Roman topography follow as a matter of course. In
giving Evander a son, Pallas, <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> appears to have followed one of the versions of
the legend (see Servius' note on v. 51 of this Book), at the same time that he retains
the name of the elder Pallas, the founder of the Arcadian Pallantium and the eponym
of the town on the <placeName key="tgn,3000935">Palatine</placeName>. The thought of making Pallas accompany <persName>Aeneas</persName> may
have been suggested by Apollonius, who makes Lycus send his son Dascylus along with
Jason: Ovid however, in telling the story of Evander in the First Book of the <title>Fasti</title>,
connects Pallas with <persName>Aeneas</persName>, so that there may have been some legendary authority
for the association. Mezentius is known to have figured in legend as an oppressor
dreaded by his neighbours, who were delivered from him on one occasion by <persName>Aeneas</persName> or
Ascanius: and this may have given the hint for <persName>Aeneas</persName>' alliance with the tyrant's
revolted subjects. The request of <persName>Venus</persName> to Vulcan and the making of the shield are
easily traceable to their <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName>ic sources: the details of the workmanship are doubtless
the poet's own, though, as has been said in the General Introduction, a hint may have
been taken from Jason's scarf in Apollonius; and they accord well with the character
and purpose of the great Roman epic.</p>

the white sow is Alba; the thirty young

the legend as old as Varro, R. R. 2. 4, L.

think, indispensable to it. It is one thing
to interpret the omen as showing the place
where <placeName key="perseus,Lavinium">Lavinium</placeName> is to be built, another to
explain the white sow of Alba, the thirty
pigs of the thirty years. <seg lang="la">Helenus confines</seg>
himself to the first: the <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName>, according
to the common text, passes from one to
the other so as rather to confuse the two.
It seems better to suppose that he simply
speaks from the latter point of view, <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">ex
quo</q> being explained as <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">ex quo prodigio</q>
with Ribbeck. This is confirmed by Serv.,
who interprets <quote lang="la">ex qua ratiocinatione,</quote>
and makes no remark on the line before
us. We may note that <persName>Aeneas</persName> takes no
notice of the place on waking, either in
his address to the river or when he sees
the sow. The line then should at least be
bracketed, if not struck from the text.
It is a further objection to the genuineness
of this line that <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">hic</q> must be taken
with great latitude, <placeName key="perseus,Lavinium">Lavinium</placeName> being twelve
Roman miles from the <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName>: and this,
which would be nothing where the country
was the thing indicated, as in the prophecy
of Helenus, seems harsh when <persName>Aeneas</persName> has
found the country, and the thing to be
indicated is the particular site of his
town. Nor is it likely perhaps that Virg.
should have inserted the line so soon after
v. 39, to which it bears some resemblance.
Heyne suggests that the passage may

<p>See Livy 1. 7., 9. 29. The
worship of Hercules at the <seg lang="la">Ara Maxuma</seg>
was originally a family worship of the
<seg lang="la">gentes Potitia</seg> and Pinaria. Livy says
that on the first institution the Pinarii
came too late; and that hence they never
after tasted of the entrails; from which
we may infer that the Potitii acted as
priests and the Pinarii as attendants.
Appius Claudius the Censor engaged
the Potitii to teach the rites to state
slaves, in order to make them public,
and in consequence of this profanation, it
was said, the Potitii, though there were
twelve families of them, became utterly
extinct within the year. Virg. is accurate
then in making Potitius, the father of the

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Strictura</lemma> is a word used not
unfrequently in connexion with metallurgy:
but the ancients themselves seem not to
have been agreed about its meaning. Serv.
explains it here as <quote lang="la">terra ferri massam
coacta,</quote> which apparently means the
metal in the ore. In his note on 10. 174,
he refers to Varro as saying of <placeName key="tgn,7006197">Ilva</placeName> <quote lang="la">nasci
quidem illic ferrum, sed in stricturam
non posse cogi nisi transvectum in Populoniam,</quote>
where the sense would seem to
be just the contrary, the metal as separated
from the ore; but the reading of the
words appears to be in some doubt. This
latter sense of <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">strictura</q> would agree
with Persius 2. 66, <quote lang="la">stringere venas Ferventis
massae crudo de pulvere iussit,</quote>
where see Jahn. Non. twice defines the
word (pp. 21, 523, 524) as meaning the
sparks which are struck out from iron
when beaten on the anvil, <quote lang="la">quod aut stricte
emittantur, id est, celeriter, aut quod
oculos sui fulgore perstringant:</quote> it may
be questioned, however, whether he does
not extract this interprestaion from an
instance he quotes from Lucil. Sat. 3 (v. 29
M&uuml;ller), <quote lang="la">crebrae ut scintillae in stricturis,
quod genus olim Ferventi ferro,</quote> where
either of the other meanings would be
equally applicable. The word occurs also
in Pliny 34. 14; but the text seems to be
too uncertain to build anything upon. If
a decision must be made, the probability
would seem to be in favour of Serv.'s
second interpretation. The Chalybes are
the traditional workers in iron, so the
metal is called <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">stricturae Chalybum,</q> as
mines are called <quote lang="la">Chalybum metalla</quote> 10.

The same variety has met us 2. 321, though
there the authority for <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">litora</q> is very
slight. Here it would seem to have the
support of the great majority of MSS., the
only other authorities distinctly quoted
for <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">limina</q> being one of Ribbeck's cursives,
seven copies mentioned by Heins.,
and one by Burm., while we can hardly
treat Pal. and Gud. as independent witnesses.
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Litora</q> however cannot be said
to be a natural reading. The Tyrrhenian
army may have been encamped near the
shore (comp. v. 497), but the shore of the
king is not the same as his seaside camp,
and there is a disagreeable incongruity
between <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">equites</q> and <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">litora,</q> not justified
as in the case of <quote lang="la">puppes signa ferre

It seems best therefore to recall <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">limina,</q>
which was first displaced by Wagn. The
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">limina</q> is here the door of the general's
tent, but that does not make the expression
less apposite, as the general notion is that
of seeking the king in his abode. Comp.

ways of reconciling or getting rid of
this discrepancy see Lewis pp. 238 foll.
His own explanation, that there were two

he urges of duplicate relics preserved in

as a motive for multiplying memorials,
which cannot have been the case in <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>

replies that the epithet merely refers to
Vulcan's representation, not to the reality

and answer seem to proceed on a wrong
conception of Virg.'s notion. Virg. was
not bound to make Vulcan preserve exact
historical perspective: he combines the
thatched hut with the gilded temple of
his own time as the best means of producing
the effect he desires and impressing
the image of the Capitol upon his reader's
mind. <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Auratis</q> doubtless refers to
Vulcan's mode of representation, like

<p>Heyne, Peerlkamp, and Ribbeck
object to these lines as incongruous. At
first sight the introduction of the infernal
regions seems our of keeping with the rest
of the portraiture. But we must consider
that Virg.'s obgect here and elsewhere is
to tell incidents pictorially: and it doubtless
seemed to him that he could not
better distribute praise and blame, with
the materials at his command, among
national benefactors and national criminals
than by representing their fortunes in the
other world. which are as it were emblematic
of the judgment of history. Catiline's
death in battle would not have told
its own story, nor would any event in
Cato's life have represented the position
which Virg. wishes to assign to him. So
in <bibl n="Verg. G. 3.37">G. 3. 37</bibl> foll., Virg., wishing to express
symbolically his reprobation of the enemies
of <seg lang="la">Caesar, places</seg> them in the infernal world.

It is surely more likely that he is represented
as on the verge of a precipice, with a reference
doubtless to the Tarpeian rock, just in
the agony of falling into the abyss. The
Furies then are probably to be understood
as pursuing and driving him over the brink.
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Minaci</q> will be overhanging, and consequently

the eulogies which Horace bestows on him

aim at perfect consistency. It was enough
for him that Cato was one who from his
character in life might be justly conceived
of as law-giver to the dead. His functions
here seem not to be those of Minos or
Rhadamanthus in Book 6, but rather those
of the <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName>ic Minos (Od. 11. 568 foll.),

<head>P. VERGILI MARONIS</head>
<head>AENEIDOS</head>
<head><seg lang="la">LIBER NONUS</seg>.</head>
<p>THE subject of this Book is the attack made by Turnus and the Latian army on the
Trojan camp while <persName>Aeneas</persName> is away. Various incidents are interwoven with it
with more or less of ingenuity. At the opening of the attack a portent occurs, the
transformation of the Trojan ships into sea-nymphs, just at the moment when they
are threatened with conflagration. This, as Sir G. C. Lewis remarks, is evidently an
echo of the story in the Fifth Book, the burning of the ships by the Trojan women.
<persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> was doubtless glad to put the legend to a double use, whether the form which
it takes on this second occasion was invented by him or borrowed from tradition. In
any case he was likely to regard the metamorphosis as part of the supernatural
machinery which is an epic poet's property. Even in Servius' time however the
incident provoked question as being without precedent: and modern criticism
will be more disposed to account for it than to justify it. No defence is needed
for the next incident, which is indeed one of the crowning instances of <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s
power of appealing to human sensibility. The hint of the episode of Nisus and
Euryalus is from <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName>'s Doloneia: but the effect produced is due entirely to the
art of the younger poet. In the <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName>ic story we sympathize neither with Dolon
nor with his captors: the former fails where he did not deserve to succeed: the success
of the latter is too complete and too bloody to call forth much enthusiasm. Nisus and
Euryalus succeed like Ulysses and Diomede, and fail like Dolon: and our feelings are
stirred alike by their success and their failure. The remaining events are less
memorable, but serve to diversify the narrative. The killing of Numanus by Ascanius
is <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s own, and is well contrived to keep up our interest in the beleaguered army.
In the account of the daring of Pandarus and Bitias and the havoc made in the Trojan
camp by Turnus <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> has borrowed something from <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName>, and is said to have
borrowed something also from Ennius. The rashness of the Trojan champions excites
little sympathy: but the single-handed bravery of Turnus justifies the place he is
made to occupy in the poem, as the prominent figure in the absence of <persName>Aeneas</persName>.</p>
<p>Heyne is so convinced of the propriety of the conduct of this part of the poem that
he thinks no objection can be made to the attack on the camp in <persName>Aeneas</persName>' absence
without the utmost injustice. Yet, if we consider for a moment, we shall perhaps
see that such an objection would not be as unwarrantable as he supposes. If <persName>Aeneas</persName>
had undertaken the journey to Evander of his own motion, we might not have wondered
that the step should have entailed a certain amount of disaster; but when we
know that it was prompted by a deity, we naturally expect a less equivocal result.
<pb n="153"/>
No doubt the balance of advantage was still on <persName>Aeneas</persName>' side: but in the case of an
action suggested by supernatural advice we are scarcely prepared to find that a balance
has to be struck. As it is, the consequences are sufficiently unfortunate to form the
abject of debate among the gods in the following Book: <persName>Venus</persName> complains, <persName>Juno</persName>
aborts that <persName>Aeneas</persName> brought the evil on himself, and <persName>Jupiter</persName> cautiously declines to
pronounce whether fate or human error is in fault. No doubt the employment of
supernatural machinery involves a poet in considerable difficulty. If it is used at all,
it would seem natural that it should be used in all the important crises of the story.
Nor is there anything abstractedly repellent in the notion that an action prompted by
a god should result in something short of absolute success, especially when we consider
that each party has an array of gods ranged on its side. We can even conceive
that Nisus may have been prompted, as <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> himself intimates, to the enterprise
which ended so gloriously and so fatally. Such however is not the way in which the
ancient poets generally make use of supernatural agency. The gods are employed to
procure good for their favourites and avert evil from them: where they can do neither,
they are commonly passive. The resolution which <persName>Hector</persName> takes, to encounter Achilles
and meet his death, is a heroic one: but it is prompted not by his protector Apollo but
by his enemy Pallas. <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> has entangled himself in a complication which the greater
simplicity of <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName>'s conceptions enables him to avoid; and the readers of the Ninth
Book only anticipate the dissatisfaction which the poet himself is compelled to express
in the Tenth.</p>

The notion is curiously like the belief that
running water dissolved a magical spell,

can hardly refer to anything but the
rising of the river, which is supposed to

had any authority for this notion of the

not know. He may have confused it with
the <placeName key="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName>, as is further made probable by
the number seven, which belongs to the
<placeName key="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName> (see 6. 800), though Serv. refers for
the seven branches of the Ganges to a
passage of Mela, which is either misunderstood

<p>Ribbeck asterizes this line, supposing
that Virg. intended it as an alternative
to vv. 86, 87. Heyne had asterized
vv. 86, 87 on similar grounds, thinking
the mention of a grove in the citadel absurd,
and inconsistent with the building
of the fleet on Ida. Wagn. defends all
three, making v. 85 an independent sentence:
<q direct="unspecified">I have a pine-forest; in this stood
a grove of pitch-trees and maples, which I
allowed <persName>Aeneas</persName> to use,</q> <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">arce summa</q>
being understood with Serv. of Gargarus,
the summit of Ida. As in 6. 743, 744,
the truth seems to lie between the two
views. We could not get rid of any part
of the passage without sacrificing something:
on the other hand we cannot say
that in its present state it is altogether
coherent. Virg. would doubtless have
altered it had he lived to complete his
poem: but we cannot point out the precise
change which he would have made.
Meantime Wagn. appears right in his
view of the grammatical structure of the
whole, breaking it up into two sentences,
as there would be awkwardness in constructing
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">pinea silva</q> in apposition to
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">lucus,</q> or in making one the predicate,
the other the subject. It is better, at the

to be unfinished, we cannot argue from

It is a question of probabilities, and one
that from the nature of the case must

have intended to make <persName>Aeneas</persName> get his
timber from a sacred grove in the citadel,

<p>Serv. remarks that this assertion
of Turnus about his destiny is false, adding
however that the art of rhetoric admits
the use of falsehood where it cannot be
disproved, as in this case. He further
observes that it is Turnus' consciousness
that he is telling a falsehood which makes
him anxious to support his case by argument,
talking of the injustice of the
Trojans. The falsehood however depends

<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">modo non</q> reminds us of rhetoric rather
than of poetry: but it must be set down
to the general tone of the speech, which is
decidedly oratorical. Wagn. Lectt. Vergg.
pp. 352 foll. accounts for <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">modo non</q> on
the ground that but for such a qualification
the Trojans would be condemned to hate
not only those whom they might possibly
marry but those whom they might not,
such as mothers and sisters. He has now
however in his 3rd school edition changed
his opinion, and takes <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">penitus&mdash;perosos</q> as
an indignant exclamation&mdash;<q direct="unspecified">to think that
they should now (<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">modo,</q> <foreign lang="greek">a)/rti</foreign>) not abhor

doubtful whether he had fully grasped
Heyne's meaning even when he supported
it, as in Lectt. Vergg. l. c. he finds a
chronological incongruity between the two

<p>Nearly repeated from 2. 166. It
is found in all the MSS.; but recent critics,
from the time of Heyne and Bryant, have
been all but unanimous in condemning it.
The reasons urged against it are that it is
tedious and even inappropriate, as there
was no citadel or Palladium in the Trojan
camp settlement, and that the form
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Palladii</q> would not have been used by
Virg. The first is partly answered by
Forb. (himself a rejecter of the line), who
admits that the mention of the Palladium
is as appropriate as the mention of the
horse, Turnus' meaning being only that
he would not condescend to stratagems
<emph>like</emph> those of the Greeks: while the charge
of tediousness may be met, if not rebutted,
by the consideration that Virg. is borrowing
from himself, and that he is not always
successful in such appropriations, any more
than when he borrows from others. This
will account for the flatness of <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">caesis
summae custodibus arcis,</q> which in Turnus'
mouth merely means, <q direct="unspecified">I will have nothing
to do with surprising and slaughtering

<p>Arisbe was one of the places that

conquest by <persName>Aeneas</persName>, if it took place at all,
must have happened before the Trojan
war. Serv., who suggests this interpretation,
mentions another, that the capture
was by Achilles (a circumstance not mentioned

passed to Pyrrhus, and eventually through
Helenus to <persName>Aeneas</persName>, <quote><q lang="la" direct="unspecified">quae cepit</q> pro

of the question. Whether Virg. followed

had called Nisus <q direct="unspecified">Hyrtacides,</q> probably
borrowing the patronymic from Il. 2. 837,
<foreign lang="greek">*)/asios *(urtaki/dhs</foreign>, and now, wanting a
town to specify, he would naturally borrow
the name of the place from which the
<persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName>ic son of Hyrtacus came. We know
that Virg. made a copious and indiscriminate
use of <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName>ic materials; and
perhaps in our ignorance of the bulk of
post-<persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName>ic legends we may be led to
imagine that he is borrowing from them
when he is really indebted only to the
<title>Iliad</title> and his own ingenuity. Those who
think he is referring to an actual legendary
event may appeal to a third suggestion
of  Serv., who says, that Abas was said to
tation, related in his <quote lang="la">Troica</quote> that after
was by abandonment of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> by the Greeks
Astyanax was made king there, that
Antenor attacked him with the help of
the neighbouring cities, Arisbe among the
number, and that <persName>Aeneas</persName> came to his
assistance and overcame the invaders, on
which occasion he may have taken Arisbe.
If this story existed, it is possible that
Virg. may have alluded to it without
adopting it (see on 4. 427): but the other
supposition seems simpler.</p>

great exaggeration. Two talents of gold

the present for the perf. for similar

of any such obligation to <persName>Dido</persName> would be
far-fetched. In 1. 79, which Gossrau on

permanent, as the gift might be withdrawn.

spurious, asks how the <q direct="unspecified">crater</q> could be
divided between two. But though the
other gifts are in pairs, it does not follow
that each pair was to be simply divided, as
there might be a partition of the whole

intended for the two friends in common.

from admitting that there are some things
in this whole passage which Virg. might
have reconsidered.</p>

The difficulties connected with
it are stated by Wagn. in his larger edition.
It is not clear whether <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">post mortem</q>
is the death of Remulus or of his
grandson, <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">moriens</q> being in favour of the
former view, the general sense of the
latter: we are not told distinctly how
Rhamnes acquired the <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">phalerae</q> and
belt, but are left to infer that he received
them as his share of the spoil after a
battle in which the grandson of Remulus
was killed: <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">bello pugnaque</q> are a cumbrous
mode of expression in a context
which speaks only of the spoils of one man.
On the other hand, if the line be omitted,
all is plain, the unnamed grandson of Remulus
being Rhamnes. This reasoning is
strong, and would probably be conclusive
in the case of a writer whose text was less
well established. As however the line is
found in all the MSS. (Med. and another
giving <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">pugnamque,</q> Rom. and one or two
others <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">praedaque,</q> perhaps from v. 450)
and was read by Serv. and Donatus, it
seems best to retain it, adopting Serv.'s
suggestion that Virg. left it in the rough.
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Post mortem</q> seems most naturally to
refer to the death of Remulus, as Wagn.
now takes it in his latest school edition,
that of his grandson being implied in the
fact that his spoils were taken from him:
the name of the grandson, as Serv. says,
would naturally be the same as that of
the grandfather, and consequently is not
given: <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">bello pugnaque</q> is a pleonasm
like <foreign lang="greek">pole/mw| te ma/xh| te</foreign>, as Heyne remarks.
Donatus ap. Serv. takes <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">post
mortem</q> of the death of Euryalus, which
is also the view of Cunningham: and Ribbeck
supposes that to have been the meaning
of the author of the verse, who added

the old days when citizens and patricians

<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">funera</q> or <quote lang="la">funerea</quote> was an ancient term
for an unprofessional, as <quote lang="la">praefica</quote> for a
professional mourner: his note however
leaves it in doubt whether he ever found
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">funera</q> in that sense, though he may
have found <quote lang="la">funerea,</quote> and in the only other
passage where it has been supposed to
occur, Ennius' epitaph on himself, v. 1,
<quote lang="la">Nemo me lacrimis decoret, nec funera
fletum Faxit,</quote> the MSS. of Cic., who twice
quotes the passage, have <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">fletu,</q> which is

<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">tua funera</q> with <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">produxi,</q> which the
order of the words absolutely repudiates.
If the text is sound, it seems best with
Ribbeck to follow Catrou's interpretation,
making <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">tua funera</q> epexegetical of
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">te,</q> Euryalus' mother correcting herself

in the construction it introduces or in the

The reference here is to the fight carried

the point of the epithet seems to lie in the

those who practise it, as they cannot see

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Macte,</lemma> or according to the more common form of the phrase, <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">macte esto,</q> is
generally, and I believe rightly, supposed to be the vocative of <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">mactus,</q> constructed
with the imperative of the verb substantive in the sense of the nominative. Madvig
disputes this, and regards <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">macte</q> as an adverb, the last syllable being shortened as in
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">bene</q> and <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">male.</q></p>
<p>The facts of the case appear to be as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Macte</lemma> or <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">mactus</q> was an old Latin word, especially used in connexion with
sacrifices. <seg lang="la">Cato De Re Rustica</seg>, chaps. 134 (135), 132 (133) &amp;c., gives various formulae
for the invocation of the different gods: <quote lang="la">Iuppiter, te hoc fercto obmovendo bonas
preces precor, uti sies volens propitius mihi liberisque meis, domo familiaeque meae,
mactus hoc fercto,</quote> <quote lang="la">Iuppiter dapalis, macte istace dape pollucenda esto,</quote> <quote lang="la">macte vino
inferio esto.</quote> This agrees with the words of Servius on the present passage, <quote lang="la">Et est
sermo tractus a sacris. Quotiens enim aut tus aut vinum super victimam fundebatur,
dicebant: Mactus est taurus vino vel ture, hoc est, cumulata est hostia et magis
aucta.</quote> To the same effect Arnobius 7. 31, <quote lang="la">Operae pretium est etiam ipsa verba depromere,
quibus, cum vinum datur, uti ac supplicare consuetudo est: Mactus hoc vino
inferio esto.</quote> There is also an apparent reference to this sacrificial use in a line from
Lucilius Book 5, quoted by Nonius p. 341 and Servius on the present passage,
<quote lang="la">Macte, inquam, virtute simulque his versibus esto,</quote> though Lion's edition of Servius
reads <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">viribus.</q> In the remaining passages where the word is used, with one or two
exceptions, it seems, as in the present passage, to have the sense of approbation and encouragement,
being commonly found with <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">virtute</q> or some similar word<note anchored="yes" n="1">This is probably its sense in Martial 4. 13. 2, <quote lang="la">Claudia, Rufe, meo nubit peregrina
Pudenti: Macte esto taedis, O Hymenaee, tuis,</quote> <quote>a blessing on thy torches.</quote></note>. There is
<pb n="223"/>
no need to accumulate instances, which may readily be found in the Dictionaries,
especially Mr. White's, to which I am indebted for almost all those already given.
Cicero, Letters to Atticus 15. 29 <seg lang="la">ad finem</seg>, has <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">macte</q> alone without a case, and
Statius (Theb. 2. 495) and Martial (12. 6. 7) have each an instance of <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">macte animi.</q>
In all these passages <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">macte</q> is the form used, with or without <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">esto,</q> as an imperative.
There is one passage where it occurs with <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">esse</q> in a sort of <seg lang="la">oratio obliqua</seg>,
Livy 2. 12, <quote lang="la">iuberem macte virtute esse, si pro mea patria ista virtus staret<note anchored="yes" n="2">In Florus 2. 18. 16, which Mr. White quotes, the reading seems uncertain.</note>.</quote>
Three passages have been quoted for a plural form <q direct="unspecified">macti,</q> with <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">este</q> or <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">estote,</q>
Livy 7. 36, Pliny 2. 12, Curtius 4. 1. &sect; 18; but in each of these there is more or less
MS. authority for <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">macte.</q> In Lucretius 5. 1339 <q direct="unspecified">mactae</q> occurs in quite a different
connexion, <quote lang="la">boves Lucae ferro male mactae:</quote> this however Mr. Munro believes to be
quite a different word. Lastly, in Attius' Epigoni fr. 16 Ribbeck (cited by Nonius
p. 342) <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">macte</q> seems to occur in connexion with <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">exsilio:</q> but the reading of the whole
passage is doubtful in a high degree.</p>
<p>I cannot but think that these facts point decidedly to one conclusion. The passage
from Cato and the note of Servius seem to prove that there was a word <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">mactus,</q>
existing as a participle side by side with <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">macto,</q> like <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">aptus</q> with <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">apto.</q> Priscian
p. 668 P. distinctly says <quote lang="la">macte, id est, magis aucte, antiqui tamen et mactus
dicebant,</quote> and Festus p. 93 has <quote lang="la">mactus, magis auctus,</quote> which he is hardly likely to have
mid if the only part of the word he knew was <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">macte.</q> The testimony of Arnobius is
more doubtful, as the form he quotes is the same as that given by Cato with <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">macte.</q>
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Mactus</q> then, as applied to the gods, seems originally to have meant honoured, as
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">mactare</q> meant to honour. This being the case, it seems to me the natural conclution
that where <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">macte</q> is used, it is used as a participle or adjective, not as an
adverb. We must remember that in all the passages where <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">macte</q> is used, except
Livy 2. 12, it is found with the imperative mood: and Livy is evidently accommodating
an obsolete expression, the grammatical rationale of which he perhaps did not himself
understand, to the <seg lang="la">oratio obliqua</seg>. How then is the use of the vocative to be accounted
for? The question is one on which it would be imprudent to speak confidently: but
I would suggest that we have here a trace of an old construction of the vocative with
the imperative, perhaps even of a connexion between the two forms, the vocative of the
noun and the imperative of the verb, each of which may be said to be analogous to the
other. There is a curious expression in <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName> which suggests a similar explanation,
<foreign lang="greek">ou)=le/  te kai\ ma/la xai=re, qeoi\ de/ toi o)/lbia doi=en</foreign> (Od. 24. 402, Hymn to Apollo 466, with
the variation <foreign lang="greek">me/ga</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">ma/la</foreign>). Here <foreign lang="greek">ou)=le</foreign> is commonly supposed to be the imperative of
an unnused <foreign lang="greek">ou)/lw = u(giai/nw</foreign>, on the strength of Strabo p. 635: but it is evident that
Strabo is merely making an etymological guess from this passage, in order to get a
derivation for <foreign lang="greek">*ou)/lios</foreign>, the Milesian and Delian name of Apollo. I can hardly doubt
that <foreign lang="greek">ou)le</foreign> is the vocative of <foreign lang="greek">ou)=los</foreign>, which had come in some way to be used colloquially
where we should expect an imperative<note anchored="yes" n="3">This suggestion, with the parallel <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">macte,</q> has already appeared in Dr. Hayman's
edition of <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName>'s Odyssey, vol. i. Appendix A. 3, to which I communicated it.
Perhaps the use of <foreign lang="greek">ou)=le</foreign> depends on its junction with <foreign lang="greek">xai=re</foreign>, in which case we may be
reminded of such expressions as <q direct="unspecified">out and spake.</q></note>. A vocative is occasionally found in Greek
contructed with the imperative of the verb substantive, as in the well-known instances
<foreign lang="greek">genou= polumna=stor</foreign> Aesch. Supp. 535, <foreign lang="greek">o)/lbie kw=re ge/noio</foreign> Theocr. 17. 66, which may be
only instances of poetical licence, but may also be remnants of an old form of expression.
The instances in the Latin poets where the vocative is substituted for the
nominative are generally of a different kind, and seem rather poetical than idiomatic<note anchored="yes" n="4">Such e.g. are the instances given in Servius' note, Persius 3. 28, 29, and others.</note>.
<pb n="224"/>
It is quite possible that the omission of <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">esto</q> after <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">macte</q> (as in the present passage
from <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> and the three passages which the dictionaries adduce from Cicero) may
have arisen from the gradual prevalence of a notion that <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">macte</q> itself was an
imperative. Nor does the question whether <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">macte</q> or <q direct="unspecified">macti</q> is the reading in the
passages cited from Livy, Pliny, and Curtius appear to be of much importance. In
Livy's time the expression was doubtless an obsolete one, imperfectly understood, and
those who employed it would be guided rather by a vague apprehension of usage than
by any clear comprehension of its original force. What seems of more importance is
the fact that in the vast majority of instances it is only found with the second person
singular of the imperative. The <q direct="unspecified">male mactae</q> in Lucretius I should myself explain
not, as Mr. Munro does, by supposing that <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">mactus</q> comes from a supposed <q direct="unspecified">macere,</q>
but by a reference to such expressions as <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">mactare malo,</q> <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">infortunio,</q> &amp;c. Lucretius
was using a word which in his time was probably obsolescent, and he may well have
wavered between a conception derived from the expressions just quoted, and one
founded on the later use of <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">mactare</q> in the sense of slaughtering a victim.</p>
<p>Madvig's explanation has of course the advantage of avoiding the hypothesis of an
otherwise unknown construction: but it appears to me unsupported by what is known
of the usage of the word <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">mactus,</q> and it fails to account for the fact of the virtual
restriction of <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">macte</q> to the second person of the imperative. I do not include the
difficulty about the quantity of the final <q direct="unspecified">e,</q> which might doubtless be got over. The
only support of Madvig's view that has occurred to me is the use of the adverb <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">salve</q>
in such phrases as <q direct="unspecified">satin salve,</q> which I have sometimes thought may have come to be
mistaken for an imperative, so that <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">salvete</q> was used in the plural, and a verb
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">salveo</q> assumed. But I am not aware that <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">salve esse</q> is ever found, though there
seems no reason why it should not exist, as Plautus says <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">bene sum</q> as well as <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">bene
est mihi.</q></p>

<p>FOLLOWING the example of <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName> in the Fourth and Eighth Books of the <title>Iliad</title>,
<persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> opens this Book with a council of the gods. It seems however to be introduced
for its own sake rather than to serve the needs of the poem. It gives occasion to two
vigorous speeches, by <persName>Venus</persName> and <persName>Juno</persName>: but <persName>Jupiter</persName>'s final deliverance is a conclusion
in which nothing is concluded; he simply announces his determination to be passive
and to let things take their course as destiny chooses. The gods are blamed for
interfering, and yet not forbidden to interfere: in fact, it is the conduct of Latinus
repeated on a larger scale. The catalogue of the Etruscan forces is obviously taken
from that of the Trojans, which concludes the Second Book of the <title>Iliad</title>. The appearance
of the transformed ships is the natural sequel of the story in the preceding Book,
but it does not otherwise assist the narrative. <persName>Aeneas</persName> learns from Cymodoce only
what he would have learnt a very little later from his own observation; nor does it
appear that he is enabled to make any preparations which he would not have made
otherwise. The story of the battle is open to objections which beset more or less
all stories of battles, at least in heroic times: we feel them however more in reading
<persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> than in reading <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName>. We have a succession of exploits by <seg lang="la">different heroes</seg>,
who are kept from coming into collision with each other till they have contributed
their respective quotas to the series of events. In this Book we hear nothing of
Turnus' being afraid of <persName>Aeneas</persName>, so that we should have expected them to meet as soon
as possible after the latter has landed with his troops: but when the Trojan leader has
slain a few of the enemy, we lose sight of him, and our attention is directed to Pallas.
The poet seems sensible that Pallas and Lausus at any rate might have been expected to
meet, and offers an apology for their not doing so. The rest of the narrative is better
devised. That Pallas should fall by Turnus was necessary for the purposes of the
story: and the incident is told so as to prepare us for sympathizing with the retribution
when it comes. <persName>Aeneas</persName> has a new motive for encountering Turnus: but <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>
recognizes the emergency and obviates it by a divine intervention. Some may object
to the character of Mezentius that we have to take his crimes as it were on credit, and
that what we actually see of him is in the main favourable. But the question is, have
we any difficulty in realizing the conception which the poet intended? Is the affection
subsisting between him and his son incompatible with the tyranny which we are
told that he practised towards his subjects and his alleged impiety? If we pronounce
that it is not, but that the character is a consistent one, we need not blame <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> for
his forbearance in throwing its darker features into the shade.

Virg., had he lived long enough, would

consideration that what <persName>Jupiter</persName> says here

uses <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">seco</q> in the sense of <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">sequor;</q> and
though this is not strictly the case, it is
still not impossible that in a half-punning
way he would put the one where the other
would be more natural: the common
phrase <quote lang="la">sectam sequi</quote> (Cic. <seg lang="la">pro Sest</seg>. 45.
97, <bibl n="Lucr. 5.1115">Lucr. 5.1115</bibl>, &amp;c.) may show that the
two roots were confounded in popular
opinion. So Virg. seems to use <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">dictus</q>
for <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">dicatus</q> 6. 138: and he puts <q direct="unspecified">c&abreve;no</q>

the same as in <quote lang="la">secto limite</quote> <bibl n="Verg. G. 2.278">G. 2. 278</bibl>:

be brothers, sons of Cycnus. Where the
poet has not chosen to be explicit, there
must necessarily be some uncertainty: and
here the uncertainty is increased by the
fact that in what follows Virg. says nothing
more of the story of Cinyras and
Cupavo, but tells instead the legend of
Cycnus, and when he returns from the
digression, specifies only one person as son
of Cycnus and leader of part of the Italian
contingent. The probability is that this
person is <seg lang="la">Cinyras, Cupavo</seg>, as the weaker
member of the pair, being dropped out of
sight . <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Formaeque insigne paternae</q>
must form part of the same sentence as
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">crimen amor vestrum,</q> but it is not easy
to say what the connexion is. Grammatically
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">formae insigne paternae</q> may
be co-ordinate either with <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">amor</q> or
with <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">crimen,</q> or again the words may
contains a separate assertion. In the first
case the meaning would be, <q direct="unspecified">love and the
cognizance of your father's shape are your
reproach,</q> i. e. you labour under a two-fold
reproach, a criminal passion of your own,
and one between your father and Phaethon,
which is represented by your family cognizance.
In the second case Virg. would
mean <q direct="unspecified">love is your reproach, and love is
the cognizance of your father's shape,</q> the
latter words being a condensed way of
saying, love gave rise to the transformation
of which you wear the symbol as a cognizance.
In the third case <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">formaeque insigne
paternae</q> would mean <q direct="unspecified">and your
cognizance is that of your father's shape.</q>
None of these interpretations can be called
really satisfactory: perhaps the truth lies
between the first and the second. Some
have supposed a corruption in the text; but
it would be difficult to point out any word
which could be altered except for the
worse. It is more likely that there is a
reference to some fact which we do not
know, or that the nature of the subject led
the poet to be intentionally obscure. Serv.
seems in some strange way to have taken
the line with what follows, as he mentions
two interpretations, one applying <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">vestrum</q>
to Cycnus and Phaethon, the other
to Cycnus and Phaethon's sisters. He
names also a third, taking <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">vestrum</q> of
Cycnus (Cinyras?) alone. Of modern
interpreters, Sprengel makes <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Amor</q> voc.,
understanding <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">vestrum</q> of Cupid and
<persName>Venus</persName> like <quote>vos o Calliope</quote> 9. 525; Wagn.
throws <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">crimen amor vestrum</q> into a
parenthesis, and takes <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">formaeque insigne
paternae</q> as epexegetical of <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">olorinae
pennae:</q> but both these views seem excluded
by the natural conditions of the
passage. (For a different view of these lines
see the additional notes at the end of the
volume.)</p>

plausibly enough omitting the Thebans.
K. O. M&uuml;ller (Etrusker 1. p. 137) thinks
that the third race was probably Umbrian.
The relation of <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">gens</q> to <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">populus</q> is

(6. p. 263) apparently uses the words
<foreign lang="greek">e)/qnos</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">po/lis</foreign> as respective Greek equivalents
(see J. F. Gronovius on Livy 5. 34).
It would seem that Virg. intends to represent
Mantua as possessing a territory
peopled by three races, each of whom was
master of four cities; just as Strabo (1. c.)
says that Sybaris had four <foreign lang="greek">e)/qnh</foreign> and twentyfive
<foreign lang="greek">po/leis</foreign> subject to her. The words
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">ipsa caput populis</q> preclude either Serv.'s

<quote lang="la">tribus</quote> and <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">populi</q> = <quote lang="la">curiae,</quote> or that
of Niebuhr (Rom. Hist. 1. p. 296 note,
Eng. Tr.) that <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">populi</q> was equivalent to
the territorial <foreign lang="greek">dh=moi</foreign> of Greek cities. Virg.
could never, in a condensed passage like
the present, merely mean the truism that
Mantua was the head of her own <q direct="unspecified">curies</q>
or of her own <q direct="unspecified">demes:</q> to say nothing of
the difficulty of supposing that <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">populi</q>
could ever mean anything but communities
or townships. K. O. M&uuml;ller (Etrusker
l. e.) seems to be right in supposing that
Virg. intended to magnify the legendary
glory of his native city not only by connecting
her with the southern Etruscan
states leagued with <persName>Aeneas</persName>, but also by
representing her as head of the ancient
northern group of twelve Tuscan cities
spoken of by Livy 5. 33 as founded from
the original dodecapolis on the south of
the Apennines. The power of the Etruscans
north of the Po was broken up by
the invasion of the Gauls, and in the time
of the elder Pliny (H. N. 3. 23) Mantua
was the only Tuscan city left in those
regions. (Comp. Mommsen, R&ouml;mische Geschichte,
1. pp. 122, 123.) This may have
been to Virg. only the greater reason for
putting Mantua forward, and assigning
her a position which according to Pliny
(H. N. 3. 20) properly belonged to Bononia
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Tusco de sanguine vires</q> must
mean that the noblest and most powerful

In the above lines Virg. has two passages
of <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName> before him: Il. 5. 4 foll., and
Il. 22. 25 foll. The first, which has been referred
to above on v. 270, is the description
of the helmet and shield of Diomed. The
second is that of Achilles running over
the plain, and appearing to the eyes of the
aged Priam like the baleful dogstar (<foreign lang="greek">kako\n

19. 375 foll. The description of the comets,
of which <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName> knows nothing, would
probably recall to Roman readers the
times of the civil wars, in which the
Romans were twice terrified by the appearance
of a remarkable comet (Pliny 2.

Ovid uses <quote>adhaereo</quote> and <quote lang="la">haereo</quote> with
abl. (probably in imitation of Virg.) M.
5. 38., 12. 95. Virg. may have used the
abl. from a reminiscence of Ennius (Ann.
v. 559), <quote lang="la">premitur pede pes atque armis
arma teruntur:</quote> a similar line of <seg lang="la">Furius
Antias</seg> (Ann. 4) is preserved by Macrob.,
6. 3. 5, <quote lang="la">pressatur pede pes, mucro
mucrone, viro vir</quote> (Taubm.). <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Haeret</q>

of <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">densus,</q> which may give <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">pede</q> and
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">viro</q> something of an instrumental
force. The simile of the contending
winds is modelled upon Il. 16. 765 foll.,
where the fight about the body of Kebriones
is compared to Eurus and Notus
striving in a forest. Virg. has magnified
this into a general contention of the
elements: and has not (like <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName>) dwelt
on the boisterous motion of the struggle,
but on the fixed, stubborn resistance of
each part of the contending universe
(<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">stant obnixa omnia contra</q>). To bring
this out further he adapts another passage
of Hom. (Il. 16. 211 foll.), where the wellmarshalled
ranks of the Myrmidons are
compared to a wall fitted tightly together:
<foreign lang="greek">a)spi\s a)/r' a)spi/d' e)/reide, ko/rus ko/run, a)ne/ra
d' a)nh/r</foreign> (comp. 13. 130 <foreign lang="greek">fra/cantes do/ru douri/,

to the close ranks of one army, but to the
obstinate mass of both when met in the
close of battle. The passage of <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName>

<p>The courage of the Arcadians,
now combining into a head after it has
been kindled here and there by Pallas, is
compared to a fire in a wood, kindled in
different points by a shepherd, and at
length suddenly uniting its strength in
the centre. The simile of fire in a wood
is used by Hom. to illustrate the destructive
fury of Agamemnon (Il. 11. 155), of
<persName>Hector</persName> (Il. 15. 605), and of Achilles (Il.
20. 490), and is employed by Virg., in a
slightly varied form, in two places, for a
similar purpose (A. 2. 304., 12. 521). Its
application here, to illustrate the rapid
contagious spread of a feeling, is modern
compared with Hom.'s treatment of it.

<p>The Italian Amyclae lay between
Caieta and Terracina. Its foundation was
attributed to settlers from Laconia, who
brought with them the name of the Laconian
Amyclae, taken (according to Paus.
3. 2. 6) by the Spartan king Teleclus,
comp. Strab. 8. p. 560 D. The epithet
<pb n="278"/>
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">tacitae</q> probably refers to the story given
by Serv. that Amyclae was taken because,
in consequence of a number of false alarms,
no one was allowed to announce the enemy's
approach. This story is not mentioned in
connexion with the Laconian Amyclae,
either by Pausanias or by Strabo 1. 1.
The Italian Amyclae was, according to
Plin. H. N. 3. 5 (9), destroyed by serpents,
which leads Serv. to give another explanation
of the epithet. But whether the
<q direct="unspecified">silence</q> story originally belonged to the
Greek or the Italian town, there is no

Roman literature with the name <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Amyclae:</q>

<p>Brunck placed this and the following

the generality of subsequent editors have
followed him. Two <persName>Paris</persName> MSS. are said to
confirm the conjecture (see however on
v. 705 below). In some respects the change
would be an improvement, as v. 665 is more
naturally contrasted with 661, 662 than

on the other hand that <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">illum</q> followed

Heyne may be right in supposing
that this and the following line were
written by Virg. in the margin: but the
supposition is not necessary. The early
critics however appear to have felt a difficulty
in the passage, as there was an old
reading <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Ille autem Aenean</q> (still found

obviously <persName>Paris</persName>, but the omission of the

justified in a poem confessedly left uncorrected.
Serv. notices it, attributing it to
metrical necessity. Various attempts to
supply the defect have been made: some
earlier critics suggested <quote lang="la">occubat hic:
carum,</quote> which, with the change of <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">carum</q>
into <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Clarium,</q> Wagn. rather approves,
while Cunningham would read <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">hic cubat.</q>
But the most plausible emendation is Bentley's
(on Hor. Epod. 5. 28), <quote lang="la">Cisseis
regina Parim: <persName>Paris</persName> urbe paterna Occubat,</quote>
which has been approved almost
unanimously by critics, and adopted by
Heyne and all subsequent editors but Gossrau.
There can be little doubt that the
change of <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">creat</q> into <q lang="la" direct="unspecified"><persName>Paris</persName></q> would be an
infinite improvement, and it seems strange
that Virg. should not have so written: but
that is hardly a reason for introducing

such an alteration in the face of all external

that in the text of Virg. <q lang="la" direct="unspecified"><persName>Paris</persName></q> should
have dropped out and have been replaced

<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Cunctatus</q> Gud. originally. Cunningham,
Heyne, and most of the modern editors
place these lines after v. 714, following
a suggestion of Scaliger and other early
critics. Externally the change has little
or no authority: all that can be alleged for
it being that one inferior MS. puts v. 714
after v. 718, while two others (one of them
MS. Canon.) reverse vv. 717, 718, which
may afford a slight presumption that in
some early copy or copies directions were
given for changing the order. On internal
grounds it is very plausible, as the action
described belongs rather to the boar than
to Mezentius. So of the word <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">tergo;</q> the
gnashing of the teeth however, though
more appropriate to the animal (comp. Il.
11. 417), might be attributed as well to
Mezentius by Virg. as by Hom. to Achilles
(Il. 19. 365): comp. Virg.'s description of
Polyphemus 3. 664, and of Hercules 8. 230.
An imitation in Lucan 6. 206 (comp. by
Taubmann), <quote lang="la">Omne repercussum squalenti
missile tergo Frangit, et haerentis mota
cute discutit hastas,</quote> of an elephant in
battle, looks as if he understood Virg.'s
words of a beast rather than a man. Yet
on the other hand it may be urged that
the balance of the com<persName>Paris</persName>on is somewhat
better kept by the order in the text, the
two lines under consideration answering
more or less exactly to <quote lang="la">infremuitque ferox
et inhorruit armos,</quote> and that Virg. may
even have wished to clench the parallel by
describing Mezentius so as to suggest the
animal with which he compares him. In
that case it will be perhaps better to understand
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">tergo</q> in its ordinary sense, Mezentius
being supposed to shake off the
darts raining on him from behind, instead
of giving it the meaning of <q direct="unspecified">shield,</q> which
might be supported to some extent from
v. 482 (note), 784, and a passage from
Sallust quoted by Serv. on 11. 619, <quote lang="la">more

<p>Serv. supposes Orion to be carrying

of a tree for a club of brass would
remind us of Polyphemus and his <quote>trunca
pinus</quote> 3. 659. Thus we should have two
pictures of Orion, one wading through the
sea, the other stalking as a hunter along
<pb n="295"/>
the mountains. But there is great plausibility
in the rival interpretation, which
makes <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">referens</q> mean reproducing or recalling
to mind, Orion's stature being
compared to that of a mountain ash, as
Pandarus and Bitias are compared to
firs or oaks 9. 675, 679 foll. In that case,
however, there would be no reason intimated
why Orion should be represented
on land (for the com<persName>Paris</persName>on to a mountain
ash would hardly be enough to suggest
that he is hunting on the mountains), and
the introduction of a com<persName>Paris</persName>on within a
com<persName>Paris</persName>on would be somewhat awkward,
not to mention that the com<persName>Paris</persName>on to a
tree would be rather an anticlimax after
we have been told that he could walk
through the sea, and would hardly prepare
us for the language of the next line.
The two latter objections would be obviated
if we could suppose that the mountain
itself is included in the com<persName>Paris</persName>on,
as then we might say that Orion's height
is indicated in two ways: when he wades
through the sea his head and shoulders are
above water; when he is on land, he is
like a tree set on a mountain top. This
may be Virg.'s meaning, though of course
the thought will not bear to be pressed, as
if the height of the mountain would be
added to the height of the tree. If we
adopt the former interpretation, we may
suppose that Virg.'s thought was suggested
by a recollection of 3. 659 referred to
above, that having been itself suggested to
him by his description of Orion striding
through the water like Polyphemus, just

<p>This line has been generally misunderstood,
from a notion that <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">vetustas</q>
could mean posterity. No instance, however,
has been adduced where it bears this
sense: in Cic. Mil. 35, <quote lang="la">de me, inquit,
nulla umquam obmutescet vetustas,</quote> the
meaning is that distance of time shall never
cause Milo not to be spoken of: antiquity
shall never make him obsolete: in Prop. 4.
1. 23, <quote lang="la">omnia post obitum fingit maiora
vetustas,</quote> the meaning is that the antiquity
of a thing makes it appear greater.
Similarly <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">fidem latura</q> has been understood
as i. q. <quote lang="la">fidem habitura,</quote> when it
should rather = <quote>fidem allatura,</quote> or <quote lang="la">factura.</quote>
The words can only signify <q direct="unspecified">if any
degree of antiquity shall be able to impart
credibility to so great a deed:</q> i. e. if a
deed, which if reported of modern times
would be justly disbelieved, should be
thought credible because it is sufficiently
ancient. Virg. means to say that the deed
was only possible in antiquity, and could
not have been performed in modern times.
This need not be a mere sentimental enthusiasm
for the past, as the poet may
naturally have thought of what he had
himself lived through in the days of the
second Triumvirate. Thus we need not
discuss the admissibility of taking <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">tanto
operi</q> of Virg.'s own work, which cannot
be reconciled with the rest of the line as
properly understood. Serv.'s note seems
to show that some doubt about the sense
of the words was entertained in his time:

<p>THE fortunes of the Rutulians, which had risen with the successes of Turnus related in
the ninth and tenth books, had already begun to wane with the deaths of Lausus and
Mezentius. The eleventh book contains the gradual preparation for the catastrophe.
Though <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> has taken hints from the later books of the Iliad, his development of
the story is here both original and interesting. After the battles of the tenth book
the last rites are paid to the dead on both sides; but even the mourning of Evander
for Pallas does not seriously lower the key of triumph in which the description of
his funeral is conceived, while the wailing of the Latins is unrelieved by any bright
memories or anticipations. Nothing, it may be remarked, is said about the burial of
Lausus, nor even about that of Mezentius: to whom it may be supposed that <persName>Aeneas</persName>
had not refused his last request (10. 904). The mourning of the Latins is immediately
succeeded by the return of the unsuccessful envoys from Diomed. Here
<persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> has skilfully seized the opportunity of deserting <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName>, and exaggerating,
through the mouth of Diomed, the Trojan fame and exploits of <persName>Aeneas</persName>, at the same
time that his narrative gains by the introduction of a fresh cause for the depression
of the Latins, and the raising of hopes in that party among them which opposed
Turnus. The idea of the council was probably in part suggested to <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> by the
narrative of the eighteenth Iliad: and as there the opposition of Polydamas throws
the responsibility of continuing the war outside the walls upon <persName>Hector</persName>, so here the
invective of Drances (who is more or less the leader of a party), following upon the
pacific proposals of the king, brings out the determined will of Turnus as the only real
stay left to the Rutulian cause. As far as the mechanism of the story goes, it may
be said that Turnus plays the part both of <persName>Paris</persName> and <persName>Hector</persName>&mdash;of the lover and the
warrior, though their moral position is the reverse of his. <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> has, however, done
something to mitigate this anomaly, and with it the odium of <persName>Aeneas</persName>' attitude, by
representing Latinus as acknowledging the evident signs of the divine will, and
recommending a policy of concession. He has also indicated more prominently than
before a turbid element in the character of the Rutulian hero, which to a certain
extent diminishes our sympathy with his resistance. The word <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">violentia,</q> applied to
Turnus in the eleventh and twelfth books, is applied to no one else in <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>.</p>
<p>The sudden breaking-up of the council under pressure of a Trojan attack gives
Turnus what he desires. In the combats which ensue, the successes of the virgin
Camilla (whose figure is a bright relief to the tedium of the <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>ian battle) sustain
the Rutulian cause till she falls. The idea of introducing a virgin warrior was doubtless
suggested to <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> by the part played by Penthesilea in the Epic cycle. Camilla's
<foreign lang="greek">a)ristei/a</foreign> may be considered as the counterpart to that of Mezentius in the previous
book. Though the Iliad had, in Sarpedon, supplied <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> with the conception of a
hero graced with a special divine favour, yet doomed to fall, we must no less admire
the freshness and originality with which he has, in this instance, filled up the outline.
<persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> doubtless drew upon some Italian legend now lost: it may be, as Heyne suggests
in his Excursus to this book, that there was a tomb of Camilla among the Volsci,
around which her story was kept alive.

If, with most editors before Wagn., and
with Ribbeck, we read <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">iuvabit</q> (Pal.,

be that Evander is glad that Pallas has
died as joint general of the Trojans, after

Gud. re-corrected, supported by Rom. <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">iuvare</q>),
Evander will say that he would

little doubt that the former is the more
natural expression for the bereaved father,
and more in accordance with the lines
which follow, while there is nothing in the

Virg. in fact says just what he had said
10. 509, <quote lang="la">Cum tamen ingentis Rutulorum

Africa, in the Pentapolis or some other place:
but his notices are confused and perhaps

for a person or thing Lucan 5. 227 (quoted
by Serv.), Sil. 13. 221, being apparently a
technical term in hunting (comp. Forc.
s.v. <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Subsessor</q>). This seems also to be the
sense of the word in Manil. 5. 303 (speaking
of Philoctetes), <quote lang="la">Maior et armatis
hostis subsederat exsul,</quote> where <quote lang="la">hostis</quote>
(which Wakef. wished to alter into <quote lang="la">hosti</quote>)
may be acc. pl. And this might very
well be its sense here, <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">devictam Asiam</q>
being understood as a bold expression for
<quote lang="la">victorem Asiae,</quote> something like <quote lang="la">Alpes
apertas</quote> 10. 13, which however is not an
exact parallel. But it seems more probable
that Virg. refers to the Greek
<foreign lang="greek">e)/fedroi</foreign>, and means that Aegisthus took up
the combat with Agamemnon when Asia
was worsted. Mr. Price, formerly of St.
John's Coll. Camb., acutely objects that
Aegisthus would rather be called <foreign lang="greek">e)/fedros</foreign>
to Agamemnon than to Asia, as Philoctetes
in the passage just cited is to the enemy:
but if we suppose Virg. to have coined the
expression, he might exercise a certain
liberty in the matter, and the mention of
Asia was quite necessary if the image was
to be used at all: he might recollect too
that <foreign lang="greek">e)/fedros</foreign> is used with a gen. in the
sense of successor to a person. Mr. Price's
own interpretation is that Aegisthus lay
at the bottom of Asia, like lees in a cask,
as a further difficulty (he comp. 5. 498,
<bibl n="Lucr. 5.497">Lucr. 5.497</bibl>); and this view, with a little
modification, would be quite reconcilable
with that advocated above, and with the
passage from Manilius. There is no other
instance of <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">subsidere</q> with an acc. in this
sense: but it is only a variety of the other,
both meaning to watch for; and the use of
<quote lang="la">subsidia</quote> for reserves (comp. Varro L. L.
5. 90) would naturally lead Virg. to the
employment of the verb. Cerda says that
<foreign lang="greek">e)/fedros</foreign> is actually used of an adulterer:
but he gives no instances, nor do Lidd.
and Scott notice the use. Val. Max.
twice uses the words <quote lang="la">subsessor alieni
matrimonii</quote> (2. 6. 5., 7. 2, ext. 1), apparently
referring to treacherous lying
in wait, and Arnob. 4. 23., 5, 20 employs
<quote lang="la">subsessor</quote> as a synonyme for <quote lang="la">adulter.</quote>
The difficulty of the expression has led to
two remarkable varieties of reading, <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">devicta
Asia,</q> mentioned with preference by
Serv. and found in three of Ribbeck's cursives
(in two of them, including Gud.,
from a correction), and <q direct="unspecified">possedit,</q> Rom.,
Med. second reading, and a variant in
Gud., perhaps from a gloss of Serv., who
gives as possible explanations of <q direct="unspecified">subsedit</q>
<quote>post possedit</quote> and <quote>dolo possedit.</quote>
Forb. thinks <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">devictam Asiam</q>
is the captured wealth of Asia, which
would be less forcible than either of the
interpretations given above. It is in
keeping with Virg.'s love of variety that
he should mention Clytaemnestra alone in
the preceding line, Aegisthus in this.</p>

<div2 type="commline" n="269">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Invidisse deos</lemma> can only be constructed
as an exclamation, unless we
consider with Wagn. and others that vv.
266&mdash;268 are out of their places, having
been either added as an after-thought by
Virg. or deranged by his transcribers. To
suppose that Virg. could have intended to
interrupt the construction after v. 265
and return to it again here is quite out of
the question. There is no inappropriateness,
as Wagn. thinks, in the exclamation,
which is a sort of reflection on the divine
<foreign lang="greek">fqo/nos</foreign>, <q direct="unspecified">surely the gods need not have
grudged me this.</q> See Madv. &sect; 399. The
feeling is the same in 4. 550., 5. 82, though
the expression is different. <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Aris</q> is read
by all Ribbeck's MSS. but two cursives,
one of which has the word altered into
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">agris</q> by a late correction, while the
other (the Codex Minoraugiensis) has
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">oris,</q> found also in the <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Oblongus Pierii.</q>
<pb n="332"/>
In spite of its external authority, <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">aris</q>
seems exceedingly improbable, as there
seems no reason why the altars should be
mentioned, and the word may have been
introduced from a recollection of 3. 332.
But it is not easy to say what word should
take its place. <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Agris</q> would seem most
probable in itself, as <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">oris</q> looks too much
like an introduction from v. 281 below:
but perhaps it is best to let external
authority decide in favour of the latter,
which was the old reading before Heins.
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Argis,</q> the reading of some of Pierius'
copies, would have great plausibility (comp.
2. 95): but though it would be natural in

with <q direct="unspecified">Calydona.</q> No MS. appears to give
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">arvis,</q> which is another possible variety.

and <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">arvis.</q> In Catull. 62 (64). 132 the

the previous accusative makes some
difference, though probably either construction
would be possible here, just as in

<p>Drances, as Heyne remarks, is a
more respectable Thersites. Perhaps we
may say that he is a compound of Thersites
and Polydamas, with the latter
of whom Ursinus parallels him. (See Introduction
to this book.) Some thought that
Virg. had Cicero in his mind, Turnus being
Antony; which may be so far true that
Drances, like Cicero and Demosthenes
both, is better at speaking than at fighting.
We are rather reminded of the part played
by Hanno against Hannibal in Livy 21 and
23. Macrob. Sat. 5. 2 thinks that Virg.
imitated the altercation between Agamemnon
and Achilles, which is less likely.

The narrative that follows, down to v.
584, is supposed by Heinrich and Peerlkamp
to have been inserted after the
completion of the poem. The latter thinks
that it was intended to come at the end of
Book 7, but that Tucca and Varius placed
it here. It is of course true that it is
calculated to interest the reader rather
than Opis, who can hardly have been
ignorant of the facts; but this is the fault
of the poet, and might easily be paralleled
from other passages in epic narrative,
where such things are difficult to avoid.
Gossrau remarks that the ancients not

many modern letters only resemble letters

The use of <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Dianae</q> here, and <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Diana</q>

neighbourhood of the Thermodon was,

come to the Thermodon from the north of
the Euxine, and Pausanias 10. 31. 8 mentions
a picture in which Penthesilea was
represented as carrying a bow <foreign lang="greek">toi=s *skuqikoi=s

Thracian Salmydessus is confusedly spoken
of as in the neighbourhood of the Thermodon.
Diodorus 2. 46 speaks of the Amazons
as conquering the tribes extending from
the Tanais to Thrace. Whether the Greek
poets, and <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> who followed them (see
also 5. 312), meant by the Thrace which
they connected with the Amazons anything

to say whether <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">pulsae</q> here and
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">pulsa</q> v. 793 mean beaten off or wounded.
The first would on the whole be the more
natural meaning here, as answering to
the etymological sense of <q direct="unspecified">tropacum</q>
(comp. <quote lang="la">pulsi Turni gloria</quote> 10. 143), and
being undoubtedly the more usual meaning
of the word. The second would suit v.
793 better, and is supported by Prop. 5. 9.
15, <quote lang="la">Maenalio iacuit pulsus tria tempora
ramo Cacus.</quote> Perhaps it is safest to say
that Virg. was glad to avail himself of the
various associations of the word, beating
off, putting to flight, and striking. Arruns
might naturally regard himself as repelling
an enemy, and he would characteristically
express himself as if he were conquering
her in fair fight and even making her fly,
at the same time that the poet might be
determined in his choice of the word by
its further and more primitive meaning.
So just below, v. 796, Gossrau, after Peerlkamp,
finds a difficulty in <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">turbatam,</q> as
implying that Camilla did not die with
fortitude. Virg. probably chose the word
partly from the association of <q direct="unspecified">proturbo</q> and
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">exturbo,</q> partly as suggesting the notion
of routing an army, partly again as expressing
the suddenness and surprise of
the event. There is a somewhat similar
fluctuation in the meaning of the words
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">victus</q> and <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">fusus</q> in such passages as

<p>Heyne supposes the sense to be,

2. 583 foll., Peerlkamp, that though he
thought the deed a glorious one, he did
not ask to be known as having done it.
The two views may be reconciled if we
attend to the character of Arruns. He is
represented as afraid of the deed he is
nevertheless longing to do: he resolves
to do it by stealth, at the least risk to himself:
and characteristically, in praying to
Apollo, he veils his cowardice under an
appearance of magnanimity. He professes
to wish to kill Camilla in the interest of
his countrymen, who are being destroyed
by a female fury, disgrace being added to
injury: he extenuates the glory of the
deed; after all, it is merely killing a
woman, and he can afford to rest on his
other exploits, so he will not claim this:
and what is really an important part of
his prayer, his safe return home, he affects
to treat not as a matter of prayer at all,
but as a sort of concession which he is
willing to make. Apollo understands him,
and treats the request as involving two
prayers, of which he grants one and refuses
the other. When the deed is done,
his first impulse is to hide himself from the
possible consequences: afterwards, finding
himself unmolested, he is proud of it
(v. 854): and his punishment is, that he
is killed in the moment of his triumph,
while his comrades treat his fall as a thing
of no consequence. With <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">inglorius</q> we

<p>THE fortunes of the Latins being again broken by the death of Camilla, their hopes
necessarily centre upon Turnus, whose character and fate form the main interest of
the concluding book. It is Turnus' conduct which gives the final justification to
<persName>Aeneas</persName>' position. Latinus, hesitating and distracted as before, would make a treaty
and give his daughter to <seg lang="la"><persName>Aeneas</persName>: Turnus</seg> disdains the idea, and will appeal to single
combat. The preliminaries are arranged: but the truce, on which they depend, is
broken by the agency of <persName>Juno</persName> and Turnus' sister Juturna. Turnus neither makes
any attempt (as <persName>Aeneas</persName> does) to keep the peace, nor ventures to seek out his powerful
adversary. But when <persName>Aeneas</persName>, wounded by an arrow from an unseen hand, retires a
little from the battle, Turnus waxes bold and throws himself into the fray, thus losing
all claim to sympathy. In the battles which ensue, the two heroes are prevented for
some time from meeting by the agency of Juturna; but the extreme peril of the city,
which the Trojans are on the point of taking, at length recalls Turnus to encounter
<persName>Aeneas</persName>, who has all along only joined in the battle on extreme provocation. The
dignity with which Turnus at length resolves to meet the supreme moment goes far to
compensate for the want of firmness and patriotism which he has hitherto displayed.</p>
<p>The mechanism of the narrative is not always easy (see, for instance, on v. 81 foll.).
The frequency of supernatural intervention is remarkable. The breaking of the
treaty, the healing of <persName>Aeneas</persName>' wound, the keeping away of Turnus from <persName>Aeneas</persName>, the
thought of taking the city, to say nothing of a number of minor incidents towards the
end of the story, are all due to divine agency. This may be partly owing to the fact
that <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> has drawn largely in this book upon Il. 19&mdash;22, where, as the poem draws
to its catastrophe and a greater interest attaches to each incident, the interference of
the gods becomes more and more frequent. The story of the suicide of the queen
Amata, however, is, as remarked in the notes, conceived in the spirit, not of the
<persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName>ic epic, but of the Attic tragedy; and the introduction of Juturna is characteristically
<persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>ian.</p>

<foreign lang="greek">ei)rwta=|s m' e)lqo/nta qea\ qeo/n</foreign>. Virg. apparently
makes Juturna a presiding nymph
of lakes and rivers generally. There was
a lake of Juturna about six Roman miles
from the fountain of Numicus (Cluver.
Ital. Ant. p. 722) formed by a stream
flowing from the Alban mount. Its waters
were held peculiarly wholesome, and
hence Serv. here and Varro (L. L. 5. 71)
derive the name from <quote>iuvo.</quote> Serv. says
that <seg lang="la">Lutatius Catulus</seg> built a temple to
Juturna in the <seg lang="la">Campus Martius</seg> (comp.
Ov. F. 1. 463, <quote lang="la">Te quoque lux eadem,
Turni soror, aede recepit, Hic ubi virginea
campus obitur aqua</quote>), and that a special
festival, the Juturnalia, was kept by those
<quote lang="la">qui artificium aqua (aquae?) exercent.</quote>
The <quote lang="la">lacus Iuturnae</quote> in the forum was
close to the temple of the Dioscuri (Ov. F.
1. 708). Preller (R&ouml;mische Mythologie,
p. 508) thinks it probable that the cultus
of Juturna on the Numicus was older than
that at Rome. Teuffel (Paully's Realencycl.
4. p. 686) supposes that Virg. made Juturna
sister of Turnus from a false notion of an
etymological connexion between the names.

Comp. Hyginus fab. 127, who quotes versions
which made Telemachus, not Ulysses,
the father. In 7. 47 foll. Latinus is son
of Faunus and Marica, grandson of Picus
and great-grandson of Saturn: a genealogy
apparently quite different. Serv. says that
many identified Marica with Circe, an
easy gloss. If the two accounts are to be
harmonized, it must be done, as Heyne
suggests, by the story of Circe's love for
Picus (Ov. M. 14. 320 foll., A. 7. 189 foll.).
This would make the Sun the greatgrandfather,
not the grandfather, of
Latinus: but Virg. is sometimes vague

hiatus defends the MS. reading on the
ground that the identity of the final vowel
of <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">anima</q> with the initial vowel of
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">atque</q> may have necessitated a pause on
the former. Whether this be the true
explanation or no, it would be hazardous
to alter the text in face of such MS.
authority. It is possible that Virg., who
was freer in allowing himself metrical
licences than either Lucretius or Catullus,
may have wished to imitate such hiatus
as <foreign lang="greek">fi/le_ e(kure/, deino/s te, h( d' a)ndri\ i)ke/lh</foreign>
in Hom. It is shown in the Excursus to
this book that he renewed some of the
apparent irregularities of Hom. and Enn.,
not because he understood their etymological
justification, where there was one,
but for the sake of giving his verse occasionally
an antiquarian flavour. The fragments
of Enn. offer no instance of such a
hiatus as the present, though they furnish
one of the lengthening of the final <emph>a</emph>

the heroes, represented by weights in the
scales: the heaviest weight or death draws
down the scale, which thus signifies the
fall of the hero whose fate is in it.
Aeschylus in his play called the <foreign lang="greek">*yuxostasi/a</foreign>
(of which only scattered notices remain),
appears to have reversed the metaphor,
representing Zeus as weighing not the
deaths, but the lives of Memnon and
Achilles. (See the notices of this play
collected in Nauck's Fragmenta Tragicorum,
or Hermann's Aeschylus.) Otto
Jahn, <quote>Arch&auml;ologische Beitr&auml;ge</quote> p. 129,
discusses several antique works of art
on which this or other <foreign lang="greek">*yuxostasi/ai</foreign> were
depicted. The souls of the heroes appear
to have been given as small figures, one in
each scale, in one case with wings. Milton
(at the end of the fourth Book of Paradise
Lost) has reversed the treatment of Virg.
and Hom., Satan's scale kicking the beam.
The metaphor is generalized by Aeschylus
Suppl. 822, where Zeus is addressed with
the words: <foreign lang="greek">so\n d' e)pi/pan *zugo\n tala/ntou</foreign>,
and Pers. 345, <foreign lang="greek">*)all' w(=de dai/mwn tis kate/fqeire

<head>EXCURSUS TO BOOK XII.</head>
<head>ON THE LENGTHENING OF SHORT FINAL SYLLABLES IN <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>.</head>
<head>(<emph>Originally contributed to the Journal of Philology.</emph>)</head>
<p>[Most of this paper was written before the appearance of the second volume of Corssen's
second edition of his Aussprache, Vokalismus, &amp;c., der Lateinischen Sprache. It is satisfactory
to find that the view here expressed is in the main identical with Corssen's, who
discusses the subject at some length, vol. ii. p. 436 foll.]</p>
<p>The fact that <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> allowed himself certain licences in the way of lengthening short
final syllables, licences which were wholly or in great part avoided by his immediate
predecessors in poetry, has, as was natural, often been noticed. The most detailed
discussion of the matter is that of Philip Wagner in No. XII. of his <emph>Quaestiones Vergilianae</emph>.
Gossrau has a paragraph upon it in the <quote>Excursus de Hexametro Vergilii</quote>
affixed to his edition of the Aeneid of <date value="1846">1846</date>: but this paragraph is, as the writer himself
professes, little more than a simpler reproduction of what Wagner had said. The
subject is treated briefly by Lachmann (on <bibl n="Lucr. 2.27">Lucr. 2.27</bibl>) and comprehensively by Lucian
M&uuml;ller (De <seg lang="la">Re Metrica</seg>, p. 324&mdash;333): but A. Weidner (Commentar zu Vergil's Aeneis
I. und II.) takes no notice of the instances occurring in those books. While Ph. Wagner
and Lucian M&uuml;ller would account for these licences almost entirely on the ground of
the position of the word in the verse, the Plautine critics (<note anchored="yes" n="1">Ritschl, <emph>Prolegomena to Trinummus</emph>,
Fleckeisen, <emph>Neue Jahrb&uuml;cher</emph>, 61. p. 17 foll.
W. Wagner, <emph>Introduction to Aulularia</emph>.</note> Ritschl, fleckeisen, and
W. Wagner) have thought that in some cases at least <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> was not unconscious of the
same uncertainty of quantity which prevailed in the earlier period of Latin poetry.
The object of this paper is to show that neither explanation is wholly true: that <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>,
though probably unconscious of any grammatical or etymological propriety in the
employment of these scansions, and though always anxious to consult the requirements
of metrical elegance, still did not employ them without due selection and a regard to the
usage of the earlier writers, however imperfectly the reasons of this usage were understood
in his own day.</p>
<p>The most decided innovation<note anchored="yes" n="2">Lachmann, l. c. <quote lang="la">quo primo Maro usus
est.</quote> Lucian M&uuml;ller, p. 322, quotes a verse
of Attius (<emph>ap. Festum</emph>, p. 146): <quote>Calones
famulique metallique caculaeque:</quote> but there
are no instances in the remaining fragments
of Ennius or Lucilius, nor in Lucretius,
Catullus, or the remaining verses of Cicero.</note> introduced into the hexameter by <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>, the lengthening
of the first <emph>que</emph> in verse-beginnings like <quote lang="la">Liminaque laurusque Dei</quote> or verseendings
like <quote>Noemonaque Prytanimque</quote>, need not detain us, as it is an obvious
<pb n="470"/>
imitation of <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName>'s <foreign lang="greek">*la/mpon te *klu/tio/n te, *proqoh/nwr te *klo/nio/s te k.t.l.</foreign> In
<persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName> <foreign lang="greek">te</foreign> is mostly lengthened before double consonants, liquids, and sibilants; and
<persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> has scrupulously followed his master. Of the sixteen instances collected by
Wagner fourteen present <emph>que</emph> lengthened before a double consonant: the other two are
<quote lang="la">Liminaque laurusque</quote> (A. 3. 91) and <quote lang="la">Eurique Zephyrique</quote> (<bibl n="Verg. G. 1.371">G. 1. 371</bibl>). Neither
is it necessary to dwell upon endings like <quote lang="la">molli fultus hyacintho,</quote> <quote lang="la">linquens profugus
hymenaeos,</quote> which, like Catullus' <quote lang="la">non despexit hymenaeos,</quote> <quote lang="la">novo auctus
hymenaeo,</quote> are clearly due to the Greek rhythm.</p>
<p>The rest of these licences are distinctly traceable to Roman sources, and require a
longer consideration.</p>
<p>The early poetry of Greece and <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> is marked by considerable uncertainty of
quantity: thus in the <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName>ic poems we have both <foreign lang="greek">)a_nh/r</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">)a^nh/r, fi_/los</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">fi^/los,
)a_pone/esqai</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">)a^poti=sai</foreign> and so on. This uncertainty is observable in Latin chiefly
in the final syllables of nouns and verbs: a fact probably due in great measure to the
rule of Latin accentuation, which forbade the accent to fall on the last syllable<note anchored="yes" n="3">This is dwelt upon by Corssen, 2, p. 441.</note>
Final syllables which were long by nature were obscured by the backward position of
the accent, and gradually became short. This process did not stop at the Augustan
age, but continued till even the final <emph>o</emph> of the present indicative was shortened by
hexameter poets. Verse-writing at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> began at a time when the tendency to
shorten final vowels originally long had commenced, but had not nearly prevailed over
the natural quantity. This state of things is most clearly discernible in Plautus: but
it is sufficiently obvious even in the stricter measure of Ennius. Lucilius, as was
natural, allowed himself, to a certain extent, a similar freedom; but the poets of the
<seg lang="la">later republic, Catullus</seg> and Lucretius, became much stricter. Except in Greek endings
like <quote lang="la">despexit hymenaeos,</quote> &amp;c., Catullus never lengthens a short final vowel,
unless we are to count the much-emended line 100. 6, <quote lang="la">Perfecta exigit<emph>ur</emph> <seg lang="la">unica amicitia</seg>,</quote>
to which Mr. Ellis apparently does not object. Two instances have been restored to
Lucretius by Mr. Munro: 2. 27, <quote lang="la">Nec domus argento ful<emph>get</emph> <seg lang="la">auroque renidet</seg>,</quote> and 5.
1049, <quote lang="la">Quid vellet facere ut scir<emph>et</emph> <seg lang="la">animoque videret</seg>:</quote> but even these were altered by
Lachmann or with his approval, for they are solitary in his author. There is nothing
of the kind in the fragments of Cicero's verses. <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> deserted the strictness of his
immediate predecessors, and recurred, to a certain extent, to the practice of Ennius<note anchored="yes" n="4">Horace is much freer than Catullus, as
<persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> is than Lucretius. Except <quote lang="la">Teucer
et Sthenelus sciens</quote> (1 C. 15. 24), which he
altogether rejects, and <quote lang="la">Si non periret immiserabilis</quote>
(3 C. 5. 17), and <quote lang="la">Ignis Iliacas
domos</quote> (1 C. 15. 36), about which he has
doubts, Mr. Munro admits the rest of these
scansions in Horace without hesitation.
These amount to about ten:  but it should be
remarked that none of them occur in the
fourth book of the Odes, the Epistles, or the
<seg lang="la">Ars Poetica</seg>, in which Horace was writing at
his best.</note>.
It will be worth while to compare the usages of the two poets in detail.</p>
<p>(1) Lengthening of final syllables in <emph>r</emph>. (<emph>a</emph>) Nouns. Masculines in <emph>or</emph>. As far as I
can ascertain there is no instance in the fragments of Ennius where this ending is short<note anchored="yes" n="5">So in Plautus, according to Fleckeisen
(ap. C. F. W. M&uuml;ller, <emph>Plautinische Prosodie</emph>, p.
42 foll.), it is exclusively long: but the Plautine
critics are not entirely agreed on this canon.</note>
either in arsis or thesis. Ennius writes not only:</p>
<p><quote>Postilla, germana sor<emph>or</emph>, <seg lang="la">errare videbar</seg></quote> (Ann. 42),</p>
<p><quote>O pater, O genit<emph>or</emph> O sanguen <seg lang="la">Dis oriundum</seg></quote> (Ann. 117),</p>
<p><quote lang="la">Qui clam<emph>or</emph> oppugnantis vagore volanti</quote> (Ann. 408),</p>

<p><quote>Imbricit<emph>or</emph> aquiloque <seg lang="la">suo cum flamine contra</seg></quote> (Ann. 424), but also</p>
<p><quote>Clam<emph>or</emph> in <seg lang="la">caelum volvendus per aethera</seg> vagit</quote> (Ann. 520), unless with Lachmann

lines of <seg lang="la">Ennius above</seg> quoted the following from <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>:

<p><quote lang="la">Omnia vincit Am<emph>or</emph>, <seg lang="la">et nos cedamus Amori</seg></quote> (E. 10. 69).</p>

<p><quote>Quippe dol<emph>or</emph>, <seg lang="la">omnis stetit imo volnere sanguis</seg></quote> (A. 12. 422).</p>
<p><quote lang="la">Et Messapus equum domit<emph>or</emph>, <seg lang="la">et fortis</seg> Asilas</quote> (<emph>ib</emph>. 550)</p>
<p>Lucian M&uuml;ller thinks the <seg lang="la">caesura sufficient</seg> to account for all these cases both in
Ennius and <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>, denies the possibility of clam<emph>or</emph> in thesis, and asserts that in the
second part of the sixth century A.U.C. this syllable was mostly shortened. No case of
such shortening, however, as has been seen, can be quoted from Ennius. <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>, who
was probably ignorant of the reason which made Ennius write as he did, viz. the original
length of this syllable, which corresponds to the Greek <foreign lang="greek">-wr</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">-wn</foreign>, and who only
wished to give an antique flavour to his verse by suggesting such echoes of the Ennian
hexameter, would never have dreamed of using the final <emph>or</emph> long except in arsis: but
M&uuml;ller can hardly be right in applying the same measure to both poets.</p>
<p>How purely a matter of form this licence was with <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> will become apparent when
we consider how far, and (from an etymological point of view) how unjustifiably, he
pushes his employment of it. Ennius, using <emph>iubar</emph> masculine, may have had some
justification for writing</p>
<p><quote lang="la">Interea fugit albus iub<emph>ar</emph> <seg lang="la">Hyperionis cursum</seg></quote> (A. 547)<note anchored="yes" n="7">Corssen (l. c. p. 501, note) accounts for this
scansion by the position of <emph>iubar</emph> in the verse,
and the fact of its being followed by a Greek
word.</note>,
but no grammatical propriety can be alleged for such scansions as</p>
<p><quote lang="la">Desine plura, pu<emph>er</emph>, <seg lang="la">et quod nunc instat agamus</seg></quote> (Verg. <bibl n="Verg. Ecl. 9">E. 9. 66</bibl>);</p>
<p><quote lang="la">Si quis eb<emph>ur</emph>, <seg lang="la">aut mixta rubent ubi lilia multa</seg></quote> (A. 12. 68);
still less for</p>
<p><quote>Pingue sup<emph>er</emph> <seg lang="la">oleum infundens ardentibus extis</seg></quote> (A. 6. 254).
The lines</p>
<p><quote lang="la">Ostentans artemque pat<emph>er</emph> <seg lang="la">arcumque sonantem</seg></quote> (A. 5. 521) and <quote lang="la">Congredior: fer
sacra pat<emph>er</emph> <seg lang="la">et concipe foedus</seg></quote> (A. 12. 13) would seem to recall the original length of
the final syllable of <emph>pater:</emph> but this had been forgotten as early as Ennius, who constantly
uses it short. This is doubted by Corssen (l. c. p. 502).</p>
<p>(<emph>b</emph>) Inflections of verbs ending in <emph>r</emph>. Ennius writes</p>
<p><quote lang="la">Quirine Pater vener<emph>or</emph> <seg lang="la">Horamque Quirini</seg></quote> (Ann. 121),
in accordance with the natural length of the syllable and the analogy of Plautine usage:
but <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>, who has not imitated him in lengthening the last syllable of the first person
sing. passive, has lengthened that of the third in the following instances:</p>
<p><quote>Altius ingredit<emph>ur</emph> <seg lang="la">et mollia crura reponit</seg></quote> (<bibl n="Verg. G. 3.76">G. 3. 76</bibl>).</p>
<p><quote lang="la">Tum sic Mercurium alloquit<emph>ur</emph>, <seg lang="la">et talia mandat</seg></quote> (A. 4. 222).</p>
<p><quote lang="la">Olli serva dat<emph>ur</emph>, <seg lang="la">operum haud ignara Minervae</seg></quote> (A. 5. 284).</p>
<p>This syllable is invariably short in Ennius, except in the very doubtful fragment
<quote>horitatur induperator</quote> Ann. 350, nor is it often, if at all, long in Plautus. The first
person plural has its ending lengthened by <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>, A. 2. 411,</p>
<p><quote>Nostrorum obruim<emph>ur</emph>, <seg lang="la">oriturque miserrima caedes</seg>,</quote>
again without precedent in the fragments of Ennius.</p>
<p>(2) Lengthening of final syllables in <emph>s</emph>. (<emph>a</emph>) Nouns.</p>
<p>The last syllable of <emph>sanguis</emph> (= <emph>sanguin-s</emph>) was originally long, and so is always used
by Lucretius and once by <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>. The length of the last syllable of <emph>pulvis</emph> in Ennius
(Ann. 286),
<quote lang="la"><l>Iamque fere pulv<emph>is</emph> <seg lang="la">ad caelum vasta videtur</seg>,
<pb n="472"/>
and in <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> (A. 1. 478),</l>
</quote></p>
<p><quote lang="la">Per terram, et versa pulv<emph>is</emph> <seg lang="la">inscribitur hasta</seg>,</quote>
is probably to be originally accounted for by the fact that <emph>pulvis</emph> = <emph>pulvis-s</emph> as <emph>Ceres</emph>=
<emph>Ceres-s</emph>. But there is some difficulty about such a scansion as <emph>popul&umacr;s</emph> (Enn. Ann. 90),</p>
<p><quote>Iamque expectabat popul<emph>us</emph> <seg lang="la">atque ora tenebat</seg>;</quote>
followed by <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>, <bibl n="Verg. G. 3.189">G. 3. 189</bibl>, 4. 453, A. 5. 337:
<quote><l>Invalid<emph>us</emph>, <seg lang="la">etiamque tremens, etiam inscius aevi</seg>:</l>
<l lang="la">Non te nulli<emph>us</emph> <seg lang="la">exercent numinis irae</seg>:</l>
<l lang="la">Emicat Euryal<emph>us</emph>, <seg lang="la">et munere victor amici</seg>.</l>
</quote></p>
<p>This is a licence which is doubtful even in Plautus (M&uuml;ller, Pl. Pr. p. 52), and it seems
most probable that Ennius (and after him <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>) was imitating the lengthening of the
Greek <foreign lang="greek">-os</foreign> of the second declension in such lines as Iliad 1. 153, 244,
<quote lang="greek"><l>*deu=ro maxhso/menos, e)pei\ ou)/ti moi ai)/tioi/ ei)sin.</l>
<l>*xwo/menos, o(/t' a)/riston *)axaiw=n ou)de\n e)/tisas.</l></quote></p>
<p><quote>Fatalisque man<emph>us</emph>, <seg lang="la">infensa Etruria Turno</seg></quote> (A. 12. 232) and</p>
<p><quote lang="la">Sicubi magna Iov<emph>is</emph> <seg lang="la">antiquo robore quercus</seg></quote> (<bibl n="Verg. G. 3.332">G. 3. 332</bibl>) may perhaps be considered
an extension of this licence. So A. 3. 112, <quote lang="la">Idaeumque nem<emph>us</emph>: <seg lang="la">hic fida silentia
sacris</seg>.</quote></p>
<p>Whether Ennius lengthened the dative plural in -<emph>bus</emph> cannot be ascertained, and
such a scansion is not frequent in Plautus. But <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> does not hesitate to write (A.
4. 64)
<quote><l>Pectorib<emph>us</emph> <seg lang="la">inhians spirantia consulit exta</seg>.</l>
</quote></p>
<p>(<emph>b</emph>) Verbs. The only cases seem to be A. 9. 610, <quote>Terga fatigam<emph>us</emph> hasta,</quote> a
quantity for which no analogy can be proved in Ennius, though Plautus perhaps has
<quote lang="la">Venim<emph>&umacr;s</emph></quote> <bibl n="Pl. Cur. 3.1">Curc. 438</bibl>, and Lucilius <quote>iacim<emph>&umacr;s</emph></quote> 9 p. 6 (Gerlach): and 11. 111, <quote>Orat<emph>is</emph>:
<seg lang="la">equidem et vivis concedere vellem</seg>.</quote></p>
<p>(3) Endings in <emph>t</emph>. Third person singular of verbs. The <emph>-at</emph> of the indicative present
1st conjugation, though long by nature and frequently scanned accordingly in
Plautus, is of variable quantity in Ennius, but mostly long.
Compare</p>

<head>ON PARTS OF RIBBECK'S PROLEGOMENA CRITICA TO HIS EDITION OF <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName><note anchored="yes" n="1">Reprinted from the Journal of Philology, vol. i. Nos. 1 and 2.</note></head>
<div2 type="Part" n="1">
<head>I.</head>
<p>M. RIBBECK has conferred a great boon on all critical students of <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> by the careful
collations which he has made or caused to be made of the principal MSS. In his Prolegomena
he has accumulated a large amount of collateral learning, bearing on the life
of the poet and the criticism of the text, the value of which I cannot appraise as I
should wish, owing to my want of acquaintance with the subject. I am anxious to say
this at starting, because the remarks which I am going to make will be chiefly concerned
with points on which I have the misfortune to differ from him. The parts of his Prolegomena
which I purpose to examine are the three later chapters on the Georgics, the
chapter on the Aeneid, and a few points in later chapters, all of them connected with
the integrity of the text as we at present possess it.</p>
<p>The present paper will be confined to the chapters on the Georgics.</p>
<p>That <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> retouched the Georgics after their original publication is likely enough.
The lines in the exordium of the Third Book (vv. 30 foll.) seem to point to events
belonging to the later years of the poet's life: Servius' story that the Fourth Book was
altered after the fall of Gallus (four years after the probable date of the completion of
the work) looks the same way: and the grammarians and commentators speak occasionally
of verbal changes found in the author's own handwriting. Thus there is
nothing <emph><seg lang="la">prima facie</seg></emph> improbable in the supposition of occasional derangements in the
text, which it may be reserved for the critical sagacity of modern times to detect and
set right. The only question is the question of fact, has modern critical sagacity
discovered any such? Let me review successively those which M. Ribbeck has pointed
out.</p>
<p>After going through the notices of varieties of reading preserved by the older critics,
he finds a difficulty in Book 1. vv. 100&mdash;103 (<quote lang="la">Humida solstitia . . . Gargara messes</quote>).
He enumerates the various precepts beginning v. 43, notices a certain symmetry in vv.
94&mdash;96, 97&mdash;99, and again in vv. 104&mdash;110, 111&mdash;117, two sentences of three lines
each being succeeded by two of seven, and complains that the four lines in question
interrupt the natural order of thought. He thinks that they ought to have been placed
either at the beginning or at the end of the whole passage, and considers whether room
could be found for them after v. 49, but decides that it is impossible. Accordingly, his
conclusion is that they were no part of the passage, as it originally stood, but that <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>
wrote them afterwards, intending to work them into the context, but failing to do so.
Now I am not disposed to contend that the lines would be in their place in a systematic
treatise in prose, or even in a poem so severely didactic as that of Lucretius: I only
say that, standing where they do, they are quite in keeping with <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s manner.
<persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>, above all things, consults liveliness and variety: he approaches one part of his
<pb n="476"/>
subject in one way, another in another, not because the different parts require a different
treatment for didactic reasons, but because he is a poet, and does not wish to
fatigue his readers by harping too long on the same string. As good an instance as
any of this peculiarity of his is the first half of the Third Book, where having to deliver
much the same series of precepts about oxen and horses, he passes at will from one
to the other, talks of the choice of the dams under the head <quote>cow,</quote> and changes to the
head <quote>horse</quote> when he has to treat of the sires, leaving in each case the remaining half
of his advice to be inferred. In the passage before us he had, as he doubtless thought,
gone on long enough in the strain of ordinary precept, and so he interposes a relief.
He addresses the husbandman directly, but instead of telling him anything more that
he is to do about his land, bids him pray for wet summers and dry winters. This is his
way of calling attention to another part of the subject, the evils of too much drought
and too much wet, and the way to remedy them. The reader's attention thus aroused,
he becomes didactic again&mdash;recommends irrigation as a remedy for a dry soil and
drainage as a remedy for a wet one.</p>
<p>M. Ribbeck's next instance is from Book 2, vv. 371 foll., where he finds the same
remark delivered twice: in vv. 373&mdash;375 cattle are said to do more harm to the young
vines than cold or heat, and in vv. 376&mdash;379 cold and heat are said not to do so much
harm as the teeth of cattle. The two, he says, are obviously different draughts of the
same passage, the second being the later and superior. This charge of repetition depends
on an arbitrary interpretation of <quote lang="la">super</quote> in v. 373, which may just as well mean <quote>beside</quote>
as <quote>more than,</quote> and for the purposes of the passage, infinitely better. <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>
amplifies, if that is a fault, but he does not repeat himself. He says that over and
above unjust winters and tyrannous suns the young shoots have other enemies to fear,
the buffalo, the roe, the sheep, and the heifer. He then goes on to say that these new
enemies are worse than the old, and he says it characteristically: he takes a line to
dwell on the severity of cold, another line to enforce the oppressiveness of heat,
and then says that neither is so injurious as the cattle, the venom of their tooth, and
the deep scar they leave on the young tree's bark. He had before tried to give a notion
of the number of the assailants: he now pictures the mischief they effect. Each sentence
has its relevancy as it stands, and to substitute the one for the other would be to
mutilate the thought.</p>
<p>We now come to the Third Book, where the passage about the madness of love (vv.
242&mdash;283) is similarly accused of confusion and tautology. M. Ribbeck rightly says
that after dwelling in the previous paragraph upon the effect of passion on bulls, the
poet intends specially to commemorate horses as the subjects of a similar frenzy. But
why, he asks, are men introduced promiscuously among a crowd of other animals, instead
of having a place of honour reserved for them? and why are horses mixed up with the
rest of the creation, when mares are kept for a separate description lower down? Clearly
the lines in which Hero and Leander are celebrated ought to follow, not precede, the lines
about lynxes, wolves, dogs, and deer: clearly also the horses ought to be introduced before
the mares, while the two lines in which the latter are described as scaling mountains and
swimming rivers ought to be omitted, as being part of the first edition, written before the
poet had resolved to speak of horses as excited to a similar display of energy. Here again
I think that a little consideration will show that <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> intended the passage to stand as
it has come down to us. He has just painted his bull-fight as a companion picture to
his racer: the horses have had their turn in relation to one part of the subject, the
oxen have their turn in relation to another. In speaking of sexual passion, then, he
does not mean to assign an equal prominence to horses in reference to the didactic object
of the poem: but he intends to mention them nevertheless. How does he manage it?
By including them in a general description, which he adds by way of digression. To
this description he gives a studied appearance of indiscriminateness: the stallion is
<pb n="477"/>
separated from the mare, which is mentioned at the end as a signal instance of the
truth of the general remark, not with any didactic purpose, but simply as occurring in
the course of observation. This accounts for the position of the young lover, who is
regarded for the moment merely as a proof of the universality of passion, and so left to
find his place as he may. Whether it would have been a greater compliment to the
dignity of humanity to place him, as M. Ribbeck would have had him placed, after all
the brute creation, <emph>except</emph> horses and mares, may, I think, be doubted. The rhetorical
effect would have been injured: the prerogatives of the human race would scarcely
have been vindicated. As to the two lines which M. Ribbeck wishes to cancel, it is
difficult to see what would be gained by waging special war against them. They were
probably introduced to gratify <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s love for geographical allusion, just as in the
lines immediately preceding he indulges his taste for mythological reference. Even if
they are struck out, the alleged tautology will not be wholly removed: after impregnation,
the mares will still scamper <quote lang="la">saxa per et scopulos et depressas convalles,</quote> while
<quote lang="la">scopuli rupesque cavae</quote> fail to retard the horses.</p>
<p>In the Fourth Book M. Ribbeck repeats the objections which have been made by
various critics to the position of vv. 47&mdash;50. They had long ago been answered by
Heyne, who shows that there is connexion enought to justify an unsystematic writer in
mentioning later what a systematic one would probably have mentioned earlier. <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>
had begun by directing the bee-master to choose a neighbourhood for the bees where
they might expatiate without injury; he now speaks of the hive, and after enjoining
that it should be made weather-tight, he naturally passes on to speak about smells and
sounds which might penetrate it and injure the inmates. It does not seem to have
occurred to M. Ribbeck to ask himself whether the passage would read equally well as
a piece of poetry if the lines in question were removed or transposed. But most
readers, I think, will feel that <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> has intentionally elaborated his language and
rhythm as he approaches the end of a paragraph, and that the verses about the
echo,
<quote lang="la"><l>Aut ubi concava pulsu
Saxa sonant, vocisque offensa resultat imago,</l>
</quote></p>
<p>make a fuller and more appropriate close than the simple <quote lang="la">raras superiniice frondes.</quote></p>
<p>The lines 203&mdash;205 are confessedly very difficult to harmonize with the context, and,
taken by themselves, may be fairly said to support M. Ribbeck's theory. I have
nothing better to suggest in defence of their present position than has been suggested
in my commentary, that the mention of the constant succession reminded <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> of the
accidents which carry off bees before their time, in themselves a proof of the energy of
the race, and that thence he was led to observe that, in spite of the frequency of such
accidents and the scanty lives enjoyed by individuals in any case, the line was inextinguishable.
No other place which could be assigned to them would be free from objections,
as M. Ribbeck seems to feel. Wagner's proposal to insert them after v. 183
would probably suit the sense best; but <quote lang="la">tantus amor florum et generandi gloria
mellis</quote> would in that <seg lang="la">case come</seg> too soon after <quote lang="la">Cecropias innatus apes amor urget
habendi.</quote> As they stand, there is no reason why <quote lang="la">saepe etiam,</quote> of which M. Ribbeck
complains, should not refer to a suppressed thought, <quote>they show their energy too in
that,</quote> &amp;c.</p>
<p>The paragraph 228&mdash;250 has given trouble to other scholars besides M. Ribbeck;
but it need not trouble any one who is not anxious to bind <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> by the precision of a
technical treatise. He tells the bee-master what he must do when he wants to take
the honey, informs him what are the periods for doing so, warns him that it is a
hazardous business, says that if it is decided to leave them the honey for the winter the
combs may advantageously be cut, and finally declares that the bees will second any
remedial care bestowed on them, and repair any injuries they may have received. The
<pb n="478"/>
whole passage is arranged so as to draw out what I may call the human interest of the
subject,&mdash;to make us regard the bees as if they were creatures like ourselves. I must
again express my wonder that M. Ribbeck should think that the last three lines of the
paragraph formed no part of the paragraph as it originally stood. Take them away,
and we should be left with a dull cheerless impression of the bees as a prey to innumerable
enemies: leave them in their place, and we are inspired with the feeling which the
poet throughout desires to excite&mdash;a sympathy for indomitable energy existing in the
lower creation.</p>
<p>Vv. 289&mdash;294 stand on a different ground from any other passage in the Georgics.
The varieties in the MSS. are a clear external warrant for suspecting the integrity of
the passage, and critical hypothesis is invited accordingly. I do not, however, think
that the omission of the three lines most in question, vv. 291&mdash;293, which is M. Ribbeck's
present view, as it has been the view of others, is the most feasible way of
dealing with the difficulty. The passage seems overloaded: but I see no reason for
supposing that any part of it was not written by <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>.</p>
<p>After thus going through the four books, M. Ribbeck steps back, and examines other
passages in the poem without much regard for order. I follow him in doing so,
though I could have wished, for the sake of my readers, that this arrangement had been
more systematic.</p>
<p>He complains of the lines on Envy, Book 3, vv. 37&mdash;39, which he thinks would
have come in more appropriately after v. 33 as part of the sculpture on the doors of the
temple. Accordingly, he supposes that in v. 37, <quote lang="la">metuens,</quote> found in the Palatine
MS., was the original reading, the sentence having been left incomplete by the poet,
and afterwards altered to make it suit the place into which it had been unskilfully
foisted. Once more I must contend that the lines, rhythmically and poetically, are
better where they stand. They form an appropriate close to the sense: they would
have been somewhat too elaborate elsewhere than at the close. The monument to
<seg lang="la">Augustus concludes</seg> with Envy in her torments, just as the prophecy of <persName>Jupiter</persName> (A. 1.
294 foll.) concludes with Fury in his prison. As for the artistic appliances by which
the representation of Envy is to be made, we may well be left to imagine them for
ourselves.</p>
<p>After a proposal which he does not press, to insert vv. 343&mdash;345 of Book 2 after v.
335, M. Ribbeck returns to Book 3, and following Tittler, a scholar with whom he does
not generally agree, pronounces that vv. 120&mdash;122 of that book ought to stand after
v. 96. The proposal is much older than Tittler, having been made in the last century
by a friend of Warton. No doubt <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> has expressed himself carelessly, confusing a
com<persName>Paris</persName>on of different qualifications in the same horse with a com<persName>Paris</persName>on of different
qualifications in different horses; but his meaning is plain enough: and as before, the
transposition of the lines would rob the paragraph of an appropriate and sonorous close,
and leave it tame and spiritless. Tittler would remedy this by further transposing vv.
113&mdash;119, so as to place them after v. 102. But v. 102 would suffer greatly by being
separated from the description of the chariot race: and it can scarcely be doubted that
<persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> intends to repeat the thought of the first lines of the paragraph in the last, leaving
on the reader's mind the one clear impression, that past services in a horse are not to
blind the breeder to the essential superiority of youth to age.</p>
<p>The next passage which is called in question is Book 1, vv. 204&mdash;310. M. Ribbeck first
places vv. 257, 258 before v. 252, and then finds that the lines so re-arranged are a revised
edition of vv. 204&mdash;207. He next pronounces the paragraph about the zones (vv. 231&mdash;
251) and that about the occupations for wet days and holidays (vv. 259&mdash;275) to be
later insertions, imperfectly harmonized with the context, and finally concludes that
the whole ought to stand thus, omitting vv. 204&mdash;207 altogether: vv. 257, 258, vv. 252
&mdash;256, vv. 231&mdash;251, vv. 208&mdash;230, vv. 276&mdash;286, vv. 259&mdash;275, vv. 287&mdash;310. The
<pb n="479"/>
notion of transposing vv. 257, 258, so that they should precede v. 252, occurred to
myself many years ago, as I could not understand how they cohered either with
the following paragraph, with which they were generally printed, or with the
preceding lines. Afterwards I saw that Professor Ramsay was right in connecting
them with the preceding lines, as they really depend on <quote lang="la">hinc</quote> v. 252, the sense being
<quote>It is this disposition of the mundane system which makes our observation of stars and
seasons not in vain.</quote> Thus the lines refer back to vv. 204&mdash;207, at the same time that
they do not simply repeat them. <quote lang="la">Idcirco,</quote> v. 231, to which M. Ribbeck demurs, refers
to the whole preceding paragraph: it is with a view to our carrying on the operations
of husbandry at their proper seasons that the mundane system is arranged. Just so
later in the book (vv. 351 foll.) the poet tells us that <persName>Jupiter</persName> himself has ordained
certain things as the antecedents of fine or stormy weather for the benefit of man.
After v. 258 the precepts become more desultory: rainy days suggest holidays, holidays
lucky and unlucky days, and these again bring us back to the natural suitableness of
different times and seasons to different occupations. Thus explained, the passage vindicates
itself as having been intended by <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> to stand as we now read it, and lends
no countenance whatever to the theory of two editions. There are however one or two
further difficulties detected by M. Ribbeck. One is about vv. 297, 298, where he
would read with Peerlkamp, <quote lang="la"><emph>Nec</emph> rubicunda Ceres . . . <emph>At</emph> medio,</quote> &amp;c., and then place the
lines immediately after v. 290. But it was long since pointed out that <quote lang="la">medio aestu</quote>
is to be understood of summer, not of the heat of the day, <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> having made a transition
in the lines just preceding from times of day to times of year by speaking of the
man who works through a long <emph>winter</emph> night. M. Ribbeck is also not quite satisfied
about the right position of vv. 259&mdash;275, which he refers to the operations of the summer,
but cannot connect with the lines where summer and winter operations are contrasted:
nor is he clear about the best place for vv. 291&mdash;296. These are difficulties
which he may be fairly said to have brought on himself, and one who believes that no
transpositions are needed can hardly be asked to help in removing them.</p>
<p>Three short passages, Book 3, vv. 81&mdash;83 (<quote lang="la">Honesti . . . et gilvo</quote>), Book 1, vv. 173,
175, and Book 4. 276, are next noted as marginal jottings made by the poet with a
view to a second edition. Such slight matters will scarcely bear argument; and it is
perhaps enough to say that, as M. Ribbeck himself evidently regards them only as very
subsidiary proofs of his theory, they may be left to the reader's judgment after
he has made up his mind on the strength or weakness of the more important part of
the case.</p>
<p>In the observations which immediately follow I am glad to welcome M. Ribbeck as
a defender of the integrity of <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s text. Tittler maintains that Books 1 and 2 are
the only parts of the Georgics given to the world by the poet himself, and supposes the
exordium of Book 3 to be a mixture of two different draughts. M. Ribbeck vindicates
the passage as it stands very satisfactorily (though confessing a difficulty in the
mention of the Britons, v. 25), refuting the notion that the temple which <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> promises
to raise to Augustus is a symbolical representation of the Aeneid, and explaining
it rightly as an undertaking that was never performed. In replying, however, to
another part of Tittler's dissertation, which treats of the invocation of Maecenas
near the beginning of Book 2, he relapses, I regret to say, into unauthorized conjecture,
adopting a suggestion of Peerlkamp's, to put v. 41 after v. 42 and alter <quote lang="la">da</quote> into
<quote lang="la">dare.</quote> <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> doubtless intended by <quote lang="la">pelago patenti</quote> not what we call the open sea,
but a sea not crowded with other ships, though it would have been better if he had
chosen a different word, so as to avoid the verbal inconsistency with what follows. This
leads M. Ribbeck to further speculations about Book 2, and the spirit of re-arrangement
takes possession of him again. he agrees with Hanovius (Hanow?) in believing
that the invocation of Maecenas should follow the invocation of Bacchus, but is perplexed
<pb n="480"/>
to know what to do with the previous lines, vv. 35&mdash;38, till he sees that their
true place is immediately before v. 109. Any one who feels the full enthusiasm of vv.
35 foll. will, I think, be slow to believe that they ought to stand anywhere but where
they do. The poet, after surveying some of the details of his subject, is visited by an
access of inspiration as he contemplates the work before him, points to the triumphs to
be won in planting whole mountains with the vine and the olive, speaks of his own
labours as parallel to the husbandman's, and calls upon his patron to bear his part in
the undertaking. Dislocate the passage and the effect is gone: Bacchus and Maecenas
lose respectively by juxtaposition: and the lines about Ismarus and Taburnus are
rendered tame by being attached to a reminder that all lands do not produce all
things.</p>
<p>Passing rapidly over transpositions in Book 4, by Peerlkamp and Heyne, which he
disapproves, and Schrader's transposition of vv. 369, 370, which he accepts, M. Ribbeck
concludes his chapter, <quote>De retractatis a poeta Georgicis,</quote> by discussing the latter
part of Book 3. Here again he finds traces of a confusion between two alternative
draughts. After v. 519 he thinks the poem might have been continued either thus,
vv. 534&mdash;536, 531&mdash;533, 537&mdash;547, or thus, vv. 520&mdash;530, 548&mdash;553, 556&mdash;566. Vv.
554, 555 he condemns as an interpolation. The only reason for suspecting the text as
it stands is that <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> after speaking of cattle digresses to other things, and then
returns to cattle again. Whether it may not be <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s manner to do so is a question
which M. Ribbeck does not ask; indeed, it would be somewhat late to ask it at the
end of a chapter which is devoted (so a believer in the integrity of the existing text
may fairly say) to obliterating the various indications of that manner which abound in
the poem. The issue raised is really one of aesthetic criticism, of the order in which a
poet may be expected to present his thoughts and images. If we criticize the passage
before us as poetry, we shall not, I think, be inclined to pronounce it deficient. <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>,
as I have said already, is fond of variety; he does not keep the reader long on the
stretch, but is always finding some expedient for relieving him, at the same time that
he takes care that the impression finally left on the mind shall be uniform and consistent.
After exciting our feelings for the labouring ox, struck down in the midst of his
work, he changes the subject, tells us briefly of the difficulty of procuring cattle for
processions and of tilling the ground at all, describes the universality of the pestilence
as extending to all creatures, tame or wild, harmless or noxious, and then reverts to the
condition of the cattle, which, instead of ministering to man even after death by the
food and raiment they supply, have become useless and injurious, and require to be
buried out of sight as fast as they fall. The two condemned lines add to the variety:
as we read them, we think of pleasant pastures, of mountain slopes and river banks,
once vocal with the bleating or the lowing of healthy cattle, now echoing with their
dying groans. Whether our understandings would be assisted by the dismemberment
of the passage I will not say: I am very sure that our imaginations would be appealed
to less powerfully.</p>
<p>Such are M. Ribbeck's reasons for believing that the Georgics, as they have come
down to us, have suffered from the unskilfulness of those who edited them after the
author's death. The two remaining chapters, in which he points out interpolations in
the poem and discusses conjectures on the text proposed by recent critics, are much
shorter.</p>
<p>After noticing two or three lines as suspicious, because occurring also in the Aeneid,
he condemns v. 433 of Book 2 as being absent in the Medicean MS., not commented
on by Servius, and not quoted by any ancient author, and also as being out of harmony
with the context. It is absurd, he says, to ask <quote lang="la">Et dubitant homines serere atque
impendere curam?</quote> when the poet is speaking of things which grow spontaneously,
<quote lang="la">non rastris, hominum non ulli obnoxia curae.</quote> I have elsewhere expressed my opinion
<pb n="481"/>
of the blindness which would rob us of one of <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s finest lines; so I will merely
say here that the poet's purpose is to rouse the cultivator to the duty of seconding
nature by art, by setting before him what nature can do and is doing unaided. Book 4,
v. 506, is said to be justly rejected by Heyne, as being superfluous after v. 503. It
is true no doubt that we already know that Orpheus has lost Eurydice, but that does not
prove that the fact will not bear to be brought home to us further&mdash;that it is superfluous
to tell us that while Orpheus is casting about in agony how to recover her, she is
floating off in the Stygian boat, death-chilled already. The omission of vv. 134, 135 of
Book 1 would be less felt as a poetical loss, but it would destroy a characteristic trait
of <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>, who is fond of combining the particular with the general: nor does there
seem ground enough for pronouncing v. 144 an interpolation in the face of the MSS.
Book 3, v. 162, again, is harmless enough, if explained, as M. Ribbeck sees that it
ought to be explained, in connexion with what follows rather than what goes before;
so that his final sentence, <quote lang="la">ambiguo illo versu malim equidem carere,</quote> is, to say the
least, a little arbitrary. V. 288 of the same book is more than harmless; it is eminently
characteristic. As usual, <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> in approaching a new part of his subject points out
to the husbandman the difficulty and glory of the task: as usual, he goes on in the
following verses to identify his own toil with theirs. Peerlkamp has been severe on
the Ovidian redundance of the description of the Scythian winter later in the book
(vv. 360 foll.): but M. Ribbeck has happily been proof against his critical acumen
except in the case of v. 362, which he thinks <quote>loquacior.</quote> In the remainder of the
chapter I am glad to say that he devotes himself to the defence of supposed interpolations
against Peerlkamp and others, observing with regard to one place that the
<quote lang="la">Batavus sagacissimus,</quote> as he elsewhere calls him, <quote lang="la">pulchram imaginem cum non
intellegeret delevit.</quote> <emph lang="la">Si sic omnia!</emph></p>
<p>The concluding chapter on the Georgics, which is chiefly occupied with the enumeration
of some conjectures of Peerlkamp's, is still briefer than the last, and need scarcely
detain us a moment. M. Ribbeck does not pledge himself to any of these conjectures,
while some of them he expressly controverts. Perhaps the only really tempting one is
<quote lang="la">divinius</quote> for <quote lang="la">divinitus,</quote> Book 1, v. 415, which was long since proposed by Reiske;
and even that can be shown to be inadmissible. The rest are mostly ingenious, but a
reader, who is convinced that <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s text does not require the aid of conjecture, will
be apt to be intolerant of such a perverse application of cleverness. M. Ribbeck declares
himself almost a convert to an emendation by Hanovius of Book 1. 142, <quote lang="la">Alta
petens alius pelago trahit humida lina,</quote> which may perhaps be an improvement of the
original line as he and others point it, but cannot be set against the old punctuation, by
which <quote lang="la">Alta petens</quote> is referred to the preceding verse; and he also approves of a proposal
by the same critic to alter the stopping of Book 3, vv. 223 foll., so as to make
a new sentence begin with v. 226, in which it is difficult to see any advantage. He
atones, however, for these concessions by resisting a suggestion that vv. 187&mdash;192 of
Book 1 should be placed after v. 203, disposing of it by the just remark, which I cannot
but wish he had thought of on other occasions, <quote lang="la">solere Vergilium singula praeceptorum
capita item ut libros singulos graviore vel aliquo modo insigniore sive sententia sive
imagine concludere.</quote></p>

<head>II.</head>
<p>TURNING to M. Ribbeck's remarks on the Aeneid, which are comprised in a single long
chapter, I am happy to find myself agreeing with him in regarding as highly probable
a theory propounded by Conrads in his <quote>Quaestiones <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>ianae</quote> (Tr&ecirc;ves, 1863), that
<persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> did not write the several books of the poem in the order in which he eventually
left them. This theory had not been promulgated at the time of the publication of the
second volume of my edition: but it certainly seems to clear up some things which are
not satisfactorily accounted for on the ordinary hypothesis. One or two of these I will
mention, making use of Conrads' remarks, but not necessarily confining myself to them.
The apparent discrepancies between the story of Palinurus as told by himself in the
Sixth Book and as told by the poet in the Fifth have often been remarked upon. Palinurus
speaks of something like a storm as happening at the time of his falling overboard:
in the Fifth Book we are merely told that the vessel became unsteady in passing
the breakers near the coast of the Sirens, and that <persName>Aeneas</persName> then was made sensible of
his loss. Palinurus talks of himself as living till the third or fourth day from the time
of his misfortune: if we followed the narrative alone, we should suppose that <persName>Aeneas</persName>
finds him in the shades after a shorter interval. Again, the voyage in which Palinurus
was lost is called <quote lang="la">Libyco cursu,</quote> whereas it would more properly be spoken of as the
voyage from Sicily. All these points can be explained on the ordinary hypothesis, but
not without effort: and as soon as it is suggested that the Fifth Book may have been
written some time after the Sixth, we feel that the solution is far easier. <quote lang="la">Libyco cursu</quote>
in particular is at once accounted for, if we suppose that when <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> wrote the words
he intended to bring <persName>Aeneas</persName> from Carthage to Cumae without halting by the way.
There are other appearances which point in the same direction. When <persName>Aeneas</persName> tells
the Sibyl that it was Anchises who bade him seek her out, it is generally explained by
referring to the words of Anchises himself in the Fifth Book. Yet the imperfect <quote lang="la">dabat</quote>
(Book 6, v. 117), following closely on <quote lang="la">ferebat</quote> (v. 114), looks as if <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> was thinking
when he wrote the passage of advice given by Anchises when alive: in other words, that
the apparition of Anchises had not then been devised. It is true that <persName>Aeneas</persName> says later
in the book (v. 695) that it was the repeated appearance of his father which compelled
him to visit the shades: but it may be replied that though <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>, having talked of a
repeated appearance, might think himself bound to describe a single visit, he is not
equally likely first to have described a single visit and then to have talked of a repeated
appearance. Not wishing however to push such reasonings into mere refinement,
especially in the case of an author like <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>, who is fond of telling the subordinate
parts of his story by incidental hints, I will merely notice that the question which we
know to have been entertained by the early critics, whether the two first lines of
Book 6 really belong to that Book or to Book 5, is at once explained if we suppose those
lines to have been added to Book 6 later, at the time when Book 5 was written. I need
not say that Book 5 is precisely one of those parts of the story which might most
naturally be supplied as an after-thought, as the conception of his work gradually
opened upon the poet. Another book, the peculiarities of which are best accounted for
by supposing it to have been written at a different time from those among which it is
found, is Book 3. Probably no book of the twelve contains so many discrepancies from
<pb n="483"/>
the rest of the story. There is the inconsistency between <persName>Aeneas</persName>' ignorance where he
is to settle, as exemplified throughout the earlier part of the book, and his having heard
from Creusa at the end of the Second Book about the land of Hesperia and the river
Tiber. There is the inconsistency between the attribution of the prophecy of eating
the tables to Celaeno and its attribution in the Seventh Book to Anchises: not to
mention that in the former case it is predicted as an infliction consequent on landing
in Italy, in the latter as a token that the unknown land on which they will have disembarked
is to be their home. There is the inconsistency between the white sow as a
token that they have reached their home, which is Helenus' prediction, and the white
sow with her young as a symbol of the number of years that are to elapse before the
foundation of Alba, which is the purpose it actually serves. There is the inconsistency
between the promise, that <persName>Aeneas</persName> shall be instructed about the war in Italy by the
Sibyl, and the fact, that he is instructed about it by Anchises. I do not know whether
we are to follow Conrads in adding to these that the Third Book, as read naturally,
represents <persName>Aeneas</persName>' wanderings as lasting two years, while in other parts of the poem
they are made to extend over seven. At any rate, enough has been adduced to make
it probable that the Third Book was not written immediately after the Second: though
it may still be doubted whether it was an early composition, containing intimations on
which the poet afterwards improved, or a late production, embodying hints to which,
had <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> lived, he would have accommodated his narrative. On the whole, I cannot
doubt that Conrads' theory throws real light on the composition of the Aeneid, though
here as in other instances we doubtless need be on our guard against carrying the spirit
of hypothesis too far.</p>
<p>I now come back to M. Ribbeck's own criticisms: and here I am afraid my differences
with him recommence.</p>
<p>After examining the notices of the composition of the Aeneid preserved by Donatus
and others, he discusses the several books in detail, beginning with the Fourth, which
is one of those that <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> is said to have read to Augustus. Besides the five hemistichs
occurring in the book, he finds other traces of imperfection. V. 53 he thinks
was originally incomplete, the last clause being due to an interpolator. He does not
say why: nor does his note on the passage help us to a reason. All that we are told is
<quote lang="la">sequentia</quote> (i. e. <quote lang="la">dum non tractabile caelum</quote>) <quote lang="la">ferri omnino non possunt, ut ficta
videantur ex Georg. 1. 211.</quote> Most students of <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>, I apprehend, find no difficulty
in tolerating the clause, and are not likely to think it suspicious because <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> has
talked elsewhere about <quote lang="la">bruma intractabilis.</quote> In his note he goes on <quote lang="la">ceterum optimum
erat v. 51 Annae orationem concludere, et poterat interpolator pannos desumere
ex Aen. 1. 535 et 551.</quote> We can only meet assertion by assertion, maintaining that
Anna's speech would read very badly without the lines in question, and that the partial
verbal similarity to the expressions in Book 1 is <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>ian enough. We are also told,
after Peerlkamp, that the latter part of v. 343 is spurious. I have elsewhere remarked
that the use of <quote lang="la">manerent</quote> there in the sense of restoration to permanence may very
well intimate that the restoration would efface the memory of the fall, and may probably
have been intended to remind us of the passage from which M. Ribbeck supposes
the interpolator to have borrowed it, Book 2, v. 56. Other charges follow: <quote lang="la">hiare
orationem circa v. 418, paulo durius abrumpi v. 160, etiam v. 98 fortasse imperfectum
esse.</quote> In the first of these passages M. Ribbeck arbitrarily supposes a gap, attempts
to fill it by two lines torn from a later speech of <persName>Dido</persName>'s, vv. 548, 549, and finding
naturally enough, that the passage, so re-arranged, is not symmetrical, declares <quote lang="la">quoniam
vel sic hiat oratio, non absolvisse locum putandus est poeta.</quote> That there is some
abruptness in v. 360 we may safely concede, as the next line, being a hemistich, shows
that the poet could not finish the speech to his mind. V. 98 is not unfinished: the
apparent difficulty arises from a rare construction of <quote lang="la">quo</quote> with the ablative, which I
<pb n="484"/>
have illustrated in my commentary. Lastly, M. Ribbeck finds an indication of two
draughts in vv. 382 foll. The cause of his perplexity appears to be v. 387: he cannot
understand how <persName>Dido</persName> can say in one line that her spectre shall constantly haunt
<persName>Aeneas</persName>, and in the next line that the news of his punishment shall reach her in the
lower world. The solution seems to be that <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> regarded the spectre and the spirit
(so to call them) as different things, just as he makes Anchises in Book 6, vv. 687 foll.,
unaware that his spectre has appeared to <persName>Aeneas</persName>.</p>
<p>M. Ribbeck next proceeds to the Sixth Book, as having been also read to the emperor
by the poet. Here again he finds various tokens of incompleteness, over and above the
discrepancies with the Fifth Book, already noticed. He thinks there is a hiatus after
v. 254, as <quote lang="la">superque,</quote> the reading of all the best MSS., cannot be otherwise explained.
Yet in Book 1. 668, where there is almost as great authority for <quote lang="la">que,</quote> he omits it,
doubtless as sufficiently accounted for by the metrical scruples of transcribers. Here
the evident imitation of Hom. Il. 11. 775 is decidedly in favour of supposing that <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>
wrote the line as it stands in the majority of modern editions, and consequently that
the passage is complete. Next come two instances of <quote>dittographia,</quote> vv. 586 and 716.
The latter passage is certainly rather awkward: the former, though much vexed by
modern editors, really only requires explanation, the meaning being that Salmoneus,
while engaged in his impious imitation of <persName>Jupiter</persName>, was struck with the vengeance from
which he still suffers. He goes on <quote lang="la">narrationis lacunam indagavi post v. 361.</quote> Boot, a
Dutch scholar, has also found a difficulty in the passage; but there can be little doubt
that both are wrong. Palinurus intimates plainly enough that he was killed by the
natives and thrown back into the sea: they rush on him with the sword, and now the
wave holds him. Why are we to suppose that <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> would have made him dilate on
the circumstances of the murder? Deiphobus, whose end was still more cruel, speaks
of it still more briefly. About vv. 602 foll. there is some difficulty, as the torments
spoken of do not seem to have been specifically appropriated to Ixion and Pirithous; but
the rhetorical structure of the passage shows that the poet, after having enumerated
various sufferers and their sufferings in detail, is at length hurrying on and dealing
with the subject more promiscuously, mentioning here a criminal and there a form of
punishment, but not caring to assign the one to the other. M. Ribbeck concludes by
intimating that vv. 93, 94, 826&mdash;835, may very probably have been added in revising
the book. The two first-mentioned lines are unoffending enough: as for the others, it
is perhaps sufficient to say that M. Ribbeck in his text inserts them after v. 807 (a
most inappropriate place, interfering with the feeling of the whole passage, without
really satisfying the chronological order); so that the theory of <quote lang="la">curae secundae</quote> may
be said to prove little more than the critic's dissatisfaction with his own arbitrary
re-arrangement of the lines as found in the MSS.</p>
<p>In Book 1 M. Ribbeck finds one lacuna after v. 550. <quote lang="la">Post hunc versum,</quote> he says
in his critical commentary, <quote lang="la">poetam suspicor et de gratia per Acesten referenda plura
additurum et eis quae v. 551 rogat Ilioneus paulo accuratius praefaturum fuisse.</quote>
This assumes, what is by no means certain, that Acestes is introduced as one who is
able to requite any kindness <persName>Dido</persName> may show even if <persName>Aeneas</persName> should be dead. It is more
probable from the context that Ilioneus mentions Sicily as a <foreign lang="greek">deu/teros plou=s</foreign>, if the death
of <persName>Aeneas</persName> and his heir should cut off the hope of Italy. Thus there will be no need of
a preface to the request which follows, that being in fact the point of Ilioneus' speech.
He asks to be allowed not to settle, but to refit the ships for either of the voyages
which await them in the two alternative contingencies. M. Ribbeck quarrels with the
latter part of v. 188, <quote lang="la">fidus quae tela gerebat Achates,</quote> though he is not sure whether
it is an interpolation or a stop-gap of <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s own. I must profess myself unable to
see anything inappropriate in it: it is simply one of those little incidental details which
the poet from time to time introduces. Surely we are not obliged to think with Servius
<pb n="485"/>
that Achates was occupied all this time in keeping up the fire he had lighted. V. 426
is at first sight a little incongruous: but it is not un-<persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>ian, as the mention of
political and civil institutions in similar connexions, Books 3. 137, 5. 758, is sufficient
to show. Vv. 367, 8 again seem unjustly suspected: there was no occasion to introduce
the detail, but there is nothing unnatural in doing so: and there is perhaps something
lively in <persName>Venus</persName>' interrupting herself as she seemed about to continue her story.
V. 711 also is harmless, if unnecessary: it is a piece of epic surplusage, such as <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>
not unfrequently indulges in after <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName>'s example. M. Ribbeck is anxious to identify
the twenty ships with which <persName>Aeneas</persName> (v. 381) tells <persName>Venus</persName> he originally embarked. Seven
are still with <persName>Aeneas</persName>: thirteen remain to be accounted for. He turns to the description
of the storm, and can find only twelve, <persName>Aeneas</persName>' own ship (vv. 102 foll.), three driven on
rocks (v. 108), three on quicksands (v. 110), Orontes' ship (v. 113), and those of <seg lang="la">Ilioneus,
Achates, Abas</seg>, and Aletes (vv. 120 foll.). Either then <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> has been careless, or we
must create a thirteenth by emending <quote lang="la">illam</quote> v. 116 into <quote lang="la">aliam.</quote> It is evident on
a com<persName>Paris</persName>on of v. 584 of this Book with Book 6. 334, that only one ship was sunk,
and that Orontes', so that the emendation breaks down. But the fact is that the twelve
ships mentioned as suffering from the storm are not necessarily identical with the
thirteen that are missing. The missing ships did not fare worse than the others, though
they parted company with them: those that were with <persName>Aeneas</persName> are said by him to be
<quote lang="la">convolsae undis Euroque.</quote> All the ships doubtless suffered more or less: all, but
Orontes', were eventually recovered. How would M. Ribbeck account on his theory
for <persName>Aeneas</persName> and Achates getting to land with the seven ships, after their own vessels had
been disabled among the thirteen? Does he suppose that they left their own ships
when they found them becoming unseaworthy, and got on board others?</p>
<p>M. Ribbeck's remarks on the Second Book are few. The celebrated passage about
Helen (vv. 567&mdash;588) he considers to be the work of an interpolator, though he does
not explain how an unknown author should have written verses which <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> need not
have disowned. With Conrads, he is surprised at the appearance of Iphitus and Pelias
in v. 535, and suspects that if <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> had finished his poem he would have mentioned
them among those named in vv. 339&mdash;346, as if this incidental and allusive mode of
narration were not one of <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s most salient characteristics. Three other lines he
regards as spurious, vv. 76, 749, 775. Of these the first and third have more or less
external authority against them: the second is unobjectionable, as though we are not
told where <persName>Aeneas</persName> left his armour, it is natural enough that he should require it when
searching for his wife, not having worn it while carrying his father. Vv. 46, 47 he
thinks a <quote>dittographia</quote> of v. 45, failing to see, what surely is plain enough, that it is
one thing to regard the horse as a receptacle for soldiers, as it actually was, another
thing to look upon it as a means for scaling the walls from outside. He is <quote>almost
sorry</quote> to have marked in his text a lacuna after v. 25; a feeling which it may be
hoped further reflection will confirm. The latter part of v. 360 appears to him a stopgap:
vv. 383, 409 he thinks too like each other to have occurred at so short an interval
in a finished poem.</p>
<p>The Third Book, as is well known, contains a line (v. 340), the only one in the poem,
where not only the metre but the sense is imperfect. M. Ribbeck is of course quite
right in treating the passage as unfinished; but there was no reason why he should
fancy, however hesitatingly, that an interpolator had been at work. The <foreign lang="greek">prw=ton yeu=dos</foreign>
of his criticism is the adoption of the false reading <quote lang="la">quae</quote> for <quote lang="la">quem</quote> in <quote lang="la">Quem tibi
iam Troia.</quote> Wagner had introduced it from the <quote>Menagianus alter;</quote> M. Ribbeck
asserts repeatedly that it is found in the Medicean. I do not know what his authority
may be; but I know that my friend Mr. A. O. Prickard of New College examined the
MS. for me in this place at Florence last year, and found <quote lang="la">quem</quote> written in the clearest
and most unmistakable way, just as it stands in Foggini's transcript. All is plain
<pb n="486"/>
sailing enough; we do not know how the line would have ended, but we know pretty
well what the sense must have been; and we know from the next line that Andromache,
no matter how, was aware that Creusa was no more. Quite as arbitrary are
M. Ribbeck's observations on the passage following Andromache's speech. No rational
cause, he says (following Peerlkamp), can be imagined why Helenus should be said to
shed many tears between his words, when nevertheless we are told that he conducts
<persName>Aeneas</persName> with joy to his home. Are tears of joy unknown in Germany or in Holland?
As to the objection that Helenus' words ought to be mentioned when his speech is not
given, I need only refer to Book 5, v. 770. What M. Ribbeck asks us to accept in place
of the passage as we are accustomed to read it is a <quote>dittographia,</quote> <quote lang="la">Haec multum lacrimans
verba inter singula fundit,</quote> supposed to be left by the poet as an alternative for
<quote lang="la">Talia fundebat lacrimans longosque ciebat Incassum fletus.</quote> V. 135 is not free from
difficulty; but there is greater difficulty in believing that <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> left <quote lang="la">Iamque fere,</quote>
and that <quote lang="la">sicco subductae litore puppes</quote> was added by an interpolator. Vv. 595 and
603 are treated as a <quote>dittographia,</quote> as if <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> could not first say that Achemenides
looked like a Greek who had served at <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> and then make him own that he was one.
Vv. 128 foll. give M. Ribbeck trouble, as they have given trouble to other modern
editors: they need trouble no one who is not disposed to bind down the poet to a
formal sequence of narration. He is surprised that no objection has been made to the
stop-gap in v. 256, <quote lang="la">nostraeque iniuria caedis,</quote> as he thinks it harsh to couple <quote lang="la">fames</quote>
and <quote lang="la">iniuria</quote> as reducing the Trojans to eat their tables. <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>, I need scarcely say,
never scruples to co-ordinate two nouns either of which separately might have been the
subject of the verb he happens to be using: and in the present case <quote lang="la">fames</quote> and
<quote lang="la">iniuria</quote> are related as effect and cause. V. 486 M. Ribbeck judiciously defends, as
also vv. 472, 3: I wish he had extended his protection to vv. 470, 471, which he agrees
with Peerlkamp in condemning. V. 230 may very possibly be an interpolation from
Book 1, v. 311, as the agreement of the best MSS. in <quote lang="la">clausam</quote> is suspicious: it is
strange, however, in that case that no copy should omit it. To M. Ribbeck's <quote lang="la">languere
admodum sentio v. 262,</quote> I can only answer that I for one have no such feeling.
Vv. 690, 691 he condemns by a simple reference to Wagner's arguments against them:
I must defend them by an equally simple reference to the reply to Wagner in my
commentary. Vv. 684&mdash;686 are no doubt full of difficulty. Whatever may be the
case with other parts of the poem, there can scarcely be a question that here the poet's
last hand is wanting. This may obviate the only serious objection which M. Ribbeck
makes to the common reading of the lines as explained by most recent commentators,
that to sail between Scylla and Charybdis was not to sail <quote lang="la">leti discrimine parvo,</quote> but
to encounter certain destruction on one side or the other. M. Ribbeck's own solution,
to restore <quote lang="la">Scylla atque Charybdis</quote> from the Vatican fragment and to transpose
vv. 685, 686, understanding the alternative to be between running upon Scylla and
Charybdis and running back upon the coast of the Cyclops, seems to me at once more
violent and less plausible.</p>
<p>On the Fifth Book M. Ribbeck discusses Conrads' opinion, to which I have already
alluded, that when <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> wrote Book 3 he intended <persName>Aeneas</persName>' wanderings to occupy a
much shorter period than they are represented to have done in Books 1 and 5. I will
only say that while the narrative in Book 3 can be reconciled to a seven years' period, it
would certainly, if standing by itself, suggest something shorter, and consequently, that
supposing it to be probable on other grounds that <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> would be inconsistent with
himself in these particular portions of his work, we may well believe that he is so in
this special instance. The difficulty of his talking about summer in Book 5, v. 625, I
think I have obviated by the suggestion made in my commentary that we should prove
the sense of <quote lang="la">vertitur,</quote> which may surely mean <quote>is passing into winter.</quote> I do not
agree with M. Ribbeck in thinking it certain that the Episode of Nisus and Euryalus
<pb n="487"/>
in Book 9 was written before the mention of the two friends in Book 5, on account of
the great fulness of the description in the later book, though it is of course possible.
Drances is more fully described on his last appearance in Book 11 than on his first introduction
earlier in the same book; and in fact such varieties are indispensable to the
freedom of poetical narrative. As usual, M. Ribbeck points out various lines in Book
5 which he regards as stop-gaps or interpolations; and as usual, I am unable to agree
with him. In v. 120 <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> is only following his ordinary custom of reiterating a
thing in a new form: v. 403 contains one of his most characteristic verbal manipulations:
v. 467 would never have been suspected by any one who was not, like Peerlkamp,
suspicious by profession: the repetition of v. 538 in v. 572 may be a carelessness,
but it may be a deliberate imitation of <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName>ic commonplace: v. 802 is an amplification,
but a sonorous and effective one: in v. 440 the picture of the preceding line is
given <emph>more Vergiliano</emph>, with a circumstantial difference: if v. 603 savours of the commentator
rather than of the poet, a large number of similar lines in the Iliad and
Odyssey must be due not to <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName> but to the Scholiasts. V. 506 has nothing to do
with the dove's clapping her wings, but is a translation, as I have shown in my commentary,
of Iliad 23. 869. V. 290 is not free from difficulty: but there is no reason
why <quote lang="la">consessu</quote> should not mean <quote>in consessum,</quote> the place of assembling being spoken
of as the assembly, and though there may be no authority for making <quote>exstructo</quote> a
substantive, it can be amply supported by analogies like <quote lang="la">suggestum.</quote> I cannot think
that vv. 82, 83 make an inappropriate close to <persName>Aeneas</persName>' brief address. <quote lang="la">Non licuit</quote> is
to be understood as in Book 4, v. 550, where it is similarly introduced at the end of a
speech, not as a mere statement of fact, but as a passionate ejaculation. Lastly, I do
not see that we need seriously arraign either the poet or a copyist for <quote lang="la">ab Ida,</quote> v. 254,
closely following <quote lang="la">frondosa Ida</quote> in v. 252. If anything, it is <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s own carelessness,
though a slight one: but perhaps, as I have already suggested, the repetition may be
intended to show that the two actions, Ganymede hunting and Ganymede carried off,
are represented as taking place on the same spot.</p>
<p>In the Ninth Book M. Ribbeck finds fault with vv. 367 foll. for their obscurity.
They are not quite plain, certainly: but the difficulty does not seem to arise from the
poet's carelessness, but from his habit of indirect narrative. Ladewig seems substantially
right in supposing that a legion was on its way from Laurentum, in answer to a
request from Turnus, and that the horsemen were sent on before to announce its
approach. They were reaching the Rutulian camp just as Nisus and Euryalus were
leaving it: and so the two parties naturally came into collision. M. Ribbeck's own
explanation <quote lang="la">immo speculatum ultra Rutulorum castra missi, dum ex urbe reliqui profecti
castra Troiana oppugnant, equites illi iam redibant,</quote> I do not clearly understand:
at any rate it appears to ignore the obvious opposition between <quote lang="la">praemissi</quote> and <quote lang="la">moratur.</quote>
With the passage generally we may compare Book 11, vv. 511 foll. Whether
the mention of Numa v. 454 and that of Asilas v. 571 are carelessnesses or pieces of
indirect information is not easy to say, and matters but little. There is perhaps some
awkwardness in the omission of Turnus' name v. 749: but <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> probably
did it intentionally, meaning to be rapid and vivid. V. 403, as read in the oldest
MSS., can scarcely be right: so there, as in a few other places, we must suppose
that the later copies have contrived to preserve the true reading. Vv.
85 foll. can hardly be explained as a <quote>dittographia,</quote> as neither the first
line nor the two last could well stand alone: it is better to suppose that <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> means
to tell us indirectly that besides pines, there were pitch-trees and maples in the grove,
while we admit that there is a clumsiness in <quote lang="la">lucus</quote> following <quote lang="la">silva</quote> and a strange
ambiguity in <quote lang="la">arce summa.</quote> The gifts promised to Nisus and Euryalus vv. 263 foll.
certainly do seem extravagant in some respects, and the mention of a single bowl where
other things are double is awkward: there accordingly we may say that <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s later
<pb n="488"/>
thoughts would perhaps have corrected his earlier. I am glad to see that M. Ribbeck
does not quarrel, as some tasteless critics have done, with the striking and pathetic
passage vv. 314 foll.: he is far, however, from seeing its full beauty. The explanation
<quote lang="la">tamen</quote> does not lie in the word <quote lang="la">inimica,</quote> though that word was no doubt chosen
intentionally, to strike a note of melancholy, but in the suppressed thought, <quote lang="la">perituri
quidem ipsi.</quote> I know nothing more touching in <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> than the manner in which he
has chosen to indicate what he will not mention, nothing more disheartening in criticism
than the blindness of the commentators to this wonderful stroke of art. The <quote lang="la">loci
Albani</quote> (v. 387) are a puzzle: but a puzzle does not necessarily imply a corruption or
a carelessness. Vv. 151 and 363 can be explained, though the last is awkward, so that
it is rash to pronounce them interpolations: v. 777 is necessary for the full close of the
paragraph, and to obliterate it shows a want of feeling for rhythm. Vv. 146, 147 are
somewhat inconsistent with the end of Turnus' speech: but he may well be supposed
to change his mind, and after proposing an attack, decide on deferring it to the morrow.
They would come in awkwardly where M. Ribbeck places them, after v. 72: indeed, if
they had appeared in the MSS. anywhere in that neighbourhood, the critic would
probably have condemned them as a <quote>dittographia</quote> of v. 51.</p>
<p>The Seventh Book, according to M. Ribbeck, is especially faulty in the latter part,
the account of the origin of the war and the catalogue, though the earlier part also
shows signs of imperfection. V. 444 he thinks may have been filled up by an interpolator,
not improbably, but Heumann had been before him in the supposition: in suspecting
the latter part of v. 571 he follows Heyne, but the notion is less plausible. He
next points out some lacunae, mostly on insufficient grounds: one after v. 242, on
account of the change of nominative in v. 243; a second after v. 543, on account of
the difficulty in <quote lang="la">convexa;</quote> a third after v. 663, where it must be confessed there is
some abruptness; a fourth after v. 695, where the verb can easily be supplied by a
zeugma; while in v. 535 the same craving for a verb after <quote lang="la">seniorque Galaesus</quote> leads
him to the same suspicion of incompleteness. Then come <quote>dittographiae,</quote> vv. 75&mdash;77
for v. 74, a needless supposition, and vv. 624&mdash;627 for vv. 638&mdash;640, an injurious one,
the lines in question being first dislocated and then condemned. Other dislocations are
the transposition of vv. 395, 396, where a natural variety is sacrificed to an ill-advised
endeavour after regularity, and that of vv. 698&mdash;702 and vv. 703&mdash;705, of which the
same may be said. The two <quote lang="la">vanissimi versus</quote> vv. 146, 147 are attributed to an
interpolator, because after telling us that food had run short, <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> would not have
talked of <quote lang="la">instaurant epulas,</quote> while there is no evidence that the wine had ever been
removed, as is implied in v. 134. But <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> plainly means that having come to the end
of their meal, they renew it in honour of the discovery of their new home, not necessarily
by eating more, but by drinking, and especially by libation. To M. Ribbeck's
<quote lang="la">Otiosi praeterea videntur vv. 386 et 575,</quote> I can only reply, <quote lang="la">Ribbeckio fortasse et
Peerlkampio, sed non mihi.</quote> It is satisfactory, however, that M. Ribbeck does not
follow Peerlkamp in condemning the whole exordium of the book, vv. 1&mdash;35, in
which he thinks him excessive, <quote lang="la">nimius.</quote> I should like to see the Peerlkamp who
could have written the lines.</p>
<p>The Eighth Book M. Ribbeck thinks unusually finished and accurate. He approves
of Heyne's notion of getting rid of the hemistich in v. 41, by combining it with the
latter part of v. 49 and striking out the intervening lines; an alteration which might
appear tempting to one who, like Heyne, would be troubled by the inconsistency with
Book 3, but need not attract persons who, like M. Ribbeck and myself, accept Conrads'
theory expounded above. Peerlkamp, M. Ribbeck considers, has <quote>demonstrated</quote> that
the latter part of v. 13 and the whole of v. 14 were not written by <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>; the fact
being that the language used is that of intentional exaggeration, such as would be consciously
or unconsciously employed by the Italian princes and their emissaries. M.
<pb n="489"/>
Ribbeck puts v. 654 after v. 641, following the example of the Parma edition; but if
he had sufficiently realized the fact that <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> is describing not the historical scenes
as we may conceive them to have taken place, but as they would have been represented
on the shield, he would scarcely have quarrelled with the old order. V. 3, according to
him, is not only superfluous but perverse, as the stirring up of steeds and armour
ought to follow the moving of men's minds, not to precede it. But <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> meant to
represent Turnus' fiery spirit as kindling the spirits of others, and so he represents
him like a roused war-god, shaking his bridle-rein and smiting on his shield, and thus
exciting the Italian tribes. We may compare the description in the simile Book 12,
vv. 331 foll. V. 149 is condemned with Peerlkamp, to the injury of the rhythmical
effect of the passage. Vv. 283, 284 are rejected after a suspicion of Heyne's; a second
instance of M. Ribbeck's antipathy to the notion of a renewed banquet. V. 601 is
called in question, because a Latin poet would hardly have thought it necessary to
specify that Silvanus was god of agriculture and cattle. The specification would be
pardonable as a mere piece of poetical surplusage like <quote>Mars armipotens:</quote> it is laudable
when we consider that <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>, though a Latin poet, is identifying himself with the
Trojan new-comers, and, as it were, explaining Italian customs for their benefit.
Lastly, while rejecting Peerlkamp's view that vv. 666&mdash;670 are a grammarian's addition,
M. Ribbeck censures the passage as inappropriate. I might myself be inclined to
question it if I were certain that I thoroughly comprehended <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s conception of the
shield: as it is, I remember the warning that one ought to be sure that one understands
a writer's ignorance before one professes oneself ignorant of his understanding.
If my readers are as tired as I am of discussing similar criticisms in similar words, they
will be glad to hear that in this Book at any rate there are no supposed cases of
<quote>dittographia.</quote></p>
<p>In the Tenth Book M. Ribbeck suspects the latter half of v. 27, <quote lang="la">nec non exercitus
alter,</quote> of being an interpolation. A stop-gap it may be, as it does not seem particularly
forcible: but there is no reason to doubt that <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> wrote it. Servius indeed does not
explain it: but why should he? V. 20 is objected to because we have not previously
heard of Turnus as riding in a chariot: but he may have appeared in a chariot nevertheless,
as M. Ribbeck admits he does later in this book, v. 440. The mention of
Capua, v. 145, is thought frigid: why so, more than the mention of the competitors in
the ship-race in Book 5, as founders of Roman families? <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> has named Mnestheus
and other Trojan worthies with some honourable addition, and he naturally does the
same in the case of Capys. Vv. 109, 110 are complained of, perhaps because they are
not understood. <persName>Jupiter</persName> declines to entertain the question whether the advantage
gained by the Italians in investing the Trojan camp is due to their own favouring
destiny on the one hand, or on the other to the mistake of the besieged in allowing their
leader to leave them and to the malignant warning conveyed to Turnus by <persName>Juno</persName>.
Perhaps there is something inconsistent in condemning the Trojans implicitly because
<persName>Aeneas</persName>, following a divine intimation, left them to go to Evander: but that is no
ground for doubting the integrity of the text. In v. 475 Pallas, like a <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName>ic
warrior, having thrown his spear, prepares to come to close quarters with his sword:
but he has no opportunity of doing so. We are not obliged to suppose that everything
is related in the precise order in which it occurs: in v. 474 the spear is thrown: in vv.
476 foll. we follow its course: the drawing of the sword doubtless took place while
Turnus was levelling his own spear. The simile in vv. 804 foll. may be a little overloaded;
but this is a <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName>ic fault, and makes us realize the picture more completely.
From some of M. Ribbeck's other remarks I do not greatly differ. The Arcadian
cavalry, whom we left in the Eighth Book, meet us rather unexpectedly in vv. 238
foll. of the present. Turnus in v. 285 is said to encounter the Trojans as they land
with his whole force: we hear nothing of those who were to continue (v. 285) the
<pb n="490"/>
blockade of the camp. The enlargement of Ascanius and his followers is noticed v. 604
with strange and inconvenient brevity. Altogether, the conclusion, <quote lang="la">Ergo non satis
diligenter ac plene haec relata sunt</quote> does not seem an unwarrantable one. But I cannot
agree that vv. 270&mdash;275 are out of place where they stand. We are meant to see
<persName>Aeneas</persName> as the Rutulians saw him, as the fleet came nearer and nearer, a glorious and
terrible presence, like that of a comet or of Sirius. For the time we think of <persName>Aeneas</persName>
and of him only, so that we do not need to be told in v. 270, <emph>whose</emph> head is a blaze of
light. He is described, as he appears to the enemy, just as in the parallel passage in
the Twenty-second Iliad, Achilles is described as he appears to Priam. Then, when we
have looked at him sufficiently with their eyes, we are told that what appals them does
not appal their leader, and our sympathy reverts to Turnus in consequence.</p>
<p>Like the rest, the Eleventh Book is declared to contain instances of incompleteness,
interpolation, and dislocation. V. 87 is said to be incomplete, the poet having probably
intended to insert the complaints of Acoetes; a supposition required neither by literary
propriety, which would rather reject the notion of a third lament, in addition to those
of <persName>Aeneas</persName> and Evander, nor by grammar, which is amply satisfied by making <quote lang="la">sternitur</quote>
the verb of the sentence, <quote>keeps throwing himself on the ground.</quote> The only reason
for suspecting v. 822 is the use of the infinitive of habit in a relative sentence, which is
an arbitrary objection enough, when we consider that the historical infinitive is found
after <quote lang="la">cum</quote> (see Madvig's <emph>Lat. Gr</emph>. &sect; 392); while the integrity of the passage is
strongly supported by the parallel Book 4, vv. 421 foll. Vv. 537&mdash;584 would certainly
be a monstrous parenthesis, if they were a parenthesis at all; but something more conclusive
than the dogmatic <quote lang="la">errat magnopere Servius cum ceteris</quote> must be urged before
a judicious editor will abandon the milder alternative of making them part of Diana's
speech. The proposed transposition of vv. 264, 265 after v. 268 destroys the effect of
<quote lang="la">Ipse Mycenaeus,</quote> &amp;c., coming at the end of a series of enumeration; and there is more
force in making <quote lang="la">invidisse deos</quote> a sorrowful exclamation, like <quote lang="la">non licuit</quote> Book 4, v. 550
spoken of above (I am adducing of course a rhetorical, not a grammatical parallel), than
in constructing it with <quote lang="la">quid referam,</quote> as if Diomede were likely to dismiss his own
misfortune among the <seg lang="la">et ceteras</seg>. I need hardly discuss the question of transposing
vv. 469&mdash;472, as M. Ribbeck is not quite certain whether they ought to go after
v. 476 or v. 485, and finally has recourse to his usual panacea <quote lang="la">nimirum ne hunc quidem
locum satis absolverat poeta.</quote> I may say, however, that the lines appear to me
perfectly in place; there is a general rush to the walls; even Latinus sees that he must
break up the council; and the preparations for defence immediately begin. The
lament of Evander is pronounced too garrulous, and various things in it are excepted
against. <quote>The Trojans ought not to be called <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Phryges</q> (v. 170), except in contempt;</quote>
a sweeping statement, to which Book 1, v. 468, is a sufficient answer. <quote>It is
vain to say that if Pallas had been as old and as strong as Turnus he would have killed
him (vv. 173 foll.);</quote> why is it no praise to say that of two well-matched warriors one
would have prevailed? <quote>Vv. 179&mdash;181 (<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Meritis&mdash;imos</q>) are redundant and feeble;</quote>
they are rather difficult, but I should call them forcible and appropriate. M. Ribbeck
once thought v. 80 a <quote>dittographia;</quote> he now thinks it spurious. I do not see why it
should be either, though it is not particularly striking. Vv. 523 foll. he suspects to be
a repetition of Book 7, vv. 565 foll., as if, because there is a gorge (or rather, as appears to
be the fact, a pond under a hill) in one spot, there could not be a wooded defile in another.
Lastly, v. 607 is condemned as harsh in itself, <quote>ardescit</quote> being not even suited to
<quote lang="la">fremitus,</quote> much less to <quote lang="la">adventus,</quote> and as absolutely needless after vv. 597 foll. I
should myself have said that <quote>ardescit</quote> was a word which none but a poet like <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>
could have used, suggesting the com<persName>Paris</persName>on of an approaching flame with its heat and
glare, while at the same time we are made to think of the actual glow of the rapid
advance and the warm breath of the horses. But tastes differ.
<pb n="491"/></p>
<p>In the Twelfth Book three instances of incompleteness are noted, v. 218, vv. 732,
733, and vv. 889&mdash;893. In the first the language is confessedly harsh and obscure,
and until some parallel shall be produced, we need not hesitate to admit that <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>
has expressed himself carelessly. The connexion between vv. 732, 733, is like that of
which I spoke in the Ninth Book: the poet passes from the regular narrative to the
unexpressed thoughts of Turnus, who feels that he is undone <quote lang="la">ni fuga subsidio subeat.</quote>
So far from being incomplete in a poetical sense, the passage is highly finished. The
third passage would hardly have been excepted against by any one not possessed by an
unseasonable spirit of logical precision. <persName>Aeneas</persName> first tells Turnus plainly that he can
fly no longer but must stand and fight, and then tauntingly bids him to transform
himself as he pleases, soar into the air or dive into the depth. Vv. 879&mdash;881 and 882&mdash;
884 M. Ribbeck apparently thinks a <quote>dittographia:</quote> but Juturna may be allowed a
little amplification in her parting lament. The speech of Latinus on ratifying the
treaty is complained of; vv. 203, 205 are thought too exaggerated for <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>, and interfere,
it is urged, with the construction of the following lines: the poet however has
followed <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName>, who introduces the appeal to the sceptre with still less attention to
regularity, though in each case the reader receives the impression intended, that of
physical impossibility that the thing spoken of or hinted at should take place. <quote lang="la">Haud
nescia rerum</quote> (v. 227) is not an idle supplement, but an epic mannerism. Why we are
to suspect vv. 439 foll. <quote lang="la">et te animo&mdash;<persName>Hector</persName></quote> because we know that interpolators
were in the habit of filling up imperfect lines does not appear. I need hardly defend
vv. 563, 564, as M. Ribbeck admits that Wagner has excused them sufficiently. The
transposition of vv. 515, 516, adopted from Peerlkamp, is ingenious but unnecessary.
To remove vv. 801, 802 from their present place and insert them after v. 831 (which is
M. Ribbeck's last proposal) is to remove from <persName>Jupiter</persName>'s first speech the one touch of
playfulness which shows that he means to conciliate even where his commands are
peremptory. If it is replied, as M. Ribbeck replies in his <quote>emendationes Vergilianae,</quote>
that <persName>Jupiter</persName> in his first speech ought to be simply peremptory, and that the time for
conciliation is afterwards, when <persName>Juno</persName> has declared herself willing to submit, we may
rejoin by urging the inconsistency of the words <quote lang="la">precibusque inflectere nostris</quote> (v. 800)
with the tone of unqualified command which M. Ribbeck bids us expect. Here, as in so
many other places, the critic is misled by failing to appreciate the free play of feeling,
which, both in poetry and in impassioned rhetoric, refuses to be bound by the strict rules
of logical sequence.</p>
<p>What more I have to say about M. Ribbeck's Prolegomena relates chiefly to the last
section of his thirteenth chapter, that in which he defends the various conjectures
which he has introduced into the text. I will notice, however, one or two points <emph>in
transitu</emph>, from the earlier sections of the same chapter.</p>
<p>In speaking of the Verona fragment (p. 275), M. Ribbeck proposes to read <quote lang="la">velis</quote> for
<quote lang="la">ventis</quote> in Aen. 3. 705. <quote lang="la">Dare vela</quote> is of course common enough: and perhaps for
that very reason <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> did not use it here. M. Ribbeck is quite right in saying that
<quote lang="la">datis ventis</quote> is not to be supported from 3. 61, where <quote lang="la">dare classibus austros</quote> has a
different meaning: but he gives no reason why <quote lang="la">datis ventis,</quote> in the sense of winds
vouchsafed by the gods, is improper or unnatural. Does he forget the common expression
<quote lang="la">ventis vocatis,</quote> which may be said to be almost correlative to <quote lang="la">ventis datis,</quote>
or the many passages in the classics where the gods are said to send favouring winds?</p>
<p>In the section on the Vatican fragment he defends his conjecture <quote lang="la">num</quote> for <quote lang="la">cum</quote>
Aen. 9. 513, by attacking the received reading as expressing a state of things which is
contradicted by what happens immediately afterwards. But that is precisely <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s
object: he throws himself by turns into the feelings of the two contending parties: the
Trojans hurl down stones: the Rutulians (so to say) laugh at them, and declare that
under their penthouse they can endure everything with content and even pleasure; in
<pb n="492"/>
the moment of their satisfaction however a huger mass than usual thunders down upon
them, and they are crushed and broken.</p>
<p>In the section on the Roman MS. <quote lang="la">effrena</quote> is proposed for <quote lang="la">ea frena</quote> in Aen. 6. 101.
Nothing is said against the reading of the MSS., so that it is not easy to see how to
defend it. I can hardly suppose M. Ribbeck not to be aware that <quote lang="la">ea frena concutit</quote>
is <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s way of saying <quote lang="la">tam vehementer frena concutit,</quote> or that shaking the bridle
is a natural expression for making the horse feel the bit: and yet if neither of these
supposed difficulties was the motive for altering the text, it is hard to say what can
have been.</p>
<p>In the section on the Gudian MS. M. Ribbeck takes occasion to discuss two passages
where he changes the received reading. In Aen. 1. 396 Pal. corrected has <quote lang="la">captos iam
respectare,</quote> Gud. originally <quote lang="la">captos iam etpectare,</quote> words which he supposes to point
to what he considers the true reading, <quote>capsos iam respectare.</quote> The swans are said to
look towards their coops or enclosures, a strange sense, as nothing in the passage leads
us to suppose that tame swans are spoken of, and expressed by a strange word, the
authority for which in that sense seems to be a single passage in Velleius. He objects
to the common reading <quote lang="la">in despectando per se spes perfugii nulla:</quote> true: but the poet
(as Dr. W. Wagner remarks) is speaking not of escape but of freedom from danger:
the eagle is out of the way, just as the storm is over, and the swans are settling on the
ground at leisure. The other passage is v. 323 of the same book, where M. Ribbeck
thinks Madvig right in objecting to the common reading, or at least to the common
punctuation, wrong in connecting <quote lang="la">maculosae</quote> (or <quote lang="la">maculoso</quote>) <quote>tegmine lyncis</quote> with
<quote lang="la">cursum,</quote> as <quote lang="la">tegmine</quote> could not be used for the hide of a living beast. M. Ribbeck
himself adopts <quote lang="la">tegmina</quote> from Gud., making <quote>tegmina lyncis</quote> co-ordinate with <quote lang="la">cursum</quote>
as the object of <quote lang="la">prementem.</quote> I do not know Madvig's remarks, which were
published in a Dutch periodical in <date value="1859">1859</date>, so that, as before, I am not sure what I am to
answer: I suppose, however, that it is not the huntress wearing a lynx's skin which is
objected to, as that might be paralleled, but the apparent awkwardness of <quote lang="la">aut</quote> as
coupling <quote lang="la">succinctam</quote> with <quote lang="la">prementem.</quote> <quote lang="la">Prementem,</quote> however, is coupled not with
<quote lang="la">succinctam</quote> but with <quote lang="la">errantem,</quote> the two cases supposed being that the huntress is
wandering about in search of game and that she is in the full cry of the chase. As to
<quote lang="la">prementem tegmina lyncis</quote> in the sense of hunting a lynx for its hide, I scarcely think
it will be considered to add much beauty to the passage.</p>
<p>In speaking of the Berne MS. which he calls c, he mentions his own conjecture on
Aen. 1. 455, <quote lang="la">intrans</quote> for <quote lang="la">inter se,</quote> as partially supported by that copy, which has
<quote lang="la">intra se.</quote> <quote lang="la">Artificum manus inter se miratur</quote> is a <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>ian expression for <quote lang="la">artificum
manus miratur dum aliam cum alia confert:</quote> <quote lang="la">intrans,</quote> unless I am greatly mistaken,
would be exceedingly flat, and not at all like <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s manner. <quote lang="la">Variis,</quote> which M.
Ribbeck extracts from <quote>uaseis,</quote> the reading of the aforesaid MS. for <quote lang="la">roseis</quote> in Aen. 7.
26, does not seem particularly tempting, though had it been the reading of the MSS.
it might have passed without remark. <quote lang="la">Croceis,</quote> Schrader's and Bentley's conjecture,
is far more plausible. But <quote lang="la">roseis</quote> is supported by an exact parallel in Ovid, Fasti
4. 713, <quote lang="la">Postera cum veniet&mdash;Memnonis in roseis lutea mater equis,</quote> which I owe to my
friend Mr. Nettleship.</p>
<p>In the sixteenth section of the same chapter, in which the inferior MSS. are discussed,
M. Ribbeck speaks of six <persName>Paris</persName> MSS., as containing the <quote>optima emendatio</quote>
<quote lang="la"><persName>Paris</persName></quote> for <quote lang="la">creat</quote> in Aen. 10. 705. In his critical note on the passage he had expressed
himself more cautiously, <quote lang="la">si fides Potterio,</quote> Pottier's reliability as a reporter of the
readings of his <persName>Paris</persName> MSS. having been generally questioned by subsequent critics. Some
years ago, being anxious to set the question at rest, I requested my friend Mr. Duckworth
(of Trinity College, Oxford), who happened to be in <persName>Paris</persName>, to examine
the six MSS. in this passage: and he assured me that none of them contained the
<pb n="493"/>
word <quote lang="la"><persName>Paris</persName></quote> or anything like it, all having <quote lang="la">creat</quote> or some slight variety of <quote lang="la">creat.</quote>
After this, I should not be disposed to trust Pottier's report of the transposition of the
lines 660&mdash;665 in the same book without further evidence. The mistakes which M.
Ribbeck has made in this section about the English MSS. of <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> have been pointed
out by Dr. W. Wagner in the postscript to his first paper <quote>On Ribbeck's <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName></quote> read
before the Philological Society.</p>
<p>I now come to the seventeenth section, which is chiefly occupied by a defence of the
conjectures introduced by M. Ribbeck into the text. He believes that all the extant
copies of <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> can be traced to a single (unknown) archetype, written <quote lang="la">parum nitide,</quote>
and filled with a multitude of conjectures, glosses, and interpolations. The arguments
by which he supports his belief are first, the instances of agreement presented by particular
MSS. in the transposition of words, secondly, the instances where the true
reading has had to be restored conjecturally. So far as I understand the first argument,
it is to the effect that instances may be produced where any two of the better
MSS. agree against the rest in a particular transposition, which points to the conclusion
that there must have been one great repertory of transpositions from which
copyists drew <seg lang="la">ad libitum</seg>. I do not profess to be skilled in the art of constructing a
conjectural history of the text of an ancient author: but I should have thought that
the phaenomena of the text of <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> were likely to be particularly impatient of being
accounted for on any such hypothesis, and it certainly does not seem to me that the
instances of transposition which M. Ribbeck adduces are either so numerous or so
striking as to require any other explanation than that of accidental coincidence in the
case of copies considered to be otherwise independent. But I must hasten to the second
argument, or rather to the conjectures which are produced as constituting its strength.</p>
<p>In <bibl n="Verg. Ecl. 3">E. 3. 110</bibl> <quote>hau temnet dulcis, haut</quote> cannot be called a happy conjecture. The
received reading at any rate gives an appropriate sense, <quote>both are worthy of the prize,
and so are all who like you can realize the sweet and bitter of love:</quote> the new reading
introduces a general maxim for which Palaemon's speech hardly seems the place.
<quote lang="la">Alte</quote> for <quote lang="la">ante</quote> <bibl n="Verg. Ecl. 6">E. 6. 80</bibl> is ingenious, but not convincing. The sense it gives is unobjectionable,
but it would I think be a little feeble here: and so I would rather take my
chance between the two rival interpretations of <quote lang="la">ante,</quote> though neither is free from
exception. Neither the change of <quote>an</quote> <bibl n="Verg. Ecl. 8">E. 8. 49</bibl> into <quote>at,</quote> nor the reconstruction of
the whole passage which it involves, seems to me <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>ian: nor can I recognize the
necessity of exact strophical correspondence in Damon's and Alphesiboeus' songs, though
I am glad to introduce an additional burden from Gud. after v. 28.</p>
<p>In <bibl n="Verg. G. 3.402">G. 3. 402</bibl> M. Ribbeck thinks Scaliger's <quote>exportans</quote> necessary. I have endeavoured
in my commentary to prove that it is unnecessary, and that the reading of the
MSS. is unobjectionable: but as M. Ribbeck adduces no reasons, I cannot defend myself.
<quote>Tussos</quote> <bibl n="Verg. G. 4.62">G. 4. 62</bibl> is highly ingenious, though the credit is really due to Reiske: but
<quote lang="la">iussos</quote> is perfectly <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>ian, being supported by <quote lang="la">monstratas aras</quote> v. 549 of the
same book, <quote lang="la">iussos honores</quote> Aen. 3. 547. If any one objects to <quote lang="la">iussos</quote> of things which
are not yet commanded, he may refer to Aen. 8. 629, <quote lang="la">pugnataque in ordine bella,</quote> a
stronger case. Here the things are said to be already prescribed, because they will
have been prescribed before the action enjoined can take place.</p>
<p>The conjectures introduced into the text of the Aeneid are naturally more numerous.
Rutgers' <quote lang="la">Eurum</quote> for <quote lang="la">Hebrum</quote> Aen. 1. 317 would be quite unobjectionable, scarcely
going beyond the licence which may be taken in dealing with the MS. spellings of
proper names, if <quote lang="la">Hebrum</quote> were not placed beyond doubt by the imitation of Silius 2.
73 foll., and by its evident appropriateness to Harpalyce of Thrace. Huet's <quote lang="la">auri</quote> for
<quote lang="la">agri</quote> v. 343 is highly plausible: but it is natural enough that <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> should be
thinking of a wealthy Roman of his own time <quote lang="la">dives agris, dives positis in fenore
nummis,</quote> rather than of the particular kind of wealth which a Phoenician would be
<pb n="494"/>
likely to possess, and to talk of land in one place and gold in another is quite in keeping
with his love of variety.</p>
<p>In Aen. 2. 76 M. Ribbeck reads <quote lang="la">Quive fuat, memores quae sit fiducia capto.</quote> I see
no objection to <quote>quive fuat,</quote> if only <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> had written it: but the MSS. tell us he
wrote <quote lang="la">quidve ferat,</quote> which is equally unobjectionable. M. Ribbeck says the Trojans
could not know that Sinon had anything to tell: but it was natural to presume that
he had, as he had purposely thrown himself in their way. But the rest of the emendation,
<quote lang="la">memores quae sit fiducia capto,</quote> which I suppose must mean <quote>recollecting that
a prisoner would require to be reassured,</quote> does not seem to me in <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s manner. In
the common reading <quote lang="la">quae sit fiducia capto</quote> means, as Dr. Henry well puts it, <quote>why
he should not meet the captive's doom.</quote></p>
<p>In the vexed passage Aen. 4. 436 M. Ribbeck gives in his text <quote lang="la">Quam mihi cum dederit,
cumulatam monte remittam.</quote> The last words he apparently understands <quote>I will
repay it with a mountain by way of interest.</quote> To promise mountains of gold, or to
promise seas and mountains, are, as he says, proverbial expressions in Latin for to make
extravagant and excessive promises. But there is no reason to believe that such a colloquial
hyperbole would be admitted into epic poetry: besides, M. Ribbeck ought to
have remembered that nothing is so hazardous as to attempt to manipulate a familiar
proverb by varying the expression. Half the stories which are told of blunders made
by foreigners in trying to speak an unfamiliar language idiomatically turn upon unadvised
experiments of this sort. I fear if <seg lang="la">Aulus Gellius</seg> could come to life again, he
would write a chapter on the stranger who wished to introduce <quote lang="la">cumulatam monte</quote>
into <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>.</p>
<p>Dr. W. Wagner thinks M. Ribbeck's conjecture of <quote lang="la">funibus</quote> for <quote lang="la">finibus</quote> Aen. 5.
139 deserving of much praise. I cannot myself think it plausible. The new expression
seems to me slightly harsh: the old is quite unobjectionable. As for the assertion that
<quote lang="la">fines</quote> is never used for the station of ships in a harbour, what is to be said of it?
<quote lang="la">Fines</quote> is a word of general and almost universal application for the limits within which
anything is contained: and no English poet would scruple to use <quote>limit</quote> on a similar
occasion.</p>
<p>In Aen. 6. 520 the MSS. make Deiphobus talk of himself as <quote lang="la">confectum curis</quote> on
the night when he slept his last sleep. M. Ribbeck objects that we have just been told
that the Trojans spent their last night in revelry. True: but it was a short revelry
succeeding a long agony of care: and in taking, as they thought, their first rest after
the departure of the Greeks, they must have had heavy arrears of weariness to get rid
of. There is exactly the same feeling in <quote lang="la">mortalibus aegris</quote> Aen. 2. 268, where,
though the expression is general, the poet evidently intends to excite our special sympathy
for the Trojans. Schrader's <quote lang="la">choreis</quote> is ingenious: but it is precisely one of those
changes which critics make from taking a too contracted view of a subject.</p>
<p>Peerlkamp's <quote lang="la">arva</quote> for <quote lang="la">arma</quote> Aen. 7. 430 is not at all impossible: but I think it
more likely that <quote lang="la">arma</quote> after <quote lang="la">armari</quote> is a carelessness of <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s. On this however
there may well be two opinions, and probably my own judgment is biassed by my
general belief in the integrity of the MSS. In v. 667 I do not think M. Ribbeck's
insertion of <quote lang="la">os</quote> after <quote>inpexum</quote> is required by the sense, while it certainly does not
improve the rhythm.</p>
<p>In Aen. 8. 211 there is no occasion to couple <quote lang="la">raptos</quote> with <quote lang="la">tractos</quote> and construct
it with <quote lang="la">versis viarum indiciis.</quote> Those words belong to <quote lang="la">tractos:</quote> <quote lang="la">raptos</quote> goes
closely with <quote lang="la">occultabat.</quote> At the same time I do not mean to deny the plausibility of
Wakefield's <quote lang="la">raptor,</quote> if we were dealing with an author whose text was more liable to
suspicion.</p>
<p>M. Ribbeck complains of Lucian M&uuml;ller's invective against his emendation <quote lang="la">qua vi
clausos</quote> in Aen. 9. 67, saving that if he had not been aware that the rhythm introduced
<pb n="495"/>
was an unusual one, he should not have apologized for it. It is really a question
of ear: and there are doubtless many ears to which the new line will seem hardly
<persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>ian, in spite of <bibl n="Verg. G. 3.276">G. 3. 276</bibl> and Aen. 7. 634. <quote lang="la">Via</quote> in the received reading is
synonymous with <quote lang="la">ratio,</quote> as in Aen. 12. 405. <quote lang="la">Sic</quote> for <quote lang="la">sed</quote> in v. 146 of Aen. 9
depends on a transposition which we have already seen reason to reject. In v. 226
<quote lang="la">et,</quote> though not found in the MSS., is said to be necessary before <quote lang="la">delecta.</quote> I do
not know what is the objection to taking <quote lang="la">delecta iuventus</quote> in apposition with <quote lang="la">ductores,</quote>
but I suppose it is either that the leaders would be too old to be designated as
<quote lang="la">iuventus,</quote> or that the word naturally implies the rank and file, as distinguished from
the chiefs. To the first I reply that <quote lang="la">iuventus</quote> means little more than fighting men,
and that <persName>Aeneas</persName> and Achates are addressed as <quote lang="la">iuvenes</quote> Aen. 1. 321; to the second
that Catillus and Coras, who are unquestionably leaders, are called <quote lang="la">Argiva iuventus</quote>
Aen. 7. 672. V. 403 is critically difficult, as the MSS. vary, and the best supported
reading is not the most likely intrinsically; but that seems no reason for introducing a
conjecture. V. 676 <quote lang="la">freti armis</quote> is unobjectionable, as the opposition is not between
arms and personal strength, but between the protection afforded by walls, and that
which a warrior can give himself by his use of his weapons. It is conceivable, however,
that as in Aen. 4. 11, Aen. 11. 641, and possibly other unsuspected places, <quote lang="la">armis</quote>
may be from <quote lang="la">armi.</quote> At any rate we do not need to read <quote lang="la">animis.</quote></p>
<p>As to <quote lang="la">transiit</quote> Aen. 10. 785, I must refer to the Excursus on <bibl n="Verg. G. 2.81">G. 2. 81</bibl> in the
second edition of my first volume. Peerlkamp's <quote lang="la">quamvis dolor alto volnere tardet</quote>
for <quote lang="la">quamquam vis alto volnere tardat</quote> (or <quote lang="la">tardet</quote>) is really ingenious; far more so
than Hoffmann's <quote lang="la">vis alti volneris ardet.</quote> The received reading is difficult: <quote lang="la">vis,</quote> in
<persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> at any rate, is generally used for offensive force, and the intransitive use of
<quote lang="la">tardo</quote> is rare, though we might give it its active meaning, and say that his physical
strength keeps him back by reason of the wound. On the whole I am not sure that the
<quote lang="la">perversa ratio</quote> of Servius (as M. Ribbeck calls it) is not right, and that <quote lang="la">vis</quote> is not
the violence of the wound, as the use of the instrumental ablative instead of the
possessive genitive is quite in keeping with <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s other manipulations of language.</p>
<p>There is not much force in M. Ribbeck's objection to <quote lang="la">acceperit ultro,</quote> Aen. 11.
471, <quote lang="la">qui accipit sequitur voluntatem alterius, ergo nihil ultra id facit quod voluit
alter.</quote> A person may be compelled to accept a thing, or he may accept it voluntarily;
and it is the latter of these situations in which Latinus would gladly have been.
<quote lang="la">Asciverit urbi</quote> is better than <quote lang="la">acceperit urbi:</quote> the one implies that <persName>Aeneas</persName> would
have been the <quote lang="la">gener</quote> of the state (comp. Aen. 11. 105): the latter could only refer
to <persName>Aeneas</persName>' admission within the walls, a much poorer thought. In v. 728 I cannot
agree that <quote>iniicit iras</quote> is weak, though Heinsius' <quote lang="la">incutit,</quote> if <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> could only be
shown to have written it, would be an exceedingly good word. <quote>Iniicio</quote> is a strong
word in itself: the only question is whether it can be used idiomatically with <quote lang="la">iras,</quote>
and that the dictionaries, with their <quote>iniicere metum,</quote> <quote lang="la">formidinem,</quote> &amp;c., set at rest.</p>
<p>Last of all is a passage in Aen. 12. 55, where it is said of Amata, <quote lang="la">ardentem generum
moritura tenebat.</quote> M. Ribbeck objects that <quote lang="la">moritura</quote> would mean that she was
actually going to die, and substitutes <quote lang="la">monitura.</quote> Is it possible? <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>, in the
rapidity of his passion, says that the queen clung to her son-in-law with the tenacious
grasp of one with death before her: the critic says she held him in order to advise or
reprove him. <emph>Utri creditis</emph>, <emph>Quirites</emph>?</p>
<p>As I said in my former paper, I have no wish to derogate from the undoubted merits
of M. Ribbeck's work: but I cannot but think that such criticisms as many of those
which I have been noticing are a serious drawback to its value. English scholarship
has not a few deficiencies: is it not preserved from some errors by the practice of Latin
verse composition?</p>

<head>ON MADVIG'S EMENDATIONS IN <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>.</head>
<p>IN the second volume of his <emph>Adversaria Critica</emph> (Copenhagen, 1873) Madvig has an
important chapter in which he proposes a number of emendations in the text of <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>.
It need hardly be said that the remarks of so great a Latin scholar are in the great
majority of cases powerful and suggestive, worth recording and examining even by those
who find themselves unable to agree with them in detail: and though it cannot, I think,
be considered that Madvig's touch is so sure when he is dealing with poets as when he
is handling the text of prose authors, it must at the same time be allowed that any
scholar who ventures to differ from him is bound to show good reasons for his difference,
and can, in any case, only derive benefit from the necessary process of examination and
discussion.</p>
<p>Madvig's general conclusions on the right method of dealing with <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s text tend
in the conservative direction. <quote lang="la">Nam in poeta,</quote> he says (p. 30), <quote lang="la">ab Alexandrinorum
exemplo pendenti nec ipso ad facilem et simplicem orationis formam, ut videtur, facto
et exercitato, et, quod ad Aeneidem attinet, in poemate ultimam manum non experto
multa ferenda sunt et paulo artificiosius et obscurius cogitata et tumidius dicta verbisque
adumbrata et nove dureque posita quaedam.</quote> I should feel disposed to develope a little
more fully, and more in favour of the poet, this true and terse exposition of the
difficulties of <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s style. <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s language was to a great extent the new creation
of a plastic genius, consciously accepted as such by the literary sense of his time and of
the century succeeding him: a consideration making, so far as it goes, in favour of the
MS. tradition where it does not support absolute nonsense. All poets are to a certain
extent innovators in language, the extent of their innovations being determined by their
instinctive sense of what the spirit of their language requires: and <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s mastery of
the Latin language, whether displayed in conservation or in invention, was, I venture
to think, greater than that of any other Latin poet. The more need, therefore, of
caution before attempting alteration in his text: the less the chance that any given
alteration proposed (granting some alteration to be necessary) will certainly correspond
with what <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> himself would have written.</p>
<p>But it is time to attempt some justification of these remarks in detail. I will begin
with Madvig's proposal on the last three lines of the third Eclogue&mdash;
<quote lang="la"><l>Non nostrum inter vos tantas componere lites:</l>
<l lang="la">Et vitula tu dignus et hic, et quisquis amores</l>
<l lang="la">Aut metuet dulcis aut experietur amaros.</l>
</quote></p>
<p><quote lang="la">Non quisquis,</quote> he says, <quote lang="la">in amore infelix est aut, ne sit, metuit, dignus illo praemio
dici posse videtur, sed quisquis eam infelicitatem certo modo fert solaturque, velut
cantando lenit, eiusque rei significatio in eo vocabulo, quod <emph>dulcis</emph> <seg lang="la">scribitur, inesse
debet ineritque, si id nominativo casu acceperimus, altera syllaba in arsi producta</seg> . . .
Ac <emph>languentis</emph> <seg lang="la">genitivo casu, producta in arsi ultima, Vergilius posuit</seg> Aen. xi. 69:
<seg lang="la">nominativo autem</seg> <emph>is</emph> produxit in <emph>pulvis</emph> i. 478, <seg lang="la">sed in forma nihil ambigui habente</seg>.</quote>
To make <emph>dulcis</emph> the nominative, when an antithesis is clearly required to <emph>amaros</emph>, seems
very forced: nor do either of the analogies to which Madvig appeals support the
lengthening of the final syllable of <emph>dulcis. Pulv&imacr;s</emph> has a distinct justification in
<pb n="497"/>
grammar, the nominative being of the same class as <emph>pub&emacr;s pub&ebreve;ris</emph>, <emph>Cer&emacr;s Cer&ebreve;ris:</emph> while
in 11. 69 <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> writes <emph><seg lang="la">languentis hyacinthi</seg></emph> in imitation of a Greek rhythm. (See
Excursus on Book 12.)

<l lang="la">Ferret hiemps culmumque levem stipulasque volantis.</l>
</quote></cit></p>
<p>For <emph>ita</emph> Madvig would read <emph>ut</emph>, objecting that <emph>ita</emph> implies a com<persName>Paris</persName>on. But <emph>ita</emph> may
quite as well be taken as meaning <emph>with such violence:</emph> compare (with Conington) Lucretius
1. 275, <quote><emph>ita</emph> <seg lang="la">perfurit acri Cum fremitu saevitque minaci murmure pontus</seg>:</quote> 286, <quote><emph>ita</emph>
<seg lang="la">magno turbidus imbri Molibus incurrens validis cum viribus amnis Dat sonitu magno
stragem</seg>.</quote> That <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> wrote <emph>ita</emph> it seems impossible to doubt on a com<persName>Paris</persName>on of these
lines of Lucretius: with such minuteness does he constantly reproduce the <emph>ipsissima
verba</emph> of his great predecessor.

<quote lang="la"><l>Ante locum similem exquirunt, ubi prima paretur</l>
<l lang="la">Arboribus seges et quo mox digesta feratur,</l>
<l lang="la">Mutatam ignorent subito ne semina matrem.</l>
</quote></cit></p>
<p>For <emph>et</emph> Madvig would read <emph>ei</emph>, which he would scan as a monosyllable (see Lach mann
on Lucretius, p. 152). There seems no objection to an alteration which would completely
clear up the sense, except that possibly <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> might be more sensitive about the scansion
of <emph>ei</emph> as a monosyllable than Lucretius, Catullus, or Manilius.

</quote></cit></p>
<p>For <emph>sic</emph> Madvig would read <emph>sub</emph>, remarking <quote>adverbium <emph>sic</emph> <seg lang="la">nihil omnino habet quo
referatur aut quod significet, quoniam ante tantum de cura lanae albae sine maculis
servandae agitur</seg>.</quote> I cannot agree with this criticism: the transition expressed by <emph>sic</emph>

<p>Madvig's correction <emph>suco</emph> for <emph>fuco</emph> seems as simple a correction as is possible, supposing
correction to be needed. But is it impossible that <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> used <emph>fucus</emph> (= <emph>dye</emph> or

</quote></cit></p>
<p>For <emph><seg lang="la">inter se</seg></emph> Madvig, following a Berne MS. of the ninth century whose first hand
gives <emph>intrase</emph>, would read <emph><seg lang="la">intra se</seg>:</emph> thus obtaining an excellent solution of an unquestionable
difficulty from the same material as that from which Ribbeck elicits his more
questionable emendation <emph>intrans</emph>. Quintilian (10. 6. 2., 11. 3. 2) uses the phrases <emph><seg lang="la">intra

</quote></p>
<p>For <emph>parent</emph> Madvig considers it certain that <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> wrote <emph>paret</emph>. It appears to me,
however, probable that <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> would have preferred to describe the perplexity of the
multitude as twofold: what was their duty, and what were the demands of Apollo.
The distinction is descriptive and poetical rather than real: but it is not on this account
less <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>ian. <emph>Fata</emph> then should be taken as accusative after <emph>parent:</emph> <quote>for whom they

<quote><l>3. 340.</l>

<p><quote lang="la">Quem (quae?) tibi iam Troia.</quote> Madvig, reading <emph>quae</emph>, would place this hemistich
after the words <quote lang="la">Iliacamque iugis hanc addidit arcem</quote> v. 336. The passage has been
sufficiently discussed by Conington in his essay on Ribbeck's Prolegomena. I will only
observe here that Madvig omits to mention the reading <emph>quem</emph>, which, according to good
authority, is found in the Medicean, and which if correct shows that the words refer to
Ascanius, mentioned in v. 339. In 3. 360 Madvig would read <quote>tripodas Clarii <emph>et</emph>
laurus</quote> for <quote lang="la">tripodas, Clarii laurus.</quote>

<l lang="la">Ecce autem Boreas angusta ab sede Pelori</l>
<l lang="la">Missus adest.</l>
</quote></p>
<p>Here Madvig proposes one of his most ingenious and successful emendations. <persName>Aeneas</persName>
is advised by Helenus (3. 410 foll.) to make for Latium not by the straits of Messana,
but by sailing round Sicily. On his reaching the neighbourhood of Aetna, his companions
are terrified at the sight of the Cyclopes, and think of nothing but flight
(<quote lang="la">quocumque rudentes excutere</quote>). Vv. 684&mdash;6, <quote lang="la">contra</quote>&mdash;<quote lang="la">cursus,</quote> seem to contain
the warning of Helenus that such a course would lead to almost certain destruction
But this sense can hardly be pressed out of the words as they stand, <quote lang="la">contra iussa
monent.</quote> To get rid of this difficulty Madvig proposes to read <emph><seg lang="la">contra ac</seg></emph> for <emph>contra</emph>,
taking <emph>ni</emph> in v. 686 as = <emph>ne</emph>, and joining <emph><seg lang="la">ni teneant</seg></emph> with <emph><seg lang="la">iussa monent</seg></emph>. The passage
would then run as follows:
<quote lang="la"><l>Contra ac iussa monent Heleni, Scyllam atque Charybdim</l>
<l lang="la">Inter, utramque viam leti discrimine parvo,</l>
<l lang="la">Ni (= ne) teneant cursus, certum est dare lintea retro.</l>
<l lang="la">Ecce autem &amp;c.</l>
</quote></p>
<p><quote>They determine to sail back (i. e. northward), against Helenus' express warning to
them not to try the fatal way between Scylla and Charybdis. But a wind blows from
the north and frustrates their design.</quote></p>
<p>The two emendations in the sixth book, <quote>Pirithoumque <emph>et</emph> <seg lang="la">Quo super atra silex</seg></quote> for
<quote lang="la">Pirithoumque, quo</quote> or <quote lang="la">quos,</quote> and <quote>merset</quote> for <quote lang="la">mersit</quote> in v. 615 are less important.
It may be observed that it would be hazardous to adopt the first until we are
<seg lang="la">quite sure</seg> that <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> was not following some story now lost. With regard to the
second, it is difficult to see that <emph>merset</emph> is an improvement on <emph>mersit</emph>. In the line <quote lang="la">quae
forma viros fortunave mersit,</quote> <emph>forma</emph> has usually been taken as = <emph><seg lang="la">forma sceleris</seg>:</emph>
in this case <emph>fortuna</emph> would refer to the vicissitudes in the life of the guilty on earth.
<pb n="499"/>
But Madvig would take <emph>forma</emph> as = <emph><seg lang="la">forma poenae</seg></emph>. What then becomes of <emph>fortuna</emph>?
It is hardly natural to understand it of their lot in the under-world.
<quote><l>8. 74.</l>
</quote></p>
<p><persName>Aeneas</persName> addressing the river-god Tiberinus says (according to the MS. tradition),
<quote lang="la"><l>Quo te cumque lacus, miserantem incommoda nostra,</l>
<l lang="la">Fonte tenet, quocumque solo pulcherrimus exis.</l>
</quote></p>
<p>Here Madvig remarks, <quote lang="la">Ridicule omnino lacus dicitur fluvium fonte tenere, et <emph>quocumque</emph>,
<seg lang="la">quasi pluribus eum tenere possit: magis, si fieri potest, ridicule, qui ignotam
sibi originem fluvii significat, sic loquitur</seg>: <emph><seg lang="la">quocumque te lacus fonte tenet</seg>;</emph> <seg lang="la">nam ex
fonte nasci fluvium scit, ex lacu nasci qui scire potest</seg>?</quote> He would therefore read
<quote lang="la">qui te cumque locus.</quote> Now it must be remarked, first, that <emph>lacus</emph> is the reading
acknowledged by Servius: secondly, that <persName>Aeneas</persName> is not addressing the river-god as a
river rising from a spring, but as a deity dwelling in a subterraneous cavern (<quote lang="la">Dixit,
deinde <emph>lacu</emph> <seg lang="la">fluvius se condidit alto, Ima petens</seg>,</quote> eight lines above the passage under
discussion). So in the fourth Georgic (v. 365 foll.) we have the rivers imagined in
Platonic fashion as rising from a vast underground recess: <quote>unde <emph><seg lang="la">pater Tiberinus</seg></emph> <seg lang="la">et
unde Aniena fluenta</seg>.</quote> The ablative <quote lang="la">quo fonte</quote> may be taken as local, not
instrumental: <quote>near whatever spring thy lake shelters thee:</quote> comp. <quote lang="la">secretum

<p>In the difficult passage 9. 282, <quote lang="la">tantum fortuna secunda Haud (or <emph>aut</emph>) <seg lang="la">adversa cadat</seg>,</quote>
Madvig would read <quote><emph>aut</emph> adversa <emph>cadet</emph>.</quote> <quote>Of myself I am certain: fortune alone
will turn out either favouring or adverse.</quote> Is it too much to say that this is to make
Euryalus utter a platitude? The passage is satisfactorily dealt with by Conington,
who, reading <emph>haud</emph>, interprets <quote>Let but fortune be prosperous, not adverse.</quote> The
expression of a feeling of misgiving at the approaching venture is quite in harmony
with the spirit of the context.
<cit><bibl>9. 386 foll.</bibl>
<quote lang="la"><l>Nisus abit, iamque imprudens evaserat hostis</l>
<l lang="la">Atque locos, qui post Albae de nomine dicti</l>
<l lang="la">Albani &amp;c.</l>
</quote></cit></p>
<p>Madvig would get over the geographical difficulty by reading <emph>locis</emph>, which he would
join with <quote lang="la">ut stetit et frustra absentem respexit amicum.</quote> I should be more inclined
to suppose that <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> was alluding to some place and name to which we have lost the

<p>Here it seems clear that Madvig has fallen into error through not sufficiently attending
to <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>ian, and indeed poetic, usage. <quote lang="la">Unum poeta promittit se commemoraturum

<pb n="500"/>
swan's feathers: <quote>a reproach, Love, to thee and thy mother.</quote> (See additional
notes.)</p>
<p>In 10. 279 Madvig would read <emph>viri</emph> and punctuate <quote lang="la">In manibus Mars: ipse, viri,
nunc coniugis esto</quote> &amp;c.: in 10. 458 he would alter <emph>ausum</emph> into <emph>ausus</emph>. I have nothing
to add on these passages to what has been said in the commentary. But on 10. 362
foll. Madvig proposes an almost convincing emendation. The MSS. give
<quote><l>Arcadas, <seg lang="la">insuetos acies inferre</seg> pedestris,</l>
<l lang="la">Ut vidit Pallas Latio dare terga sequaci,</l>
<l lang="la">Aspera quis natura loci dimittere quando</l>
<l lang="la">Suasit equos.</l>
</quote></p>
<p><emph><seg lang="la">Quis quando</seg></emph> is difficult, if not impossible. Madvig would read <emph><seg lang="la">aspera aquis</seg>:</emph> the
ground being broken by a torrent.</p>
<p>In 10. 479 Madvig objects to <quote lang="la">strinxit de corpore Turni</quote> (hasta), and would read
<quote lang="la">tinxit se corpore.</quote> But Persius 2. 65 says <quote><emph>stringere</emph> <seg lang="la">venas Ferventis massae crudo</seg>
<emph>de</emph> pulvere.</quote></p>
<p>I pass over several less important alterations and come to 11. 495 foll., <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s
translation of the simile of the horse in Il. 6. 508,
<quote lang="la"><l>Aut ille in pastus armentaque tendit equarum,
Aut adsuetus aquae perfundi flumine noto
Emicat.</l>
</quote></p>
<p><quote lang="la">Perversum hoc,</quote> says Madvig, <quote lang="la">prorsusque vitiosum. Nam <emph>adsuetus aquae</emph> accipi
vetat <emph>perfundi</emph> infinitivus, <emph>adsuetus aquae perfundi</emph> nihil est: iungenda igitur haec
sunt: <emph>adsuetus perfundi flumine noto aquae:</emph> atqui (ut taceam de <emph>flumine aquae</emph>)
<emph>flumine noto</emph> avelli ab <emph>emicat</emph> nequit, quod nec hoc absolute dictum sensum habet et
quod equus, lavari solitus, consuetudine flumen notum petit ex eoque deinde emicat.
Scribendum est igitur necessario <q direct="unspecified">Aut adsuetus <emph>aqua</emph> perfundi, flumine noto Emicat.</q></quote>
First, I would remark that <emph><seg lang="la">flumine aquae</seg></emph> is quite unobjectionable, for Lucretius 2.
664 foll. speaks of <quote lang="la">equorum duellica proles . . . Uno eodemque sitim sedantes <emph>flumine
aquai:</emph></quote> secondly, that before altering anything in this passage it is necessary to attend
to the passage in <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName> which <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> is translating. Now the line <quote lang="la">adsuetus aquae
perfundi flumine noto</quote> is a translation of <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName>'s <foreign lang="greek">ei)wqw\s lou/esqai e)u+rrei=os potamoi=o</foreign>,
and should therefore not be broken up: <quote lang="la">emicat, arrectisque fremit cervicibus</quote> &amp;c.
corresponds to <foreign lang="greek">kudio/wn, u(you= de\ ka/rh e)/xei</foreign>, though the sense and rhythm of <foreign lang="greek">kudio/wn</foreign> are
given by <emph>luxurians</emph> in the next line. <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> has spoilt the simplicity of the <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName>ic
passage by introducing <emph><seg lang="la">aut&mdash;aut</seg>:</emph> but the whole structure of the piece seems to show
that <emph>emicat</emph> is not to be taken with <emph>flumine</emph>, but refers to the original escape of the
horse.
<cit><bibl>12. 731 foll.</bibl>
<quote><l>At <seg lang="la">perfidus ensis</seg></l>
<l lang="la">Frangitur, in medioque ardentem deserit ictu,</l>
<l lang="la">Ni fuga subsidio subeat.</l>
</quote></cit></p>
<p>Madvig would punctuate <quote lang="la">deserit ictu. Ni fuga subsidio, subeat:</quote> i. e. <quote>he would
himself have to undergo the blow, unless flight came to his aid.</quote> But the clause,
pointed as usual, may, it seems to me, fairly stand. There is no condition implied in
<emph>deserit:</emph> the sword is broken and actually deserts him: but flight comes to his aid.

<l lang="la">Permixtos heroas, et ipse videbitur illis,</l>
<l lang="la">Pacatumque reget patriis virtutibus orbem.</l></quote>
<p>The prophecy is of a king reigning in righteousness, like Saturn according to the
myth current in Italy, or Numa; and the commentators refer the words <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">deum
vitam accipiet</q> to the return of the golden age, when men according to Hesiod (<foreign lang="greek">*)/erga</foreign>
v. 112 foll.) <foreign lang="greek">w(/ste qeoi\ e)/zwon a)khde/a qumo\n e)/xontes, *no/sfin a)/ter te po/nwn</foreign>. The words
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">divisque videbit</q> &amp;c. are in like manner referred to that familiar intercourse between
gods and men, supposed by the Roman poets (not, be it observed, by <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName><note anchored="yes" n="1">. In Od. 7. 201, <foreign lang="greek">ai)ei\ ga\r to\ pa/ros ge
qeoi\ fai/nontai e)nargei=s k.t.l</foreign>., Alcinous is
evidently speaking of a special familiarity
between the gods and the Phaeacians.</note> or Hesiod)
to be a characteristic of the golden age. Now, though <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s words will bear this
plain and obvious meaning, no one has observed, so far as I know, that the poet has
not expressed it in at all an ordinary manner. <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Deum vitam <emph>accipere</emph></q> does not seem
the most obvious way in which <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> might have reproduced <foreign lang="greek">w(/ste qeoi\ zh=n</foreign>: and as,
elsewhere, he uses the simple expression <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">fruitur deorum colloquio</q> for intercourse
with the gods, it seems strange that he should have used here, to express the same
notion, the less obvious phrase <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">divisque videbit Permixtos heroas</q> &amp;c. This criticism
may appear far-fetched, but it should be remembered that <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> chose his words with
extraordinary care, often repeating himself with little or no variation when the language
appeared to him to be a perfect expression of his thought, and hardly ever, in important
matters, using language which had not, to his mind, if not some cherished association,
at least some more or less exquisite justification. I suspect that in this passage, though
its first and most obvious reference is to a renewal of the golden age, <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> is using
language tinged by association with the mysteries, Eleusinian or other. <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Vitam
<emph>accipere</emph>,</q> <q direct="unspecified">to receive or take to one's self a life,</q> is a phrase requiring comment: now
<quote lang="la">accipere sacra</quote> was the regular phrase for being <quote>initiated into mysteries:</quote> see
Lampridius, Heliogabalus 7, <quote lang="la">Matris etiam deorum <emph>sacra accepit</emph>,</quote> and other passages
in Hildebrand's note on Arnobius 5. 19. Then as to <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">deum vita,</q> this expression
might also have been caught from the mysteries: for Plato, Phaedo p. 81, says of the
soul, <foreign lang="greek">w(/sper de\ le/getai kata\ tw=n memuhme/nwn, w(s a)lhqw=s to\n loipo\n xro/non meta\ tw=n
qew=n dia/gousa</foreign>: comp. ib. p. 69, <foreign lang="greek">o( de\ kekaqarme/nos te kai\ tetelesme/nos e)kei=se a)fiko/menos
meta\ qew=n oi)kh/sei</foreign>: passages which seem to show that the idea of a participation in a
divine life was popularly associated with the mysteries<note anchored="yes" n="2">This idea is further illustrated by Plato,
Phaedrus p. 250, <foreign lang="greek">o(/te su\n eu)dai/moni xorw=|

me\n *dio\s h(mei=s, a)/lloi de\ met' a)/llwn qew=n,

(ap. Lobeck, Aglaophamus p. 89) speaks of <foreign lang="greek">to\
qeofile\s kai\ qeoi=s sundi/aiton</foreign> as the privilege
of persons initiated into the Eleusinia.</note>. The words <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">divisque videbit</q>
&amp;c. carry out the idea thus started: one of the chief points in the Eleusinia being that
statues of gods and heroes were exhibited to the gaze of the initiated (see Themistius
quoted by Lobeck, Aglaophamus p. 52). I do not of course suppose <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> literally to
<pb n="502"/>
mean that his king will be a <foreign lang="greek">memuhme/nos</foreign>, but that his language was originally suggested
by the circumstances of the mysteries, and thus that the words <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">deum vitam accipiet</q>
might fairly be translated, <q direct="unspecified">shall be initiated into,</q> or <q direct="unspecified">partake in,</q> <q direct="unspecified">the life of the gods.</q></p>

<head>GEORGIC 4. 290 foll.</head>
<p>This difficult passage, in which <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> seems to have confused his geography beyond
ordinary poetical licence or conventionality in making the Nile flow from India (<quote lang="la">usque
coloratis amnis devexus ab Indis</quote>), may perhaps be illustrated by an indication of the
popular conceptions of geography among the ancients afforded by Arrian (6. 1),
according to whom Alexander, on first seeing the crocodiles in the Indus, concluded
that he had discovered the upper course of the Nile. It is true that Alexander was
speedily convinced of his error: still, the error could hardly have been possible, had
not considerable confusion existed at the time in the popular imagination as to the
limits and extent of Asia and Africa: and whether the popular imagination on those
matters was more enlightened in the time of Augustus than in that of Alexander may
be doubtful. To take <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Indis</q> of the Aethiopians, as Forbiger in his fourth edition still
does, would not be necessary if this hypothesis be correct.</p>

<p>Among the oldest testimonies that <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Arma virumque</lemma> is the real beginning of the
Aeneid is an inscription (Corpus Inscr. Lat. vol. 2, No. 4967. 31) attributed by H&uuml;bner to
the first century A.D., in which the words <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Arma virumque . . . . Litora</q> are quoted. The
inscription, it should be remarked, reads <q direct="unspecified">Lavinaque.</q> The words <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Arma virumque
cano</q> are also found scribbled on the walls of Pompeii (Zangemeister, C. I. L. vol. 5).
It may also be observed (as I do not think that any commentator has remarked it), that
although several expressions in the opening of the Aeneid recall the opening of the
Odyssey, the rhythm and general structure of the first seven lines of the Aeneid (beginning
with <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Arma virumque</q>) are taken from that of the first seven lines of the Iliad,
and that the first two and the last lines of the seven in each case are precisely similar
in point of metre.

from the description of Hades (modelled in every line upon <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>) in the <emph><seg lang="la">Hercules

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Infantumque animae flentes in limine primo</lemma> is explained in the notes as a reference
to the Roman habit of burying new-born infants <quote>in suggrundis,</quote> under the eaves of
the house. It may perhaps be worth noticing that the ghost in Plautus' <emph>Mostellaria</emph>
(<bibl n="Pl. Mos. 2.2">2. 2. 67</bibl>) is made to say <quote lang="la">Nam me Acheruntem recipere Orcus noluit, <emph>Quia praemature
vita careo</emph>.</quote> The infants in <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> are indeed allowed to cross the Styx, but
they do not get further than the threshold of Orcus. Both the passage in Plautus and
that in <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> seem to be based on a notion that a full term of life ended by a natural
or honourable or happy death was a necessary condition for a complete admission into
the under-world. Comp. <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s language about <persName>Dido</persName> at the end of the fourth book:
<quote lang="la">Nam quia nec fato, merita nec morte peribat, Nondum illi flavum Proserpina vertice
crinem Abstulerat</quote> &amp;c. Tertullian de Anima 56 says, <quote lang="la">Aiunt et immatura morte
praeventas eo usque vagari istic, donec reliquatio compleatur aetatum, quas tum pervixissent,
si non intempestive obiissent.</quote> That <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> was influenced by this notion
seems clear from the fact that he places the unjustly-condemned, the suicides, and the
victims of unrequited love next to the infants in the under-world.</p>

<p>This, the MS. order of the lines, seems, in spite of the difficulties presented by the
obviously unfinished state of the whole passage, to be more natural than the transposed
order adopted by Ribbeck. <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> has enumerated the various punishments of the
guilty souls: he then naturally adds that they suffer <quote><emph><seg lang="la">quisque suos</seg></emph> Manis.</quote> Each
suffers a punishment appropriate, we must suppose, to his crime. But why should
<persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> write <quote lang="la">Manis</quote> when <quote lang="la">poenas</quote> would equally have suited his metre? <emph>Manes</emph>
seems (if I may venture to offer a fresh suggestion on so well-worn a difficulty) to mean
the spiritual representative of the man once living: the same personality living on in the
under-world. Each soul, then, says <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>, suffers its own personality or its own spiritual
being. But this can only have a meaning if there be something in the spiritual being
to cause suffering: and the cause of suffering can be nothing but the defilements
contracted by each soul in the former life. The words should therefore mean <quote>we each
suffer the defilements of our spiritual being:</quote> these follow us into the under-world and
there take vengeance upon us. Now Seneca in his <seg lang="la">Hercules Furens</seg> (v. 735) describing
the punishments of guilty souls in the under-world, says (in a context full of reminiscences
of <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>),
<quote lang="la"><l>Quod quisque fecit, patitur: auctorem scelus</l>
<l lang="la">Repetit, suoque premitur exemplo nocens.</l>
</quote></p>
<p>Is it possible that Seneca was putting in his clear and logical way what <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>
expresses vaguely and poetically? If so, <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> may perhaps be supposed to have dimly
adumbrated the theory which Seneca follows, that each soul is punished <emph>in kind:</emph> <quote>we
each suffer, i. e. suffer for, the stains which we bring with us: our crimes pursue us in
the form of their punishment.</quote> Thus understood, the words <quote lang="la">quisque suos patimur
Manis</quote> would be a real continuation of the preceding lines.</p>
