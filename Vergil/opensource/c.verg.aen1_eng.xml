<div1 type="Introduction" n="intro">
<head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
<p>IN turning from the Eclogues and Georgics to the Aeneid, we are no
longer confronted by the opinion which insists on Virgil's claims as a
strictly original poet. The days are past when Scaliger could compare
Virgil and <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName> in detail, and pronounce that the scholar had in
almost every instance excelled his master; nor would a modern reader
easily tolerate even those less invidious parallels, such as were not infrequent
in the last century, where <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> was measured against <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName>
on the same principles on which Johnson has measured Pope against
Dryden, and with substantially the same results. It is hard to read
without a smile the apologetic tone in which Pope himself vindicates
Homer against the admirers of <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>, pleading that the old Greek has
at all events the advantage of having written first; that if he had a less
cool judgment, he holds the heart under a stronger enchantment, and
that to endeavour to exalt <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> at his expense is much the same as if
one should think to raise the superstructure by undermining the foundation<note anchored="yes" n="1">Preface to Homer.</note>. It is now the turn of the critic of the Aeneid to use the language
of extenuation and speak with bated breath. On the one side it
is admitted, as it is asserted on the other, that in undertaking the
Aeneid at the command of a superior <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> was venturing beyond the
province of his genius, and that all we can expect to find is the incidental
success which could not fail to be obtained even on uncongenial
ground by the poet of the Georgics. I have elsewhere explained the
reasons which lead me to question the appropriateness of the special
praise usually given to <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s agricultural poetry, and conceded, though
with more hesitation, to his pastoral compositions, as if the true bent of
his mind were to be found in his sympathy with external nature, at the
same time that I have spoken as strongly as it was in my power to
speak of the marvellous grace and delicacy, the evidences of a culture
most elaborate and most refined, which shine out in the midst of a
thousand incongruities of costume and outward circumstance, and make
us forget that we are reading Bucolic poems of which line after line is to
be found in Theocritus, and precepts about husbandry which are far more
<pb n="4"/>
intelligibly stated in Theophrastus or in the Geoponica. It is precisely
this measure which I would wish now to extend to the Aeneid. So far
it may seem that I am substantially at one with the opinion which I
have mentioned as that which is now generally entertained on Virgil's
claims as an epic poet. It is possible however that the habit of sharply
contrasting the characteristics of the several works of <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> may have
led to an exaggeration on the one side, as I believe it has on the other,&mdash;
that the Aeneid may have been brought too exclusively to the standard
of the <title>Iliad</title> and <title>Odyssey</title>, and that <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> may have been blamed, as
Pope complains that <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName> has been blamed, for not doing what he
never intended.</p>
<p>There can be little doubt that too much has been made of <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s
supposed disqualification or disinclination for epic poetry. We have his
own confession in the Sixth Eclogue that his early ambition was to sing
of kings and battles: and though Phoebus may have whispered in his
ear that such themes were too high for one so young, so humble, and so
unknown, we are not obliged to conclude that the aspiration was then
and there finally abandoned, or that as he rose naturally from short
pastorals to a long didactic poem, he may not have cherished the hope
of rising by an equally natural ascent to a still longer epic. If Pope's
epic poem of Alcander was the dream of his boyhood, when he fancied
himself the greatest poet that ever lived, his epic poem on <persName>Brutus</persName> was
no less the vision of his later years, when he had come, as he thought,
to take a just measure of his powers. That Augustus may have exercised
some pressure on <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>, urging him to undertake heroic poetry,
is very possible; but <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s words in the Third Georgic, and the similar
language held by other poets, such as <persName>Horace</persName> and <persName>Propertius</persName>, would
lead us to agree with a recent German editor<note anchored="yes" n="2">Gossrau, Praef. ad Aeneidem.</note>, that what the emperor
wished for was a direct celebration of his own actions; nor is there anything,
even in the apocryphal notices of the pseudo-biographer, to compel
us to any other conclusion. It was only natural that Augustus should
take an interest, as we know him to have done, in the progress of a
poem which, in grandeur of scope and compass, promised to transcend
any previous effort of the Roman muse, and so could not but reflect indirect
glory on his reign. We may observe, however, that in the only
words of <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> on the subject which have come down to us<note anchored="yes" n="3">Macrobius, Sat. i. 24.</note> the poet
expresses himself with considerable reserve, and is by no means forward
to gratify the imperial curiosity. Nor need we to lay any stress on the
story which, supported as it is by the authority of the elder <persName><surname>Pliny</surname></persName><note anchored="yes" n="4">Nat. Hist. vii. 30. Comp. Gell. xvii. 10.</note>, there
seems no reason to doubt, that <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> himself, when dying, condemned
his Aeneid to the flames. Rightly understood, that story seems to contain,
<pb n="5"/>
not a confession that he had mistaken his powers, but simply one
more instance of the fastidious and exacting nature of his self-criticism.
The words of the pseudo-biographer, who in this case at least is telling
a plausible tale, inform us distinctly that it was the uncorrected and
unfinished state of the work which made <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> anxious that it should
not survive him, <quote lang="la">comburi iussit ut rem inemendatam imperfectamque<note anchored="yes" n="5">Donatus, Life of <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>, &sect; 14. 52.</note>.</quote>
The explanation is consonant to all that we know of <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s character,
as shown in his writings; and it can only be a private opinion which we
may ourselves entertain about the merit of the poem that would lead us
to seek for any other. The biographer tells us, and here again his story
is credible enough, that <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> was overtaken by death at the time when
he was intending to spend three years in polishing and elaborating the
Aeneid: and we may imagine for ourselves what would be the value of
three years of correction in the judgment of a poet like <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>, and how
abortive he might consider the work which had lost the advantage of so
long a gestation. We cannot, indeed, tell, except in a very few
obvious cases, such as the hemistichs, and perhaps also certain inconsistencies
in the narrative, of which I have spoken elsewhere<note anchored="yes" n="6">See Introductions to Books 3 and 5.</note>, what
may have been the actual shortcomings of the poem as they appeared
to its author. He may have introduced verses, as the story says he
did, which were intended as mere temporary make-shifts<note anchored="yes" n="7">Donatus, Life of <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>, &sect; 9. 35.</note>, props to
stay the building until more solid supports should be forthcoming; but
modern criticism has not in general been very happy in pointing out
these weak places, and for the present we must be content to admit
that, as regards the execution of the poem, at any rate, our conceptions
of what is required fall infinitely short of <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s own; and that
though we may hope, in some measure, to appreciate what he has done,
we can form no notion of what he left yet to do. Such an admission
of ignorance is no more than the tribute which we pay, naturally and
cheerfully, to a consummate artist. In any case, we need not doubt
that the feeling which made <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> wish to rob the world of his
greatest poem was simply the mortification of leaving in a state of
comparative imperfection a work which he had intended to be his
masterpiece. To imagine that he was sensible of the unreality which,
to a certain extent, characterizes the Aeneid, as compared with the
Homeric poems, is to imagine an anachronism and an impossibility, to
attribute to him a thought which is inconsistent with the whole tenor of
his writings, and must have been alien to the entire current of sentiment
among his contemporaries, whether admiring or adverse. He
seems never to have tormented himself with doubts that he had not
realized the rustic vigour of Theocritus, or the primitive simplicity of
<pb n="6"/>
Hesiod. He appropriates their form boldly and openly, and does not
ask himself whether he has reproduced their spirit. To be the Roman
<persName>Homer</persName>; to write the sequel of the tale of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, not as an inferior, but
as an equal, not as a younger son of the victorious race, but as the heir
of those many ages which had lifted the conquered people to a height
far above their conquerors; to combine the glories of the heroic age
with the august antiquities of his own nation; this was an ideal which
might well captivate a mind like <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s, and which less partial voices
than those of an applauding court might have told him that he was able
to attain.</p>
<p>The chasm which separates the Aeneid from the <title>Iliad</title> and <title>Odyssey</title> is
undoubtedly one which is not easily spanned. It is true that sufficient
account has not always been taken of the numerous intervening objects
which break the distance and afford resting-places to the eye. The substance
of the Homeric poetry, the conduct of the action and the conception
of the actors, came to <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> modified by the intermediate agency
of the Greek drama. His view of the form may have been similarly
affected by the example of those later Greek epics of which the poem of
Apollonius is the only surviving specimen, and by the precepts of that
critical fraternity of which the author of the Argonautics was no undistinguished
member. But the unsurpassed eminence of the two writers,
the bard or bards of pre-historic Greek and the poet of Augustan <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>,
will always make them prominent objects of comparison or contrast;
and the parallel is itself one which <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>, far from avoiding, has done
his utmost to challenge. To a modern reader the exactness of the
parallel only serves to make the contrast deeper and more unmistakeable.
Mr. Gladstone says nothing which a critic, not sworn, like himself,
absolutely to the service of Homer, need hesitate to admit, when he
calls attention to the extraordinary amount of admitted imitation and
obvious similarity on the surface of the Aeneid, and pronounces nevertheless
that the poem stands in almost every fundamental particular in
the strongest contrast to the <title>Iliad</title><note anchored="yes" n="8">Studies on <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName>, vol. iii. p. 502. I may here express my obligations generally
to this part of Mr. Gladstone's work, which has in fact suggested much of the present
Essay, though I have mostly found myself unable to agree with his views.</note>. Both features, the identity and
the diversity, are, as I have just said, sufficiently familiar to us; we
have seen them in <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s treatment of Theocritus and Hesiod, and we
shall not be surprised to meet them again in his treatment of Homer.
On the identity, indeed, there is but little for me to say which has not
been anticipated in what I have advanced in my Introduction to the
Eclogues. The diversity is a more complex question, and may well
occupy us somewhat longer.</p>
<p>The production of the Aeneid was part of that general burst of
<pb n="7"/>
literary enthusiasm which distinguished the Augustan period. Roman
literature had always been imitative; Pacuvius and Attius had set
themselves to make the best they could out of Sophocles and Aeschylus<note anchored="yes" n="9">Hor. 2 Ep. 1. 161 foll.</note>; and it was doubtless in his own judgment, as well as in that
of eulogistic critics, that Ennius appeared to be wise and brave, and a
second Homer<note anchored="yes" n="1">Hor. 2 Ep. 1. 50 foll. The <q direct="unspecified">somnia Pythagorea</q> are evidence enough of what he
thought of his relation to <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName>.</note>. But the period which witnessed the establishment of
the empire generated new hopes and aspirations among the poets of
<placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. The fervour of an age, half revolutionary, half organic in its
character, had produced intellectual activities which the imperial system
was not slow to welcome and cherish. The writers of the new era saw
that <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> had as yet yielded but few of her spoils to her semibarbarous
invaders; and they planned fresh expeditions, which should
be undertaken under more exalted auspices, and return crowned with
greener and more luxuriant laurels. The ebullition of anticipated
triumph which opens the Third Georgic doubtless represents the real
feeling of the poet, though the vision which he there professes to see
does not correspond in its details with that which his better genius
afterwards revealed to him. <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> was to be conquered, and conquered
with her own weapons. The games were to be the veritable Olympic
games, transplanted to the banks of the <placeName key="tgn,1127180">Mincio</placeName>, those games of which
the race and the caestus are the type; and the ceremonial of the day is
to be varied with the accessories of a Roman triumph. It was in this
spirit that he addressed himself to the task of reproducing Homer. The
imitation of externals was a thing not to be avoided or dexterously concealed,
but to be openly and boldly embraced; and it was the hitherto
unapproached excellence of the model which was held to constitute the
glory of the success. Even in his own day there appear to have been
critics, probably rival versifiers, who reproached him with having taken
so much from Homer; and the answer which he is said to have made
shows the light in which he wished his own labours to be regarded<note anchored="yes" n="2">Donatus, &sect; 16. 64, who gives the authority of Asconius Pedianus. He adds, however,
something about <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> resolving to yield to the pertinacity of his critics; but
the precise meaning is not clear, as the words seem to be corrupt.</note>.
<quote>Let them try to steal for themselves as they say I have stolen for
myself, and they will find that it is easier to rob Hercules of his club than
to rob <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName> of a single verse.</quote> It was an act of high-handed brigandage,
which, rightly appreciated, carried with it its own justification. In the
long hours of laborious days, paring down and refining the verses which
had been poured out in the exuberance of the morning<note anchored="yes" n="3">Gellius 17. 10, Donatus, &sect; 9. 33. Quinctilian, Inst. 10. 3, cites Varus for the
statement that the number of verses composed by <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> daily was very small.</note>, he had grappled
<pb n="8"/>
with the Grecian Hercules, and had again and again wrested from
him that weapon which had so long been the terror of meaner freebooters<note anchored="yes" n="4">That this view of the character of Virgil's imitations was taken by the ancients
themselves is shown by a passage in the Third <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Suasoria</q> of the elder <persName><surname>Seneca</surname></persName> (quoted
by Heyne, Dissertatio de Carmine Epico Vergiliano), who says, speaking of a supposed
appropriation of <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s words by <persName><surname>Ovid</surname></persName>, <quote lang="la">fecisse quod in multis aliis versibus Vergilius
fecerat, non surripiendi causa sed palam imitandi, hoc animo ut vellet adgnosci.</quote></note>. I have elsewhere remarked on <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s absolute silence about
Homer, who, throughout the Aeneid, is never named or even indicated;
but no one would interpret it as the silence of a writer anxious to ignore
or conceal his obligations. Even were epic narrative as favourable to
the introduction of personal notices as pastoral dialogue or didactic disquisition,
it would have been superfluous to mention <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName> in a poem
which invites comparison with the <title>Iliad</title> and <title>Odyssey</title> in its whole
external form, and even in its very title, and contains an imitation or
translation from <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName> in almost every page.</p>
<p>This avowed rivalry, I venture to think, should be borne in mind in
estimating, not only the similarity of the Homeric and Virgilian epics,
but their discrepancies. When we require that <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>, drawing as he
does his characters from the circle of Homeric legend, should exhibit
them as they are exhibited in <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName>, we are not only forgetting, what
<persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> could scarcely have forgotten if he would, the changes which
those characters underwent as they passed under the hands of Attic and
Alexandrian schools of poetry, but we are mistaking the whole attitude
assumed by <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> with reference to his illustrious predecessor. Homer,
in his eyes, is not the father alike of history and of poetry, the sole
anthority for all our knowledge about the Greeks and the Trojans,
their ethnology, their polity, their moral relations to each other; he is
the rival poet of a rival nation, the party chronicler of a quarrel which
the Trojans had bequeathed to their successors, and those successors,
after many centuries, had pushed to a victorious issue. Was it likely
that a Trojan would have accepted the Homeric estimate of his nation
and his nation's cruel enemies? and was it to be expected that the heir
of the Trojans should dwarf his representation of Trojan worth and
Trojan valour to a Homeric standard? The lions had at last come to be
the painters; and though they could not represent their progenitor as
victorious over the man in that great legendary struggle, they could
portray it as a contest of fraud and cruelty with heroic endurance
and genuine bravery; they could poise the event more doubtfully in the
balance, and call down indignation on the crimes that stained the hour
of triumph; they could point to the retribution which fell, even within
the period of the legend, on the homes of those who had made others
homeless, and shadow forth in prophetic vision the yet more terrible
<pb n="9"/>
recompense which history was to bring in the fulness of time. Aeneas
is drawn by <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName> at a time when, from the nature of the case, he
could only play a secondary part in the action; yet <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName> admits his
reputation among his countrymen, and grudgingly concedes his real
prowess, while he makes the Trojan hero's future the special concern of
destiny, provided for even by those gods who are the fiercest enemies of
<placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>. <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> takes up his story when he is left alone as the one surviving
protector of his country, the forlorn hope of those who sought to
resist, during the sack of the city, the recognized leader of the Trojan
migration. Worsted as he had been by Achilles, and even by Diomed,
it was no less true that he had been a terror to the Lords of the Danaans
and the armies of Agamemnon; nor was there any reason why he and
his Trojans should not prove too strong for the Italian nations, though
they had proved too weak for the forces of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>. Even in <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName> it
is easy to see that the character of <persName><surname>Ulysses</surname></persName> has more sides than one: he
is the prince of policy, because with him every species of fraud is lawful;
and it is natural that his stratagems should be differently estimated by
those in whose favour they are exercised and those to whom they
brought havoc, exile, and death. <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>, it is true, represents his
<persName><surname>Ulysses</surname></persName> as engaging in crimes from which the Homeric Ulysses would
probably have shrunk; but we must not judge a poet as we should judge
a historian who were to invent actions in order to support a preconceived
theory of character. If the right of independent treatment be conceded,
it must be allowed to extend, not only to the interpretation of character,
but to the invention of incident. Regarding <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName> as a party chronicler,
<persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> was not bound to assume that he has recorded all the actions
of his hero, any more than that he has given a true colour to those
actions which he has recorded. And so the poet of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, having taken
such a measure as it was in the nature of a Trojan to take of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>'s
subtlest enemy, might fairly avail himself of any post-Homeric tradition
which might serve the cause that he had to advocate, or even create for
himself new traditions, so long as they were plausible and consistent.
<quote lang="la">Aut famam sequere, aut sibi convenientia finge.</quote> To be plausible
and consistent are a poet's sole historical duties; and in this instance
plausibility and consistency are to be estimated, not according to the
view which sets up <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName> as the one record of historical truth, but
according to that which regards his poems as pieces of advocacy,
the answers to which have been lost. The image is indeed something
more than a mere metaphor. We know that in the Greek
schools of rhetoric attempts were frequently made to overturn the
verdict, not only of history, but of fable; and we may recall with a
smile the fact that it was not merely sophistical acumen, but real
sympathy with a friendly nation, which led Greek orators to rehabilitate
<pb n="10"/>
Busiris, and purge <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> from the stain of a legendary participation in
the guilt of human sacrifices. <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> has obtained leave to reargue the
case of his countrymen; and all that is required of him is that his facts
and inferences should be such as would have been credible to a Trojan
warrior. Bearing this in mind, we may remember that if Aeneas calls
<persName>Ulysses</persName> <quote>fell,</quote> <quote>relentless,</quote> and <quote>the inventor of crime,</quote> it is when he
is speaking of the sack of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, or of the carrying off of the statue
which made <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> impregnable. If Sinon represents him as a treacherous,
artful glozer, it is when he is describing plots laid against his
friend's life and his own. If Deiphobus knows him only as the counsellor
of deeds of wrong, we may pardon the one-sided judgment of a
person who has been hewn by him as a carcase fit for hounds, and
continues mangled even in his ghostly body. Such men were not
likely to sympathize with the admiration expressed by the Homeric
Antenor, as, on the day that was to bring the war to a peaceful close,
he recalled the impression made on him by his illustrious guest in bygone
years, before the war began. Nor is it less perfectly in keeping
that the Rutulians should disparage the wiles of <persName>Ulysses</persName> in comparison
of their own more daring exploits, at the same time that it leads us
to admire the art of the poet, who has thus condemned the most
formidable enemies of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> out of the mouth of other enemies, who were
destined to prove less formidable. As little could it be expected that
the <persName>Aeneas</persName> of <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> should appreciate the lights and shades distributed
over the character of the Homeric Helen. How he regarded her during
the siege we are not told; he may have shared the mixed feeling of
admiration and disapproval which the old men on the wall express in
their hour of respite; he may have partaken of the sense of repulsion
with which, as she tells us in her wail over <persName>Hector</persName>, she was looked upon
by all in <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>; but as his eye fell upon her at the moment of the sack
of the royal palace, and the savage slaughter of the good old king,
thoughts of hatred and vengeance could hardly fail to be uppermost in
his mind; and he may well have needed a supernatural interposition to
teach him to distinguish between the authors of so terrible a ruin and
its wretched instrument. Let us once fix in our minds that <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName> is
the poet of the Greeks, and that his action is laid during the siege, that
<persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> is the poet of the Trojans, and that his action is laid after the
burning of the city, and we shall not, I think, be disposed to charge
<persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> with mere wanton depravation of the Homeric characters.</p>
<p>The same notion of independent rivalry will explain <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s neglect
of Homeric traditions in other matters where patriotic feeling or dramatic
propriety was not concerned. <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> doubtless held himself bound
to follow <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName>'s narrative only so far as that narrative had taken hold
of the popular mind of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. He was not the interpreter of an ancient
<pb n="11"/>
record, bound to minute and painstaking accuracy; he was the reviver
of an old story, which in its broad features was familiar to all lovers of
poetry. The relative position of the various members of the royal family
of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, the distinctions of races among the hosts that respectively made
up the Greek and Trojan armies, the extent of the names <placeName key="perseus,Pergamon">Pergamus</placeName>,
<placeName key="perseus,Troy">Ilion</placeName>, and Dardania, the comparative importance of the Scamander and
the Simois, the geographical details of countries which few Romans had
ever visited,&mdash;these were not points that interested the Roman readers
of the Iliad and Odyssey, nor were they likely to be scrutinized by
Roman readers of the Aeneid. The very care which <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> has taken to
construct his own catalogue of the Italian forces, might naturally be
thought to absolve him from the duty of minutely studying catalogues
with which even an educated Roman felt he had no concern. The indifference
of the Romans to the history of other countries is a known
feature in their character<note anchored="yes" n="5">See Bunsen, <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, vol. i. pp. 152 foll. (Cottrell's translation.)</note>; curious about the antiquities of their own
nation, they had but little of that historical spirit which impels a student
to investigate records entirely unconnected with himself; and Virgil
was a type of his countrymen, alike in his learning and in his carelessness
or ignorance. Besides, the body of knowledge already existing at
<placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and the habits of ordinary speech, would have been a serious
impediment to Virgil, even if he had wished to follow <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName> faithfully.
As he was obliged to talk of <persName>Jupiter</persName>, <persName>Juno</persName>, and <persName>Mars</persName>, to a nation which
had agreed to identify the Greek gods with those whom they were themselves
worshipping daily, so he could hardly have avoided calling the
Greeks by that generic name by which the Romans knew them, though
it had no existence in Homer's time, and had never really belonged to
more than an infinitesimally small part of the Greek people. If we,
with our appreciation of historical criticism, find it impossible not to
talk of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> and the Greeks, what would it have been to a Roman, to
whom the name was a contemporary fact, and who spoke of <q direct="unspecified">Graecia</q>
and <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Graeci</q> as we speak of <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> and Germans? With this
cardinal offence against history and ethnology staring him in the face,
Virgil would have found it in vain to affect or aim at accuracy. Accordingly,
he appeals indifferently to all the associations of his readers,
whether vague or exact. Here he takes advantage of an obscure tradition;
there, of a loose popular identification. He talks of Dorians
at a time when the Dorians were scarcely known, and confers on the
Trojans the name of their Phrygian neighbours. He generalizes from
a part to the whole, and then comes down from the whole to some other
part; just as where, in describing the Trojan horse, he first speaks of it
as pine-wood, then as maple, and lastly as oak; not, I think, from confusion
or forgetfulness, but as an assertion of the poet's privilege to
<pb n="12"/>
represent, in as many ways as he pleased, the general notion of wood.
In short, he is an artist, an Italian antiquary, a Roman of the Augustan
period, speaking to the average educated intelligence of his own day;
he is anything rather than what modern admirers of <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName> would wish
him to be, a hierophant of <quote>the inner Homeric world,</quote> an expounder of
<quote>primitive history, philosophy, policy, and religion<note anchored="yes" n="6">Gladstone, vol. i. pp. 11, 12.</note>,</quote> as contained in
Homer.</p>
<p>Such a course of independent rivalry, however, could hardly be pursued
without provoking the consequent Nemesis. A story of the heroic
time of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, treated in an essentially modern and Roman spirit, was
sure to leave a sense of incongruity on the mind, not only of a Homeric
student, but of a more popular reader. A reader of this sort might be
utterly unconscious of a thousand inaccuracies of costume; he might
feel the loss of primitive simplicity of manner to be compensated by the
greater stateliness of the modern heroic; but he could scarcely fail to
be struck with an essential want of consistency in the drawing of the
principal figures, which, being Homeric, must necessarily be old, and
being Virgilian, must as necessarily be new. It is this, I think, which
constitutes the secret of the dissatisfaction which is generally felt with
the character of Aeneas. To represent him, as some modern critics
have done, as simply mean and feeble, unmanly and unheroic, is unjust,
and even absurd. His appearances in <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName> ought not to prejudice
our opinion about his appearances in <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>; nor perhaps would they,
were it not for an error in judgment committed by the poet himself,
who, in his spirit of dramatic fair dealing towards his hero's enemies,&mdash;
a spirit which will call for our notice again very shortly,&mdash;makes them
taunt him with his Homeric escapes and evasions of danger, allowing
them, at the same time, to confound what <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName> never would have
confounded, and identify a warlike Trojan with an effeminate Phrygian.
We are wearied, it must be confessed, by being continually reminded of
his piety; though that may be partly owing to our misapprehension of
the use of the epithet, which was doubtless intended to be a Homeric
one, attached to the name as a sort of prefix, and to be taken as a
matter of course; but his piety is not merely nominal; it shows itself in
his whole feeling and conduct to the gods, his father, and his son.
Heyne, who had a soul to admire and reverence both <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName> and <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>,
remarks on the dignity and beauty of <persName>Aeneas</persName>'s address to <persName>Evander</persName>.
His faithfulness to the memory of <persName>Pallas</persName> is all the more noble, as apparently
being not, like that of <persName>Achilles</persName> to his dead friend, grounded on
strong personal affection, but rather the offspring of generous selfreproach
for his own involuntary failure to discharge a sacred trust.
<pb n="13"/>
His long forbearance towards Lausus, and the revulsion of feeling when
he sees him dead, contrasts strangely with the <quote>genuine manliness</quote> with
which Turnus exults in the prospect of killing <persName>Pallas</persName>, and glories over
him when killed. But the greater the tenderness and grace of these
traits of character, the harsher the jar with which we find the hero of
the Aeneid exhibiting at other times the savage, indomitable spirit of
the hero of the <title>Iliad</title>. There is tenderness, deep tenderness, mingled
with the ferocity of Achilles; yet we are not surprised when, after receiving
Priam graciously, and losing his own sorrows in sympathy with
the poor old king, he is roused to momentary fury by a word spoken out
of season. But the temper of <persName>Aeneas</persName> is less impulsive, and his gentleness
more abiding and untroubled, so that our feelings are shocked
when we see him plunging his hands in blood as deeply as a Homeric
warrior, and reserving the sons of two families to be sacrificed alive on
the funeral pile of his friend. It is in keeping with the manners of the
heroic age; but it is not in keeping with the humanity with which the
poet's modern spirit has led him to invest the rest of the character. It
is this inconsistency between the heroic and the modern type which we
feel in Aeneas's treatment of <persName>Dido</persName>. Stripped of its accessories, the conduct
of Aeneas to <persName>Dido</persName> is not very unlike that of <persName>Ulysses</persName> to Calypso,
if not to Circe. He is thrown on her coast; he is treated hospitably;
he accepts the position of a husband; he leaves her that he may go to
his natural home. It can hardly be said that the deity of Calypso constitutes
an essential difference between her and <persName>Dido</persName>. If she is a goddess,
her words show that she feels the love and even the jealousy of a
woman; and the criticism<note anchored="yes" n="7">Gladstone, vol. iii. p. 525.</note> which contrasts <persName>Ulysses</persName>'s farewell to her
with the language of Aeneas to <persName>Dido</persName> might perhaps have been spared,
if it had been recollected that in <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName> she herself receives the order
from the gods to part with <persName>Ulysses</persName>, while in <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> the whole burden is
thrown upon Aeneas, who has not only to justify himself for going, but
to vouch for the supernatural compulsion under which he goes. But
for a hero to leave a mortal love was no novelty in the heroic age, as the
titles of Ovid's Heroic Epistles sufficiently show. The novelty is in the
interest which <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> has excited in the situation and feelings of his
forsaken heroine. He has struck the chord of modern passion, and
powerfully has it responded; more powerfully, perhaps, than the minstrel
himself expected. Had <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName> written of <persName>Dido</persName>, we should probably
have been called on to sympathize with her but little; our feelings
would have been with the hero whom she strove to keep from the home
whither he was bound. There were reasons which might have induced
<persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> to give a similar colour to his narrative. All his sympathies are
<pb n="14"/>
Roman; and the breach between <persName>Dido</persName> and <persName>Aeneas</persName> is the symbol and
the prophecy of the quarrel of <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. It is hard, too, to
suppose that in sketching the Carthaginian queen, who endeavours to
keep Aeneas from his kingdom, he did not think again and again of the
Egyptian enchantress to whom Antony would have transferred the
sceptre of the western world, whose blandishments had prevailed over
the great Julius, and had been successfully resisted by Octavianus
alone. Circe might have supplied the legendary framework, <persName>Cleopatra</persName>
the animating historical spirit; and even though the Trojan Ulysses
had yielded to the allurements of the charmer, we might have hailed the
flash of his drawn sword, and sent our hearts along with him in his
journey from the enchanted shore. But <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> has not chosen to paint
a picture like this. Following in the track of Apollonius, he has lavished
all his art on the presentation of a vivid portrait of female passion.
<persName>Dido</persName>'s flame has been kindled, not from within, but from without, by a
supernatural power; the generosity of her nature has already shown
itself in the princely hospitality which she extends to Aeneas and his
shipwrecked comrades; but, after all, we sympathize with her simply as
a woman; it is the mere exhibition of the depths of a woman's heart
that stirs our own so powerfully. Other heroes have loved and left as
Aeneas does; few have had as strong a justification as he can plead for
his flight: but no one seems to us so traitorous as Aeneas, except it be
Jason; and the reason lies in the depth of colouring with which <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>,
like Euripides, has painted the agonies of the abandoned queen.</p>
<p>The relation of <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> to <persName>Homer</persName>, as I have said already, unquestionably
furnishes the most important point of view from which the Aeneid
can be regarded by one who wishes to estimate the surrounding circumstances
which told upon the genius of the Augustan poet. The expectation
of an unknown birth which should be greater than the <title>Iliad</title> was
doubtless the vision which illuminated the later years of <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s own
life, as we know it to have occupied the mind of his contemporaries.
But it was not simply by contemplating Homer, by studying him
intently and gradually appropriating his beauties, that <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> hoped to
rival him; he was to be encountered principally indeed with his own
weapons, but partly also with those supplied to the hands of a younger
competitor by long centuries of subsequent culture. The extent and
variety of these appliances are only imperfectly known to us. <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>
probably had access to the whole of what had been written by any
author of note from Homer's time to his own; in the remains that have
come down to us whole classes of composition are entirely wanting, and
those which we have exist only in specimens more or less numerous.
The cyclic poets and the other epic writers of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> proper are mere
<pb n="15"/>
shadowy figures to us, but to <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> they had a real personal existence;
they may have modified the form of his poem; they must to a certain
extent have supplied the data from which he constructed his story. It
is not till we come to the Athenian drama that we are able to trace
definitely the operation of a really powerful agency upon <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s
genius. Even there our losses are neither few nor unimportant; we
know that a considerable number of the plays of the three great
tragedians embraced various parts of the tale of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, yet of these
we can only be said to possess the Ajax and the Philoctetes of
Sophocles, the Rhesus, the Troades, and the Hecuba of Euripides. Of
Sophocles especially we are told, that <quote>he so greatly delighted in the
epic cycle as to have borrowed whole dramas from its contents,</quote> and
there is reason to think that no less than three of his plays traversed
the ground occupied by <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> in the second Aeneid; but of the Laocoon
we have only a brief outline of the plot, and thirteen lines, six of them
significant; of the <foreign lang="greek">*coanhfo/roi</foreign>, a bare indication of the subject, so bare
that it is a question whether it really points to a separate play; of the
Sinon, three unimportant words. Great, however, as our losses are,
we need not doubt that our gains are greater. That which constitutes
the main value of Greek tragedy as a step in intellectual progress can
be abundantly appreciated from the specimens that have come down to
us, and we are able distinctly to recognize its influence upon <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>. I
have in some measure anticipated what I am going to say, in the
observations which I have ventured on <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s treatment of character,
as compared with Homer's: but the point is one which will well bear to
be explained and enforced further.</p>
<p>Mr. Grote has shown his characteristic insight in remarking<note anchored="yes" n="8">Hist. of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, vol. viii. chap. 67.</note> that
<quote>the great innovation of the Athenian dramatists consisted in the
rhetorical, the dialectical, and the ethical spirit which they breathed
into their poetry.</quote> <quote>Of all this,</quote> he continues, <quote>the undeveloped germ
doubtless existed in the previous epic, lyric, and gnomic composition;
but the drama stood distinguished from all these by bringing it out into
conspicuous amplitude, and making it the substantive means of effect.</quote>
The structural exigencies of form must have combined with the intellectual
temper of the time in giving especial prominence to these kindred
features. A drama is shorter than an epic; it traverses not the whole of
a long history, but some special part of it; and the treatment of that
special part may evoke interests conflicting with those which would be
called out by the treatment of the whole. Had the plot of the
Agamemnon been merged in a longer narrative, we should not have been
led to pause on the character of Clytaemnestra, and examine as we now
<pb n="16"/>
do the ground of her actions. The institution of the trilogy, apparently
contrived as a means of taking the hearer through the various stages of
a lengthened story, was frequently made to be directly subservient to
this conflict of interests, the first and second plays complicating a knot
which it was the business of the third to unravel. No more striking
instance of this can have existed than that furnished to us by the chance
which has robbed us of the first and third plays of the Promethean
trilogy and preserved the second. The grounds of Zeus's vengeance are
not set before us as clearly as they doubtless were in the opening
drama, nor have we more than the faintest glimpses of the terms of
reconciliation which were ratified in the third; we simply see the Titan
in the first agony of his suffering, we feel his wrongs, we hear of his
good deeds, we witness a display of his prophetic power, and our sympathies
are wholly on his side. Accident has allowed us to hear but one
part of the summing up, and we mistake it, as modern writers of genius
have mistaken it, for a piece of powerful advocacy. As the Greek
drama advanced, its rhetorical and dialectical aspects became still more
apparent. The chorus, gradually divested of its musical glories, yet
compelled as a general rule to continue on the stage, becomes a mere
moderator between disputants, interposing a couplet of common-place
at the end of the animated orations in which the various parties advocate
their competing views.</p>
<p>It is needless to dwell on the profound intellectual effect which such
a species of composition was calculated to produce. Many modern
readers will have experienced the same stimulus in reading contemporary
works of fiction; they will vividly remember the time when they came
to be interested, not so much in unexpected incidents or a skilfully
constructed plot, as in the evolution of character, and the statement or
solution of some complex moral problem. Not without a considerable
sacrifice of beauty of form, the modern prose fiction combines the depth
of tragedy with the breadth of epic poetry, and a modern reader under
the spell of some powerful analyst of character and motive may interpret
to himself many of the feelings of an Athenian spectator at the Great
Dionysia. Perhaps it would have been impossible for a poet writing
after the opening of this new fountain of human interest to return to
the simpler portraiture of the elder epic: at any rate there can be little
doubt that <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> is strongly tinctured by the dramatic spirit, and that
he has sacrificed to it the general effect of his narrative. I do not say
that <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s conception of character is so consistent or so vivid as
Homer's; doubtless it is not: I only say that the dramatic feeling, the
drawing of character for character's sake, the delight in doing rhetorical
justice to the personages of the story, is more strongly shown in the
Aeneid than in the Homeric poems. One signal instance of this I have
<pb n="17"/>
already noted in the character of <persName>Dido</persName>; the character of Turnus affords
another not less remarkable.</p>
<p>It has been ingeniously suggested that the reason for the enthusiasm
with which <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> throws himself into the character of Turnus, is that
here at least he feels himself to be <quote>an Italian minstrel, singing to
Italians about an Italian hero<note anchored="yes" n="9">Gladstone, vol. iii. p. 512. Gossrau makes a similar remark on Aeneid 9. 155:
but it is obvious to reply that we are not expected to take Turnus and his friends
at their own valuation. One curious fact however he mentions, that Silius Italicus
uses <quote lang="la">Rutuli</quote> as one of his poetical synonymes for the Romans.</note>.</quote> National feeling did undoubtedly
work in <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>, but not, I think, national feeling of this kind. Like the
rest of his countrymen, he cared for <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> not independently of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>,
but as the broad base on which Roman power was built. His creed as
a patriot would be expressed by the words of Varro, <quote lang="la">Licet omnia
Italica pro Romanis habeam.</quote> The <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> of Dante's vision may talk
of <quote>that low <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> for which <persName>Camilla</persName> the virgin, Euryalus, and Turnus,
and Nisus died of wounds<note anchored="yes" n="1">Dante, Inferno i. 106 foll. (Carlyle's translation.)</note>;</quote> but with the poet himself the object of
the struggle is the establishment of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>; and those who resisted the
Trojan invaders were not Italian patriots, but men deaf to the voices of
the gods, and blind to the course of destiny. Here again the secret
seems to be, that <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> is impregnated with modern feeling, and that
Turnus occupies ground which, to modern feelings, appear unassailable.
As in the case of <persName>Dido</persName>, the fact that the gods are on the side of Aeneas
makes but little impression on us; we hear their dictates and their
warnings, but the note does not ring with the same awful clearness as
in the Homeric poems; our human feelings are roused, and our ears are
filled with other sounds. The words of the oracle are express, and we
feel that Amata's interpretation of them is a mere gloss; but it is good
enough for the purpose; it gives a verbal sanction to a course which
our hearts tell us to be the true one, and we are satisfied with it accordingly.
Aeneas is called the Phrygian freebooter, who comes to drive
peaceful inhabitants from their homes, and break the plighted engagements
of a royal house; and we sympathize with topics so well adapted
to conciliate modern readers. <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName> would not have allowed us to feel
so; he would have given no space to the pleadings of the natives for
their rights, but would have thrown his whole strength on the case of
the invaders, as being perfectly conformable to the code of the heroic
age. <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> must have sympathized with Aeneas, not only as realizing
the adopted type of heroic action, but as representing the undeviating
and relentless march of Roman greatness. But the modern spirit was
too strong for him; in describing Turnus as he conceived him to have
been, he was led, in fact, to advocate his cause, and to record a protest
<pb n="18"/>
against heroic and Roman aggression alike. It is the spirit of the
drama allowing itself free play; and the result is the enlargement of
human sympathy, the vindication of the weaker as well as of the
stronger. In many respects, as I have intimated, the character of
Turnus does not command our approval; there is fierceness in it, and
blind fury, and, in the case of <persName>Pallas</persName> at least, savage cruelty. But this
barbarity is the outgrowth of weakness; it is the impotent beating of a
captive against the iron bars of destiny; and as an exhibition of weakness
we sympathize even with it. So it is weakness, rendered hopeless
and helpless, that engages our interest in the closing scene. It is
modelled, no doubt, on the fall of <persName>Patroclus</persName>, who is paralyzed and
disarmed by <persName>Apollo</persName> before he is killed by <persName>Hector</persName>; but the incidents
which, as we read them in Homer, touch us as we are touched by a fairy
tale, are wrought up by <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> to a terrible moral significance. The
fates of the combatants have been balanced by <persName>Jupiter</persName>, and we know
that in a short time the only obstacle that keeps Aeneas from his
destined empire will be removed by Turnus's death. Yet that brief
space only serves to intensify our interest for the doomed man; our wishes
lend him wings as he is flying for his life, and calling by name on each
of his terrified comrades; and we echo the agonized prayer in which
he implores the gods of his native land to hold fast Aeneas's spear. The
strife of the Olympian deities is over; <persName>Juno</persName> herself has abandoned
Turnus, and is reconciled to the prospect of a Trojan empire without the
name of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>; but we refuse to look so far into the future. We follow
Turnus through the few remaining stages of helpless effort, dreamy
bewilderment, and final overthrow, feeling that till he is dead we can
spare no thoughts for the conqueror and the fruits of his victory. All
this, I repeat, is simply the tribute we pay to the profound human
interest with which <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s dramatic power leads him to invest a person
for whom no minstrel of the heroic age would have claimed a tear.
If <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> had been the poet of the Odyssey, it is possible that our
recollections of insolence, cruelty, and lawless sensuality would not
have wholly hindered us from feeling for the slaughter of the suitors.</p>
<p>The influence of the Greek drama is also to be observed in the
prominence given throughout the Aeneid to female characters. Mr.
Gladstone<note anchored="yes" n="2">Vol. iii. p. 527. He remarks later, p. 594, on the change produced in the Homeric
women when they appear as stage heroines.</note> has remarked with justice, that while Homer's women are
uniformly feminine and retiring, <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s are slightly masculine and
generally of a pronounced type; they are agitated by violent passions
and meet with violent ends. This is ascribed by an able critic in a
weekly journal<note anchored="yes" n="3">Saturday Review, Sept. 25, <date value="1858">1858</date>.</note> to <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s experience of his own age, when, for the first
<pb n="19"/>
time in Roman history, women came upon the stage of public life: it
is, I think, no less due to the influence of the actual stage of <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>.
Whether or no women were admitted as spectators of theatrical representations
at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, in the stories that were represented they had to
bear as conspicuous a part as men: the exigencies of dramatic art
required it; and perhaps the fact that their parts were not only written
but acted by men, tended still further to give them an equality which
Homer would never have dreamed of, and which Athenian life did not
sanction. They are not only merged in the aggregate of a sympathizing
but subordinate chorus, accompanying the action as it were with an
under-song; they occupy individually a large portion of the drama,
sometimes, like Io or Electra, as sufferers, sometimes, like Clytaemnestra
or Hecuba, as actors rising to masculine importance. <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>
may have had actual precedents, in history or fiction, for the characters
of <persName>Dido</persName>, Amata, Juturna, and <persName>Camilla</persName>; but even if he had not, his
recollections of Greek art must have been amply sufficient both to
suggest the thought and to guide the pencil.</p>
<p>Of <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s more palpable and measurable obligations to the writings
of the Greek tragedians there is less to be said. As I have already
intimated, several of the plays from which he is likely to have borrowed
are lost; and in the remainder the question is one rather of conjecture
and inference than of direct observation. There can be no doubt, however,
that the changes which the Homeric characters sustained in
passing through the hands of the dramatists, as well as in the wear and
tear of common tradition, had their full effect on <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s conception of
the personages who make up his gallery of the heroic age. The appearance
of Helen in the Troades of Euripides, where her more than
feminine logic is overpowered by the superior logic of Hecuba, intensified
by hatred, made it easier for <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> to represent her as he has
done in the second and sixth books of the Aeneid, though that representation,
as I have said previously, was forced upon him by the circumstances
of his story, and is sufficiently justified by them. So it was
natural that Aeneas should be antipathetic to <persName>Ulysses</persName>; but the grounds
of antipathy are strengthened by the later Greek representations of the
wily Greek, who is made, by a substitution characteristic of an Athenian
writer during the Peloponnesian war, to exchange his part of a popular
counsellor for that of a mere mob orator, and whose nobler qualities are
transferred to a rival character, Palamedes, of whom he is the enemy
and the treacherous murderer. Probably, also, there are situations
which <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> has conveyed from the Greek drama less directly and
openly. One such I seem to observe in the steps by which <persName>Dido</persName>
approaches the resolution of putting herself to death, talking freely and
wildly of the thought while it is only a thought, carefully concealing it
<pb n="20"/>
when it has passed into a purpose. This appears to me to have been
suggested by that celebrated change of feeling in the Ajax of Sophocles,
who in one scene breathes nothing but self-destruction, and in the next
is won to a calmness which the subtlety of modern critics will not allow
to be altogether feigned. Of such slight matters as the actual appropriation
of phrases and forms of expression, this is not the place to
speak. They are far from numerous, and will be found noticed, so far
as I have observed them, in the notes. But it is not less true that
<persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s debts for language and phraseology, to one at least of the
masters of Athenian tragedy, are real and great. That which is so
remarkable a feature of <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s style, his practice of employing combinations
of words so constructed as to remind the reader of other and
yet other combinations, could hardly be better illustrated than by a
comparison of the language of <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> with the language of Sophocles<note anchored="yes" n="4">The influence of the Greek drama on the Aeneid is briefly noticed by Heyne,
Dissertatio de Carmine Epico Vergiliano, p. 15 of vol. ii. of Wagner's edition of
Heyne's Virgil.</note>.</p>
<p>The Argonautics of Apollonius Rhodius would have their value for
the critic of the Aeneid, if only as the single representative which has
come down to us of the later epic poetry of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>. A poet like <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>,
studious to embody in himself all that was best in previous culture,
could not be wholly independent of writers whose conception of their
art was so far analogous to his own, that they strove to represent the
Homeric spirit under more modern forms: and the Alexandrian school
in particular must have had singular attractions for the chief poetical
artist of an era which itself displayed so many of the characteristics of a
period of renaissance. But the connexion between <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> and Apollonius
is closer than could have been presumed from any mere general considerations.
After the <title>Iliad</title> and Odyssey, the Argonautics is the only poem
which the intelligent criticism of antiquity declares to have furnished an
actual model to the author of the Aeneid, and the similarity is one
which the reader of the two works does not take long to discover. Not
only is the passion of Medea in Apollonius' Third Book confessedly
the counterpart of the passion of <persName>Dido</persName> in <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s Fourth, but the
instances are far from few where <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> has conveyed an incident from
his Alexandrian predecessor, altering and adapting, but not wholly
disguising it. The departure of Jason from his father and mother
resembles the departure of <persName>Pallas</persName> from Evander; the song of Orpheus is
contracted into the song of Iopas, as it had already been expanded into
the song of Silenus; the reception of the Argonauts by Hypsipyle is
like the reception of the Trojans by <persName>Dido</persName>, and the parting of Jason
from the Lemnian princess reappears, though in very different colours,
<pb n="21"/>
in the parting of Aeneas from the queen of <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>; the mythical
representations in <persName>Jason</persName>'s scarf answer to the historical representations
which distinguished the shield of Aeneas from that of Achilles; the
combat of Pollux with Amycus is reproduced in the combat of Entellus
with Dares; the harpies of <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> are the harpies of Apollonius, while
the deliverance of Phineus by the Argonauts may have furnished a hint
for the deliverance of Achemenides by the Trojans, an act of mercy
which has another parallel in the deliverance of the sons of Phrixus;
Phineus' predictions are like the predictions of Helenus; the cave of
Acheron in <placeName key="tgn,7002294">Asia Minor</placeName> suggests the cave of Avernus in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>; Evander
and Pallas appear once more in Lycus and Dascylus; Here addresses
Thetis as Juno addresses Juturna; Triton gives the same vigorous aid
in launching the Argo that he gives to the stranded vessels of Aeneas,
or that Portunus gives to the ship of Cloanthus in the Sicilian race.
Minor resemblances of thought or expression are easily detected by a
very cursory perusal of the Argonautics; I have myself noted at least
fifty of them, which will be found in their places in my notes on the
Aeneid. Altogether it might naturally be supposed that we possess
what every critic would admit to be an invaluable treasure, a poem
occupying a middle position between the Homeric epics and the Aeneid,
and making the transition from the one to the other intelligible.</p>
<p>Yet I am greatly mistaken if the reader of the Argonautics will find
any such expectations fulfilled in any adequate sense. The similarities
of detail are there, doubtless more than I have enumerated or discovered:
but the poem, taken as a whole, does not remind us of the
Aeneid, or enable us to understand the form under which <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> has
chosen to represent Homer. <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> resembles <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName> far more strongly
than he resembles the supposed intermediary. It is a signal instance of
the kinship of genius asserting itself against the rival affinities of outward
condition and circumstance. The style of Apollonius is a literary
style, the epic language of <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName> reproduced and modified by a modern
student: but though it is sometimes graceful and ingenious, compared
with the style of <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> it is the mere jargon of a grammarian, seeking
to revive a mode of speech of which he had no living appreciation. His
treatment of his subject makes us think of the <title>Iliad</title> and the Aeneid,
but it is by way of contrast; where he is felicitous, the felicity is not of
an epic character, and the general tenor of the narrative is tedious and
uninteresting, and therefore neither Homeric nor Virgilian. A catalogue
of heroes is in itself a sufficiently epic thing, yet we feel that
neither <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName> nor <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> would have dreamed of commencing a poem
with it, as the reader must be made to sympathize in the object of the
muster before the muster-roll can have any meaning to him. The
incidents of the voyage have either no interest at all, or an interest
<pb n="22"/>
unconnected with the main purpose of the poem. In the narratives of
the Odyssey and the Aeneid everything bears on the fortunes of
<persName>Ulysses</persName> and his crew, or on those of Aeneas regarded as the future
founder of the Trojan nation; the voyages are sufficiently diversified,
but the object of every event is to illustrate the action of the contending
powers whose strife keeps the prince of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> from his home, the chief
of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> from his destined kingdom. But in Apollonius there is little or
nothing of this; the voyage was part of his poem; it had to be made an
eventful one, and events are produced accordingly. We do not see the
object of the sojourn in <placeName key="tgn,7011173">Lemnos</placeName>, or of the fight between Pollux and
Amycus; even Phineus seems to be introduced rather for his own sake
than for the aid which his prophecy affords to the voyagers. They lose
some of their comrades; but even the loss of <persName>Hercules</persName> scarcely impresses
itself on us, and that of Tiphys is more easily remedied than we should have
expected. The Third Book is the gem of the whole poem, and may beread
with real pleasure, even by those whose recollection of <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> is fresh and
vivid. <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>, indeed, has not chosen to contend directly with Apollonius;
he concentrates his strength on the picture of <persName>Dido</persName> in her abandonment
and despair, and touches more lightly the early approaches of the love
that was to undo her. The object of Apollonius is different; Medea,
the forsaken and desperate wife, formed no part of the argument of his
poem; his Medea is a maiden in her father's palace, and he has to paint
the steps by which, under the agency of the god of love, she resigns all
her feelings for home, and is delivered heart and soul to the power of
enchantments more mighty than her own. Accordingly, when she retires
to her chamber we have her thoughts and also her dreams; the
last not simply mentioned, like <persName>Dido</persName>'s on the night after Aeneas's story,
but recounted. She goes to her sister, who is fortunately as excited as
she, though from a different cause; and even an arrangement which
gives her hope of binding Jason to herself does not prevent her from
passing the dreary midnight hours in an agony of hopeless longing,
which she is at one time nearly ending by swallowing a drug from her
own casket of poisons. Yet, though there is power and beauty here, it
is not the power and beauty of <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>. Even the passage in which
Medea, with the casket lying open on her lap, is struck with a sudden
horror of death, and feels as she never felt before, that <quote>the light is
sweet, and it is a pleasant thing to behold the sun,</quote> deep as is its truth
and pathos, does not affect us as we expect to be affected by an incident
in an epic poem. It is too modern for Homer; <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> might have
owned the feeling, but he would have been content to indicate it in two
or three lines. The conference of Here and <persName>Pallas</persName>, and their joint
visit to Aphrodite, are evidently imitated from Here's visit to Aphrodite
in the Fourteenth Book of the <title>Iliad</title>, and are as evidently <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s model
<pb n="23"/>
in the scene between <persName>Venus</persName> and Cupid at the end of the First Aeneid,
and that between <persName>Juno</persName> and <persName>Venus</persName> at the beginning of the Fourth; but
they do not impress the reader as he is impressed by their Greek original,
or by their Latin copy; they are graceful, fanciful, in a word,
Ovidian; but they are not epic. The description of Love overreaching
Ganymede at dice, the boy-god erect and radiant, his playmate pouting
and pettish, is obviously made for painting; but the picture would not
find a place in a heroic gallery. Nor is Apollonius writing in the <q direct="unspecified">grand
style</q> when he introduces Aphrodite playfully pinching her son's cheek,
and bribing him to attack Medea by a promise of the magic ball with
which Zeus played when a babe in his cavern-nursery of Ida. The interview
between Jason and Medea in the temple of Hecate is tender
and touching; but <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> would never have descended to the prettiness
of the comparison of the two lovers, bashful and silent, to tall pine-trees
at first standing still in the calm, and then breaking into a rustle under
the agitation of the wind: a simile which Valerius Flaccus has to tone
down and render less graphic in order to adapt it to the genius of his
quasi-Virgilian imitation<note anchored="yes" n="5"><cit><quote lang="greek"><l>tw\ d' a)/new| kai\ a)/naudoi e)fe/stasan a)llh/loisin</l>

<bibl>Val. Flacc. 7. 403, foll.</bibl></cit></note>. When the voyage recommences, the poem
again ceases to interest us. The treacherous murder of Absyrtus is
narrated in a manner to excite pity and terror; but we have heard too
little of the youth to feel much personal concern in his fate. The ineffectual
appeal of Medea to the greater sorceress, Circe, is better in
conception than in execution. The adventures of the suppliants in
Phaeacia have rather the grotesqueness of romance than the dignity of
epic narrative. The other incidents of the homeward voyage, like those
of the voyage out, seem as if related for an emergency, not evolved by
the internal necessities of the story; and the few lines in which the heroes
are at last dismissed may perhaps show that the poet had come to be as
weary of the subject as his readers. The Homeric poems, according to
Longinus<note anchored="yes" n="6">On the Sublime, &sect; 33.</note>, contain many slips, the Argonautics none; yet, asks the
critic, who would not rather be <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName> than Apollonius? It required
<pb n="24"/>
but little confidence to put the question; but few, I imagine, would now
accept the previous judgment on which it is based. If <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName> sometimes
nods, Apollonius may be said to be only occasionally awake,
though his long fits of somnolency are relieved by fanciful and even
attractive dreams.</p>
<p>Of the earlier epic poetry of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> we know still less than of the later
epic poetry of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>. We know, however, enough to assure us that
it had some influence on <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>; enough also to warrant us in assuming
that its influence, could it be thoroughly estimated, would be found not
to have penetrated very far. To inquire into the influence of Naevius
and Ennius upon <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> is, in fact, as unfruitful a subject as to inquire
into the influence of Chaucer and Spenser, or perhaps Cowley, upon
Pope. Incidents and external colouring may occasionally have been
borrowed; forms of expression and turns of rhythm may have been appropriated
by a writer of whom it might be said, as it has been said of
Pope, that <quote>there is scarcely a happy combination of words, or a phrase
poetically elegant, in his native language, which he has not inserted into
his poems<note anchored="yes" n="7">Watts, quoted in Johnson's Life of Pope.</note>;</quote> but the use he made of his predecessors cannot have borne
any analogy to the use he made of <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName>. In the one case it is an
ancient conqueror who, having overcome a veteran worthy of his steel,
converts his body into merchandise, and wears his armour as his own;
in the other case it is a despot, who walks through the houses of
his subjects, and takes away anything that strikes his fancy, for the
adornment of his own palace. The same tradition which, as we have
seen, makes <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> speak of grappling with <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName> as of attempting to
rob <persName>Hercules</persName> of his club, tells us that he talked of his appropriations
from Ennius as the gold which a man rakes from a dunghill<note anchored="yes" n="8">Donatus, &sect; 18. 71.</note>. Almost
all that we know of the actual obligations of <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> to the Punic War of
Naevius, is that in Naevius's poem, no less than in <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>'s, Aeneas is
supposed to be questioned about his departure from <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, that Naevius
speaks of <persName>Dido</persName> and her sister Anna, from which it is inferred that the
questioner of Aeneas is the Carthaginian queen, and that the consolation
addressed by Aeneas to his crew in the First Aeneid and the discourse
between <persName>Venus</persName> and <persName>Jupiter</persName> in the same book are, as we are
told in words which must necessarily be understood with some latitude<note anchored="yes" n="9">Serv. on Aen. i. 198: <quote lang="la"><emph>O socii</emph> . . . et totus hic locus de Naevio belli Punici lib.

<q direct="unspecified">entirely</q> taken from the old poet. It must be confessed that the two
or three lines quoted by Servius in exemplification of the hints which
Naevius gave to <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> do not suggest the notion of any very close
imitation. When Naevius says of the wives of Anchises and Aeneas&mdash;

<l>Flentes ambae abeuntes lacrimis cum multis,</l>

<p>And we feel that the Virgilian Aeneas might have represented himself
as <q direct="unspecified">wondering at the multitude<note anchored="yes" n="2">Aen. 2. 797. Serv. ad loc.</note></q> of those who followed his fortunes
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">animis opibusque parati,</q> even if Naevius, speaking of the same gathering,

it by the stately Grecian exotic.</p>
<p>The identity of metre at once establishes a closer affinity between
Virgil and Ennius than can ever have existed between the poet of the
Aeneid and the poet of the Punic War. As a matter of fact we know
that many lines in the Aeneid are taken, more or less changed, from the
Annals; indeed, we owe the preservation of not a few of Ennius's
hexameters to the early critics who pointed out the imitations of them
in Virgil. Every reader of the Aeneid will remember lines resembling
<quote lang="la">Qui caelum versat stellis fulgentibus aptum,</quote> <quote lang="la">Teque pater Tiberine
tuo cum flumine sancto,</quote> <quote lang="la">Cum superum lumen nox intempesta teneret,</quote>

opum vi,</quote> <quote lang="la">Quis potis ingentis oras evolvere belli?</quote> <quote lang="la">Semianimesque
micant oculi lucemque requirunt;</quote> lines, some of which, when
<pb n="26"/>
we meet them in Virgil, strike us with no want of smoothness or finish,
while others, though somewhat rougher, serve to vary the harmony which
they do not really interrupt. The Latin hexameter, under all its modifications,
has characteristics which distinguish it from the Greek; and as
Ennius was its originator, he may claim to be the author of Virgil's
versification, even in cases where nothing like imitation can be pretended.
Ennius did not naturalize his new importation until the language
into which it was introduced had lost some portion of its original
plasticity; he had accordingly, as has been ably shown by a German
writer<note anchored="yes" n="4">K&ouml;ne, Ueber die Sprache der R&ouml;mischen Epiker. M&uuml;nster, <date value="1840">1840</date>.</note>, to adopt a certain conventionalism of expression, innovating
here, paraphrasing there, in order to avoid obvious words which happened
to be unsuitable to his metre; and though <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> was not likely
to follow him in his harsher <q direct="unspecified">tours de force,</q> his <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">saxo cere- comminuit
-brum,</q> or his <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">replet te laetificum gau-,</q> the same necessity which pressed
on the elder poet pressed on the younger also, making him fall into the
style of epic commonplace which already existed, and augment it by a
thousand new and ingenious devices of his own. All this we may admit,
as we have made similar admissions in the case of Apollonius; yet it
may still be true that Virgil's debt to Ennius is so trifling as to be
scarcely worth computation. We know too little of Ennius to be
able to estimate his merits as a narrator; hundreds of his verses have
come down to us, but very few passages which exceed three or four
lines, and of these scarcely any can be called pieces of narrative.
There is indeed a description of an invincible tribune in the Histrian
war, bathed in sweat and exposed to a hailstorm of javelins, which
Virgil doubtless had before him while painting Turnus at the end of the
ninth Aeneid; but the model is itself a copy from the single-handed
resistance of the Homeric Ajax in the sixteenth Iliad, which would
sufficiently account for Virgil's imitation if the fragment of the Annals
had never been preserved by Macrobius<note anchored="yes" n="5">Sat. 6. 3.</note>, while it leaves us no means of
judging how Ennius would have treated such a situation if he had not
had <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName> to draw from. The account of Romulus and Remus waiting
for the augury, preserved by Cicero in the first book of his De Divinatione,
is not a very remarkable specimen of narrative power. Homer
would have introduced more details; <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> would have treated those
which Ennius gives in a more artificial way, dwelling on one or two,
and hinting the rest; both would probably have thrown in some short
speech, directly or indirectly expressed, to show the feeling of the rival
brothers and the attendant multitude. But without venturing farther
on the precarious ground of hypothetical criticism, we need scarcely
<pb n="27"/>
doubt that there was nothing in Ennius's conception of his art which
Virgil was likely to welcome as a help towards improving upon Homer.
Living in a pre-historic time, <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName> (I use the name for convenience'
sake, not as taking a side in the controversy about his personality) is
the only poet who has attained the grace and finish of a literary period;
he is the only primeval poet so complete in himself that it might be
questioned whether it would have been an advantage to him to have
lived later. There may conceivably be one or two touches in Ennius
which appear to show a more modern feeling than Homer's, a keen
sense of colour<note anchored="yes" n="6">e. g. <q direct="unspecified">Russescunt frundes,</q> Ann. 7. fr. 20 (Vahlen's edition).</note>, an appreciation of philosophy<note anchored="yes" n="7"><quote lang="la">Nec quisquam sophiam sapientia quae perhibetur
In somnis vidit prius quam sam discere coepit.</quote>&mdash;Ann. 7. fr. 2.
Compare also fr. 1, the celebrated lines about Naevius.</note> and literature as such;
for an age, even when relatively less advanced than some former age, is
yet in a certain sense the heir of all that have gone before it, and the age
of Ennius in particular possessed the rudiments of criticism and aspired
after culture; but, regarded in the gross, <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName> is mature and articulate,
while Ennius is still crude and infantine, and it was not to be
expected that the large utterance of the divine foretime of Greece
should come mended to Virgil's ear when repeated by the stammering
lips of his Italian ancestors. <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> may have believed, as Ennius did,
that the soul which dwelt in his own breast had once animated Homer;
but he probably would not have recognized Ennius as the intermediate
channel of its transmission.</p>
<p>It is needless to say anything of the rest of the early Roman epic
writers, who are indeed mere names to us; to speculate on the extent to
which Virgil's impressions of Apollonius' poem may have been modified
by the version of Varro Atacinus, of which five unimportant fragments
remain<note anchored="yes" n="8">Seneca (Controv. 16, p. 238) says that Montanus Julius praised <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> for having
improved (in his description of night, A. 8. 27, foll.) on two lines of Varro:
<quote lang="la">Desierant latrare canes, urbesque silebant:
Omnia noctis erant, placida conposta quiete.</quote>
Virgil, however, is not nearer to Varro than he is to Varro's original, <bibl n="Apollon. 3.749">Apoll. 3. 749</bibl>, foll.</note>, or to inquire whether the Aeneid is likely to have benefited
by the example of Hostius' work, De Bello Histrico, in any other
respect than in the multiplication of the <quote>ten tongues</quote> of the second
Iliad into a hundred<note anchored="yes" n="9"><quote lang="la">Homeri est <foreign lang="greek">ou)d' ei)/ moi de/ka me\n glw=ssai, de/ka de\ sto/mat' ei)=en</foreign>. Hunc secutus

ora sient totidem vocesque liquatae. Hinc Vergilius ait: Non mihi si linguae centum
sint oraque centum.</quote> Macrob. Sat. 2. 3. It is worth noting that Pope, professing to
translate Homer, has turned the ten tongues into a thousand. He had, however, some
provocation, as Ogilby had made them a hundred.</note>. As little necessity is there to speak of the
<pb n="28"/>
possible effect of Roman tragedy on the Aeneid, as, though there are
evident proofs that <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> did not disdain to imitate individual passages<note anchored="yes" n="1">See on A. 2. 237, 281, 499, &amp;c.</note>,
his real obligations are not to Ennius, Pacuvius, or Attius, but to the
great Athenian masters whom they copied as Ennius copied Homer.</p>
<p>The result of our inquiry then is this. <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> imitated Homer, but
imitated him as a rival, not as a disciple; his object was not to give a
faithful interpretation of his great master, but to draw forth his own
genius and satisfy the age in which he lived; and accordingly he
modified the Homeric story at his pleasure, according to the thousand
considerations that might occur to a poetical artist, a patriot, and a
connoisseur of antiquarian learning. Of later influences, the only one
which seems to have taken a really powerful hold of him is Greek
tragedy, which was in fact the only instance of a genius and culture
commensurate with his own, operating in a sphere analogous to his.
The epics of Alexandria and of early <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> may furnish occasional
illustrations to the commentator on the Aeneid; but his more continuous
studies will be better devoted to the poetry of <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName> and to the

<div2 type="Introduction" n="intro">
<p>THE subject of the Aeneid, as propounded in the opening lines, is the settlement of
Aeneas in Italy, after years of wandering, and a short but sharp final struggle. It is
however only of the events preceding the settlement that the poet really treats,&mdash;of the
wanderings and the war. In that, as in other things, he follows Homer, who does not
show us Ulysses <quote>an idle king, matched with an aged wife, meting laws to a savage
race,</quote> but leaves him fresh from the slaughter of the suitors, from the first embrace of
his wife and father, and from the conquest of his disaffected subjects. Accordingly,
the poem divides itself into two parts, the wanderings being embraced by the first, the
Italian war by the second. But the two parts naturally involve different modes of
treatment, comprehending as they do periods of time widely differing in length, the
one seven years, the other apparently a few days. Here again the example of Homer
is followed. The long period of wanderings is taken at a point not far from its
conclusion; enough is told in detail to serve as a specimen of the whole, and the rest is
related more summarily by the help of an obvious expedient, the hero being made to
narrate his past adventures to the person whose relation to him is all the time forming
one adventure more. This peculiarity of the Homeric story is noticed by Horace in a
well-known passage of his Art of Poetry (vv. 146 foll.), and recommended to the
adoption of Epic writers generally; but he does not clearly indicate the reason of it,
which doubtless is the wish to avoid that fatal dryness which seems to be inseparable
from all narratives where the events of many years are told continuously in a short
compass.</p>
<p>The First Book of the Aeneid may be said to perform well the objects which it was no
doubt intended to accomplish,&mdash;those of interesting us in the hero and introducing the
story. After a brief statement of the subject, we have a view of the supernatural machinery
by which it is to be worked out; and this, though imitated from Homer, where
the solitary rancour of Poseidon against Ulysses answers to the solitary rancour of Juno
against Aeneas, is skilfully contrived so as to throw a light on the subsequent history
of the Roman descendants of Aeneas, by the mention, even at that early time, of their
great enemy, Carthage. It is probable, as I have said in the general Introduction to
the Aeneid, that the merit of this thought may be due to Naevius, who seems to have
been the first to commit the felicitous anachronism of bringing Aeneas and Dido
together; but it must be allowed to be in strict accordance with the spirit of Virgil's
poem, which is throughout that of historical anticipation. Like Ulysses, Aeneas is
shipwrecked in the voyage which was to have been his last, the main difference being
that the Grecian hero is solitary, having long since lost all his companions, while the
Trojan is still accompanied by those who followed his fortunes from <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>. The
machinery by which the storm is allayed is perhaps managed more adroitly by Virgil
<pb n="30"/>
than by Homer, as there seems to be more propriety in representing the inferior god of
the winds as counteracted by the superior god of the sea, than in making a sea nymph
rescue one whom the god of the sea is seeking to destroy. But if <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> has obtained
an advantage over Homer, it is with the help of Homer's weapons, as the interview
between Juno and Aeolus obviously owes its existence to the interview between Here
and the God of Sleep. The dialogue of Venus and Jupiter appears to be another appropriation
from Naevius; but, as in the former case, <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> seems to have established
his right to what he has borrowed by the perfect fitness with which a prophecy of the
destiny of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> is introduced at the commencement of a poem intended to be a
monument of Roman greatness. The remaining incidents of the First Book need not
detain us much longer. As a general rule, they are borrowed from Homer; but we
may admire the skill with which <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> has introduced varieties of detail, as where
Ulysses, listening to songs about <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, reappears in Aeneas looking at sculptures or
paintings of Trojan subjects, and the art with which a new impression is produced by a
combination of old materials, in making the friendly power that receives Aeneas unite
the blaudishments of Calypso with the hospitality of Alcinous, and so engrafting a tale
of passion on a narrative of ordinary adventure. The suggestion of the employment of
Cupid by Venus was evidently taken from the loan of Aphrodite's cestus in <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName> and
the assistance rendered by the God of Love in Apollonius; but the treatment of the
thought is original and happy; and the few lines which describe the removal of
Ascanius to Idalia might themselves suggest a subject for poetry to some Keats or
Shelley, in whose mind the seed casually dropped by <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> should expand and
germinate.</p></div2>

<p>They are not found in Med., Rom., Gud.,
or the Verona fragments (Pal. and the
fragments of Vat. and St. Gall seem to
fail here), and the only MS. in Ribbeck's
list which contains them (the Berne MS.
No. 172) has them written in the margin
by a later hand. They appear to have
existed in the time of Servius and of the
Pseudo-Donatus, who say that Nisus the
grammarian had heard a story of their
having been expunged by Tueca and
Varius; on which Heyne remarks, <quote lang="la">Si res
ita se habet, acutior sane Varius Vergilio
fuit.</quote> The external evidence of such a
story it is impossible to estimate, but its
existence suspiciously indicates that the
lines were felt to require apology. Those
who speak of them as an <emph>introduction</emph> to
the poem, forget that if genuine they are
an integral part of the first sentence; and
that it is, to say the least, remarkable that
the exordium should be so constructed as
to be at once interwoven with the context,
and yet capable of removal without detriment
to the construction, just at the point
which forms a much better commencement.
The words <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">arma virumque</q> are
quoted by Martial, 8. 56., 19. 14., 185. 2,
and Auson. Epig. 137. 1, evidently as a
real commencement of the Aeneid; while
Ovid, Trist. 2. 533, and Persius, 1. 96, quote
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">arma virumque,</q> or <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">arma virum,</q> as important
and independent words, which they
cease to be the moment <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">arma</q> is viewed
in connexion with the words supposed to
precede it. Virg. himself, 9. 777, has (of
the poet Clytins) <quote lang="la">Semper equos atque
arma virum pugnasque canebat.</quote> Comp.
also <bibl n="Ov. Am. 1.15">Ov. 1 Amor. 15. 25</bibl>, Prop. 3. 26. 63,
which point the same way. Macrob. Sat.
5. 2. quotes <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Troiae qui primus ab oris</q> as
part of the first verse of the Aeneid.
On the other hand Priscian 910 P cites
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Ille ego qui quondam gracili modulatus
avena</q> as Virg.'s. Henry's view that
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">arma Martis</q> is happily contrasted with
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">arma agricolae</q> (comp. <bibl n="Verg. G. 1.160">G. 1. 160</bibl>) seems
to be favoured by the structure of the
sentence, and may very possibly have been
present to the mind of the author of these
<pb n="31"/>
lines; but it clearly was not present to
the minds of those who quoted <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">arma</q> by
itself as <emph>war</emph>. Tastes may differ as to the
rival commencements, on which see Henry
in loco, and on 2. 247; but it may be suggested
that Virg. would scarcely in his
first sentence have divided the attention of
the reader between himself and his hero
by saying, in effect, that the poet who
wrote the Eclogues and the Georgics, sings
the hero who founded <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. Wagn.
and Forb., however, as well as Henry, consider
the lines as genuine; and they have
been imitated by Spenser in the opening of
the Faery Queene, and Milton in the
opening of Paradise Regained.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Arma virumque:</lemma> this is an imitation
of the opening of the Odyssey, <foreign lang="greek">a)/ndra moi
e)/nnepe k.t.l.</foreign> It may also be taken from
the first line of the Cyclic poem of the
Epigoni, preserved by the Schol. on <bibl n="Aristoph. Peace 1270">Aristoph.
Peace 1270</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">*nu=n au)=q' u(ploterwn a)ndrw=n
a)rxw/meqa, *mou=sai</foreign>. It is followed by
all the other Roman writers of epic
poetry, Lucan, Flaccus, Statius, and, above
all, Silius, the most faithful copier of Virg.,
with a unanimity which strongly supports
the view taken in the preceding note.
The words are not a hendiadys, but give
first the character of the subject and then
the subject itself. <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Arma</q> may have been
intended to suggest, though it does not
express, a contrast between this and
Virg.'s previous poems.&mdash;In commencing
with <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">cano</q> he has followed his own example
in the Georgics, rather than that
of Homer, who at once invokes the Muse;
and the Latin Epic writers have followed
Virg. The earlier commentators have
found a difficulty in reconciling <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">primus</q>
with Antenor's previous migration (below,
vv. 242 foll.), and suggest that Aeneas had
first reached Italy proper, though Antenor
had previously reached Venetia. On the
other hand, Heyne and Wagn. make
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">primus</q> equivalent to <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">olim,</q> thus weakening
a word which from its position and
its occurrence in the first line of the poem
must be emphatic. The more obvious sense
is that Aeneas is so called without reference
to Antenor, as the founder of the
great Trojan empire in Italy.</p>

seems to rest solely on the authority of
Med., which has <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Lavinia</q> (corrected into
<q direct="unspecified">Lavina</q>), with a mark of erasure after the
word. <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Laviniaque</q> is found in the Verona

Terentianus Maurus and Diomedes, and in
single MSS. of Priscian, Censorinus, and
Servius in artem Donati. <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Lavinaque</q> is
found in Rom., Gud., and probably most
other MSS., and is supported by quotations
in Macrobius, Gellius, Marius Victorinus,
Pompeius, the Schol. on Lucan, most

Servius mentions both readings, saying,
<quote lang="la">Lavina legendum est, non Lavinia.</quote>
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Lavinia</q> is supported by 4. 236: but the
synizesis, though not unexampled (comp.
5. 269., 6. 33, and see on <bibl n="Verg. G. 4.243">G. 4. 243</bibl>), is
perhaps awkward, especially in the second
line of the poem, and the imitation in Prop. 3.
26. 64, <quote>Iactaque Lavinis moenia litoribus,</quote>
is in favour of the form <q direct="unspecified">Lavina.</q> Juv.
12. 71 has <quote lang="la">novercali sedes praelata Lavino,</quote>
though there as in Prop. the quadrisyllabic
form might be introduced and
explained by synizesis. On the whole, I
have preferred <q direct="unspecified">Lavinaque,</q> believing the
form to be possible in itself (comp. <quote lang="la">Campanus,</quote>
<quote lang="la">Lucanus,</quote> <quote>Appulus,</quote> &amp;c.), and

Lachmann on <bibl n="Lucr. 2.719">Lucr. 2.719</bibl> speaks

Pallas, by Poseidon, who afterwards, provoked
by his impious boast that he would

Aeschylus, like Virg., mentions a general
storm, and implies (through the forebodings
of Clytaemnestra) that it was the
punishment of some impiety. The crime
of Ajax is fixed by Lycophron and others
to be insolence offered to Cassandra in the

Gossrau. Henry's interpretation, making
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">scopulo</q> abl., and supposing Ajax to be
pierced by a fragment of rock hurled at
him (<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">turbine</q> being paralleled with <quote lang="la">ingentis

certain extent with Quinct. Smyrn. 14.
567 foll. (not with Sen. Ag. 552 foll., who
follows Hom.); nothing however is there
said about piercing Ajax, who is merely
said to be overwhelmed by the rock as
Enceladus was overwhelmed by Aetna; so
that the parallel is hardly made out. W.
Ribbeck cites Seneca's poem to Corduba,
vv. 13, 14 (Wernsdorf's Poet. Lat. Min.
vol. 5, p. 1367), <quote lang="la">Ille tuus quondam magnus,

as the writer evidently means
to speak of his banishment to a rocky
island as an impalement.</p>

then the subjunctive is less forcible than

(l. c) to Vulcan. Comp. also Val. F. 1.
579 foll. The Aeolus of Hom. is not a
demigod, but the king of a sort of magic
isle, entrusted by Zeus with the control
of the winds, but passing his life in
continually feasting with his queen and
children.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="commline" n="53">
<p>Hom.'s winds are not represented
as struggling, or the object of anxious
custody. When Aeolus wishes to waft
Ulysses to his country, he lets the west
wind blow, and ties up all the rest in a
skin. Val. F., on the contrary, with questionable
judgment, makes Aeolus let loose
the winds whenever he finds them ungovernable.
Gud. originally had <q direct="unspecified">luctatos.</q></p>
</div2>
<div2 type="commline" n="54">
<p>Henry (on v. 86) considers the
whole picture of the winds to have been
suggested by the Ludi Circenses, referring
particularly to the words <q direct="unspecified">inperio premit,</q>
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">frenat,</q> <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">fremunt,</q> <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">carcere,</q> and <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">claustra,</q>
and citing the imitation by Val. F. 1. 611,
<quote lang="la">fundunt se carcere laeti Thraces equi
Zephyrusque,</quote> and the description of a
chariot-race in Sidon. Apoll. 1. ad Consentium,
opening with <quote lang="la">Illi ad claustra fremunt.</quote>
Against this may be urged the
collocation of two of the most important
words, <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">carcere</q> and <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">frenat;</q> inasmuch
as <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">carcere frenat</q> must mean <q direct="unspecified">curbs with
a carcer,</q> not <q direct="unspecified">curbs in a carcer.</q> <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Vinclis</q>
also appears to fix the sense of <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">carcere</q>
as a prison-house, and not a barrier in a
race-course. Again, <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">circum claustra fremunt</q>
is not the same thing as <quote lang="la">ad claustra
fremunt.</quote> The more reasonable thing
seems to be to say that Virg. uses imagery
principally taken from the race-horse and
the prison, but without intending any one
connected or uniform series of metaphors.
Lucr., in a passage from which this is
partly imitated (<bibl n="Lucr. 6.189">6. 189&mdash;203</bibl>), compares
the winds pent in a thunder-cloud to wild
beasts in a cage, <cit><quote lang="la">in caveisque ferarum
more minantur, Nunc hinc nunc illinc
fremitus per nubila mittunt Quaerentesque
viam circum versantur</quote> <bibl n="Lucr. 6.198">(vv. 198&mdash;200)</bibl></cit>.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="commline" n="55">
<p>Here we are reminded of an earlier
part of the passage just cited from Lucr.,
where the storm-clouds in which the winds
are confined are compared to mountains
(vv. 189, 190) and caverns (v. 195),
<quote lang="la">moles . . quas venti cum tempestate
coorta Complerunt, magno indignantur
murmure clausi Nubibus.</quote> It is possible
that the Lucretian image may have suggested
to Virg. his deviation from the
account in Hom. <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Magno cum murmure:</q>
comp. such phrases as <quote lang="la">cum
magna calamitate et prope pernicie civitatis,</quote>
Cic. 2 Verr. 1. 24. See also Hand,

the passage in Lucr. <q direct="unspecified">While the huge

</div2>
<div2 type="commline" n="56">
<p>It is not easy to say what or where
this <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">arx</q> of Aeolus is intended to be. The
common notion is that it is the top of the
mountain in which the winds are confined.
Henry once thought it was an eminence
within the cave; now he takes it of a
fortress or palace in the neighbourhood.
This last certainly seems the most natural
meaning of the word. The citadel is the
natural dwelling of a despotic governor
(comp. Juv. 10. 307); in Greek history,
tyrants seize it when they assume supreme
power; and so here, as Aeolia is under a
strong government, it is supposed to be
furnished with an <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">arx,</q> though the government
consists in keeping the key of
the prison. So in the description of the
shades, Stat. Theb. 8. 21, Pluto is described
as <quote lang="la">sedens media regni infelicis in arce,</quote>
words apparently imitated from Virg., and
<pb n="39"/>
doubtless to be understood simply as bringing
out the notion of sovereignty, without
any particular reference to the appropriateness
of the image. It is in this
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">arx</q> that Juno has her interview with
Aeolus, who goes from it (though this is
not directly asserted) to the dungeon, and
opens the door. <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Sedet</q> expresses actual
sitting, not, as Henry thinks, merely dwelling;
but it has no further appropriateness
than as carrying out the image of <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">arce;</q>

<foreign lang="greek">skhptou=xos</foreign>.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="commline" n="57">
<p><foreign lang="greek">*skh=ptra</foreign> in Greek appears to signify

Virg. however uses it simply for <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">sceptrum,</q>
7. 252, and probably this is the
meaning here, though there is no special
appropriateness in the image; see previous

<p>The legend of Antenor is given
by Livy, 1. 1, where it is said that he led
a colony of Trojans and of Heneti from
Paphlagonia to the head of the Adriatic,
whence he expelled the Euganei; and that
the place where he and his followers first
landed was called Troja. His story was
variously told, Pindar, Pyth. 5. 19, taking
the Antenoridae to Cyrene: the Romans
however cherished naturally the legend of
a migration to Italy, and one Largus, a
contemporary of Ovid, wrote a poem on it.

barbarity of the inhabitants. <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Illyricos

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Fontem Timavi</lemma> is rightly explained
by Henry of the fountain or source
of the Timavus. Between this and the sea
(a distance of about a mile) there are subterranean
communications, through which
the salt water forces its way, breaking out
at the fountain through seven mouths or
holes in the limestone rock, and overflowing
the channel of the river. See the account
quoted by Henry from Cluverius,
Ital. Antiq. 1. 20, and more recent descriptions
cited in the same note from
Wittmann and Schl&ouml;zer. It appears from
Serv. that this view was received by
many in his time; but the subsequent
commentators, including Heyne, Wagn.,
and Forb., understand <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">mare</q> and <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">pelago</q>
of the volume of the waters of the river,
so that <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">fontem Timavi</q> has to stand for

</div2>
<div2 type="commline" n="245">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Per ora novem:</lemma> the general account,
as intimated above, appears to be
that there were seven of these <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">ora,</q> or
sources. Cluverius however l. c. speaks of
the whole of the country to the sea as
<quote lang="la">unum perpetuumque saxum innumeris
passim altissimisque antris perforatum;</quote>
and it seems from Wittmann's account
that the <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">ora</q> are constantly overflowed,
so that their number is not easy to ascertain.
Polybius asserts that the water in
all but one of these <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">ora</q> is salt, which
Strabo denies. The two are reconciled by
Cluverius, who reports from actual observation
that the sea occasionally bursts up
through six of the sources, and renders the
water undrinkable. <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Vasto cum murmure

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Nunc,</lemma> &amp;c.: Wagn., Forb., and
Jahn understand these words of the death
of Antenor; but in spite of the special
pleading of the former that a peaceful
death would naturally be mentioned as the
climax of the wanderer's happiness, and
that Antenor, even during the Trojan war,
must have been near the grave, it is evident
that the sense required is rather that
of a tranquil settlement following on labours.
The language undoubtedly is such
as is more generally applied to death or
sleep, but the occurrence of such expressions
as <quote lang="la">conponere pacem</quote> (7. 339., 12.

that the words <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">conpostus pace</q>

a peaceful life. Possibly too Virg. may
have thought of Ennius' celebrated lines
(A. 18. 7), <quote lang="la">Sicut fortis equus, spatio qui

<p>This line seems to answer in

to settle on or to mark out for settling
(<quote lang="la">capere oculis</quote>), which latter would agree

words <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">captas despectare,</q> which could not
very naturally, as Henry thinks, stand for
the action of the swans rising again and
hovering over the place where they had
settled, while Wagn.'s view (in his smaller

others look down on it after having marked
it, is open to the obvious objection that such
a distinction could not possibly be observed
or pointed out by a spectator. It seems
best then, with Burm., to take <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">captas</q>

<p>Troilus is mentioned by Priam, Il.
24. 257, with the epithet of <foreign lang="greek">i(ppioxa/rmhs</foreign>, as
having been killed in battle (before the

was killed by Achilles must have been
drawn by Virg. from other sources, such
as those represented by Quintus Smyrnaeus,
Tzetzes, Dictys, and Dares, who
however differ about the period in the
Trojan war when his death occurred.
Heyne conjectures from a Schol. on Hom.
l. c. that Soph. in his lost tragedy of
Troilus represented the youth as surprised
by Achilles while exercising his chariot,
and killed. See his Excursus on this
passage. <bibl n="Pl. Bac. 4.9">Plautus, Bacchid. 4. 9. 29 foll.</bibl>,
speaks of the death of Troilus as one of the
three fatal events in the siege of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, the
other two being the loss of the Palladium
and the fall of the top of the Scaean gate.
Ribbeck transposes this passage so as to
make it follow the next scene; but this
would be to bind Virg. to follow servilely
the Homeric order, with which indeed there
would still be a disagreement, as in Hom.
the mission to the temple of Athene precedes
the Dolonea. The intention of Virg.
doubtless is to mention first two fatal

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Armaque</lemma> Rom., Pal., Gud.,
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">arvaque</q> Med. The great majority of
MSS. would seem to be in favour of the
former: the latter is found in at least one
of the Oxford MSS., that of Ball. Coll.
In internal probability the two words seem
to be as nearly balanced as possible. <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Arva</q>
brings out further the notion of a settlement,
and is used repeatedly in connexion
with the Trojan settlement in Italy (see
among many other passages v. 569 below,
4. 311, 355, and comp. 3. 136). <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Arma</q>
adds a new thought, and one which is
natural enough in the mouth of Ilioneus.
Arms are a natural addition to a city:
comp. v. 347 foll. above, <quote lang="la">urbem Patavi
sedesque locavit Teucrorum, et genti
nomen dedit, armaque fixit Troia,</quote> 12.
192 foll., <quote lang="la">socer arma Latinus habeto . . .
mihi moenia Teucri Constituent, urbique
dabit Lavinia nomen.</quote> The Trojans have
arms of their own (comp. 4. 48, where
observe <quote lang="la">urbem</quote> and <quote lang="la">regna</quote> in the
immediate context); but in the absence of
Aeneas they must seek armed assistance
elsewhere. Such being the balance of
probabilities, I have decided, after much
hesitation, by external evidence, adopting
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">arma</q> with Henry and Ribbeck, against
most modern critics. <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Arva</q> was first
introduced by Heyne. Oddly enough,
there are traces of a similar variety in Pal.
and another MS. below, v. 569, where,
though <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">arma</q> would be out of the question,
there is a certain parallelism. <q direct="unspecified">A

by the language of the parallel 7.

<div2 type="Introduction" n="intro">
<p>THE voice of criticism has unanimously fixed on this book, along with the Fourth and
Sixth, as affording the best evidence of the true greatness of Virgil. Whether or no
we believe the story told in Donatus' biography, that the poet himself chose these
three books to read to Augustus as a specimen of his work, it indicates at any rate
the judgment passed by antiquity; and modern opinion has not been slow to ratify
the verdict.</p>
<p>The conception of the present book is eminently fortunate. <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName> had made Ulysses
tell the story of his wanderings to Alcinous, and so had supplied the canvas on which
the younger artist might work: but the tale of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> taken forms no part of the narrative
of the Odyssey: it is briefly sung by a bard, whose strains move the tears of
Ulysses, as the Trojan portraits at Carthage have moved those of Aeneas; but that is
all. It was open to <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> to make his hero tell the whole story of the destruction of
Troy without trespassing on Homer's ground; and he seized the opportunity. The
subject could not fail to be most impressive, and it is introduced with perfect propriety.
Dido, it is true, knew the main incidents of the siege; but that was all the more reason
why she should wish to hear them from the chief living witness on the side of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>.
Virgil too has shown his wisdom not only in what he has said, but in what he has left
unsaid. Dido's curiosity would naturally extend over the whole ten years; but the
poet knew that a detail of the siege, natural as it might be, would weary his readers.
He tells us that the queen asked of Priam and Hector, of Diomedc and Achilles; but
he does not require us to listen to Aeneas till he can concentrate our attention on <q direct="unspecified">the
last agony of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>,</q> the one night in which the city was taken and sacked.</p>
<p>The taking of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> was, as might be expected, a favourite subject with poets before
Virgil. It formed part of the epic cycle; it was treated by the masters of the Greek
drama. Of these works the only one that has come down to us is the Troades of
Euripides; and even that has its scene laid after the catastrophe, which it deals with
only by way of retrospect. We know enough of the others to be assured that the
main incidents in Virgil's narrative&mdash;the story of the Trojan horse, the introduction of
Sinon, the tragic death of Laocoon&mdash;are taken from his predecessors. It would have
been unnatural if it had not been so. Custom bound <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> to follow the legend in its
main bearings as he had received it, though it left him quite free, as I have contended
in the general Introduction to the Aeneid, to vary minor details, and give his own
colour to the whole. How far <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> is original in the minuti&aelig; of his treatment, we
cannot tell. Macrobius indeed makes one of his interlocutors (Sat. 5. 2) speak of it as
a fact known to every schoolboy, that the story of this book is taken almost word for
word from one Pisander, who wrote a mythological history of the world in verse; but
though the charge is circumstantially made, it is discredited by the silence of other
<pb n="108"/>
authorities, whose ignorance contrasts strangely with this schoolboy knowledge; and
Heyne, in his first Excursus to this book, has made it more than probable that the
plagiarism of the poet is really the blunder of the critic, who is supposed to have confounded
two Pisanders, one who lived before Virgil, but did not write the mythologicohistorical
poem, and another who did write the poem, but lived after Virgil<note anchored="yes" n="1">Welcker, Epischer Cyclus, p. 91, thinks that there may have been a spurious poem
on the subject forged in the Alexandrian age, and attributed to the earlier Pisander;
&mdash;rather a hypothetical mode of saving Macrobius' credit.</note>. The
little that we know from Servius and others about the treatment of the stories of
Laocoon and Sinon by earlier writers points rather to difference from Virgil's version
than to identity with it: and though we must not build so much on this, as it is the
wont of such witnesses to dwell rather on points of dissimilarity than on points of
agreement, we may take it as showing that <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> did really exercise his privilege of
varying the smaller circumstances of the narrative, especially as his successors,
Quinctus Smyrnaeus and Tryphiodorus, who are supposed to have been diligent copyists
of the early writers, differ from him considerably in their manner of treatment. At
any rate, whatever may have been Virgil's obligations to his predecessors for the
incidents of his narrative, we cannot doubt that the golden thread which runs through
the whole, the feeling of Aeneas himself, is substantially his own. The steps by which
the hero comes to realize his position as an inhabitant of a captured city, a partisan
of a cause against which the gods have finally declared,&mdash;steps indicated with such
subtlety that it is only of late that they have been fully recognized (see on vv. 322,
402),&mdash;are not likely to have been transmitted by legend, while they bear in themselves
the strongest marks of the poet's peculiar art.</p>
<p>Perhaps there is no better way of estimating the greatness of <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> in this book
than by glancing at the manner in which the subject has been treated by the three
later poets, Smyrnaeus, Tryphiodorus, and Tzetzes. With his example before them,
not to mention the other writers whom they probably followed, they have yet contrived
to divest a most stirring and pathetic story of a large part of its interest. Smyrnaeus
bestows two of his fourteen books, the twelfth and the thirteenth, on the capture of
Troy. He goes over much the same ground as Virgil; but his narrative is flat and
lifeless: the incidents do not flow out of each other, and sometimes, instead of incident,
we are put off with the tedious generality of a mere historical abridgment. Calchas
advises the Greeks to try stratagem rather than force: Ulysses on the moment strikes
out the notion of the wooden horse with all its details: Neoptolemus and Philoctetes,
like Milton's Moloch, are for open war, and attempt to lead their people to battle at
once, but are checked by a thunderbolt from Zeus, which quite overawes them; an incident
briefly despatched, and apparently introduced for no object whatever. Soon after
we hear that the gods are at war with each other, as in the twentieth Iliad, hurling as
missiles the hills of Ida; but we are expressly told that while all nature is convulsed,
the human combatants are unconscious of what is going on, and even this invisible warfare
is soon terminated by another thunderbolt from Zeus, so that, as before, we are at
a loss to understand the relevancy of the incident. When the horse is made, Sinon is
left with it, having expressed to the Greeks his willingness to undergo burning alive, or
any torture that the Trojans may inflict. Accordingly, he stands silent while the enemy
surrounds him, trying him first with mild words of inquiry, afterwards with the harsher
methods of mutilation and burning: and then, having given this undoubted proof of his
courage, he voluntarily tells his story. Laocoon, who disbelieves him, is struck blind
on the spot, the state of his eyes being described with a sickening minuteness of detail;
yet even in this condition he continues urging his countrymen to burn the horse, and
so the serpents are sent to destroy his children by his side. Cassandra then takes his
<pb n="109"/>
place in denunciation, but is gibed at by the Trojans: she tries herself to burn or break
open the horse, but torch and weapons are wrested from her. A paragraph is spent in
enforcing the statement that the Greeks suffered during the sack as well as the Trojans,
and the modes of their deaths are enumerated with statistical particularity. Some, we
are told, were hit by goblets, others by tables, others by torches and spits with meat
adhering to them, others by hatchets: some have their fingers cut off in trying to ward
off blows: some are bruised with stones, and some pierced with lances, which the Trojans
were able to wield in spite of the wine they had drunk. We are told of Aeneas' escape,
which it appears was owing partly, as in Virgil, to the protection of his mother, who
warded off the weapons of the enemy, but partly also to a speech of Calchas to the
Greeks, ordering them to spare him on account of his signal piety in taking his father
and son with him rather than his treasure. But perhaps the greatest piece of flatness
is found in Pyrrhus' speech to old Priam, who has been praying for death at his
hands:&mdash;
<quote lang="greek"><l>w)= ge/ron, e)mmemaw=ta kai\ e)ssu/meno/n per a)nw/geis:</l>
<l>ou) ga/r s' e)xqro\n e)o/nta meta\ zwoi=sin e)a/sw:</l>
<l>ou) ga/r ti yuxh=s pe/lei a)ndra/si fi/lteron a)/llo.</l>
</quote></p>
<p>Tryphiodorus is a writer of a somewhat lower stamp, perhaps equal in power to Smyrnaeus,
but inferior in taste and judgment. He concentrates himself chiefly on the
wooden horse and the events immediately connected with it, fifty lines being given to a
minute description of all its parts, from which it appears that it was a costly as well as
elaborate performance,&mdash;its eyes being made of beryl and amethyst, and its teeth of
silver. Ulysses, as in Smyrnaeus, lays down the programme of operations: the heroes
rise one after another, as at the challenge of Hector in the seventh book of the Iliad,
and volunteer in the service; and when they are lodged in the horse, Pallas provides
them with ambrosia; immediately after which they are aptly compared to beasts running
down a rock to escape a winter torrent, and waiting in their den, famished with
hunger. Sinon is left, mangled, like Ulysses in Helen's story in the fourth Odyssey,
with stripes from his own hand, and tells a similar story to that in Virgil, except that
he represents himself as having been scourged by his comrades because he refused to
fly with them. The dragging of the horse into the city is detailed at tedious length,&mdash;
the agency of the gods, which duly appears later in the poem, being tastelessly anticipated,
and Here being made to open the gates wider than usual, while Poseidon knocks
down part of the stonework of the entrance. Cassandra protests, as in Smyrnaeus, and
is severely upbraided by her father, who sends her to her chamber. Helen's story in
Homer is again put under requisition, and the adulteress is made to address the Greeks
within the horse in the tones of their respective wives; but the incident is an isolated
one, and no attempt is made to harmonize it with the rest of the story. For the rest of
the book the narrative proceeds more rapidly, the different events of the sack being
despatched each in a few lines, without any attempt at pictorial narrative. The poet
cannot, he says, tell all that happened on that night; that is a business for the Muses:
he feels himself to be a chariot-driver nearing the goal. Tzetzes need hardly detain us
a moment, as his narrative of the sack of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> is utterly contemptible, with no pretension
to poetry, and very little to style or metre. He is fortunately brief, and in
fact presents a condensed r&eacute;sum&eacute; of the story as told by his various predecessors,
Virgil included, the absence of detail enabling him in general to avoid the points in
which they differ. There is however quite enough to distinguish him from them, or
from any other writer professing to be a poet. When the heroes get into the horse,
he takes the opportunity of telling us the personal characteristics of the leading
Greeks, in lines like these:&mdash;
<pb n="110"/>
<quote lang="greek"><l>*ka/lxas mikro\s e)/hn, lepto/s, leuko/s, dasuxai/ths,</l>

</quote></p>
<p>This he may have borrowed from Dares Phrygius, whose work, as we now have it,
abounds in notices of the sort. But he is probably original when he says that he
cannot tell what was the precise occasion on which Ulysses fell temporarily into
the hands of the Trojans, his attention to the incident having been distracted by
the cruel treatment he received from <quote>the crafty wife of Isaac,</quote> or when he censures
Tryphiodorus for talking of the horse as crowned with flowers when it was the depth
of winter, and professes that he, Tzetzes, had been taught by Orpheus never to tell a
falsehood. But it is an insult to <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> even to mention such absurdities in connexion
with the Second Book of the Aeneid.</p>
<p>A curious critique of Virgil's narrative from a military point of view by Napoleon I.
may be found in an abridged form in the Classical Museum, vol. i. pp. 205 foll. It is
needless to say that the story does not stand a test which it was never meant to stand:
much of the Emperor's censure however falls really, not on Virgil, but on the legend
which, as we have seen, he necessarily followed.</p>

Serv., rightly, as is shown by the parallel
v. 189, and by the passage from Attius
quoted on v. 17, from which Virg. doubtless
took the words. The epithet <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">innuptae,</q>
which is rather in the Homeric style
than appropriate to anything in the context,
makes it likely that he was referring
also to Eur. Tro. 536, <foreign lang="greek">xa/rin a)/zugos a)brotopw/lou</foreign>,
which according to the ordinary
interpretation is understood in precisely
the same way, though Hermann questions
the applicability of <foreign lang="greek">a)brotopw/lou</foreign> to the
goddess, and supposes <foreign lang="greek">a)/zuc a)broto/pwlos</foreign>
to be the horse. The offering was made
to Minerva as one of the tutelary deities of
Troy, whom the Greeks had outraged, and
as such it was virtually an offering to <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>
and the Trojans&mdash;a consideration which
reconciles the present passage with those

Rom. unfortunately fails us here,

frequently repeats himself (probably with
the notion of imitating Hom.), and equally
certain that the inferior MSS. frequently
introduce lines from other parts of the

originally and Ribbeck adopts it. But the
enumeration would be jejune, and the
epithet <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">dulcis</q> is tender and natural.
Comp. 4. 33, <bibl n="Verg. G. 2.523">G. 2. 523</bibl>. <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Natos</q> presents
a difficulty from the age of Sinon, who is
said to have been sent to the war <quote lang="la">primis
ab annis,</quote> v. 87 (note). The notion that
Virg. intentionally makes Sinon contradict
himself is not to be thought of; while
Henry's interpretation <q direct="unspecified">the sons and the
father,</q> i. e. my father and his sons, is
equally impossible, and not to be defended
from 4. 605., 6. 116, where the context at
once fixes the sense. Had there been any
object in reading <q direct="unspecified">exoptatamque,</q> we
might have explained <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">parentem</q> with reference
to <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">natos;</q> but the reverse process
in a context like this is not so easy. Either
we must suppose an oversight, or say that
Sinon, though sent out early (the time,
as remarked in note on v. 87, being probably
fixed with reference to the Roman
age for service), may yet have been married.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Fors et</lemma> is the reading of Med.,

however the structure of the sentence
gives more scope for such a construction,
which here could only be explained by
reference to the use of <foreign lang="greek">poina\s</foreign> in Greek.

probably have other instances of the kind

after <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">reposco,</q> which is found 7. 606, for
Burm.'s remark, adopted by Heyne, that

<div2 type="commline" n="199">
<p>The story of Laocoon appears to
have been variously related. See Introduction
to this book. Euphorion apud Serv.
agrees mainly with Virg., except that Laocoon's
real offence is said to have been a
forbidden marriage; and so Hyginus, who
treats the notion of any other crime as a
delusion of the Trojans. Heyne thinks it
probable that Virg. may expressly have
copied Euphorion, whom he is known to
have admired (see <bibl n="Verg. Ecl. 6">E. 6. 72</bibl>., 10. 50). Of
Sophocles' tragedy of Laocoon but very
few fragments have been preserved: from
one of them however (fr. 343, Nauck) it
appears that his story must have differed
from Virg.'s, as the flight of Aeneas with
his father and a body of Trojan emigrants
is distinctly mentioned, so that the hero
of the play can hardly have died before
the taking of the city. Serv. has a
strange notice of Bacchylides, who, he
says, speaks of Laocoon and his wife, or
the serpents which came from the Calydnae
islands and were turned into men
(<quote lang="la">in homines conversis</quote> might conceivably
mean <q direct="unspecified">attacking men</q>); but the
passage may be corrupt. For fuller details
of these legends see Heyne's Excursus.

treatise.</p>

to sacrifice to <seg lang="la">Neptune, in place</seg> of

rightly remark on the propriety of the

in which Laocoon was engaged by a
kind of tragic <foreign lang="greek">ei)rwnei/a</foreign>. The simile is partially
imitated from Il. 20. 403, where the
bull is being offered to Poseidon. For a
victim to escape from the altar, or to bellow
when struck, was a bad omen, as we
learn from Paulus Diaconus (ap. Cerdam).

equivalent to <quote>salus reipublicae.</quote> In this
way most of the commentators understand
it here, taking <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">quo loco</q> for <quote lang="la">quo statu,</quote>
as in Hor. 1 Ep. 12. 25, <quote lang="la">quo sit Romana
loco res,</quote> and A. 9. 723, <quote lang="la">quo sit fortuna
loco.</quote> There is however much to be said
for supposing the reference to be military,
as suggested by Trapp and enforced by
Henry (who has since changed his mind),
comparing Livy 23. 49, <quote lang="la">Eodem et duo
duces et duo exercitus Karthaginiensium,
ibi rem summam agi cernentes, convenerunt.</quote>
Virg. himself twice uses <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">belli

the latter place speaking of Latium, <quote lang="la">Hoc

The question then would be, <q direct="unspecified">in what

a natural inquiry for Aeneas, who
had just expressed his ardour <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">glomerare

the whole however it seems more likely
that Aeneas, who has as yet seen no one,
should ask first a general question about
<pb n="143"/>
the safety of the city, and then a special
one about the citadel, so that after much
hesitation I follow Henry in returning to
the common view. <quote lang="la">Arx</quote> is used in its
proper sense, a citadel, or point of defence,
though <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">quam</q> seems to show that the
word is not meant to be restricted to the

interpretation of <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">quam</q> for <quote lang="la">quomodo</quote>
would not yield an appropriate sense.
Aeneas sees Panthus hurrying away from
the citadel with his gods and his grandson,
and so naturally asks, <q direct="unspecified">What citadel
are we occupying?</q> or <q direct="unspecified">have we occupied?</q>
suspecting already that Pergamus
is no longer tenable. Henry well remarks
that Panthus answers in effect, <q direct="unspecified">We have
no citadel anywhere to defend,</q> and that
Aeneas, hearing this, rushes out with
no definite object in the direction of the

note. Coroebus, son of Mydon (Il. 3. 184),

personage. The legend seems to
have agreed about his history, but not
about his death, which was generally
ascribed to Neoptolemus, by Lesches to
Diomedes, and by Virg., or the authority
whom he followed (v. 425), to Peneleus.
He is mentioned by Euripides (?), Rhes.
539. Euphorion (see on v. 199) represented
him as a fool, probably to give
individuality to the character, as later
writers perverted the Homeric conceptions
of Menelaus, Ulysses, &amp;c.; and this view
became traditional, Zenobius making him
a sort of gigantic idiot who would stand
counting the waves of the sea, Aristides
(Platon. 2) contrasting him and Palamades
as the two extremes, and Aelian (Var.
<pb n="145"/>
Hist. 13. 15) enumerating him among
extraordinary fools. Cerda, who has collected
these authorities, also mentions a
proverb, <foreign lang="greek">h)liqiw/teros *koroi/bou</foreign>. In Virg.'s
conception there is merely impetuosity and
light-heartedness. The story of the love

read <q direct="unspecified">Androgei</q> v. 392, and Charisius (1.
15, p. 92, Keil) agrees with them, though
in 6. 20 he declares that Virg. wrote
<q direct="unspecified">Androgeo,</q> which seems now to be found
only in some cursive MSS. In v. 425 the

<quote>Demoleus;</quote> Rom. and Pal. <quote lang="la">Demoleos,</quote>

The MSS. are constantly varying in the
spelling of proper names, and it does not
seem probable that Virg. would designedly
have alternated between two forms of the
same word within a few lines of each other,
nor yet that a bon&acirc; fide tradition of his
variety of practice in this respect can have
come down to the grammarians. Reason
would seem in favour of <q direct="unspecified">Androgeos,</q>
<q direct="unspecified">Androgeo,</q> as the Greek form would be
<foreign lang="greek">*)androge/ws</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">*)andro/gaios</foreign>, like <foreign lang="greek">*menele/ws</foreign>

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Sensit delapsus</lemma> is a familiar

stands instead of the object of the
verb. The principle is the same as that of
prolepsis, and is exemplified also in such
expressions as <quote lang="la">ostendit se dextra,</quote> v. 388.

the verb, <quote>he perceived as a man perceives

difference between the nom. and the acc.

all, e. g. <quote lang="la">gaudent perfusi sanguine fratrum,</quote>
<bibl n="Verg. G. 2.510">G. 2. 510</bibl>, where the use of the
nom. appears quite natural, and the object

The use of the nom. with <quote lang="la">esse,</quote>
as in Hor. 3 Od. 27. 73, <quote lang="la">Uxor invicti
Iovis esse nescis,</quote> is not to be confounded
with it, as there an attraction does take
place, or rather perhaps a confusion between
the two modes of expression. It is

shown by any of the leaders of the Greeks:

<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Invitis</q> seems to express that the gods
are not willing to be trusted, as if by
taking advantage of a turn of fortune and

force to the whole context which it would
not otherwise possess, the fate of the disguised
Trojans being treated as a visitation
from the gods for presuming on their aid,
or attempting to gain it when it was not
to be given. If Serv.'s explanation of v.
396 could be substantiated, the meaning
would be more definite; but the passage
does not require such a hypothesis. We
should bear in mind the prominence given
throughout this book to the agency of the
gods; the Trojans are blinded by the gods
so as to take in the horse: Aeneas rushes
out in desperation on hearing that the gods
have declared against <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, v. 336; his
very words to his companions, vv. 350 foll.,
contrast ominously with those of Coroebus,
v. 387, the one bidding them accept the
doom of the vanquished, <quote lang="la">Una salus victis
nullam sperare salutem,</quote> the other urging
them to avail themselves of the first omen of
safety and convert it into a certainty. They
are punished; and Aeneas, after witnessing
the fate of Priam, is caused by Venus to see
the gods visibly arrayed against his country.

<p>The Cyclic poets, as appears from

Cassandra as dragged from the temple of
Pallas by Ajax, the son of Oileus, who
dragged away also the statue of the goddess

the Greeks would have stoned him had not
he himself taken sanctuary, and his trial
before the kings for the crime was the
subject of paintings in the Poecile at
Athens and at Delphi. The story is also
referred to by Eur. Tro. 69 foll., where it
is said that the Greeks took no notice of

<p>The following simile is modelled,

The point however is not the same: Hector
is waiting for an attack, while Pyrrhus
is himself the assailant, and the bodily
motion of the serpent, which in the Homeric
image merely implies readiness for
conflict, is combined by Virg. with its
having renewed its youth, so as to make
it a fit symbol of the <q direct="unspecified">new warrior</q>

Helen lurking in the temple of Vesta. I
was doubting whether to kill her&mdash;it
seemed monstrous that she should enjoy
a safe and triumphant return, after all
the misery she had brought on us and
ours.</q> Like the four lines prefixed to the
Aeneid, this passage is traditionally said
to have been written by Virg., but omitted
by Tucca and Varius. The external evidence
against its genuineness is strong,
stronger than against the genuineness of
the former passage, the MSS. which contain
the lines now in question being very
few, and apparently none of them of great
importance. The early interpreters do not
comment on them, though their existence
is recognized by a doubtful notice in Serv.,
which is the chief authority for the Tucca
and Varius story. But when we come to
internal considerations, the case is altered.
The lines, though possibly disfigured by a
few harshnesses, are vigorous and elaborate,
and in general worthy of Virg. They
are perhaps not required by the context,
as v. 601 might be explained without
them, and the appearance of Venus could
be accounted for by supposing with Donatus
that Aeneas was meditating suicide;
but the context is improved by their presence,
and v. 589, as Wagn. has pointed
out, coheres rather awkwardly with v.
566. The aesthetical or ethical objection
that has been taken to them, as if Virg.
would not have made his hero think of
killing a woman in a temple, seems to belong
to a later age (see on v. 583), nor
need the discrepancy between the present
<pb n="167"/>
account of Helen and what we read 6. 510
foll. about her introducing the Greeks to
the chamber of Deiphobus disturb us much,
at the same time that one or both reasons
may have led to their exclusion on critical
grounds, whether by Tucca and Varius, or
by some less authorized regulator of Virg.'s
text. The external evidence however seems
to me too formidably strong to be summarily
ignored, so that I have followed the
earlier editors, who enclose the passage in
brackets, rather than the bulk of the later,
who print it as an unquestioned part of
the text. Where possibilities are so many
and facts so few, an attitude of doubt seems
the only one which can be safely assumed,
except by those, who, like Jahn and Peerlkamp,
condemn the lines unreservedly, on
internal as well as external grounds.</p>

<p>observing at the same time that what in
Aeneas, the hero, is a mere passing impulse,
is deliberately resolved on by
Arruns, the coward. Arruns' cowardice
however is shown not by his wishing to
kill Camilla, but by his not daring to confront
her, his disclaimer of a desire for
spoils meaning that his object is not to
conquer her, but simply to take her life;
and the feeling of Aeneas answers exactly
to that of Pylades, Eur. Or. 1131 foll.,
who argues that it would be dishonourable
to put a virtuous woman to death,
but a worthy deed to execute vengeance
on Helen. Both expression and thought

as an argument against the whole passage;

it would naturally emit&mdash;a view agreeing

as he suggests with reference to <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">levis</q>) of
Ascanius' head. The latter would be supported
by 10. 270, <quote lang="la">ardet apex capiti,</quote>
the <q direct="unspecified">apox</q> there being the crest of the
helmet which Aeneas happened to be
wearing: the former has the authority of
Ovid, who three times (F. 6. 636, M. 10.
279, Pont. 4. 9. 54) uses <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">apex</q> of a
point or spire of flame, and agrees with
Val. Fl. 3. 188, where <quote lang="la">frontis apex</quote>
seems to mean a luminous halo or star on
the brow of Castor. This evidence in
favour of a special use is to a certain extent
confirmed by the language of the
present passage, by the epithet <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">levis</q> and
the words <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">summo de vertice,</q> which do
not agree equally well with Henry's
view, as in that case <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">apex</q> and <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Iuli</q>
could hardly be separated. The tautology
between <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">fundere lumen apex</q> (as explained
of the flame) and <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">lambere flamma
comas,</q> of which he complains, is not unVirgilian.
It is singular that there should
be two passages in later poets, one (Claud.
4 Cons. Hon. 192 foll.) alluding to, the
other (Sil. 16. 119 foll.) modelled on, the
present, in both of which the same doubt
might be raised as here. A third interpretation,
dating from Serv. and adopted
by Burm., and more recently by Schirach,
supposes the <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">apex</q> to be the Phrygian
cap or mitre which Ascanius may have
worn, as it is specially used of the cap
worn by the <quote>flamines</quote> and <quote lang="la">salii</quote> at
Rome (see 8. 664, and Dict. A. <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Apex</q>),
which Serv. says Ascanius himself was the
first to introduce at Alba: but the whole
description seems to show that at this
time at least his head was bare. The parallel
instance in Roman legend, which
doubtless was in Virg.'s mind, is the
blazing of the hair of Servius Tullius when
a boy, for which see Livy 1. 39. The appearance,
wherever it was seen, was supposed
to be an omen of future greatness,
perhaps of royal dignity, so that here it
points out Ascanius as a future king, and
shows that the house of Aeneas is destined
to survive. Virg. also had in view <cit><bibl n="Apollon. 3.1017">Apoll.

probably representing the parent text from

may be doubted whether the fact that

<div2 type="Introduction" n="intro">
<p>IN the Third Book <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> treads yet more closely in the steps of Homer, the subject
being the wanderings of Aeneas, as that of the Ninth and three following books of the
Odyssey is the wanderings of Ulysses. The time embraced by the present narrative is
not much shorter than that comprehended by its prototype: indeed, it is considerably
longer, as of Ulysses' ten years seven are spent with Calypso, and of these we have no
record: but <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> felt that the second narrator must be briefer than the first, and
accordingly contracted his story into a single book. To a certain extent it was almost
necessary that there should be a coincidence in the details of the two accounts as well
as in the original plan. The mythical geography of <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName> had become part of the
epic commonplace, though, like the mythical history, it was modified freely, not followed
servilely: and as Aeneas was wandering in the same parts as Ulysses, and at the
same time, it would have been unnatural to make their experiences altogether independent
and dissimilar. Yet the only place in which the two lines of adventure actually
touch is when they enter the country of the Cyclops: and there <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> has skilfully
contrived not to rival Homer's story, but to appropriate it, and to make Aeneas
reap the fruit of Ulysses' experience without being obliged to repeat it in his own person.
For his other incidents he is indebted partly to other portions of the body of
heroic legend, partly to his own invention. Polydorus is from the Greek drama; the
bleeding myrtle however may be Virgil's own, though Heyne, with a judicial <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">videtur,</q>
gives the credit of it to the Cyclic poets: the adventure with the Harpies was
suggested by Apollonius, who also, as we have seen in the general Introduction, gave
hints for the predictions of Helenus and the deliverance of Achemenides: other legends,
noticed in Heyne's first Excursus, seem to have given the outline of the voyage, indicating
the several places touched at. The mistakes made in searching for the new
kingdom, the scene at Delos, the appearance of the Penates, the meeting with Andromache,
seem all to be more or less original. Segrais notes that the interest of the book
has suffered from its position between two of the noblest portions of the poem: and
Heyne observes that it is not generally appreciated because the reader does not possess
adequate knowledge of the minute particulars of legendary history, geography, and
antiquities which the poet has indicated by transient and remote allusions.</p>
<p>Heyne has been at the pains to distinguish the seven years over which <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> distributes
his hero's wanderings. <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, according to the almost universal tradition, was
taken in the summer. The winter of this year, which counts as the first of the seven,
is spent by Aeneas in those preparations of which we read vv. 5 foll. He sails in the
spring or summer of the second year (v. 8), and spends the winter in Thrace, where he
builds a city. The tragedy of Polydorus drives him away in the spring of the third
year (v. 69). He goes to Delos and thence to Crete. Two years are supposed to be
<pb n="192"/>
consumed in his unfortunate attempt at colonization. His stay at Actium brings him
to the end of the fifth year (v. 284). The sixth year is spent partly in Epirus, partly
in Sicily. In the summer of the seventh year he arrives at Carthage (1. 755), leaving
probably as winter is drawing on, though there is some difficulty in reconciling the
language used by <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> in different places. Dido talks about storms and winter while
Aeneas is yet at Carthage (4. 309): Beroe speaks of the seventh summer as still going
on after they have returned to Sicily (5. 626): but some exaggeration may be allowed
in the mouth of the former, and in the case of the latter the difficulty may be removed
by pressing the sense of <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">vertitur,</q> which seems to mean that summer in its revolution
is becoming winter.</p>
<p>Ingenious and plausible as this division is, it overlooks an important question, which
appears only to have occurred quite recently to the critics of Virgil, but, when once
entertained, is not easily dismissed. The Aeneid is known to have been left incomplete:
are we right in treating it as a complete poem, and reconciling all the passages in
the narrative in which the same thing is differently spoken of, rather than allowing for
the existence of discrepancies? In particular, can we safely assume that the books of
the Aeneid were all composed in the order in which they now stand? This last question
has been pressed home forcibly by a German scholar, Conrads, in a short treatise
called <q direct="unspecified">Quaestiones Virgilianae,</q> which appeared at Treves in <date value="1863">1863</date>. He believes that
when <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> wrote the present book he intended Aeneas' wanderings to occupy not
more than two or three years, which would agree with the account given by other
authorities, or, as Heyne chooses to call it, the <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">fides historiae.</q> This would certainly
seem more natural on a view of the narrative as it stands, since the only marks of time
which it contains subsequently to the notice of the departure of the Trojans, are vv. 69
foll., which may point to the opening of a new year, and vv. 284 foll., which distinctly
speak of winter. The suggestion having been once made that this book was written
independently of the rest, we readily see how much there is to confirm it. A difficulty
has always been felt about Creusa's mention of Hesperia, Book 2. 781, as contrasted
with Aeneas' ignorance on the subject during the early part of his wanderings: the
prophecy of Celaeno is in effect another version of the prophecy of Anchises (Book 7.
124 foll.), with which it is scarcely reconcilable: and the predictions of Helenus about
the white sow and the information to be received from the Sibyl are either inconsistent
with or unaccountably independent of what actually happens in the course of the
story. Whether the Third Book represents Virgil's earliest or latest thoughts is of
course a question: but that it is not homogeneous with those which precede and follow
it can hardly, I think, be denied.</p></div2>

<p>In Hom. Polydorus, Priam's
youngest son, is killed by Achilles when
he returns to the battle after the death of
Patroclus (Il. 20. 407 foll.). Other traditions
represented him as entrusted to
Polymestor, king of Thrace, who broke
the ties of hospitality and practised on his
life; but the details of the story differed
considerably, Euripides in the Hecuba
agreeing in the main with Virg. (see on v.
22), Hyginus (fab. 109, 240) making Polymestor
instead kill his own son by mistake,
while Dictys (2. 18, 22, 27) speaks of

points more keenly as the shafts grew into
a wood, and the whole became incorporated
with his body. Euripides makes no
mention of this portent in his version of
the story of Polydorus. We cannot tell

it is evidently meant to express what

There is a difficulty however in determining
whether Aeneas is reflecting on a story
which he knew already, or receiving a new
communication, doubtless from Polydorus
himself. The language would rather be
in favour of the former; but if Aeneas
had known the story, he would hardly
have landed in Thrace, and v. 60 seems to
show that it was not until informed by

as referring not to Priam's end or to his

of his son. Surely however an interpretation
so restricted impairs the nature
and poetical truth of the passage. Aeneas
has just finished his narrative of the sack
of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>; and neither he nor Dido could
associate the name of Priam with any
other thought than that of unhappiness,

<p>Anius was a mythical person, whose
story was differently told: see Dict. Biog.
One account was that Lavinia, the wife of
Aeneas, was his daughter, and like him, a
prophetess. He was himself represented
by some as the son of Creusa. His friendship
with Anchises is explained by the
legend that Anchises had consulted him in
former years whether he should go with
Priam to Salamis to recover Hesione. We
may perhaps wonder that Virg. should
have mentioned him so slightly. Ovid, in
the resum&eacute; of Aeneas' voyage which occupies
parts of Books 13 and 14 of the
Metamorphoses, introduces him more at
length (13. 631&mdash;703), giving a conversation
between him and Anchises, and describing
in detail the presents which he
and his guests exchanged at parting.

<p>The natural meaning of the words
would seem to be that Iasius was the father
of Dardanus, and the ultimate progenitor
of the Trojan race. No tradition however
appears to favour this view: and Virg.
himself in 7. 219 apparently follows the
Homeric story (Il. 20. 215), which makes
Dardanus the son of Zeus. The legends
vary (see Dict. Biog. Dardanus, Iasion):
but those which assert a connexion between
Dardanus and Iasion or Iasius make them
brothers. This also might be reconciled
with the text, which would then mean that
the brothers sprung from Italy, and that
Iasius, one of them, was the father of the
Trojans. Here again however we should
be at issue with the legends, and with
Virg.'s language elsewhere, which speak of
Dardanus as the author of the race, Iasius
having settled, not in Phrygia, but in
Samothrace. If then we wish to make
Virgil consistent with himself, and with
the line of tradition which he seems to
have followed, we must suppose him to
use <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">pater</q> rather vaguely, and to intend
<q direct="unspecified">a quo</q> to refer to Dardanus. But the
language is certainly against this; and
those who prefer to consider that he has
attributed to Iasius what is elsewhere
attributed to Dardanus may perhaps fortify
themselves by appealing to 7. 208,
where not Iasius but Dardanus is said to

other names here are names of islands.
Mela 2. 7 mentions Neritos among the

Sil. 15. 305, who however as evidently

<p>The name of Abas, an early king
of Argos, son of Lynceus and Hypermnestra,
is connected in legends with a
shield, which obtained victory even after
his death (Dict. Biog., following Serv. on
this passage). This shield appears to have
been fastened up in the temple of Here at
Argos, that the conqueror in the games
celebrated there might bear it in procession.
Another story, also mentioned by
Serv., made Abas the inventor of the
shield. Virg. can hardly be thinking of
this mythical person, whose date would
involve an anachronism here, though it is
singular that the words <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">de Danais victoribus,</q>
v. 289, coincide with the pedigree
of the shield, which is said originally to
have belonged to his grandfather Danaus,
while the story about the games again
seems as if it might be glanced at in the
Actian games just mentioned, as if Aeneas
were bearding the old hero on his own
ground. But for these coincidences, the
Abas of the present passage would be to
us merely the name of some unknown
Grecian warrior whom Aeneas had slain
at some time or other, and whose shield
he hangs up on Grecian soil as a crowning
act of triumphant joy after an unmolested
sojourn there. Ov. M. 15. 664 talks of the

Serv. Wagn. examines this dictum in an
excursus on 12. 609&mdash;613, ending by accepting
it in a very limited sense, as applying
to the supposed case of a <seg lang="la">bona fide</seg> participle
in the nominative terminating a
paragraph, of which he finds no example
in Virg., and which he thinks objectionable
on account of the weakness of such a termination.
The question is one of some
interest, but belongs perhaps more properly
to a treatise on Latin composition
than to a commentary on a Latin poet.
Serv. is evidently wrong at the outset in
the distinction which he takes between
Latin and Greek poetry, as if the offending
participle were more to be condemned in
the case of the latter than in that of the
former. The present participle at any rate
is known to be much more idiomatic in
Greek than in Latin. Hom. says in one
of his most wonderful passages (Il. 6. 201)
<foreign lang="greek">h)/toi o( ka\p pedi/on to\ *)alh/i+on ou)=os a)la=to,
*(\on qumo\n kate/dwn, pa/ton a)nqrw/pwn a)leei/nwn</foreign>.
Cicero renders it nearly verbally
(Tusc. 3. 26) <quote lang="la">qui miser in campis maerens
errabat Aleis, Ipse suum cor edens,
hominum vestigia vitans;</quote> and we at
once feel the difference. As a matter of
fact, one book of the Iliad (the 18th), and
two of the Odyssey (the 5th and the 15th)
end with the obnoxious participle.

other MSS., supported by the testimony

The external authority for the accusative

<q direct="unspecified">Andromachen</q> by fragm. Vat., and the

an unfeeling reproach to Andromache,
understood as it must be with
Wagn., <quote lang="la">tune, Hectoris coniunx, in Pyrrhi,

venisti?</quote>&mdash;a reproach, too, which
would be unmeaning in itself, as Aeneas
well knew that Andromache had become
Pyrrhus' captive, and therefore, according
to the Homeric usage, his concubine, and
inconsistent with the previous context, as
though Aeneas finds the rumour of Helenus'
good fortune incredible, he nevertheless
assumes its truth in action (v. 299).
The force of these objections might be to a
certain extent abated; but enough would
remain to make the passage as commonly
read difficult and awkward. If we accept
the accusative, all is clear: Aeneas asks,
as Henry remarks, <q direct="unspecified">In what condition do
I find Hector's wife?</q> the second clause
going beyond the first, and referring to
the report of her new prosperity, while in
the third he inquires whether she is <emph>still</emph>
united to Pyrrhus, in other words, whether
the report is a false one. <q direct="unspecified">Hectoris Andromachen</q>

such as would occur to her on the moment

are precisely what might be spoken under

wondering whether the separation had
really entailed a breach in their love of

danger to the sacrificer; though perhaps
the meaning may be that he would become
confused or break off the sacrifice. The
prohibition <quote lang="la">Absint profani</quote> is supposed
to be connected with the same observance.
If we may trust Serv., Virg. is not only
accounting for a Roman custom, but glancing
at a Trojan legend, to the effect that
Diomede, being ordered by an oracle to
restore the Palladium, came upon Aeneas
while sacrificing, that Aeneas did not interrupt
his worship, and that the restoration

The question seems to lie between

been forms used in classical Latin, Cic.
Arat. v. 152 having <quote lang="la">pistricis,</quote> while
<quote>pristim</quote> occurs 10. 211. On internal
grounds it might seem more probable that
Virg. should have written <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">pristis,</q> as there
is no passage in the Aeneid which requires
the form in <q direct="unspecified">x,</q> while there are several (5.
116, 156., 10. 211) which do not admit it.
The external authority however is strongly
for <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">pistrix,</q> only inferior MSS. being cited
for <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">pristis;</q> and as the question seems
not to be one of mere orthography, it is
better to adopt the better attested word.
The notion that Virg. was likely to have
given the more colloquial name to the ship,
the less colloquial to the actual fish, is
refuted by the passage in Book 10. The
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">pistrix</q> was a great fish, which Pliny (9.

length.</p>

<p>This line is a further description

more than <quote lang="la">piscium.</quote> Virg. calls the fishy
part <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">pistrix</q> and <q direct="unspecified">delphin</q> indifferently,

graphic, not prosaically general, as he
speaks of the material of the Trojan

Helenus and Andromache are congratulated

i. e. on having done with chance

fortune and fate are looked upon not as
the constituents of human life, but as
disturbing agencies. Or we may say that

enough to have intended a special reference

have been found by the commentators in
the founding of Nicopolis by Octavianus

seems more likely to have been intended,
as the event was recent, and the compliment
one which Virg. would be glad to
pay, while the transaction itself would be
more flattering to the national vanity of

been proposed fail to commend themselves.
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Sortiti remos</q> would be a harsh expression
for <q direct="unspecified">casting lots who was to remain

<p>This and the two following
lines are condemned by Heyne and removed
from the text by Wagn.; they are however

sense, viz. that in the extremity of their
fear the Trojans remembered Helenus'
warning about Scylla and Charybdis, and
feeling that to be a greater danger even
than the Cyclops, resolved to put back
again, when the north wind sprung up and
carried them into safety; but the processes
which have been devised for getting that
sense from the words are sufficiently
various. On the whole the punctuation
which gives the best sense seems to be
that suggested by Vulpius on Tibull. 4. 1.
70 (after a hint of Serv.) and followed by
Heyne and Henry, though there is still
room for some difference of opinion on
details of interpretation. Taking <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">ni</q> in
the sense of <quote lang="la">ne</quote> and regarding <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">utramque
viam</q> as in opposition to <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">cursus,</q> or,
better perhaps, as a kind of cognate accusative
expressing the effect of <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">teneant
cursus</q> (see on <bibl n="Verg. G. 3.41">G. 3. 41</bibl>), I would translate
<q direct="unspecified">On the other hand, the injunctions of
Helenus warn us not to hold on our way
between Scylla and Charybdis&mdash;either passage
a hair's breadth remove from death:
so we resolve on sailing back again.</q> The
construction <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">leti discrimine parvo</q> is
fixed by the parallel 9. 143, where the
words recur (as also in Ov. M. 7. 426),
and by the similar expression <quote lang="la">tenui discrimine
leti</quote> 10. 511, so that it will be a
descriptive ablative. <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Utramque viam</q>
may refer to the two passages, the one
nearer to Scylla, the other to Charybdis,
both of which were taken by Ulysses&mdash;or
it may be only a poetical way of describing
the one passage as dangerous on both sides.
The use of <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">ni</q> for <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">ne</q> is supported by
Donatus and Serv., and has vouchers in
inscriptions and fragments of lost writings
(see Forc.), while it is perhaps to be retained
in such passages as <bibl n="Pl. Men. 1.2">Plaut. Men. 1. 2. 1</bibl>.

<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Lintea</q> does not occur elsewhere in Virg.;

who quotes them twice, 15. 2, and 18. 79.
The chief difficulty perhaps is in <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">teneant,</q>
for which we should have expected <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">teneamus,</q>
as <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">praecipites</q> v. 682 points to
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">nos</q> rather than to <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">socios.</q> The meaning
may conceivably be that Aeneas' companions

The history of such passages as
the supposed exordium of Book 1 and the
episode of Helen in Book 2 shows that the
early grammarians were jealous of interpolations
in Virg.'s text, one recension being
in fact a check upon another, so that intrinsic
considerations require to be strong

Aeneas speak as he himself would have

the narrative and the time of the poem.
A poet with his mind full of the literary
and historical interest of his subject is
perhaps not unlikely to allow the expression
of that feeling to escape him even at
the most inappropriate time. We may
remember how gladly he avails himself of
the prophetic power of Anchises in Book 6
to contrast the small beginnings of Italy
with its subsequent greatness (6. 766),

<div2 type="Introduction" n="intro">
<p>ON the fourth Book of the Aeneid little remains to be added to what has been already
said in the general Introduction. Its subject has made it the most attractive, perhaps
the most celebrated, part of the poem: it has provoked much controversy, and that of
a kind which has an interest, not only for the scholar, but for the general reader; much
of it has been supposed to be borrowed from a particular Greek writer, whose work
happens to be preserved: it is the most dramatic portion of the Aeneid, and as such
may be viewed in relation to the masterpieces of Greek dramatic art. These are all
points which appear to belong to the sphere of Virgilian criticism in general, whether
aesthetic or antiquarian; and it seemed natural to discuss them in that connexion. For
the questions then of Aeneas' treatment of Dido, of Virgil's obligations to Apollonius
Rhodius, and of his relations, general and special, to the Greek drama, I must refer
my readers to what I have said already.</p>
<p>Naevius, as has been remarked in the general Introduction, is supposed to have
preceded <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> in the anachronism of bringing Aeneas and Dido together. As
this fact is itself a matter of inference, we cannot of course tell whether he made their
parting tragical or otherwise. All that we know connecting Naevius with the story
of this book is that he mentioned Anna, Dido's sister, who appears now in <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> for
the first time. How this personage came to be complicated with the legendary history
of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> is not clear; her name however, which is Carthaginian, like Hanno, Hannibal,
&amp;c., led to her identification with Anna Perenna, the Roman goddess of the year,
and Ovid (Fasti, 3. 523 foll.) recounts or invents a story of her following Aeneas to
Italy. In <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> she is merely the confidante of the heroine, a character which has
become a stock one at certain periods of the history of the drama, especially since the
chorus came to be excluded from the action. In other respects <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> would seem
simply to have taken the traditional story of Dido, and modified it as was required by
the necessity of blending her destiny with that of Aeneas. According to the most
detailed accounts, as epitomized in the Dictionary of Biography, Dido's early history
up to the time of her landing in Africa coincides substantially with that narrated by
Venus to Aeneas in Book 1; afterwards she is persecuted by her neighbour, King
Iarbas, who demands her hand; she resolves to avoid him by death, erects a funeral
pile under the pretence of a sacrifice to propitiate her former husband, and kills herself
there. <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> turns the loveless queen into a passionate lover, keeping however the
groundwork of the character, devotion to the memory of her murdered lord, which is
<pb n="259"/>
only overcome by Venus' express agency, and even then from time to time struggles
and resists. Iarbas is naturally made to recede into the distance; his anger contributes
to darken the prospect of Dido's desolation, but is in no sense the motive cause of her
death. The mode of her death is borrowed from the traditional story, and the fact of
her resorting to a pretext to conceal her purpose; but as the reason for her death is
different, the pretext is different also. In filling up the picture which he has sketched
Virgil is indebted partly to Apollonius, though, as I have remarked elsewhere, not to
such an extent as to deprive him of the praise of originality, partly perhaps to the
Ajax of Sophocles.</p>
<p>Virgil's power is nowhere more conspicuously shown than in the lines describing the
horrors which drive Dido to her fatal purpose (vv. 450&mdash;473). Some remarks on the
details of the description will be found in the Commentary.</p></div2>

fact is, as I have satisfied myself by observation,
that the sheep, until it has
attained the age of one year, has a set of
eight primary or milk teeth: when the
age of one year has been attained, the two
central of these eight teeth drop out, and
are replaced by the first two teeth of the
second or permanent set, which being very
large and conspicuous among the six remaining
milk teeth (originally much
smaller, and now greatly diminished by
use and absorption), the animal at first
sight appears to have only two teeth (sheep
never having any teeth at all in the upper
jaw): hence the appellation <q direct="unspecified">bidens.</q> This
condition of the teeth continues during
the whole of the second year, at the end
of which, i. e. when the sheep is two years
old complete, two more of the milk teeth
drop, and are replaced by two large permanent
teeth exactly similar to, and one
on each side of, the two first; so that from
the completion of the second year till the
beginning of the third the sheep appears
to have a set of four large teeth, and is no

<p>Ceres, Apollo, and Bacchus are propitiated

Stat. 1 Silv. 2. 219 foll., of Bacchus and
Apollo, and Himerius, Orat. 1. 3, of Apollo.
Possibly they may also be invoked as gods
of the new colony, to further the political
union between the Carthaginians and the
Trojans. The epithet <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">legiferae</q> (a translation
of <foreign lang="greek">qesmofo/ros</foreign>, a title of Demeter,
Hdt. 6. 91 &amp;c.) points that way: Apollo
again is known to have been celebrated as
the founder of cities (Dict. B. <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Apollo</q>),
and Dionysus like Demeter was called
<foreign lang="greek">qesmofo/ros</foreign> (Orph. H. 41. 1). Heyne goes
farther, and attempts to show that these
three divinities, like Juno, had a special
relation to Carthage. Serv. accumulates
a number of heterogeneous reasons for
their introduction here, which are not
worth quoting: he has preserved however
two lines of Calvus, which illustrate the
mention of Ceres:</p>
<p><quote lang="la">Et leges sanctas docuit, et cara iugavit
Corpora connubiis, et magnas condidit
urbes.</quote></p>
<p>There is a tantalizing passage in Macrob.
Sat. 3. 12, where one of the speakers asks
another whether he does not think Virgil
has committed a great mistake here, in
first saying <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">mactant&mdash;Lyaeo,</q> and then
as it were recollecting himself and adding
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Iunoni&mdash;curae,</q> a question which is followed
by no answer or explanation of any
sort, so that there is evidently a lacuna.
For <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">legiferae</q> Rom., fragm. Vat. a m. pr.,

<p>We need not press the attribute

The libation was preliminary to the sacrifice:
comp. 6. 244. Serv. on the latter
passage says this was done to try the
fitness of the victims&mdash;<quote lang="la">ut, si non stupuerint,
aptae probentur.</quote> In Hom. the
wine seems to have been poured either
on the burning flesh of the victims (Il.

295, 300). Lersch (Antiqq. Vergg. p.

sacrifice performed a sort of slow dance
before the altar with torches in their
hands; and the early editors follow him,
referring to Hor. A. P. 232, <quote lang="la">Ut festis

<p>Wagn. seems more successful in
his attempt to fix a ceremonial sense in

(see on <bibl n="Verg. G. 3.527">G. 3. 527</bibl>), with which he couples
it. The account of this peculiar meaning
would appear to be that stated recurrence
is a notion so inseparably connected with
any thing ritual, that recurring celebration
comes to be talked of when nothing
more than mere celebration is meant.
It is nevertheless true that in many of the
passages where it is used of observances
there is a more distinct propriety in the
notion of renewal, as in v. 145 note,
5. 94, where it is explained by <quote lang="la">inceptos,</quote>
7. 146., 8. 283, where a second feast is
spoken of. Thus Stat. Theb. 2. 88, borrowing
the words <quote lang="la">instaurare diem</quote> from
<pb n="266"/>
Virg., applies them to a feast which had
been interrupted by a brawl. So in Livy
25. 16, when the sacrifice has been disturbed
by a portent, it is said <quote lang="la">Id cum
haruspicum monitu sacrificium instauraretur.</quote>
It would be possible to give it some
such reference here, Dido being said as it
were to revive the flagging solemnities of
the day as it wore on by ordering new
sacrifices; but this would be too artificial.
It is however countenanced by Donatus,
<quote lang="la">Saepius hoc faciebat, ut produceret diem,
volens diutius habere praesentem quem
amabat.</quote> Serv. says, much less plausibly,
<quote lang="la">quia iam supra (1. 632) sacrificaverat.</quote>
Ladewig supposes Dido to order one sacrifice
after another, a reference to which
he sees in <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">pinguis aras,</q> in the hope of
obtaining a favourable manifestation, and
then, when all fail, to throw the blame on
the prophet or priests, v. 65; an exceedingly
ingenious view, but one which an
attentive consideration of the context will,
I think, scarcely warrant. Dido, as the
queen, would naturally be at the cost of
the public sacrifices, like Clytaemnestra
Aesch. Ag. 87 foll. Comp. 1. 632 note.</p>

the gods, called <quote>consultoriae,</quote> and those
where there is simply an offering of the

might be plausibly supported from v. 464

<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">vatum mentes,</q> is clearly right, confirmed
as it is by Appuleius, Met. 10. p. 682, <quote lang="la">Heu

reference is to the powerlessness of physic
in the case of love, and by Sil. 8. 100,
<quote lang="la">Heu sacri vatum errores,</quote> also an imitation
of this passage (both quoted by Forb.).
There is however some room for doubt as
to the sentiment intended; Heyne thinks
the prophets are censured as ignorant of
the terrible future of Dido's love; Gossrau
supposes Dido and Anna to be the <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">vates;</q>
while Ladewig, as we have seen, understands
the words as the expression of Dido's
impatient despair. Probably Henry is
right (after Serv. and Donatus) in supposing
the meaning to be that <quote>Dido's soothsayers
little knew the state of Dido's mind
&mdash;that she was beyond all help&mdash;that hers
was no case for sacrifice or propitiation of
the gods&mdash;that their art was thrown away
upon her.</quote> He goes on to say, <quote><q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Est
mollis flamma medullas <emph>Interea:</emph></q> so little
good is she likely to derive from sacrificing,
that even <emph>while</emph> she is sacrificing, the internal
flame is consuming her.</quote> The hint
of the words he seems right in tracing to
a curious passage in <bibl n="Apollon. 3.932">Apoll. R. 3. 932</bibl>,
where an oracular raven is heard ridiculing
a prophet for his ignorance of the ways of
a woman in love. The early critics raised
aesthetic objections to this exclamation,
saying that an epic poet ought not to obtrude
his personality, and that Homer
never does so. Heyne replies that this is
no real obtrusion of personality, but merely
an expression of the poet's sympathy with
his subject: he might have added that
Hom.'s <foreign lang="greek">*ou)de/ se/qen, *mene/lae, qeoi\ ma/kares

<p>Much difficulty has been found in

supposed to imply that Ascanius is left
behind, so that the queen can fondle him

whole perplexity vanishes if we do not tie
down Virg. to a narrative of the events of

the morning and the evening of the day

between <quote lang="la">Quo nequitiam meam</quote> and

between <quote lang="la">Quo tibi vel Nioben, Basse, vel

think then there is no reason for departing
here from a reading which is found in all
MSS., especially when we consider the

testimony of those MSS. has been
generally admitted to be in error. How
the abl. is to be explained is another and a

<p>Gossrau, Ladewig, and Henry are,
I think, right in following Serv. against the

the <quote>alatores,</quote> who appear from Isid.
Orig. 10 quoted on <bibl n="Verg. G. 3.413">G. 3. 413</bibl> and other old
authorities to have been a distinct class of
huntsmen. They are generally supposed
to have been mounted like cavalry, of
which the <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">alae</q> of the Roman army originally
consisted: Mr. Long, however,
thinks that they were beaters or drivers,
so called from their position on the flank,
the people for whom the game was driven
answering to the legions in the centre.
The other interpretation, understanding it
of the red feathers with which the game
was scared (see on <bibl n="Verg. G. 3.372">G. 3. 372</bibl>), is not in
Virg.'s manner, though it may suit a more
modern taste, dwelling as it does on an unimportant
circumstance, with the object of
producing a picturesque effect. The change
of nom. at <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">cingunt,</q> too, is an objection
to this view, though a slight one. A similar
question has been raised on the use of
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">ala</q> in a passage in Silius Italicus (2. 418),
describing this very scene:
<quote lang="la"><l>Hinc et speluncam furtivaque foedera

<p>There however the proprieties of the description,

of hurrying hither and thither. <q direct="unspecified">Indago</q>

the spirit of the passages which he quotes
from Ovid, esp. M. 9. 795, the absence of

<p>The general notion of the following
simile, and the geographical names in
the first two lines, are taken, as Henry
remarks, from <bibl n="Apollon. 1.307">Apoll. R. 1. 307</bibl> foll., where
Jason is compared to Apollo. The other
circumstances of the simile correspond, as
Heyne observes, to those in the simile of
Dido to Diana 1. 498 foll. Apollo is supposed
to fix his winter quarters in his
<seg lang="la">temple at Patara in Lycia</seg>, and thence to
go to Delos. Nothing is said about his
dividing the year between the two, so that
we need not speculate with Henry whether
Delos is more than a halting-place on the
way to Delphi. The journeyings of Apollo
formed the subject of a paean by Alcaeus,
the substance of which is preserved by
Himerius, Orations 14. 10, and is extracted
by Bergk, <seg lang="la">Poetae Lyrici Graeci</seg>, pp. 569,
570 (1st edition). From this it appears
that when Apollo was born, Zeus gave him
a mitre, a lyre, and a car driven by swans,
and sent him to Delphi; but he chose first
to go to the Hyperboreans, spending a year
with them, and thence going to Delphi,
where nature as well as men greeted him
with demonstrations of welcome. A passage
from Procopius cited by Turnebus,
Adversaria 24. 26, speaks of the <foreign lang="greek">e)pidhmi/a
*)apo/llwnos</foreign> (an expression supported also
by Himerius l. c.) as a festival at Delphi.
Serv. says definitely that Apollo was supposed
to give oracles for the six winter
months at Patara, for the six summer
ones at Delos: a practical realization of
the belief in Apollo's migratory habits
which is supported by Hdt. 1. 182, as
Heyne observes in his Excursus. But the
meaning may be, as Mr. Long thinks, that
Apollo leaves Lycia in the winter, and
goes to the more genial Delos&mdash;an interpretation
already suggested as a question
by Serv., <quote lang="la">an quam hiberno tempore deserere

other countries. So in Homer's Hymn to
Apollo, vv. 391 foll., Cretans sailing to
Pylos are brought by Apollo to Crisa and
established as his priests. It is also possible,
as Heyne suggests, that these strangers
may have been sent on sacred embassies
to Delos. See on the whole subject of

with Keightley (Myth. p. 454, ed. 3) whether
it was ever one of her regular titles.
The whole description is rightly regarded
by Henry as one not of an inauspicious but
of an auspicious marriage, in which the
gods take the parts ordinarily performed
by mortals; the various phenomena of the
storm being in fact regarded by Virg. as
representing the various parts of the wedding
solemnity, the lightning the holding
up of the torches, the sounds of waters or
<pb n="277"/>
woods the nuptial <foreign lang="greek">o)lolugmo/s</foreign>. But he
goes too far when he supposes the descent
of rain upon the earth to be itself a symbolical
marriage union between two great
parts of nature. Such a notion is found
in other passages of the classics (e. g. <bibl n="Verg. G. 2.325">G. 2.

clear in either case what parts are meant
to be assigned to the Earth and Juno
respectively, supposing, as was observed in

ascribed here to the various deities. Taking
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">signum</q> as a sign, and so regarding
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">fulsere ignes</q> as that in which the sign

for the operation of Juno, who is the
mistress of the atmosphere; but the office
of Tellus is still undetermined. The generality
of commentators, regarding the
appearances as inauspicious, suppose the
sign given by Earth to be the shock of an
earthquake. This was probably the interpretation
of Milton, who doubtless intended
to imitate the passage in his description of
the effects following the first act of sin
(Par. Lost, 9. 782 foll., 1000 foll.). Henry
thinks <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">signum</q> is a signal, which he

<div2 type="commline" n="173">
<p>This description of Fame has
furnished a commonplace for critics, especially
those of the last century, some of
whom have thought its introduction under
any circumstances needlessly ambitious,
while others, though admiring it generally,
think it is carried on too long. A reader
of the present day will, I think, wonder
rather at the poet's reticence than at his
exuberance. The mighty power of Fame
or Rumour is a conception which will bear
dwelling on; the thought is appropriate
here, as one of the main causes which lead
to Dido's death is the sense of the disgrace
to which she has brought herself before the
world: and Virgil's treatment of it is quite
in the taste of classical poetry. Such
mythological personifications are common
enough in Ovid, and it is hard to see why
Virg. should be altogether debarred the
use of them, though doubtless they are
to be more sparingly employed in a poem
like the Aeneid than in a poem like the
Metamorphoses. The hint, as usual, is
from Homer, who personifies <foreign lang="greek">*)/ossa</foreign> Il. 2.
93, Od. 24. 412, which last line Virg. has
almost copied in the present v. 173; the
elaboration of detail too partly comes from
the Homeric, <foreign lang="greek">*)/eris</foreign>, Il. 4. 442, 443. Probably
too he thought of the Hesiodic <foreign lang="greek">*fh/mh</foreign>
(Works 760 foll.). Ovid has an ingenious
passage on the dwelling of Fame, the
receptacle of all the reports in the world
(M. 12. 39 foll.), which, though not copied
from this of Virg., forms a good pendant
to it. Valerius Flaccus (2. 116 foll.) and
Statius (Theb. 2. 426 foll.) tread in the
steps of Virg., but for a much shorter

nothing of the local Olympus, but, wishing
as usual to follow Hom., makes Mercury
take Mount Atlas as a halting-place between
the sky and Carthage. The belief
that Atlas stood as a pillar between heaven
and earth doubtless seemed a reason for
his introduction here, though perhaps it
rather confuses the image. Voss (Mythologische
Briefe, vol. 2, letter 27, referred
to by Henry) suggests a more elaborate
explanation, according to which there
were three openings in the heavenly
Olympus, one in the vertex, immediately
over the earthly mountain, the other two
at the sides, eastern and western, the
latter being the route taken by Mercury
as the nearest to Carthage. I do not
know whether it is an objection to this
view that when in 1. 225 Jupiter looks
down upon Libya, he is expressly said to
be standing not at the west gate of Olympus

<p>This and the two following lines

ground is the awkwardness of expression
in v. 257, as it would be equally objectionable

somewhat late in remembering Mercury's
relationship to Atlas; but it is not unlike
the indirect manner in which he sometimes
introduces what he has to say. The fact
of the relationship he was likely enough
to mention, as he has done afterwards, 8.
138 foll., where again Atlas is spoken of

<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Mortalis visus</q> is Virgil's indirect way of
telling us that Mercury appeared in a visible
though divine form. At the second
apparition (v. 556 foll.), which however
differs from this as taking place in sleep,
the fact is told us directly. Serv. remarks
that Mercury had repeated all his message,
and accordingly understands <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">medio sermone</q>
to mean <q direct="unspecified">when the dialogue was
half over,</q> in other words, without giving
Aeneas time to reply. Donatus has the
same interpretation, which is certainly an
ingenious one. Gossrau accepts it. But
we should not be justified in fixing this
special sense of <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">sermo</q> unless we could
prove that it was never used where only
one person was speaking, which 12. 940
shows not to be the case. <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Medio sermone</q>
then will have its ordinary sense,
which must be explained by supposing
either that Mercury became actually invisible
before his speech was ended, or that
his speech seemed to end abruptly from
the suddenness with which he closed it
and vanished. In either case the expression
is rhetorical and must not be closely
pressed, as all that the poet means is to
give the effect of a sudden and transient
apparition. So below v. 388 there is no
sign of imperfection in Dido's actual
speech, but <quote lang="la">medium sermonem abrumpit</quote>

<p>Comp. vv. 36, 37 above. Either
we must suppose Dido to have known of
the indignation of Iarbas on hearing of her
preference of Aeneas, or we must understand
her to mean no more than that she
has alienated her neighbours by refusing
them the love which she has since bestowed
on Aeneas. The last would be a sufficiently
natural way of speaking in the bitterness
of her despair, especially as she would feel
that the indignation of her former suitors
would be doubled as soon as she was known
to have given herself to another. Perhaps
the same explanation may apply to <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">infensi
Tyrii,</q> which according to this would refer
either to suitors at Tyre (v. 35) or to
Pygmalion, either of whom might be
expected to resent the new alliance. But
Gossrau's interpretation, referring <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Tyrii</q>
to the Carthaginians, who are indignant
at their queen for surrendering herself and
them to a stranger, is on the whole more
plausible. See on v. 466. For <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Nomadum</q>

judge such an expression of feeling by our
modern standard. Other princesses of
mythical antiquity had children by heroes
that forsook them, and Dido is only carrying
out her determination to regard her
union with Aeneas as a lawful marriage.
To suppose with Gossrau that the passage
could have been interpolated before the
time of Juvenal, who, as is well known,
alludes to it Sat. 5. 138, is extravagant.

time that he agrees with the more modern
conception of the absent being made
present by recollection. Jahn and Wagn.
(smaller ed.) revive the old interpretation,
<seg lang="la">Dido following Aeneas</seg> with her funeral
flames, which he will see when at sea
(comp. v. 661 below, 5. 3 foll.); but this
would not suit the present context, as the
pile would not be lighted till Dido was
dead, while it would represent the thought
of death too definitely for Dido's present
state of mind. She has talked of death
from the first (v. 308); but the notion
does not become a resolution till v. 450,

quite certain. Not to mention the obvious

for <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">remittam,</q> while Med., Pal., and Gud.

Med. <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">cumulata</q> for <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">cumulatam.</q> These
varieties are all mentioned by Serv., who
says that <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">dederis</q> was the reading of
Tucca and Varius. <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Relinquam</q> may be
dismissed as probably an interpretation of
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">remittam,</q> fixing it to the particular sense
of returning a favour at death as a bequest
left by the dying. There is the same variety
in the MSS. in Pers. Prol. 5. <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Dederit</q> is
more plausible, as the <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">extrema venia</q>
may be well said with Henry to answer to
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">extremum munus,</q> v. 429, the grace of
a brief delay. But Henry has forgotten
that it may answer equally well to <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">miserae
hoc tamen unum exsequere,</q> v. 420,
the favour which Dido begs of her sister,
of carrying this message to Aeneas: and it
cannot be denied that <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">miserere sororis</q>
is strongly in favour of so interpreting it,
though the words might mean&mdash;<q direct="unspecified">pity me
and tell him so.</q> There is then no overpowering
<seg lang="la">prima facie</seg> reason for adopting
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">dederit:</q> nor do the interpretations proposed
by its supporters supply any additional
argument in its favour. If indeed
we might read with the Delphin
editor <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">cumulatum,</q> we should obtain
a clear and intelligible sense&mdash;<q direct="unspecified">when
he has granted me this, I will send him
away with my death to crown and reward
him.</q> I do not know why Wagn.
calls this <quote lang="la">pessimum:</quote> the objection which
occurs at first sight, that Dido would thus
speak too plainly of a resolution which she
afterwards takes such pains to conceal
from her sister, is, as we shall see, not
convincing: the expression would, I think,
strike any one as sufficiently natural and
unforced, if the reading were undoubted;
and the strongest improbability in the
case is the general one founded on the
almost invariable trustworthiness of one
or other of Virg.'s MSS. Henry's interpretation
adopts not only <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">dederit</q> but
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">cumulata,</q> understanding Dido to say
that if Aeneas grants her the favour of a
little delay, she, though brought lower
than the grave (<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">morte cumulata</q> = in
aggravated death, in a state worse than
death), will abate her passion. The intransitive
sense of <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">remitto</q> is possible
enough: but the interpretation of <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">cumulata
morte</q> is absolutely impossible, and
not justified by a less forced expression in
a more forced writer, Statius, who in Theb.
11. 582 speaks of Oedipus' blindness as
<quote lang="la">mors imperfecta.</quote> On the whole, the
chief value of <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">cumulata</q> seems to be that
it has given occasion for a very ingenious
conjecture of Schrader, <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">cumulata sorte,</q>
which would suit <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">remittam,</q> the sense
produced being <q direct="unspecified">I will repay it with interest.</q>
Accepting the ordinary reading
as having the authority of Serv., we shall
not find much difficulty in giving <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">remittam</q>
the sense of <quote lang="la">reddam,</quote> though
it does not seem to have been generally
used as its conventional equivalent (comp.
Hor. A. P. 349, <quote lang="la">Poscentique gravem
persaepe remittit acutum</quote>), while <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">cumulatum</q>
will naturally mean <q direct="unspecified">with
interest,</q> as in Livy 2. 23, <quote lang="la">aes alienum
cumulatum usuris.</quote> <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Morte</q> may be
either the abl. instr. with <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">cumulatam,</q>
or used as in v. 502 below, <q direct="unspecified">at the time of
death.</q> Here again the difficulty is in the
<pb n="303"/>
general sense. Roughly considered, the
meaning seems to be that Dido's death
will bring to Anna a return for her kindness;
but it is not easy to see what the
return can be, and so to determine whether
the death is to be the cause of its
being made or merely the occasion.
Wagn.'s notion that Dido hints that she
will bequeath her kingdom to Anna is
unworthy of the occasion, and not supported
by any thing else in this book,
while it has not even the justification of
consistency with the legend, which makes
Anna after her sister's death migrate into
Italy. Perhaps we may say, borrowing a
hint from Serv., that Dido's language is
intentionally obscure, her meaning being
that her return for Anna's kindness will
be that she will kill herself, and so rid
her sister of the burden. Anna would
take the words as a mere expression of
desperation, their very obscurity preventing
her from attaching too much meaning
to them. So her language in v. 419 is
worded in a manner which might have
led any one already on the watch to infer
the worst, while an unsuspecting person
like Anna would take it in a good sense,
knowing moreover, as Virg. reminds us v.
502, that Dido had once before endured
successfully what seemed even a worse
sorrow. Generally we may say that while
Dido's purpose is still undecided, she does
not shrink from speaking of death, though
her words are little more than those of
vague desperation. It is only when she has
seen death to be her only course that she
is anxious that no one should suspect what
she is meditating. Sophocles has represented
just the same change of feeling in
Ajax, who talks wildly of death on his
first recovery from his frenzy, but afterwards,
when he is quite resolved to die,
contrives an elaborate blind for Tecmessa
and the Chorus. Thus that Dido should
speak of death here is no more than we
should expect, though the precise import
of her words may be left undetermined.

they have forsaken her, and she has to be
queen of a desolate country, like Creon in
Soph. Ant. 739. This latter feeling throws
light on v. 320, <quote lang="la">infensi Tyrii.</quote> The notion
of loneliness is thus enforced in two
ways, which with great psychological
truth are made to blend together confusedly:
she loses Aeneas, and she loses
her own subjects too. Thus we see that

The object of all these expedients is to
avoid the reference to the stage, it being
supposed that an ancient poet would more
naturally think of the real Pentheus and
Orestes as parallel to Dido, herself a personage
of similar antiquity, than of their
theatrical representatives. But it is quite
in keeping with Virg.'s literary tastes that
he should interest himself more in the
dramatic persons that he had seen or read
of than in their supposed prototypes.
Such a feeling, it is true, is not the simple
feeling of an old poet: to conceive of any
thing of the kind in <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName> would involve
a grotesque impossibility. But the comparison
of one mythical person to another
is equally foreign to Homer. His similes
are limited in their range: heroes and their
actions are paralleled to the more ordinary
occupations of life, to inferior creatures or
natural phenomena. He does not tell us
that Achilles resented the abduction of
Briseis as Meleager did the slight offered
to Atalanta. Virg. must be judged by
his own standard; and there is nothing
<pb n="307"/>
inconsistent with that standard in supposing
that the Pentheus of his thoughts
was the Pentheus of Euripides, the Orestes
of Aeschylus. He doubtless felt that it
was to the stage that he owed the
glorious vision of their madness, and he
was glad to make the acknowledgment.
It is this feeling which dictates the presents,
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">videt,</q> <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">fugit,</q> <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">sedent.</q> The frenzy
of the Theban and the Argive is not a
thing of the past, embalmed in legend;
it is constantly repeating itself; it is present
as often as the Bacchae or the Eumenides
are acted, read, or remembered. As
before, we cannot determine whether Virg.
had any single play exclusively in his mind.
Serv. says that Pacuvius (in his Dolorestes
or Dulorestes?) represented Orestes as entering
Apollo's temple at the instance of
Pylades and being attacked by the Furies
when he tried to leave it. In Aesch. Eum.
the ghost of Clytaemnestra appears, but
does not haunt Orestes, contenting herself
with stirring up the Erinnyes. <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Scaenis
agitatus</q> I understand to mean <q direct="unspecified">driven
over the stage,</q> the sense of <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">agitatus</q>
being fixed by the context, and by the
parallels 3. 331., 12. 668, Cic. Rosc. Am.
24, <quote lang="la">ut eos agitent Furiae.</quote> That Ausonius
uses the words <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">scaenis agitare</q> in
the sense of <q direct="unspecified">to treat scenically</q> may
prove that he had Virg.'s words in his
mind, but need only prove further that he
did not consider himself bound by Virg.'s
meaning, when another suited him better
and suited the genius of the language as
well. In other words, the objection to the
interpretation which Serv. gives as an
alternative to that adopted above, <quote lang="la">famosus,
celebratus tragoediis,</quote> is not that it
is doubtful Latin, but that it would yield
a very frigid sense. I will now transcribe
the passage to which I referred from <seg lang="la">Valerius
Flaccus</seg>, as the detail into which the
description is carried makes it more than
a mere repetition of Virg. The comparison
is to Medea's lovesick distraction&mdash;

<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">spargens mella papaverque</q> of

which he shows from various passages

considered a great delicacy among the
Romans, forming, at least in early times,
part of the second course at a banquet.
That <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">spargens</q> means sprinkling on the
food, not sprinkling on the ground as a
separate and substantive article of food,
he argues from a passage where Petronius

specified by Pliny as the particular kind of
poppy whose seeds were so employed. All
<pb n="309"/>
attempts to modify or evade this obvious

Serv.'s new punctuation, adopted by Gossrau,
which connects <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">spargens</q> &amp;c. with
what follows, Turnebus' fancy that the
dragon required to be put to sleep occasionally
that he might not break down
from overwatching, Jahn's supposition
that honey and poppies were strewn about
to keep intruders away, and Waddel's suggestion
that the priestess may have dealt
with soporifics as Macbeth wished to deal
with physic, throwing them to the dogs to
keep them out of the dragon's way. But
perhaps it may still be open to some
unusually audacious critic to hint that
Virg., by a strange confusion, such as might
possibly happen to a great writer who
never lived to revise his poem, thought of
the dragon for the moment as a creature
which the priestess was to subdue or elude,
and so made her exercise her charming
power in sending it to sleep. Medea, who,

to herself. We can easily understand
how the burning of the <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">exuviae</q>

other alternative, the extinguishing of the
passion. A funeral pile is raised, with all
its accoutrements (see v. 506), really to
<seg lang="la">serve for Dido</seg>, but apparently for Aeneas,
who is to be burnt in effigy (v. 508), as
being dead to Dido. The description of
the pile is parallel to that of the pile

grieves that she could not live an unwedded
life. Probably she is not thinking here of
Sychaeus, though in the next line she bewails
her unfaithfulness to his memory.
She wishes that she had been born to a wild
life in the woods, like Camilla, without
any thought of wedlock. It is not constancy
to her first mate, but simply wildness,
undisturbed by human passions and
frailties, that is now in her mind. <q direct="unspecified">More
ferae</q> is startling, but it ceases to be
strange if we understand it, with Henry,
not of a beast's life as contrasted with a
man's in respect of the union of the sexes,
but generally of the life of beasts as contrasted
with civilization and its attendant
weaknesses. Camilla's virginity arose out
of her wild life: she would not submit to
a husband's yoke, as her father would not
yield to civic restraints, <quote lang="la">neque ipse manus
feritate dedisset</quote> 11. 568. So Orpheus,
obdurate to love after Eurydice's death,
wanders among rocks and snows, <bibl n="Verg. G. 4.507">G. 4. 507</bibl>

those who think that <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">thalami expertem</q>

that a man who delights in solitude
must be <foreign lang="greek">h)\ qhri/on h)\ qeo/s</foreign>. The Greek use
of <foreign lang="greek">a)/dmhtos</foreign> for unmarried seems indeed to
express the main thought which Virg.
wished to convey. This may perhaps be a
sufficient account of words which have
caused so much perplexity, though it would
be well if further illustration could be obtained.
Serv. thinks the reference is to a
particular kind of beast, such as a lynx,
which, if a quotation he makes from Pliny
is to be trusted, after losing its first mate
never takes a second. Mr. Long explains
<q direct="unspecified">more ferae</q> by <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">sine crimine,</q> beasts
having no sense of good and evil. Quinct.
Inst. 9. 2. 64 notes this as an instance of

for men as men. It matters little whether

<p>There is no reason to suppose that
Aeneas had any doubt that it was Mercury
whom he had seen, as we are expressly
told that the Mercury of the dream was
in all respects like the real god. The case
is even stronger in 9. 22, where Turnus,
having first addressed Iris by name, afterwards
says, <quote lang="la">Sequor omina tanta, Quisquis
in arma vocas;</quote> though there, as
possibly here, the doubt may be about the
god who had sent down the messenger.
But it seems to have been usual to throw
in a saving clause, from motives of reverence,
in case the speaker should have mistaken
the god or addressed him by a name
unacceptable to him. Serv. says that
the pontiffs were accustomed to pray
<quote lang="la">Iuppiter omnipotens, vel quo alio nomine
appellari volueris,</quote> exactly the <foreign lang="greek">*zeu\s

9. 201, and see further Serv. on 2. 351,
Gell. 2. 28. Possibly there may be something
in another suggestion of Serv. that
the doubt is expressed in consequence of
the number of gods bearing the same name,
e. g. three Mercuries are spoken of. Heyne,
who censures the <quote lang="la">argutiae</quote> of Serv. and
others, can hardly be said to have explained
the matter by reminding us that Aeneas
only saw the form of Mercury, and had no

Aeneas. The latter is supported by Dido's
language v. 496 above, and by Tibull. 3. 6.
42, quoted by Wagn., <quote lang="la">ingrati referens
impia facta viri,</quote> of Theseus' desertion of
Ariadne. But in this case it is difficult to
explain the next line, the full construction
of which must be <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Tum decuit (facta impia
tangere te) cum sceptra dabas.</q> Dido
had no reason to think Aeneas treacherous
when she offered him a share in the crown:
he had treated no one else with the same
perfidy. Wagn. attempts to get over this
by understanding <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">tum decuit</q> <quote>you should
have suspected him then;</quote> but the question
recurs, had be given ground for suspicion?
The very next words seem to say that all
his previous actions had been in his favour,
and that his present faithlessness makes her
disbelieve that they ever took place. Her
regret for not having slain him, vv. 600
foll., refers not to the time of her welcoming
him, but to that of her becoming first
aware of his treachery, as <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">moritura</q> v.
604 shows. It seems better then to understand
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">facta impia</q> of Dido's own faithlessness

Henry, who comp. Medea's self-reproach,

this interpretation, as his preceding line is
<quote lang="la">Hei mihi! quid feci? quo me furor egit
amantem?</quote> which may be an imitation
of v. 595. Heyne, who also refers <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">facta
impia</q> to Dido, thinks she is struck with
horror at her wish to avenge herself on
her lover, and then wishes that her moral
sense had been as keen earlier: but this is
far less likely, and scarcely consistent with
the access of fury v. 600, or indeed with
the tone of the whole speech, which, tempestuous

<p>Virg. has doubtless framed Dido's
imprecations so that, while intended by
her to be all that is dreadful, they should
be susceptible of a much more endurable
fulfilment. The imprecation of Polyphemus
in <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName> is something of the same
kind: there however the relief is found in
the fact that the curse only extends to
Ulysses' arrival at home, and so is not incompatible
with his subsequent triumph
over his enemies. Dido is more unrelenting:
she prays that he may have to fight,
to leave his settlement and his son, implore
foreign aid, submit to a disgraceful
peace, die prematurely, and be deprived of
burial. Aeneas does meet with opposition
(Book 7): he has to leave Ascanius in the
camp and entreat aid from Evander (Books
8 and 9): the final peace involves concessions
to the Latins and the extinction of
the Trojan name (Book 12): while his
death, according to one legend, which
Virg. probably followed (see 1. 265), happened
when he had reigned only three
years, and his body, if not left <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">media

swallowed up in the Numicius, or, according
to another account, not being found
after a battle. Yet Aeneas' career after
reaching Italy would have been felt to be
a prosperous one, just as the Romans of
Virg.'s day would feel that the eternal
feud between <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> and Carthage, and
the actual appearance of the threatened
avenger, were not painful but glorious
recollections. The Sibyl, however (6. 83
foll.), takes a similar, though less gloomy
view of Aeneas' future in Italy. These
lines, as is well known, had a more terrible
fulfilment in our own history in the case

to have understood the passage, <bibl n="Ov. Ep. 7.153">Ov. Her.

Dido as slaying herself with the sword

of the points of the legend. Yet this

thing which did not belong to Aeneas at
the time of his departure. The alternative
seems to be to suppose the sword to have
been Dido's present to Aeneas, already

<div2 type="Introduction" n="intro">
<p>IN the first half of the Aeneid it would almost seem as if <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> had intentionally
relieved those portions of his narrative which possess the most absorbing interest with
others of a more level and less exciting kind. The detailed account of the agonies of
the one night of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>'s capture was succeeded by a rapid sketch of the events of seven
years of travel: and now we pass from the spectacle of Dido's frantic love and (as a
modern reader will regard it) Aeneas' faithlessness to a description of the games celebrated
by the Trojan hero in Sicily on the anniversary of his father's death. This
serves to conduct us from the tragedy of the Fourth Book to the mysterious solemnities
of the Sixth. Aeneas does not pass at once from the terrible conflict of love and duty
to the initiation which is reserved for the chosen favourites of Heaven, but is shown
to us the pious and beneficent prince, reverentially dutiful to his father's memory,
and kind and liberal to his followers and friends&mdash;encouraging the ambition of his
own men and returning the courtesies of the Sicilians by a display in which it is his
honour to be the dispenser of honour to others.</p>
<p>As usual, the subject and much of the treatment in detail are from Homer. The
heroic courtesy of Achilles is never more conspicuous than in the games which he gives
in memory of his dead friend, as described in the Twenty-third Iliad: and by treading
in the steps of Homer, <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> has succeeded in investing his own hero with similar
associations of chivalrous magnificence. For the scene in which the action is laid,
he was indebted to that variety of the Trojan legend which made <seg lang="la">Anchises die</seg> in Sicily,
and to the tradition which had fixed a Trojan colony there already. That Aeneas
should revisit the island by choice or accidentally, and that being there he should
honour his father by a splendid funeral celebration, was a sufficiently plausible development
of the story. The earlier games, it is true, are little more than a re-arrangement
of the Homeric materials; but they are made interesting in themselves, and the few
novelties introduced increase the reader's pleasure&mdash;such as the affection between
Nisus and Euryalus, the defeat of the braggart by the veteran in the boxing-match,
and the portent of Acestes' arrow. The tilt, which was Aeneas' surprise for his
spectators, is Virgil's surprise for his readers; it is described with an ingenious felicity
of language which exercises commentators and translators alike; and it must have
been peculiarly flattering to Augustus to find an exhibition in which he took pleasure
referred to his great progenitor. <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> never seems to be more in his element than
<pb n="332"/>
when he is speaking of the young; and the halo of hope which surrounds the sons of
the conquerors of Italy is one of the most pleasing features in the Aeneid.</p>
<p>The burning of the ships by the Trojan women was a part of the Trojan legend,
though the story was very variously told, as will be seen by any one who will consult
Heyne's Excursus on the subject, some placing the scene in Greece, some in Italy,
while one account connected it with the foundation of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. Dionysius agrees with
Virgil in making it an incident in the voyage of Aeneas. In the account of the fate
of Palinurus, with which the book closes, the poet, as usual, has combined an Italian
tradition with an imitation of Homer. The promontory of Palinurus was supposed to
have derived its name from the pilot of Aeneas, who was buried there: in the Odyssey,
Menelaus' pilot dies at his post in the middle of his voyage: Ulysses loses one of his
comrades just as he is about to visit the shades. <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> has fitted these fragments
into his tessellated work, and has thus, as Heyne remarks, secured an episode to give
interest to the voyage from Sicily to Italy, which would otherwise have been uneventful.
</p>
<p>It is no impeachment of the aptness and relevancy of this Book that it probably did
not form part of Virgil's original conception. Conrads, whose views about the composition
of the Aeneid have been mentioned in the Introduction to Book 3, has pointed
out, what had occurred more or less distinctly to others, that the words <q direct="unspecified">libyco cursu,</q>
Book 6. 338, naturally mean that Palinurus was lost during the voyage from Carthage
to Italy, which accordingly he supposes to have formed part of the story as <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> first
planned it. There are other points in the scene with Palinurus in Book 6, which it
requires some ingenuity to reconcile with the narrative at the end of this Book; the
mention of Apollo's prediction (6. 343 foll.), the stress laid on the stormy condition of
the sea (vv. 354 foll.), and perhaps the time during which Palinurus represents himself
as kept alive after his fall (<emph>ib.</emph>). Again, the request of Anchises that Aeneas would
consult the Sibyl mentioned in Book 6. 115, would seem rather to have been an injunction
given in life than identical with that which we read of vv. 731 foll. of this Book.
Lastly, the supposition that this Book was an afterthought, would account at once for
the doubt which existed in ancient times, whether the two first lines of Book 6 do not
really belong to the present Book. Had <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> lived to complete his work, he would
doubtless have observed these discrepancies: as it is, they concern the critical scholar
rather than the general reader. The introduction of Nisus and Euryalus in Book 9,
as if they had not appeared in the narration before, may perhaps show that the present
Book was composed later than Book 9.</p></div2>

of should have begun, there is no reason
why it should not have been exactly half
finished at the time mentioned. In other
words, Virg. assumes for rhetorical purposes
that the thing is half done, an assumption
which here is contrary to the
fact, while there, for aught we know, it
may be consistent with it. 4. 277 is
nearer the mark, as we can hardly suppose
that Mercury ceased to be visible in

The precise meaning however of <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">colligere

to be understood of taking in part

explains it of stowing away those parts of

thinks <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> means generally to make
every thing tight and prepare for a squall.

meant <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">colligere</q> as well as <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">arma</q> to be
metaphorical, speaking of the sailors as
men resuming the arms which they had
laid down and preparing for action; or

<p>It is natural enough, as the later
commentators remark against Heyne, that
the Trojans should take this opportunity
of asking for a prosperous voyage, especially
as the satisfactory observance of this
sacred anniversary is in the next clause
adroitly made conditional on their landing
in Italy. But a question still remains,
whether the prayer is made to the winds
themselves, or to Anchises. The latter
interpretation, which perhaps is that more
obviously suggested by the context, was
evidently maintained by Lactantius, who
says of Anchises (Inst. 1. 15) <quote lang="la">cui Aeneas
non tantum inmortalitatem, verum etiam
ventorum tribuit potestatem.</quote> Klausen
too, in his work on Aeneas and the
Penates, considers that Anchises is recognized
as a god of the winds. On the
other hand offerings were made as a fact
to the winds themselves at the end of the
ceremonies to Anchises, v. 772 below, as
we have seen done already 3. 115 foll.,
where <quote lang="la">placemus ventos</quote> is like <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">poscamus

right. The point was that none but good

repeated what the priest said or did not

extract in extenso two of the most important

seems right in recalling the former,
as it appears from v. 248 that the crew of
each ship received a talent of silver, unless
Heyne is right in supposing that a talent

of two talents of gold. The meaning then
will be that there was several talents'

<p>Virg. naturally substitutes the

Wagn. thinks <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">pares</q> must refer to
swiftness, not to size, supposing the Chimaera
to be larger than the rest, being a
trireme, while the others are assumed to
have been biremes. In v. 153 however the
weight of Cloanthus' vessel is said to be
the reason why he did not get ahead of
Gyas, so that the two ships probably did
not differ much in size. It seems more
likely that in the following description
Virg. as usual has studied variety, calling
the Pristis swift and the Scylla sea-coloured
without meaning that the others were not
swift, or implying any thing about their
colour, and thus that in dwelling on the
size of the Chimaera he has no intention
of disparaging that of the rest. <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Gravibus

progenitor. It is supposed however that
they may have died out before Virg.'s

the repetition is intentional, as Gossrau

<q direct="unspecified">nexantem nodos,</q> the common reading
before Heins., in some old MSS. which
Pierius does not name (a suspicious circumstance
which throws doubt on many of
his readings), and two later copies. Wagn.
and the later editors restore <q direct="unspecified">nixantem
nodis,</q> which they understand of the serpent
working itself on with its coils, that
being its normal state of motion, which
its mutilation retards. The fact however
is traversed by Mr. Long, who observes to
me that the motion of a serpent is laterally
sinuous, not vertically sinuous or in coils;
and the argument for <q direct="unspecified">nexantem,</q> like that
for <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">subnexus</q> 4. 217, is not easily to be
resisted, viz. the improbability that Virg.,
speaking of twines and coils, should have
passed over <q direct="unspecified">nexare</q> and chosen a word so
nearly resembling it. <q direct="unspecified">Nexantem nodis</q>
too will enable us to account readily for the
variations: the construction was seen to be
an unusual one: so while one set of correctors
altered the abl. into the acc., another
altered the verb. (Wagn. however argues
with some plausibility that <q direct="unspecified">nixantem</q>
was first altered into <q direct="unspecified">nexantem</q> as the
more natural word, and then <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">nodis</q> into
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">nodos.</q>) <q direct="unspecified">Nexantem nodis</q> then will be
a Virgilian variety for <q direct="unspecified">nexantem nodos</q>
or <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">nexantem se in nodos,</q> <q direct="unspecified">nexantem</q>
being used intransitively, like other transitive
words in Virg., and <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">nodis</q> a modal
abl. It is not easy to say whether the

as affected by the wound or as struggling
against it. <quote><q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Membra:</q> <seg lang="la">etiam hoc ab

to have been found in all his copies. If by
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">ambiguum relinquere</q> is meant to leave
the contest undecided, which is the general
opinion (Heyne, who adopts it, referring
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">ambiguum</q> to Helymus as a person), there
can be little doubt that <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">ve</q> should be read,
as it could not be said that in a context
like this the two cases could be represented
except as alternatives. And this interpretation
seems to be exactly confirmed by
Il. 23. 382, <foreign lang="greek">kai/ nu/ ken h)\ pare/lass', h)\ a)mfh/riston
e)/qhken</foreign>, which Virg. probably had
in his mind, as <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">incumbens humero</q> seems
to be modelled on Hom.'s description in
<pb n="364"/>
the three lines immediately preceding.
But there is another passage which also
Virg. had before him, Il. 23. 526, <foreign lang="greek">ei) de/ k'
e)/ti prote/rw ge/neto dro/mos a)mfote/roisin,
*tw=| ke/n min pare/lass', ou)d' a)mfh/riston
e)/qhken</foreign>, and this would suggest another
interpretation of Virg.'s words, proposed
long ago by Turnebus 14. 4, apparently
adopted by Cerda, and now revived by
Henry, who does not seem aware that he
has been anticipated, giving <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">relinquere</q>
the special sense of leaving behind in a
race, like the passive <foreign lang="greek">lei/pesqai</foreign> (comp. Hor.
A. P. 417, <quote lang="la">occupet extremum scabies:
mihi turpe relinqui est,</quote> and other places),
so that the meaning will be <q direct="unspecified">would pass
him who is now doubtful,</q> i. e. would make
him doubtful no longer, but clearly defeated.
This view I now accept, as satisfactory
in itself and recommended by the
unanimous concurrence of the MSS. in
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">ambiguumque,</q> though, had the preponderance
been reversed, I should see no
sufficient reason for leaving the ordinary
interpretation. Against the new one it
may perhaps be urged that it does not
bring Virg. into absolute conformity with
Hom., who does not mean that Menelaus
and Antilochus were <foreign lang="greek">a)mfh/ristoi</foreign> as it was,
but that Menelaus in a longer course would
not only have become <foreign lang="greek">a)mfh/ristos</foreign> but
superior, while Virg. on the other hand,
as thus interpreted, represents Helymus as
already no more than <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">ambiguus;</q> and
also that the case of Helymus and Diores
is more like that of Eumelus and Diomed,
who were nearly even from the first, than
that of Menelaus and Antilochus, whose
places were reversed during the race by an
act of fraud, so that Menelaus, in passing
his rival, would only have been asserting
the intrinsic superiority which he had all
along. But these points, though worth
considering, do not seem to <seg lang="la">me sufficient</seg>
to overbalance the general probability that

<p>Nisus' accident is taken from

for introducing the slaughter of oxen here

reason as is assigned by Hom.l.c., the
sacrifice at the tomb of Patroclus. But
without going back to the sacrifice nine
days before, v. 97, we may suppose not
unreasonably that a sacrifice had been performed
to Anchises before the games,
though Virg., true to his love of variety,
even at the expense of perspicuity, has not
chosen directly to inform us of it. We need
not settle the topography of the circus;
but it cannot have been at any great distance
from the tomb. <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Forte</q> expresses,
not that the slaughter was an ordinary

happened to pass over the ground where
the slaughter had taken place&mdash;a thing

really contained in those words, which are
intended to express not the ground which
he put forward in his appeal, but the reason
why he made an appeal at all. On the other
hand the indic., though more regular,
would have been comparatively tame.
The union of the two forms of expression
is grammatically irregular, no doubt: but
here as elsewhere the violation of grammar
is a gain to rhetorical and poetical effect.
We are told that Diores is speaking: we
are reminded of what his real grievance is,
not in his own words, but in those which

The first would be more natural so far as
mere language goes: but no instances are
quoted of fillets intertwined with gold,
whereas bullocks with gilded horns were

to the old Romans no less than to
the Greeks of the heroic time. Lersch

the clause <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Bebrycia gente,</q> as Wagn. and

above, <quote lang="la">vastis cum viribus effert ora,</quote>
<quote lang="la">vasta se mole moventem</quote> 3. 656.
Heyne's pointing, which separates <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">se
ferebat</q> both from <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">inmani corpore</q> and
from <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">veniens,</q> &amp;c., is contrary to the

without something to qualify and complete
it, except where it is connected with words

<quote lang="la">veniens ex gente,</quote> though we have <quote lang="la">Venerat
antiquis Corythi de finibus Acron</quote>
10. 719. Both the use of <q direct="unspecified">de gente</q> elsewhere
in Virg., and the requirements of
the present passage oblige us to take <q direct="unspecified">de

as if it were <quote lang="la">veniens vir de gente</quote> or

Such a thing however is not likely to have

<p>I incline to refer these two lines
to Dares, not to the subjects of the two

former is supported by an imitation in
Val. Fl. 4. 125, <quote lang="la">Iam iam aliae vires

strength of a different grade from Amycus'.

Comp. v. 443 note. Rom. omits <q direct="unspecified">in,</q> an
omission approved by one or two earlier
critics, and adopted by Ladewig after
Fleckeisen in Jahn's Jahrb. 61, p. 32.
Comp. v. 167, where the omission of <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">et</q>
after <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">revocabat</q> rests on the same authority,
is approved by nearly the same critics,
and must be vindicated on the same
grounds, as likely to have been altered by
those who did not understand the metrical
licence. Here however, putting aside the
question of accidental omission, which probably
after all may be the true account,
there is the counter probability that <q direct="unspecified">in</q>
may have been left out by some one who
did not understand the construction <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">inlisit

contempt intended to Dares in the word,
the allusion being, as Germ. thinks, to the

<p>The meaning seems to be, as most
of the editors have seen, that what then
came to pass was really a portent of evil,
though not understood so at the time, its
true meaning being taught by the event,
when the prophets of the day pointed out
the connexion between the omen and its
fulfilment. Aeneas, immediately on its
appearance, as we shall see (v. 530), interprets
it favourably, but what happened
subsequently showed that he was mistaken.
What then was the event portended? The
old interpretation was, the burning of the
ships: but this disaster, soon over and
soon repaired, would hardly suit v. 524,
which points apparently to something more
terrible and more distant. Wagn. supposes
it to be the impending war in Italy;
but Acestes had nothing to do with this
either as actor or as sufferer. It seems
more probable that Heyne is right in referring
it to the wars between <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> and
Sicily. But there is no need to fix it at
all, as long as we regard it as identified
with some adequate occurrence in the subsequent
history of Sicily. Wagn. censures
the awkwardness of alluding to something
extraneous to the poem and not specified;
but Gossrau remarks that Virg. is probably
not inventing this story of the portent and
its supposed accomplishment, but repeating
what he found in a legend. Med., Pal., Gud.,
Rom., and others have <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">subito,</q> as Med.,
Pal., and Verona fragm. have in 2. 680:
wrongly in both places. The awkwardness
of the connexion <quote lang="la">subito futurumque</quote>

itself is not strictly co-ordinate with
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">futurum,</q> being a predicate. <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Magno
futurum augurio:</q> strictly speaking the
thing was an <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">augurium</q> already, but as

reading before Heins., and Wagn. has restored
it. The corrections seem to show
that both readings belong to old rescensions,
so that the decision between them
must turn on intrinsic considerations.
These again are as nearly balanced as may
be, as both sing. and pl. are equally good
and Virgilian, as Wagn. remarks, comp.
vv. 342, 347. Nor is there any thing to

<p>This line presents great difficulty.
The natural way of understanding would
seem to be that all have their hair bound
(comp. 4. 148, <quote lang="la">Fronde premit crinem</quote>)
with a wreath of stripped leaves (<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">tonsa
corona</q> for <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">corona tonsae frondis;</q> comp.
v. 774, <bibl n="Verg. G. 3.21">G. 3. 21</bibl> note). But how is this to
be reconciled with their wearing helmets
(v. 673)? Wreaths were sometimes put
over the helmet, as appears from 7. 751,
<quote lang="la">Fronde super galeam et felici comptus
oliva,</quote> which would agree with <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">tonsa</q>
here, that being probably a sign that oliveleaves
are meant (v. 774 &amp;c.). But in
that case the hair must be confined by
the helmet, not by the wreath. Cerda
proves from <bibl n="Ov. Ep. 13">Ov. Her. 13. 39</bibl>, Fast. 3. 2
that <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">premi</q> would naturally be said of
the pressure of a helmet (comp. also 9.
612, <quote lang="la">Canitiem galea premimus</quote>), as
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">solvi</q> of its removal; but this will not
help us here, unless we are to suppose that
Virg. is thinking of wreath and helmet
both, while only mentioning the former.
Peerlkamp apparently considers the wreath
to be under the helmet, to which Forb.
answers, that in that case the helmet
would not fit. But it seems possible that
there might be a wreath worn just below
the helmet, so as not to interfere with it&mdash;
a variety of the custom mentioned 7. 751.
And in this interpretation I incline to acquiesce,
till a better shall have been proposed.
Henry, following Gesner in his
Thesaurus, thinks the meaning is that the
hair of the boys was cut round, as was
that of the Roman boys (a custom expressed
by <q direct="unspecified">in morem,</q> according to Virg.'s
usual habit of ascribing Roman usages to
the Trojans). He compares the words used
by St. Jerome in translating and commenting
<pb n="388"/>
on Ezekiel 44. 20, where the poll
of the Jewish priests is spoken of (a mode
of wearing the hair which he believes to
have been as nearly as possible the same
as that in use among the Roman boys),
<quote lang="la">comas ad pressum tondere,</quote> the use of
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">premere</q> for pruning or lopping leaves
(<bibl n="Verg. G. 1.157">G. 1. 157</bibl> &amp;c.), and that of <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">corona</q> in
modern Italian for pollarding a tree. But
these parallelisms are by no means equal
in value to those adduced in support of
the other interpretation: and moreover
the passage, so interpreted, would be inconsistent
with 10. 137, where we are expressly
told that Ascanius' hair was not
cropped, but only confined by a gold band.

(say) to the right, another to the left,

the three left turn about and severally
charge each other. Heyne thought that
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">terni solvere agmina</q> perhaps meant

horsemen each, which would complicate
the picture needlessly: Wagn. and Forb.
suppose no more to be meant than that
the three <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">turmae,</q> having been together
while they passed in procession, now separate:
but, as Henry remarks, the previous
context, so far from leading us to suppose
that they ever formed into one, distinctly
suggests the contrary. <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Discurrere pares,</q>
according to Virg.'s wont, is explained by
the following clause. There is something
antithetical in the combination of the two
words, <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">discurrere</q> alone suggesting the
notion of irregular dispersion (9. 164., 12.
590), as if it had been said <quote>discurrerunt

<seg lang="la">quidem, sed ita ut pares fierent</seg>.</quote> <q direct="unspecified">Terni,</q>
being distributed into three, that being as
it were the basis of their <q direct="unspecified">discursio</q> and
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">solutio agminum;</q> they separate, keeping
their original distinction into three,
so that there are not simply two companies,
right and left, but three pairs of
companies. One difficulty remains which
Henry has not noticed: when the three
companies are divided into pairs, there are
still only three leaders. This may not be
fatal to the interpretation; but it can only
be met by charging Virg. with an oversight.

the generality of the commentators to
complicated circular evolutions as it were
entangling each other. The <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">chori</q> are
not really confused, but their movements
are so ingeniously intricate that they appear
confused: the effect produced is that
of circles involved in or cutting each
other. <quote lang="la">Septenosque orbibus orbis Inpediunt</quote>
occurs 8. 448 of the shield of
Aeneas, where, though the entanglement
of the circles is not the same as that
here supposed, the picture is still less
like what Henry imagines, circles preventing
each other from being circles. Besides,
Virg. has himself shown that he intends
not single but highly complicated
evolutions by the comparison to the labyrinth
which immediately follows&mdash;a comparison
which would be unmeaning if the
movements of the <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">chori</q> had been such
as the eye could easily trace. Whether
these circular evolutions are the same as
what is described generally in v. 583, or
something different, it is not easy to say.

<div2 type="commline" n="620">
<p>In Il. 3. 121 foll. Iris, sent with
a message to Helen, assumes the form of
Laodice, Priam's daughter and Helicaon's
wife. Nothing more is known of this Beroe.
The nation of her husband is disputed, the
word being variously written in the MSS.;
the varieties however reduce themselves to
two, <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Tmarii</q> and <q direct="unspecified">Ismarii,</q> the rest, which
are more or less obvious errors, tending to
support <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Tmarii.</q> We have already seen
the MSS. vary between <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Tmaros</q> and
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Ismarus</q> <bibl n="Verg. Ecl. 8">E. 8. 44</bibl>. Internal evidence,

favour of <q direct="unspecified">Ismarii.</q> Thrace and <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>
were neighbouring and allied countries,
and a Trojan woman might easily marry
a Thracian; while those who vindicate
Tmarus have to suppose that Beroe left
Troy with Helenus, married in Epirus,
and (probably becoming a widow) accompanied
Aeneas. But the external authority
for <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Tmarii</q> is too great to be resisted,
the only evidence for <q direct="unspecified">Ismarii</q>
among Ribbeck's MSS. being an abortive
attempt in Med. to correct <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Mari,</q> the
original reading, into <q direct="unspecified">Immari</q> or <q direct="unspecified">Immarii,</q>
so that we must suppose Virg. to
have introduced another reference (comp.
note on v. 360) to Aeneas' visit to Epirus,
either from a legend now lost, or from his
own spirit of invention, seeking to give an
air of verisimilitude to a narrative which
has not the background of a consistent
history. Lachmann's decision (on <bibl n="Lucr. 4.1169">Lucr. 4.1169</bibl>) that the final vowel in <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Beroe</q>

was of a different kind, as the context

those who were for continuing the voyage
had their true interests at heart. If this

show. The antithesis may seem to require
<q direct="unspecified">either restore us wholly or ruin us wholly,</q>
not <q direct="unspecified">either give us partial safety or ruin
us wholly:</q> but Aeneas' thoughts flow too
fast to conform to balanced rhetoric. He
first says <q direct="unspecified">rescue our wretched fortunes
from death: it is but little to ask, and yet,
if it be not granted, we are extinguished
at once and for ever:</q> then as he looks at
the ships burning one by one, he says,
<q direct="unspecified">We are well night crushed already: tread
us wholly into dust.</q> There is a fragment
of Attius' Nyctegresia (9 Ribbeck) of
which Virg. perhaps thought, <quote lang="la">Tum quod

harsh in making Aeneas identify himself
with the Trojans, of whom he is the head,
and resting their safety on his deserts.
On the other hand, an objection might
perhaps be raised with justice to Aeneas'
separating himself from the rest, as he does
according to the common interpretation,
and calling for his own destruction as the
one thing wanted to crown the national
misery. On the whole then I think <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">quod

an anacoluthon in <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Isque</q> v. 708, taking
up the sentence unfinished in vv. 704, 705.
Henry well expands the meaning: <quote>Pallas
was in the habit of answering him as to
both of the great classes into which all
future events were divisible, not only as to
those fixed and immutable events which
were decreed by the fates, that class of
events to which for instance Aeneas' arrival
in Italy and establishment of a great
empire there belonged, but as to those, if
I may so say, uncertain and precarious
events which were produced by the special
intervention of offended deities, that class
of events of which the storm in the First
Book and all Aeneas' subsequent misfortunes
afford examples.</quote> For this division
of events he (after Gossrau) comp. Claudian,
De Bello Getico v. 171 (speaking of the
irruption of the barbarians into Thrace),
<quote lang="la">seu fata vocabant, Seu gravis ira deum,
seriem meditata ruinis.</quote> There is still
however an unexplained difficulty about
the expression. The sense would seem to
require that we should supply some antecedent
for <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">quae</q> from the sentence itself,
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">responsa dabat (de iis), vel quae,</q> &amp;c., or
regard <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">quae</q> as acc. pl. of <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">quis.</q> But I
believe Virg. meant <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">quae</q> to be connected
with <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">responsa,</q> speaking of the
responses as portended by the wrath of
heaven or demanded by the order of fate,
to show how completely the responses represented
and were identified with the
events. The events or responses are said
to be portended by the wrath of the gods,
whereas we should rather expect to hear
that the wrath of the gods was itself portended
by supernatural appearances: but
though <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">portendere</q> seems generally to
bear the latter meaning, the substantive
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">portentum</q> is quite in accordance with
the former. <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Responsum dare</q> occurs
elsewhere, as in <bibl n="Verg. Ecl. 1">E. 1. 44</bibl>, of a god giving
forth a response to those who consulted

<p>With Ribbeck I have recalled
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">nomen,</q> the reading of Heins. and Heyne,

is <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">numen:</q> two MSS. have <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">lumen</q>
as a various reading, and Rom. and another
MS. give <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">caelum.</q> The last is adopted
by Henry: but it seems to have arisen
from a recollection of 4. 53, as has so
often happened in similar cases. Between
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">numen</q> and <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">nomen</q> the question
is more difficult. Wagn., reading <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">numen,</q>
appeals to the deification of <foreign lang="greek">*qa/lassa</foreign> or
<foreign lang="greek">*po/ntos</foreign>. Henry replies that Virg. speaks
of gods of the sea, but not of the sea
itself as a god. The sea is called <quote lang="la">monstrum</quote>
below v. 849 in a passage somewhat
similar to this: but such an analogy
does not help us much. Admitting then
that if the notion involved in <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">numen</q>
would be satisfactorily supported, the
word would be appropriate and poetical, I
think this passage is one of the innumerable
exceptions to the critical rule that the
more difficult reading is to be preferred.
Virg. may have thought of the Homerie
<foreign lang="greek">ou)k o)nomasto/s</foreign>, Od. 19. 260, 597., 23. 19.
But it would be more satisfactory if a
parallel could be adduced from his own
works, though the expression may seem to
be one which does not stand in need of any
such support. The confusion is of course
common: see 4. 94 note.</p>

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Subegit</lemma> Aeneam. <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Classe amissa</q>

qualifies the words in v. 796, if the interpretation
adopted in the note there is correct.
There is the same spirit of exaggeration
in her language 1. 251, where she
talks of <quote lang="la">navibus amissis,</quote> though she
doubtless knew at the time that only one

</div2>
<div2 type="commline" n="795">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Ignotae</lemma> is another touch of exaggeration,
as elsewhere the Trojans speak
of Sicily as familiar and friendly, above
vv. 24, 28 foll., 630. But she may call it
so with reference to the separation between
Aeneas and those left behind, who will be
strangers to him henceforth. <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Ignota
terra</q> is read by Med., Gud. a m. pr., first
Mentelian, &amp;c.: but the dat. which is found
in fragm. Vat. is more poetical and less
obvious, and so more likely to have been
altered. Rom. exhibits the error in its
transitional state, reading <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">ignotae terra,</q>
and the original reading of Pal. was perhaps
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">ignota terrae.</q></p>
</div2>
<div2 type="commline" n="796">
<p>There is even more variety of
opinion about <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">quod superest</q> here than
in v. 691 above. Heyne, who placed a
semicolon after <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">superest,</q> seems to have
regarded it as i. q. <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">ceterum,</q> to which
Wagn. objects that the request which follows,
so far from being an afterthought,
is the main object of Venus' speech. This
objection is not quite conclusive, as there
might even be a dramatic propriety in the
request so introduced. Venus has been
carried on by her impetuosity into an
enumeration of Juno's crimes, and now bethinks
herself of what she wants to have
done, at the same time that she may purposely
adopt a phrase which rather disguises
her anxiety about the main point.
Such a defence however can hardly be
urged against other views equally reconcilable
with the language, and not requiring
to be reconciled with the context. Henry
understands it to mean <q direct="unspecified">all that is now
possible for us to obtain from you in this
our distressed condition,</q> which would
agree with the common interpretation of
the words in v. 691, <quote>all that is left for
you to do in order to ruin us utterly.</quote>
But Neptune's help was really worth far
more to them than this, though it may
again be replied that it suits Venus' purpose
to extenuate the boon. Two other
interpretations are mentioned by Wagn.,
<quote lang="la">quod superest de classe,</quote> or <quote>de sociis,</quote>
and <quote lang="la">quod superest de itinere.</quote> The former
brings the passage into conformity
with what appears on the whole the best
view of v. 691, at the same time that it
supplies a subject for <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">dare,</q> which would
otherwise perhaps be too obscure with
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">tibi</q> following. Besides, the latter is
open to one or two objections of its own:
it is not suggested by the immediate context,
which speaks of the burning of the
ships, the Aeolian storm having been dismissed
in v. 792: perhaps also it makes
Venus assume too readily that their journey
is near its end, as if distance and tempests
had been the only causes of its prolongation.
I think then that <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">quod superest</q>
is to be explained of the remaining ships
and their crews, and that the probabilities
of this interpretation here and in v.
691 may fairly be said to strengthen each
other.</p>

<div2 type="commline" n="797">
<p>Most editors take <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">tibi</q> as an

middle of the night, the god of sleep assails
Palinurus with a temptation to quit his
post, but finding him inflexible, throws him

water. Aeneas perceives the loss of his
pilot, supplies his place, and laments him.</q></p>

Serv. Heyne agrees with this preference
of the latter interpretation, but Wagn.

former, which agrees with v. 853. Strictly

the reading of some of Pierius' copies, and
originally of Pal., and so Ribbeck; but
though this would make it easy to take
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">auris</q> as a dat., it would introduce clumsiness
and obvious tautology. Donatus
also read <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">caelo,</q> reading too <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">fallacius</q> for
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">fallacibus,</q> and so making <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">quid&mdash;caelo</q>
parenthetical. A further change, also

but <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">fraude</q> would then be an awkward
and superfluous adjunct of <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">deceptus.</q>
The proposal, revived by Bothe, to take
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">quid enim</q> parenthetically, supplying

to go with <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">fraude,</q> had already
been rejected with reason by Heyne as
contrary to the sense of <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">quid enim.</q>
Accepting the ordinary pointing as the
only natural one, we cannot separate
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">credam</q> from <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">auris,</q> as Jahn still wishes
to do; while on the other hand to understand
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">et deceptus,</q> <q direct="unspecified">and that after having
been deceived,</q> with Heyne, Wagn., &amp;c.,
seems scarcely natural. I would then regard
it as one of the instances where Virg.
has coupled by a copula two forms of expression
not grammatically co-ordinate
(see on 3. 329), <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">fallacibus auris</q> being
equivalent to <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">falsus auris,</q> <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">deceptus caeli
fraude</q> to <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">fraudi caeli quae decepit me.</q>
As such it is rightly included by Wagn. in
his Q. V. 34. 2, though with Heyne he
gives to <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">et</q> the sense of <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">et quidem.</q>
In these cases Virg. generally contents
<pb n="420"/>
himself with coupling two words, such as
an adverb and an adjective: here he goes
farther, so that we might almost class it
with instances of the confusion of two
constructions, were it not that here the

added to this book vv. 1, 2 of Book 6, but
that Tucca and Varius, or some one else (for
the versions of the story vary) transferred
them to their present place. The story is
easily explained if we suppose with Conrads
(see Introduction to this Book) that
the present book is an afterthought, Virg.
having originally intended to bring Aeneas
direct from Carthage to Italy. In that
case vv. 1, 2 of Book 6 really belong to the
later draught, and in that sense are separable
from the lines which they at present
precede. As the poem now stands, no
reader of taste will, I think, wish to disturb

to an imitation of the opening of Il. 7,

an opposite course: but his object there

wish his readers to dwell on Aeneas' last
words about the death of Anchises, and so
purposely carried them farther, that they
might end with a sense of repose.

<div2 type="Introduction" n="intro">
<p>THE celebrity of the Sixth Book of the Aeneid is one of those broad and acknowledged
facts before which minute criticism is almost powerless. There is indeed no part of the
work which more completely exemplifies the characteristics of <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> as a poetical
artist. He appears not only to reproduce Homer, but to absorb him. Aeneas sees all,
or nearly all, that Ulysses sees, his parent, his friends, his enemies, and the heroes
and heroines of previous legend: but he sees much more besides. The bare and
shadowy outlines of the Homeric <foreign lang="greek">nekui/+a</foreign> are filled in with details unquestionably elaborate
and apparently precise. Instead of a place of simply ghostly existence, where
suffering and doing seem to be the exceptions, and dreary, objectless being the rule, we
have a territory mapped out and sharply divided; a neutral region for those who are
unfortunate rather than blameworthy, a barred and bolted prison-house of torture for
the bad, a heroic Valhalla for prowess, genius, and worth. All that later Greek religion
and philosophy taught by legend, allegory, and symbol is pressed into the service of
poetry, and made to contribute to the production of a grand and impressive picture.
As a climax to the whole, the Pythagorean doctrine of transmigration is invoked for
the purpose of showing Aeneas the vision of the future, as he has already seen the
vision of the past. He beholds the spirits that are to appear in each as actors in the
great drama of Roman history, each even now wearing his historical form: and the
line of worthies ends with the young hope of the nation, whose untimely death was still
fresh in the memory of his countrymen when the poet wrote.</p>
<p>Yet, if we approach this wonderful production in detail, we meet with much that
appears to us not only unaccountable or presumably wrong, but demonstrably inconsistent
or confused. It is not merely, as Mr. Gladstone complains,<note anchored="yes" n="1">Homeric Studies, vol. iii. p. 515.</note> that <quote>the Inferno
of <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> has no consistent or veracious relation to any idea of the future or unseen
state actually operative among mankind.</quote> To what extent this charge is true is, as
we shall see, a difficult question; but admitting it not to be wholly groundless, we may
urge that a mythological poem of the Augustan age could not have the same relation
to the real beliefs or anticipations of its readers as the Odyssey, with its absence of
philosophy and its comparative uniformity of legend. The defects I allude to are such
as vitiate not so much the spirit of the work as that about which <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> is generally
more careful, the external structure. Some of these indeed are merely of the nature
<pb n="424"/>
of those which we have already encountered in earlier parts of the poem. In the opening
of the book, while we admire the description of the temple of Cumae and the
ravings of the Sibyl, and confess that <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> has there taken full and worthy advantage
of a supposed form of the supernatural which in Homer's time was only in its
infancy, we must yet feel the awkwardness with which the Homeric Elpenor is introduced
first as <seg lang="la">Misenus above</seg> ground, then as Palinurus below, when a single drowned
friend would have been sufficient both to delay Aeneas' descent and to meet him on
the threshold of the shades. So again it is not clear whether it is to rapidity and
indirectness of narrative or to carelessness that we are to impute the apparent inconsistency
between the intimations that these rivers, one of them ninefold, had to be
passed by any one wishing to penetrate into the infernal world, and the circumstantial
detail which would lead us to suppose that Aeneas only crossed one, and that only once.
But the inconsistency of treatment becomes more serious as we advance farther into
the book. The lower world, as was said just now, is divided by <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> into a neutral
region, a place of torment, and a place of happiness. The two latter present no difficulty:
the conception of the former is not so satisfactory. The general notion seems
to be that it is the receptacle of those who, not having fulfilled their natural time of
life, cannot be pronounced good or bad. This is Addison's view,<note anchored="yes" n="2">Works, vol. ii. p. 300, quarto edition, <date value="1721">1721</date> (cited by Warburton).</note> and it appears to
satisfy the requirements of the passage as well as any that can be suggested: but it
does not show the poet to have formed a consistent conception. Indeed, <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> himself
may be said to point out to us an incongruity in the picture he has drawn, when he
introduces the class of persons who have suffered death by unjust sentences. We are
ready at once to ask whether it is not the business of the tribunal of the other world
to rectify the inequality of earthly judgments: and lest the thought should not occur
to us, <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> suggests it himself by telling us that the cases of these misjudged sufferers
are reheard below. The natural conclusion would be that, after this rehearing, the
spirits, now truly judged, are sent to Tartarus or Elysium: but of this not a word is
said, and we are left to suppose that they remain in the dubious limbo where we
first find them. But the doubt, once raised, extends farther, and we ask whether the
infallible Minos could not pronounce on the real character of all who have been
prematurely cut off. A further question arises as to the nature of premature death.
Tartarus, as afterwards described, contains many who have died before their time by
the visitation of heaven. Is it intended that the Mourning Fields should contain all
who have suffered by human vengeance? Eriphyle is there; would <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> have ventured
to introduce Clytaemnestra? Again, what is to be said of the heroes, who
occupy the extreme part of this neutral region? It is not expressly stated that they
died in war: we merely hear of them as <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">bello clari.</q> <q direct="unspecified">The pale spectre of Adrastus</q>
happens to be the spirit of the only one of the Seven against Thebes who survived the
expedition. But even if we suppose that Virgil's general conception is that of slain
warriors, can we say that he is consistent with himself in placing slain warriors in a
condition neither of torment nor of happiness? There are <seg lang="la">heroes in Elysium</seg>; there
are those who suffered wounds in battle for their country. But among the heroes in
the neutral region there are found not only the assailants of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, but its defenders.
Was theirs not a patriotic cause? or are we to distinguish those who were merely
wounded from those who were killed, and say that the former earned Elysium by their
subsequent lives?</p>
<p>Such are some of the questions that may be raised about the earlier part of this
Book. But they are as nothing to the grand difficulty which the poet has chosen to
create by his philosophy of transmigration. The doctrine is a sublime one, and well
<pb n="425"/>
adapted for poetry: but it is quite incompatible with the conception that pervades the
rest of the description of the lower world. The neutral region, Tartarus, and Elysium,
all dissolve before it. They exist on the assumption that departed spirits remain in a fixed
state, each preserving its own individuality. The later doctrine takes all spirits alike as
soon as they have been separated from the body, puts them through a thousand years'
purgation, and then sends most of them to reanimate other frames. We hear not of
good or bad lives, but of the necessary stains which the ethereal spirit contracts from its
imprisonment in clay. According to this doctrine, Dido and <seg lang="la">Deiphobus, Salmoneus</seg> and
the Lapithae, ought to have undergone a prolonged purification, with a prospect of
resigning their identity and becoming other personages in <seg lang="la">later ages</seg>. Some indeed, of
whom Anchises is the type, are apparently exempted from this general law, and made
to inhabit Elysium immediately after their expiation: but the exemption seems to
proceed from a different feeling from that which established the law, and at any rate
it leaves the great majority of spirits involved in the migratory cycle. There is inconsistency
also in the manner in which the picture of the migration is presented.
While <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> is expounding his doctrine he is clear: when he comes to paint it in its
results he becomes confused. The spirits that are to be Romans are spirits that have
inhabited other bodies. Why do we hear every thing about their future, nothing about
their past? It may be said that they have drunk Lethe and left the past behind.
This may hold good of Silvius and one or two others who are just on the threshold of a
new life on earth: but does it accord with the presumable condition of the later Roman
worthies, such as Augustus himself? They have had their thousand years of purgation:
how are they to spend the remaining thousand years before they become living
men? And what is to be the condition of Silvius and the earlier posterity of Aeneas
after they have fulfilled their new term on earth? Will they reappear in successive
generations as later Romans? These are inquiries which the Pythagorean doctrine
suggests, and which, if treated in an independent manner, and not brought into connexion
with beliefs with which it has nothing to do, it might perhaps have answered.
After this, it is comparatively unimportant to notice the difficulty which many critics
have felt about the two gates of sleep, their want of congruity with the topography of
the rest of the book, and the absence of any reason why Aeneas and the Sibyl should
be dismissed by the ivory gate. This last question is answered, though with some
hesitation, by Gibbon and Heyne, who remark that corporeal visitants could not be
dismissed by the horn gate, not being <q direct="unspecified">true shades.</q> The reply is obvious, that if they
are not <q direct="unspecified">true shades,</q> neither are they <q direct="unspecified">false dreams,</q> and that the inappropriateness of
one mode of exit does not prove the appropriateness of the other, or excuse <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> for
having created so inopportune an alternative.</p>
<p>I must not conclude without saying a few words on Warburton's once celebrated
hypothesis, that Aeneas' descent into the shades is an allegorical description of his
initiation into the mysteries, a process which, it is contended, in pursuance of the
argument of the Divine Legation, was part of the training of every heathen legislator,
such as Aeneas is assumed to be. That hypothesis was controverted, as is well known,
in a characteristic essay by Gibbon, who was probably repelled not more by the
arrogant dogmatism of the untrained scholar than by the zeal of the ecclesiastic in
proving that even pagan times witnessed to the alliance between religion and civil
government. A reader of the present day will, I think, be induced to award the
palm of learning and ingenuity to Warburton. He deals indeed largely in unproved
assumptions, which his skilful adversary is not slow to expose; but he has succeeded in
investing his theory with considerable plausibility, suggesting by its help explanations
of points in Virgil's narrative which it is not easy to clear up otherwise. The theory
in its totality is sufficiently alien from the spirit of modern criticism. No one who
regards <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> as my readers have, I trust, seen reason to regard him, will suspect him
<pb n="426"/>
of intending an elaborate and sustained allegory in this book any more than in the
whole poem. Aeneas is not an anticipation of Augustus, and the descent into the
shades is not simply a poetical account of initiation. But Aeneas has many Augustan
traits, and it is quite possible that several of Virgil's details, as Heyne admits, if not
his general conception, may have been drawn from the mysteries. Gibbon is satisfied
to argue that the mysteries being admitted to be <quote>a theatrical representation of all
that was believed or imagined of the lower world, it is not surprising that the copy.
was like the original:</quote> but that <quote>it still remains undetermined whether <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> intended
to describe the original or the copy.</quote> This argument really proceeds on an assumption
as unwarranted as any of Warburton's, that there was a recognized doctrine on the
subject which the mysteries copied faithfully in detail. As a matter of fact, no such
authorized description of the state of the dead can be shown to have existed. Classical
dictionaries have to compound their accounts of the state of belief on these question
out of many different and indeed discordant materials. <persName><surname>Homer</surname></persName> says one thing, Pindar
another; <seg lang="la">Plato differs</seg> from them both, even when speaking, like them, the language
of fable, and the mythe in one of his dialogues differs from the mythe in another.
The representation in the mysteries differs circumstantially from other mythical representations
that have come down to us; and the question is whether <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> may not
have described the original after the manner of this particular copy. There is some
reason to suspect that in certain instances this was actually the case. Virgil's Elysium,
as Warburton has pointed out, is like that sketched by Aristophanes in the Frogs, and
expressly identified by him with the happy state of the initiated. The inexplicable
golden bough perhaps receives more light from the <quote lang="la">palma auro subtiliter foliata,</quote>
which was carried in the mysteries of Isis, than from any other parallel that has been
adduced. Nay, we may even believe with Warburton that in describing the descent
of Aeneas <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> may have thought of the initiation of Augustus, and that here as
elsewhere, while adopting an incident from Homer, the poet may have had ulterior
purposes of his own. The supposition is shadowy and conjectural; but the thought in
itself is one which might not unnaturally have found place in that assemblage of
antiquarian recollections, philosophical fancies, patriotic feelings, and courtly sentiments
which acted as the motive power on Virgil's imagination. Gibbon objects that Aeneas
is no legislator: but though he performs no acts of legislation in the Aeneid, his spirit
is legislatorial throughout: he is the repository of traditions which are to be handed
down to his posterity, and his destiny, as declared by Jupiter, is to found institutions
as well as walls. Nor need we be concerned to defend <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> from the charge of
having made disclosures which would have led Horace to renounce his friendship.
Warburton's thoroughgoing adherence to his theory obliged him to suppose that the
poet of the Aeneid had actually been initiated, a supposition which Gibbon rightly
rejects as resting on no evidence, and contradicted by the accounts of Virgil's biographer.
But the circumstances connected with initiation were one thing, and the
grand secret itself another: and while the latter has been so successfully preserved as
to have perished with its depositaries, the former meet us openly in ancient literature,
in allusion or in detail, so that we may be sure that they were perfectly at the service
of any uninitiated poet who chose to avail himself of them to garnish and authenticate
his narrative.

Crete: but Sardinia was also mentioned as
a spot to which he went. Italy as well as

his name with its works of art: and

537, of Haemonides. Holdsworth and
Spence (Miscellanea Virgiliana, pp. 207
foll.) distinguish between the priestess and
the Sibyl, who they say, being a goddess,
required some other person to introduce
worshippers to her. But their distinction
is not really borne out by Virg., who must
have intended the same person in vv. 46
foll. and 77 foll., a patent fact which they
are compelled to deny. The Sibyl is nowhere
called a goddess by Virg., as in v.
258 <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">dea</q> is Hecate: she is called a
priestess v. 321, as they admit. It is true,
as they assert, that in Silius Italicus, Book
13, where Scipio goes down into the shades,
he deals in the first instance not with the
Sibyl, but with the priestess Autonoe: but
Silius' Sibyl is not alive, but dead: she is
like Homer's Tiresias, who drinks the
blood of the victim, and then acquires the
power of speech, and tells the visitor what
he wishes to know. They object that Deiphobe
the daughter of Glaucus was not
the Sibyl's name; but there were several
Sibyls, and the Cumaean Sibyl in particular
had several names (Dict. Myth. <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Sibylla</q>),
so that Virg. may have followed
some legend unknown to us, or may have
thought himself at liberty to invent a
name. On the whole subject see Heyne's
Excursus. Glaucus, as the commentators
remark, is a natural personage to be a
Sibyl's father, being himself a prophetic god.</p>

Arruns</quote>), and either would yield an appropriate
sense, as the fates may be represented
either as satisfying the requirements

satisfied (comp. the passages where
the fates are said <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">poscere,</q> 4. 614 &amp;c.).

their fulfilment from some other power.
The question then is whether the Sibyl is
here regarded as the person through whom
a demand is made on destiny, or on whom
the destinies of private persons make their
demand. On the whole I think it must
be left open, as there seems nothing in the

The former is the more difficult reading,
and as such is, I think, rightly restored
by Wagn. There is however still considerable
doubt about the interpretation
of it, as it may be either a possessive gen.
or a locative gen. or dat. The former is
sufficiently supported by 10. 57, <quote lang="la">Totque
maris vastaeque exhausta pericula terrae;</quote>
1. 598, <quote lang="la">terraeque marisque Omnibus exhaustos
iam casibus:</quote> the latter has the
analogy of <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">humi</q> in its favour, and is
defended by such passages as 10. 555, 11.
87, <bibl n="Verg. G. 2.290">G. 2. 290</bibl>, and by <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Cretae</q> 3. 162.
The passage itself is perhaps rather in
favour of the locative, as there would be a
slight harshness in the omission of <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">pericula</q>
if it is intended to be closely constructed
with <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">terrae.</q> Yet it would be
too hazardous to argue from the passages

can be traced more or less clearly in all
three. The etymological history of a case

Peerlkamp thinks, he may have intended
to make the forest easier of entrance than
of exit: but in the subsequent description
the forest is not made an obstacle at all:
Aeneas goes through it under the guidance
of the Sibyl without a hint of difficulty,
and the only real bar is the passage of the
river, which the possession of the bough
enables him to overcome. But Virg. was
thinking of Hom.'s lines about the difficulty
of approaching his Hades, Od. 11.

<p>Whether this notion of propitiating
Proserpine by a golden bough is Virg.'s
own invention we cannot tell. Heyne
acutely argues from v. 409 below that it
probably was a feature in some other
legend. The commentators have collected
many things which might have
suggested the invention to Virgil&mdash;the use
of a bough in supplication, and also in lustration,
the golden rod of Hermes, the
gilded branch in the mysteries of Isis;
while the appearance of the golden bough
in the wood may conceivably have been
suggested, as Heyne thinks, by the golden

the shell to Triton. It is possible

us from Varro that piles were surrounded
with cypresses that the smell of the burning

burning body, and Stat. 9. 460., 5. 54, in
passages apparently imitated from the

Bay was used as well as olive, Juv. 2. 158.

substituted the olive for the bay out of compliment
to Augustus, whose birthday was
marked by the springing up of a bay on the
Palatine, and that it was not thought well
that the triumphal associations of the tree
should be mixed up with funeral reminiscences.
Lersch shows that the olive was

Heyne thinks it a gloss, and Wagn. and
Ribbeck remove it from the text. There
is nothing un-Virgilian about it: Virg. is
fond of talking of the names of places, as
Henry remarks (comp. e. <bibl n="Verg. G. 3.693">g. 3. 693</bibl>): he
refers to a Greek name G .3. 148 (a common
habit with his master Lucr.): and
the expression <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">nomine dicere,</q> to which
Wagn. objects, is found v. 441 below, as is
observed by Forb. On the other hand
the external evidence is such as to leave
the question doubtful, so I have placed the
line in brackets. There is a further question
whether <q direct="unspecified">Aornon</q> or <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Avernum</q>
ought to be read. The MSS. which retain
the line would seem generally in favour of
this latter, which I have adopted: but it
would seem more likely that Virg. would
use the Greek word than the Latin transformation
of it, which hides the etymology.
Is it certain that Lucr. in talking of the
etymology of <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Avernus</q> did not mean to
derive it from <quote lang="la">avis</quote>? Possibly however
Virg. may have so far complied with the

the custom of sacrificing victims to the

those devoted to the gods above being
sacrificed with their heads upturned, the
<foreign lang="greek">au)= e)/rusan</foreign> of Hom. For this he quotes
Myrsilus De Rebus Lesbiacis 2 (? the

cannot suppose that a sacrifice to the infernal
gods is specially meant. All that
is said is that the throat is cut from beneath,
and this might be done equally well
whether the victims' heads were turned
up or down&mdash;more easily indeed in the
former case. It is more probable that the
special reference, if any, is to another
(Roman?) sacrificial custom mentioned by
Cerda in the same note, that of first striking
the victims down with an axe or club,
afterwards cutting their throats, a process
which seems to have required two persons,
according to a passage from Dionys. Hal.

The object of catching the blood is said
by Donatus to be <quote lang="la">ne iam sacratus in

seem to have been just the reverse, as what
was poured on the earth was supposed to
reach the powers below. So Od. 11. 35
Ulysses cuts the throats of the sheep into
a trench, that the shades may flock round
it. Virg. however seems to mean that the
blood is caught in bowls that it may be
afterwards poured out, apparently on the
ground (3. 67., 5. 78). Perhaps we may say
then that this mode of offering was adopted
as giving more solemnity to the act, and
involving as it were a separate consecration
of the blood apart from that of the victims.

it should be considered as itself a sign of
the weakness which it remedies, at the

in which it resembles death,
may naturally impress the imagination as
an actual evil. That it is not fanciful to
attribute such considerations to an ancient
poet may be seen by comparing the Sophoclean
<foreign lang="greek">u(/pnos o( pantogh/rws</foreign> (Ant. 606),

<p>The Furies are mentioned below,
vv. 570 foll., as carrying on their work
within: so that it has been questioned
why they are represented here among the
guardians of the gate. It has been replied
that the Furies may be distinguished from
the Eumenides; that the meaning may be
that they sleep here, but work elsewhere,
a view somewhat favoured by the form
of expression, which speaks of their chambers,
not of themselves, though it would
naturally stand for the Furies and their
chambers; that Virg. has been inconsistent,
perhaps following different legends.
Either of the two latter views seems probable.
Virg. however has doubtless an
object in placing the Furies on the threshold,
which seems to have been their seat
(see on v. 563 below), and there is something
of the same inconsistency in his language
about the Hydra, vv. 287, 576.

and unsubstantial nature of the appearances,
pointed out by the Sibyl in the following
lines. Some of these monsters had
been actually killed, so that it was natural
that they should appear spectrally in
Hades; others, like the Harpies, were
products of the infernal world (comp. 3.
214), and though when appearing on earth
they may have had bodies, they may be
supposed to be divested of them in the
shades, where spirit acts upon spirit. The
train of thought may be the same as that
in Hom. (Od. 11. 602), where though
Hercules himself is among the gods, his
<foreign lang="greek">ei)/dwlon</foreign> is in the shades (comp. Shelley's
<q direct="unspecified">Phantasm of Jupiter</q> in the Prometheus

of the four infernal rivers, as given by
Hom., is very confused. Hom. says briefly,
Od. 10. 513 foll.:

<p>but he does not mention them at all when
he comes to the actual journey of his hero.
Virg. conducts Aeneas over the water circumstantially,
but from his description we
should infer that there is only one river,
which, after being called Acheron or Cocytus
here, turns out eventually to be Styx,
v. 385. Heyne remarks with justice (Excursus
9) that the poet would have found
it awkward to have to describe the passage
of all three, especially as Styx alone is
said to surround the lower world nine
times, v. 439. Generally we may say that
Virg. found the notion of a single river of
death most convenient for poetical purposes,
but that he wished as usual to introduce
the various points of the legends
he followed, and so he employed the names
Acheron, Cocytus, and Styx, whenever the
river was to be spoken of, with a dim conception
of Acheron as emptying itself into
Cocytus, and perhaps of Styx as the most
inward of the three, and a clear one of
Phlegethon as specially surrounding Tartarus.
Plato gives a much more definite
description in his Phaedo, pp. 112, 113,
speaking of four rivers, Ocean, Acheron,
Pyriphlegethon, and Styx, the last of
which disappears under the earth and reappears
as Cocytus, an attempt apparently
to realize the picture in Hom.: and later
Roman poets, as Heyne observes, Exc. 9,
have introduced varieties of their own.</p>

two constructions which are exemplified
in <quote lang="la">Claudius Vinio fictilibus ministrari

<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">ratem,</q> unless we consider <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">velis ministrat</q>

On the other hand Tac. Germ. 44 has
<quote lang="la">naves velis ministrantur,</quote> which makes
strongly for the abl., and Val. F. 3. 38 has
<quote lang="la">ipse ratem vento stellisque ministrat,</quote> evidently
imitating either this passage or that

Apollo sitting in the car with Amphiaraus,

It seems possible to combine both
views: Palinurus would seek for rest as a
consolation for his untimely end, and rest
in the grave after his wanderings, as he
could not have the rest which is the great
theme of the Aeneid, rest in a Trojan settlement.
This latter view will not oblige

</div2>
<div2 type="commline" n="430">
<p>The meaning seems clear, that a
<seg lang="la">separate place</seg> is assigned to those who
have met their death by unjust condemnation.
It has been asked why they should
be made to suffer: but there is no suffering
in this part of the shades; there is
merely the absence of the enjoyment of
life, the Homeric condition of the dead
which <seg lang="la">Achilles declares</seg> to be worse than
the lowest function on earth. That they
should endure this is not unjust: the
iniquity which dismissed them from life
does not make their lives good or bad;
that is decided by Minos, as we shall see
immediately. We should expect however
that they would not occupy this place permanently,
but that on the rehearing of
their case some would be despatched to
Tartarus, others to Elysium. But Virg.
does not say this, and if we compare the
case of these persons with those of the
<pb n="477"/>
infants and the suicides, we may doubt
whether he intended it. Infants remain
in their limbo apparently because they
have had no opportunity of showing whether
they were worthy of Elysium or of
Tartarus; those who have cut short their
own lives are not to be credited with the
good or evil of their lives, but are consigned
at once and for ever to a twilight
condition like that imagined by Hom.:
and so perhaps the victims of unjust sentences
may be dealt with as those who
having accidentally come into the state of
death are exempted alike from reward and
punishment. But we must not probe Virg.'s
meaning too deeply: he has deserted the
simplicity of Hom. for something far
more complicated, and it is not surprising
that in borrowing details from other sources
he should have been led occasionally to combine
inconsistencies. Warburton thought
the reference here was to a story in Plato's
Gorgias, pp. 523 foll., where the establishment
of infernal judges is said to have been
owing to the inequality of the sentences
originally passed by living judges who had
to decide the condition after death of those
who were still in the body. Virg. may
have thought of this: but his words are
hardly reconcilable with it, as Warburton
admits by his proposal to alter <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">crimine</q>
into <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">tempore.</q> Virg. coincides with Plato
in putting the place of judgment before
the spot where the roads to Tartarus and
Elysium diverge (vv. 540 foll.), and also in
particularizing Minos, who according to
Plato is a supreme judge of appeal, Asiatics
being judged in the first instance by Rhadamanthus,
Europeans by Aeacus. Virg.
may also have thought of another passage
in Plato, of which Cerda reminds us&mdash;that
in the Apology, p. 41 B, where Socrates
dwells on the pleasure of meeting in the
shades those who, like himself, have died
in consequence of an unjust sentence, <foreign lang="greek">ei)/
tis tw=n palaiw=n dia\ kri/sin a)/dikon te/qnhke</foreign>,
such as Palamedes and the greater Ajax,
though it is clear that if Plato had been
asked where he intended to place these, he
would have replied, in Elysium. There
still remains a difficulty about the construction,
as <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">mortis</q> may be connected
either with <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">damnati</q> or with <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">crimine.</q>
Perhaps in the absence of any instance of
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">crimen mortis</q>=<quote lang="la">crimen capitale</quote> (comp.
<quote lang="la">caussa capitis,</quote> <quote lang="la">iudicium capitis</quote>), it
will be safer to adopt the former, <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">damnatus</q>
with the gen. of the punishment
being sufficiently common (see Forc. s. v.).</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="commline" n="431">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Hae sedes</lemma> seems to be used
generally of the lower world, so that this
and the two following lines will be virtually
parenthetical. At the same time it
would be too much to suppose that Virg.
meant to commit himself to stating that
the jurisdiction of Minos extended to all
those who came down into the shades; we
should rather infer, as was hinted in the
last note, that some at least of those who
died prematurely were left without any
judgment at all, and consigned neither to
Tartarus nor to Elysium. What the effect
of this new judgment is on those on whom
it is undoubtedly meant to operate, the
falsely condemned, he has not told us, and
perhaps he did not clearly realize himself.
Meantime in this line, as in those that
follow, he has introduced the phraseology
of the Roman law, <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">sine sorte</q> apparently
referring to the <quote lang="la">sortitio iudicum,</quote> the
choice by lot of <quote lang="la">iudices</quote> for a particular
case out of the whole judicial body. (The
notion of Serv. and some early critics that
the reference is to the drawing of lots
to decide the order in which the causes
should come on is far less likely.) In any
<seg lang="la">case Minos</seg> is represented as <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">quaesitor,</q>
the name given to the presiding magistrate
on a Roman criminal trial, who was assisted
by the <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">iudices</q> just mentioned. To say any
thing definite about those who in the world
below would answer to these <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">iudices</q> would
have been embarrassing to Virg., as, if
Rhadamanthus and Aeacus were meant,
they would hold their places without <quote lang="la">sortitio,</quote>
while it would not be easy to conceive
of a judicial body among the shades
themselves: so the poet as usual leaves
the matter in obscurity. The pseudoAsconius
however, commenting on Cic.
Verr. Act. 1. 10, refers to this passage in
the following words: <quote lang="la">Ad hanc similitudinem
poeta Vergilius Minoem, iudicem
apud inferos, tanquam si praetor sit rerum
capitalium, <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">quaesitorem</q> <seg lang="la">appellat: dat

vocat:</q> <seg lang="la">dat cognitionem facinorum,
cum dicit</seg> <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">vitasque et crimina
discit.</q></quote> But though <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">consilium</q> is the
technical term for the <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">iudices</q> in relation
to the presiding magistrate, and the word
is found in Pal. and Gud. a m. p., the context
is against it, as we should expect the

Another interpretation, also mentioned

these words to be the poet's, as if, just as

attention to the sentry at the gate, whom
Aeneas can see, and then proceeds to
speak of the horrors within, which he
cannot see. <quote lang="la">Foribus cardo stridebat

spoken of, <quote lang="la">Despectum praebet sub terras

<pb n="496"/>
The occurrence of <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">hiatibus</q> in v. 576
cannot be unconnected with the presence
of <quote lang="la">hiatus</quote> in Lucr. l. c., so that we may
imagine either that having talked of <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">hiatibus</q>
Virg. was reminded of <quote lang="la">hiatus</quote> in
Lucr. and so of the whole passage, or that
having imitated the passage he was led to
recast v. 576 so as to introduce <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">hiatibus.</q>
There is of course much scope for fancy in
this kind of criticism; but a subtle imitator
like Virg. may be said specially to invite
it, and those who are themselves accustomed
to composition will be interested in
pursuing it, even though indisposed to
build much on its apparent results.</p>

<div2 type="commline" n="579">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Suspectus</lemma> occurs again 9. 530,
where we hear of a tower <quote lang="la">vasto suspectu.</quote>
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Caeli suspectus</q> evidently means
the looking up to heaven, <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">ad aetherium
Olympum</q> being added to develope the
thought. The meaning then will be that
the gulf of Tartarus extends twice as far
below the ground of the infernal regions
which Aeneas and the Sibyl are traversing,
as the heaven extends above the earth.
To this explanation we are helped by the
words of Hom. quoted on v. 577. We
should have expected some mention of the
earth, but Virg., writing with Hom. and
Lucr. in his mind, was perhaps less likely
to cultivate perfect clearness of expression,
and he doubtless intended <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">suspectus</q> to
be pressed, the earth being the only place
from which a person could look up to
heaven. This seems more likely than the
view apparently held by Donatus and
glanced at by Heyne, which would make
the meaning to be that the depth of
Tartarus below the infernal plains is as
great as the height of heaven viewed, if it
could be viewed, from the infernal plains;
though there would be nothing harsh in
thus slurring over <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">suspectus,</q> if we did
not suppose Virg. to have the parallel of
Hom. in his mind. Comp. <bibl n="Verg. G. 1.243">G. 1. 243</bibl> (note),
where <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">videt</q> is used as loosely as <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">suspectus</q>
would be according to this interpretation.
A third view is mentioned by
Forb. as Henry's, who however does not
give it in his own note on this passage,
viz. that <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">caeli suspectus</q> means the looking
up from the floor of the sky to the
highest point of Olympus, which he supposes
to be meant by <quote lang="la">vertice caeli</quote> 1.
225. This view also would have much to
recommend it, introducing as it does a
striking comparison between the heights
of heaven and the depths of the shades,
but for the parallel in Hom. Petit ingeniously
proposed to substitute <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">terra</q>
for <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">caeli</q> here, introducing <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">caeli</q> for
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Terrae</q> in the next verse. Ladewig, following

that Salmoneus is described as struck with
vengeance in the very midst of his impious
triumph. We may say if we please that
the sight of his punishment recalls the
thought of his impiety, and so that the
Sibyl may be said to have witnessed the
latter as still continuing. The construction
generally resembles that in the well-known

<p>Tityos actually appears in the
shades in Od. 11. 576 foll., a passage of
part of which this is an expanded translation.
Virg. is also indebted to the celebrated
lines of <bibl n="Lucr. 3.984">Lucr. 3.984</bibl> foll., where
the sufferings of Tityos are described and
pronounced to be a symbolic representation
of the effects of passion. Hom. (who
mentions two vultures) says nothing about
the growing again of the liver, and Lucr. makes it an objection to the literal truth
of the story that the liver must come to
an end, in spite of its gigantic size as inferred
from the size of the body. Virg.
may be said to have met this objection by
introducing the circumstance of the imperishability
of the liver, apparently from
the story of Prometheus, as we shall see on
v. 598: he has not however been <seg lang="la">quite consistent</seg>
with himself, as v. 599 will show.
<q direct="unspecified">Omniparentis:</q> <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">omnipotentis</q> is the
reading a m. p. of Med. and fragm. Vat.,
quoted too by Arusianus and Nonius.
<q direct="unspecified">Omnipatentis</q> is found in one MS.
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Omnipotens</q> would not be a natural
epithet of the earth, <quote lang="la">omnipotentis
Olympi</quote> 10. 1, as Wagn. remarks, not
being in point; and the error is one into
which a transcriber would most naturally
fall. <q direct="unspecified">Omniparens</q> on the other hand is
found twice in Lucr. as an epithet of the
earth (2. 706., 5. 259), and is a translation,
as Heyne remarks, of <foreign lang="greek">pammh/teira</foreign>.
Hom. affords no help, as his words are
<foreign lang="greek">*gai/hs e)rikude/os ui(o/n</foreign>, unless it should be
contended that <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">omnipotentis</q> is a translation,
an awkward one at best, of <foreign lang="greek">e)rikude/os</foreign>.
Still though <q direct="unspecified">omniparentis</q> appears
to be Virg.'s word, it may be
doubted whether he would not have done
more wisely in following Hom. more
closely, as it detracts from the grandeur
of Tityos' descent as one of the earthborn
to intimate in the same breath that the
earth is the mother of all. <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Alumnus</q>
expresses the relation of a child to the
nurse rather than to the mother; but the
two lie so near together that they are
often identified. Comp. vv. 876 foll. below,

There is however a legend, which Virg.

Cerda reminds us appropriately that the
liver was regarded by the ancients as the
seat of passion, so that Tityos, the ravisher,
is suitably punished: Lucr. however has
not taken advantage of this in moralizing
the legend, not mentioning the liver even
in his description of Tityos' sufferings.</p>

the advantage of variety, partly that of

fearful abyss, and, after distinguishing a
few figures, were to find himself unable to
disentangle his impressions of the sufferers

for the whole class of hitherto unnamed

chosen not as those which the persons specified

there is a dramatic and poetical propriety,

Tantalus as tormented with perpetual

connect this punishment with the preceding,
Ixion and Pirithous, whom they
suppose to be placed under the overhanging
rock, and also tormented by the presence
of a banquet which they cannot enjoy.
This may perhaps be supported by Stat.
Theb. 1. 712,
<quote lang="la"><l>ultrix tibi torva Megaera</l>
<l>Ieiunum Phlegyam subter cava saxa
iacentem</l>
<l>Aeterno premit accubitu dapibusque
profanis</l>
<l>Instimulat: sed mixta famem fastidia
vincunt,</l>
</quote></p>
<p>but though the mention of Megaera and
the word <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">accubitus</q> show that Stat. had
this passage of Virg. in his mind, the
banquet he is thinking of is the banquet
which Tantalus served up of his child's
flesh, supposed to be repeated in the
lower world, so that we cannot argue
from the imitation to the right interpretation
of the passage imitated. On the
other hand, the two punishments are not
easily combined in thought, the point of
the terror of the overhanging rock being
that it distracts the victim's mind from
any thing else, while the banquet is represented
as rendered impossible, not by the
alarm of the rock, but by the interference
of the Fury. If the view taken on v. 601
is the correct one, there is of course a
further reason for supposing more than
one punishment to be spoken of. On the
whole then I think that two punishments
are named, and those only as specimens
of an infinite number. The hint of the
banquet is evidently given by the Homeric
description of Tantalus, but the circumstances
are varied with considerable judgment,
the board spread with artificial
dainties being substituted for the simpler
features of lake-water and orchard-trees.
In Val. Fl. 2. 192 foll. Theseus and
Phlegyas are represented as doomed to sit
at a similar banquet, the poet having
either followed another legend, or availed
himself of Virg.'s example to introduce
changes of his own. <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Geniales tori</q> are
entirely different from the <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">lectus genialis</q>
or bridal bed, though both receive their
name from the genius, the deification of
the happier and more impulsive part of
man (see on <bibl n="Verg. G. 1.302">G. 1. 302</bibl>). <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Genialis dies</q> is
a feast-day, and so <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">genialis torus</q> is a
banqueting couch, whether the expression
is Virg.'s own or borrowed from common
language. <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Altis:</q> so <quote lang="la">toro ab alto</quote> 2. 2.
The second epithet is rather awkward,
but it is doubtless to be explained with
Wagn. on 5. 24 by saying that <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">genialis

is added as a piece of ornamental description.

of the propositions involved in his precept.

points the same way. But it
signifies little what was the precise image
Virg. had before his mind, the real point
being that the spirit is hung up in such a
way as to secure its purification by air.

<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">inanes</q> here the nom., supposing the
meaning to be that the winds blow through

there would however be something awkward
in the predicative epithet here, when
we have already to connect <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">suspensae</q>
closely with <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">panduntur;</q> and it is possible
that the same meaning may be intended
by the application of the epithet to the
winds, which being thin and unsubstantial,
<pb n="517"/>
are conceived of as the more penetrating.
Notices of this threefold purification are
cited by Cerda from Martianus Capella and
St. Augustin: but it is not clear that they,
any more than Serv., had any further
authority for the custom than the present

seems more than doubtful): but such a
use of the compound is abundantly defended

enucleata esse suffragia</quote> Cic. Planc. 4.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="commline" n="743, 744">
<p>These lines are among the
hardest in Virg. The first sentence <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Quisque&mdash;Manis</q>
has puzzled the commentators
perhaps more than it would have done had
they sufficiently remembered Virg.'s fondness
for artificial phrases. The general
meaning evidently is <q direct="unspecified">Each spirit has its
individual discipline.</q> This Virg. has
apparently chosen to express by saying
<q direct="unspecified">Each of us suffers his own Manes,</q> the
Manes, which appear to have been a sort
of twofold genius belonging to each person
(see on 4. 610), being regarded as separable
from the person himself, and as subjecting
him to inflictions: at the same time that
Virg. probably intended to avail himself of
other possible constructions, the cognate
accusative, <q direct="unspecified">Each suffers spiritual suffering,</q>
and the accusative of definition, <q direct="unspecified">Each
suffers as to his spirit.</q> The suggestion
that the Genius is meant is made by Serv.,
but it seems better not to regard it as
exhausting the meaning of the passage, as
the Manes or Genius elsewhere appear to
stand for the deified individual, and their
visitations, as in 4. 610, take effect not on
the individual himself but on his enemies.
We are also helped by the consideration
that elsewhere in Virg. the infernal powers
are spoken of loosely as <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Manes</q> (10. 39.,
12. 646, <bibl n="Verg. G. 4.489">G. 4. 489</bibl>, 505), though it would
be too much to infer from this with Cerda
and others that <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Manes</q> here simply =
<q direct="unspecified">Furies,</q> if it were only that the words so
interpreted would be open to the objection
made in the last sentence, the Furies of a
person generally meaning not the Furies
that punish a person, but those which,
being his embodied curses, punish his
enemies (see on 4. 384). It is true that
there is a distinct instance where <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Manes</q>
appears to be used for spiritual punishment,
Stat. Theb. 8. 84, <quote lang="la">At tibi quos,
inquit, Manis?</quote> but this proves no more
than that Stat. there as elsewhere ventured
on an experiment in language in imitation,
as he thought, of Virg. Professor Munro,
Journal of Philology, vol. 2, pp. 145, 146
says, <quote><q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Quisque suos patimur Manis</q> I
am convinced means simply, <q direct="unspecified">we put on,
bear the burden, each one of us good or
bad, of his own manes or garb of death,</q> i.e.
the shadowy semblance of one's living self
which the dead spirit was supposed to assume
at the funeral pile or elsewhere. This
is illustrated by the old picture in the
Vatican Virgil, and, as I think, by Sen.
Hipp. 1226, <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Donator atrae lucis, Alcide,
tuum Diti remitte munus, ereptos mihi
Restitue manis: inpius frustra invoco Mortem
relictam.</q></quote> The difficulty of what
follows is greater. The words are easy,
but it is not easy to see the appropriateness
of the sentence to the context. As
they stand, they appear to speak of a second
purgation as going on in Elysium,
which is in itself not a very likely thing,
while the change of person from <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">mittimur</q>
and <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">tenemus</q> to <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">revisant</q> v. 750
has still to be accounted for. Jahn, whose
<pb n="518"/>
explanation is approved by Forb., supposes
that all the shades are sent into Elysium
after their purgation, but that while the
greater part only pass through on their
way to Lethe, a few, of whom Anchises is
one, are allowed to remain there and complete
a still higher purification, as a prelude
to a new and glorious life on earth.
This is probably as plausible an explanation
as is likely to be suggested of the passage
as it stands, but the inconsistencies of it
lie on the surface. Elysium, as has been
said above, is not a natural place for purgation;
it is evidently the everlasting
reward of a good life, not a place of temporary
sojourn previous to a return to
earth: there is nothing in vv. 741, 742, as
compared with vv. 745&mdash;747, to show that
the degree of purification contemplated in
the latter is intended to be higher than
that in the former: the <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">mille anni</q> of v.
748 are plainly parallel to the <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">longa dies</q>
of v. 745; and it can hardly be meant
that the more highly purified spirits return
to earth without a draught of Lethe. A
general view of the context seems to require,
as Heyne and some of the early
editors, and more lately Henry, have seen,
that the souls which are purified and sent
back to earth should be distinguished from
the select few who are purified and established
in Elysium, and this the change of
person decidedly favours. The words
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">pauci&mdash;tenemus</q> then, if not the previous
clause, will refer to the latter, the
whole of the following lines to the former,
who, as being far the larger number, are
spoken of as if they were the whole body.
But this sense, though required by the
context and favoured by the language,
does not suit the order of the passage.
Heyne and his contemporaries wished to
get rid of the difficulty by transposing the
two lines before us, which is Ribbeck's
remedy; Henry thinks they are no more
than an ordinary Virgilian parenthesis.
The first suggestion appears to me as
much too violent as the second is too
lenient. The supposition of a confusion of
the order introduced by the transcribers
is at all times hazardous (see on <bibl n="Verg. G. 4.203">G. 4. 203</bibl>
&mdash;205), and is exposed to unusual suspicion
here, as the lines would still look awkward
if placed, where alone they could be placed,
after v. 747, so that Heyne inclines to
treat them as altogether spurious; while
on the other hand, if Virg. intended no
more than an ordinary parenthesis, it
must be admitted that his sentence is exceedingly
ill constructed. I think then
that every thing points to the supposition,
which at one time occurred to Heyne himself,
that we have here one of the passages
in the Aeneid (the case of the Georgics is
different: see on <bibl n="Verg. G. 4.203">G. 4. 203</bibl>&mdash;205) which
Virg. left unfinished. His whole conception
of a metempsychosis seems, as I have
said in the prefatory remarks to this book,
to be really inconsistent with the general
picture which he gives of the world of
spirits, and so he naturally found a difficulty
in harmonizing the two in Anchises'
narrative. Had the Aeneid been a
finished poem, the obstacle would doubtless
have been surmounted so far as
the mechanical structure of the present
passage is concerned, but we should have
felt it nevertheless in reading the Sixth
Book. A doubt still remains whether
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">mittimur</q> refers to the whole body of the
departed, as <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">patimur</q> evidently does, or
to the few spoken of in the next clause.
In the one case the meaning will be that
the whole multitude is sent through Elysium,
the greater part to drink the Lethe
water and then return to life, the few to remain
in Elysium: in the other, that the few
are distributed among the spacious plains,
a use of <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">per</q> for which see on 1. 680.
On the whole the former view seems to
agree best with the language of these two
lines, while any objection which may be
raised to it from the language of vv. 748
foll., where Lethe seems to be introduced
for the first time, is obviated by the
consideration mentioned above, that the
present passage as left by Virg. is not
meant to cohere with the context. <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Pauci

punished through ten periods of a hundred
years each, a hundred years being the
estimated length of a life-time on earth,

<div2 type="commline" n="764">
<p>The story, as told by Serv. here
and on 1. 270 and others (Lewis, p. 356), is
<pb n="521"/>
that Lavinia was left pregnant at Aeneas'
death, when, fearing Ascanius, she took
refuge in the woods, and there brought
forth Silvius; after which an arrangement,
variously related, was made, by which Lavinium
was left to Lavinia, and Ascanius
founded Alba. In the latter kingdom
Silvius eventually succeeded Ascanius,
either in default of heirs, or because the
actual heir, named Iulus, was too young.
Some made Silvius the son of Ascanius,
and so Livy 1. 4, who speaks of him as
<quote lang="la">casu quodam in silvis natus.</quote> Virg. apparently
adopts the tradition generally,
without thinking it necessary to specify
the circumstances of Silvius' birth in the
woods, while he indirectly contradicts the
story of Lavinia's fear of Ascanius, which
would have jarred on all readers of the
Aeneid, by representing Silvius as born in
his father's lifetime. The legends of the
sequel of Aeneas' life after his settlement
in Latium are not altogether reconcilable
with the treatment adopted by Virg. in
the Aeneid. Virg. doubtless could have
harmonized them with his purpose, had
he pleased, as skilfully as he has harmonized
discordant materials in the story of
the Aeneid itself: but he has chosen instead
to regard them from a distance,
without distinctly committing himself to
any one version of them. Even thus however
he has not been able to escape some
inconsistencies, as the present passage
shows, compared with that in the First
Book. There (1. 265 foll.) we are told by
implication that Aeneas' death and deification
takes place three years after his landing
in Latium: here he is spoken of as
living to old age, a time which must have
been conceived of by Virg. as long subsequent
to that in which he captivated
Dido: there the name of Ascanius is associated
with Alba, here that of Silvius.
These statements, it is true, may be
brought into agreement by supposing that
Aeneas reigns at Lavinium after the expiration
of three years in camp, Ascanius
removing to Alba after his death, and that
Silvius is mentioned here simply as the
successor of <seg lang="la">Ascanius at Alba</seg>; but it
seems hardly likely that Virg. should have
formed a definite and, in one respect at
least, independent conception of events
which he alludes to so cursorily. With
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">serum</q> Germ. comp. Evander's words to
Pallas, 8. 581, <quote lang="la">mea sola et sera voluptas.</quote>
This is the first mention of the name of
Aeneas' destined wife, who has been already
alluded to 2. 783., 6. 93. Serv.
curiously reconciles <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">longaevo</q> with the
posthumous birth of Silvius by understanding
it of the immortal life of the
deified Aeneas, as the Greeks call the gods

one peculiarly consonant to the etymology
of the word. Perhaps on a comparison of
7. 763 we may say that Virg. meant to
glance at both meanings (comp. also the
association of <foreign lang="greek">ti/ktein</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">tre/fein</foreign> in Greek
tragedy), though in v. 779 it can hardly

it by saying that <seg lang="la">Aeneas Silvius</seg> was
kept out of his kingdom for fifty-three

Lewis rightly remarks that Serv.'s story
is inconsistent with Dionysius and others,

given only to those who distinguished

other ancient honours however it was voted
by the senate to Augustus, who had oaken
wreaths hung before his doors as being the
perpetual preserver of the citizens. Gossrau,
from whom this is taken, refers to Ov.

<p>The right meaning of this verse,
I have little doubt, has been substantially
given by Peerlkamp and Henry, after Serv.
Romulus is already marked as a child of
upper air (comp. <quote lang="la">apud superos</quote> v. 568
above) by his father's token, the twocrested
helmet. The reference apparently
is to the contingency which more or less
overshadows all who are in this state of
potential existence (note on v. 769), and
which Romulus by favour of his future
father Mars has in fact already overcome.
Henry's objection, that <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">pater ipse</q> in
Virg. is restricted to Jupiter, is met by
observing that <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">ipse</q> here belongs not so
much to <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">pater</q> as to <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">suo.</q> That the
two-crested helmet was distinctive of Mars
is, as Henry says, made probable by Val.
Max. 1. 8, &sect; 6, taken in conjunction with
this passage, <quote lang="la">cognitum pariter atque
creditum est, Martem patrem tunc populo

with a helmet. <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Suo</q> can only
refer to <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">pater,</q> as <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">ipse</q> shows. The
only difficulty is in the use of <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">superum</q>
in the singular in the sense which, as we
have seen, it bears in the plural; but this
is not invincible (comp. its application to
things vv. 128, 680), and certainly need
not lead us to construct <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">superum</q> as gen.
pl. with either <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">pater</q> or <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">honore,</q> to the

where Virg. has pointed out what nature
offers, and asks whether man will not do
his part. So here Anchises, after showing
the glorious culmination of the Trojan
fortunes in Augustus, asks whether Aeneas
hesitates to take his place as a link in that
vast chain of destiny. The reading of the
concluding words is doubtful. Med. has
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">virtutem extendere factis,</q> which is supported

MSS. have <quote lang="la">virtute extendere viris,</quote>
which is confirmed by Diomedes p. 411,
whose MSS. have <quote lang="la">virtutem extendere

nevertheless in Gud. a m. p. The sense
would be nearly the same, to extend our
power by our bravery, to commence the

easy to see how the variation can have
arisen. If Med. stood alone as the chief
authority for <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">factis,</q> there would be no

case is not so clear): but Serv. of course
has an independent weight. On the whole,
however, I have with Ribbeck preferred
the reading of Rom. and Pal., as I see no
plausible hypothesis on which its introduction
can be accounted for, an argument
which has similarly determined my judgment

Roman history. Wagn. thought the question

<p>This second <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">ille</q> has been variously
identified. Hyginus, quoted by
Gell. 10. 16, assumed that Mummius was
still intended, and accused Virg. of confounding
two distinct events, Mummius'
campaign and the war with Pyrrhus,
whom he supposes to be intended by
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Aeaciden,</q> his conclusion being that Virg.
would doubtless have altered the passage
had he lived, and that if v. 839 were
excluded, all would be right. Gossrau still
pleads for Mummius, contending with
considerable ingenuity that Anchises in
the preceding couplet has expressed himself
in Roman imagery, and now repeats his
meaning in words more intelligible to
Aeneas, who knew nothing of Corinth or
the Capitol, and would only conceive of
the conquest of Greece as a victory over
the descendants of Achilles or the destruction
of the empire of Agamemnon. But
Anchises is not elsewhere so considerate
to his son's ignorance, referring as he does
throughout to Roman exploits in Roman
language: nor is it credible that <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">ipsum
Aeaciden</q> should have been used not for
an individual but for the descendants of
Achilles generally. The argument that if
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">ultus</q> &amp;c. v. 840 be referred to any one
but Mummius, Virg. virtually denies that
Mummius did execute this revenge, needs
no refutation. So far as the language is
concerned, it would certainly seem that
the second <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">ille</q> denotes a different person
from the first. The most probable candidate
for this honour appears to be L.
<seg lang="la">Aemilius Paullus</seg>, the conqueror of Macedon,
v. 839 being understood of his victory
over Perseus, who is said by Prop. 5. 11.
39, Sil. 15. 291 (speaking of his father
Philip) to have been a descendant of
Achilles; though there still remains a difficulty,
as Paullus was not the destroyer of
Argos and Mycenae. We must suppose
then that Virg. has written loosely, perhaps
conceiving that the indefinite <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">ille&mdash;ille</q>
exempted him from the need of strict
accuracy. Heyne suggests that <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">ipsum
Aeaciden</q> may refer to Paullus' cruel
destruction of the Epirots, supposed to be
represented by their ancestor Pyrrhus
(agreeably to the well-known line of
<pb n="531"/>
Ennius, <quote lang="la">Aio te, Aeacida, Romanos vincere

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Orabunt caussas melius</lemma> has
perplexed commentators and critics, from
Cerda to De Quincey (Works, vol. 14, p. 67,
first Eng. ed.), who cannot understand why
Virg. should have conceded to Greece superiority
in oratory, and in some cases even
insinuate that he must have been jealous
of the fame of Cicero. But Virg.'s concession
is made in a liberal and magnificent
spirit, in order that the real fame of his
countrymen as warriors and statesmen
may appear greater: and it is not likely
that he thought of the number of individual
reputations that the position thus
assumed compelled him to sacrifice. In
the general proposition, that the real
greatness of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> lay in acts of war and
policy, all moderns will agree with him:
and whether he has specified oratory
among the pursuits in which other nations
are allowed to excel or has left it to
be inferred is a matter of little consequence.
He would doubtless have specified
poetry with equal or greater readiness,
if he had not felt that the very mention
of it would have implied a latent
egotism. <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Caeli meatus</q> like <quote lang="la">caeli vias</quote>

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Ars</lemma> or <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">artes</q> is a common expression
for pursuits or appliances of any
kind: here however there is probably a
reference to its stricter sense. <q direct="unspecified">These
shall be <emph>your</emph> arts</q>&mdash;these shall stand to
you in the place of sculpture, eloquence,
and astronomy. Pal. a m. pr. and three
inferior MSS. have <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">haec,</q> and so Ribbeck:
but though it is not unlikely that copyists
should have been puzzled by the older form
of the nom. fem. plural, as they doubtless
were in <bibl n="Verg. G. 3.305">G. 3. 305</bibl>, where I would now
read <quote lang="la">Haec&mdash;tuendae,</quote> the external authority

<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Inponere</q> &amp;c. are in apposition with

all the best MSS. (Pal. and Gud. as well

to be trusted) appear to give <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">paci,</q> which
Ribbeck adopts. Admitting the difficulty
of the question, I have on the whole preferred
to abide by the more usual reading,
which is found in Serv., <quote lang="la">leges pacis,</quote> and
supported by Livy 9. 14, <quote lang="la">gentem quae
suarum inpotens rerum prae domesticis

Wagn. <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Morem pacis inponere</q> however

with <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">paci,</q> though I am not sure that it
would be Virgilian to understand <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">paci</q>
as i. q. <quote lang="la">pacatis gentibus.</quote> Perhaps we
might say that peace is curbed by institutions
which prevent it from degenerating
into luxury and licence, or that it is restrained
by being made lasting. No parallel
however occurs to me in Virg. or any
other author, which would clear up the expression.
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Pacis</q> on the other hand is
further confirmed by <quote lang="la">pacis dicere leges</quote>
12. 112, which is parallel in expression

is quoted from an edict of Augustus by
Suet. Aug. 28. Comp. also the phrase
<quote lang="la">nec sisti posse,</quote> common in Livy (3. 9,
16, 20 &amp;c.). So the epithet <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">stator,</q> which
was used not only of Jupiter as the stayer
of flight (Livy 1. 12, comp. by Forb.), but
of Jupiter and other gods as supporters of
Rome. <quote lang="la">Auctor ac stator Romani nominis,
Gradive Mars</quote> Vell. 2. 131. It is
not altogether easy to say whether <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">eques</q>
should go with <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">sistet</q> or with <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">sternet.</q>
The combat in which Marcellus gained
the <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">spolia opima</q> was a combat of cavalry
(Dict. B. <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Marcellus</q>): and though <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">sternet,</q>
as Wagn. remarks, goes more naturally
with <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">eques</q> than <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">sistet,</q> it does not seem
certain that Marcellus' advantages against
the Carthaginians had any special connexion
with cavalry. Gossrau however
refers to Sil. 12. 178 foll., who speaks as if
the sally from Nola, memorable as the first
success obtained against Hannibal, were
chiefly one of cavalry: but this does not
specially appear in the account in Livy 23.

<p>There is a difficulty about <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">suspendet

Romulus, the author of the custom, dedicated
the first <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">spolia opima</q> to Jupiter
Feretrius. Serv. explains it by referring
to a law of Numa's, which is said to have
enjoined that on the first winning of
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">spolia opima</q> they should be offered to
Jupiter Feretrius, as had been already
done by Romulus; on the second to Mars,
which was done by Cossus; on the third
to Quirinus. Livy however, 3. 20, distinctly
speaks of the <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">spolia opima</q> of
Cossus as dedicated to Jupiter Feretrius:
and Prop. 5. 10. 45 talks of <quote lang="la">spolia in

an alternative to separate <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">patri</q> from
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Quirino,</q> taking <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">patri</q> of Jupiter, and

all of course flow from a single notion. In
the case of <q direct="unspecified">instar</q> it seems probable from

notion was something like <q direct="unspecified">standard.</q>
This will explain all the instances where it
is used with the gen. in the sense of
resemblance (comp. <quote lang="la">ad modum</quote>). There
seems no doubt that in some passages (e.g.
Suet. Caes. 61, <quote lang="la">cuius etiam instar pro
aede Veneris genetricis dedicavit</quote>) it means
a representation, but it does not appear
that there is any trace of this earlier than
Livy, so that we need not assume it to be
the original notion of the word, at the
same time that we can quite account for
it as a meaning that may have been
attached to it in subsequent usage. Here
then it might possibly be taken with Serv.
&amp;c. in the sense of <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">similitudo.</q> It is to
be observed however that Virg. elsewhere
uses the word in connexion with size (2.
15., 3. 637., 7. 707), so that I would
rather suppose the meaning to be, with
Heyne, <q direct="unspecified">how commanding is his presence,</q>
which is besides suggested by the context.
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Ipso</q> is evidently meant to distinguish
him from those about him, so that we

607. The gates of Sleep are from Hom.'s
gates of dreams, which are similarly described
Od. 19. 562 foll. Much ingenuity
has been expended in searching for a
symbolical meaning in them. Heyne
seems right in saying that Virg. wanted
to dismiss Aeneas from the shades by
some other way than that by which he
had entered, and that Hom.'s gates fortunately
occurred to him. See Introduction
to this Book. Turnebus and
others wanted to understand <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">somni</q> as
<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">somnii:</q> but <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">somnii</q> would not be the

to suppose a slight carelessness on Virg.'s

the great MSS. Ribbeck cuts the knot
by bracketing v. 901, which is repeated
from 3. 277. Perhaps we may say that
Virg. inserted it as a piece of his own epic
common-place, whether as a stop-gap or
not, and that this accounts for the repetition
of <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">litore.</q> The mention of Caieta has
been objected to, as inconsistent with the

that the death of <seg lang="la">Caieta, Aeneas</seg>' nurse,
was the occasion of the name. But this is
natural and Virgilian enough; and we can
hardly wish that the poet had rivalled the

<p><cit><quote>THEN, binding round their brows the mystic branch of bay, they rose, and in silence
entered upon holy ground. . . . . . Fronting them rose the high altar, crowned, like
the rest, with laurel, on which all must lay tribute who would inquire aught of
Phoebus. Here the priests took of their offering and burnt it upon the slab. If the
day were one of consultation, lots then were drawn for precedence, and he whom
fortune favoured moved on, past the Omphalos, where Apollo had reposed in early
days, past the tomb of Neoptolemus, past the image of Pallas, to the steps of the
shrine itself. At the foot he left his train of servants, and mounted all alone, wondering
<pb n="539"/>
at the marvels round, the open colonnades, the wondrous sculptures filling the
pediments of the noble tympana, each commemorating the life and labours of a god.
. . . And now the jubilant trumpets of the priests pealed out, with notes that rang
round the valley, and up among the windings of the Hyampeian cliff. Awed into
silence by the sound, he crossed the garlanded threshold: he sprinkled on his head the
holy water from the fonts of gold, and entered the outer court. New statues, fresh
fonts, craters, and goblets, the gift of many an Eastern king, met his eye: walls
emblazoned with dark sayings rose about him as he crossed towards the inner adytum.
Then the music grew more loud: the interest deepened: his heart beat faster. With
a sound as of many thunders, that penetrated to the crowd without, the subterranean
door rolled back: the earth trembled: the laurels nodded: smoke and vapour broke
commingled forth: and, railed below within a hollow of the rock, perchance he caught
one glimpse of the marble effigies of Zeus and the dread sisters, one gleam of sacred
arms; for one moment saw a steaming chasm, a shaking tripod, above all, a Figure
with fever on her cheek and foam upon her lips, who, fixing a wild eye upon space,
tossed her arms aloft in the agony of her soul, and, with a shriek that never left his
ear for days, chanted high and quick the dark utterances of the will of Heaven.</quote>

Mr. Conington added: <quote>A development of this view will be found in an extract
printed at the end of this Book, from a letter from Mr. D. B. Monro, Fellow and Tutor
of Oriel College, to whom I am indebted for the information about the Aristotelian
use of <foreign lang="greek">a)nti/fwnos</foreign>.</quote> This extract could not be found. Mr. Monro has kindly supplied
the defect by sending the following remarks on Aeneid 6. 646:&mdash;</p>
<p><quote>The passages which <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName> seems chiefly to have had in view in the description of
Orpheus are Od. 8. 256&mdash;265 (see Mr. Conington's note on Aen. 6. 644), and Il. 18.
590&mdash;606, 569&mdash;572. In the first of these passages Phemius is represented as playing
on the phorminx, and (it would seem) singing the story of Ares and Aphrodite as an
accompaniment to the dancing of the Phaeacian youth. In the second passage we are
told that one of the pictures on the shield of Achilles represented a chorus dancing,
<q direct="unspecified">and in their midst a divine singer made music (<foreign lang="greek">e)me/lpeto</foreign>), playing on the phorminx.</q>
In those cases the chorus is not expressly said to be one of singers: but in the procession
of grape-gatherers on the same shield (vv. 561&mdash;572) the troop moved along <q direct="unspecified">with
music and joyous cries</q> (<foreign lang="greek">molph=| t' i)ugmw=| te</foreign>), while a boy played the phorminx and
sang the Linus to its accompaniment (if that is the true meaning of <foreign lang="greek">li/non d' u(po\ kalo\n
a)/eide</foreign>). So according to the Hymn to the Pythian Apollo (H. Apoll. 514 ff.) the god himself
led the way bearing the phorminx, while the Cretans followed and sang a Cretan
paean: and in <seg lang="la">Olympus Apollo</seg> plays on the phorminx, and the Muses sing in turn
(Il. 1. 604). In all these cases there is a single musician whose instrument regulates
and accompanies the chorus: but whether he sings himself, and whether the chorus
sings as well as dances, is not always clear. The practice may have varied with the
character of the performance, as the epic or lyric element predominated. In the
Lament for Hector (Il. 24. 720&mdash;776) there are singers who <q direct="unspecified">lead the wailing,</q> but
nothing is said of instruments: Andromache, Hecuba, and Helen recite in turn their
praises of the dead man, and the rest bewail in chorus. Virgil, however, has distinctly
made his chorus sing or recite (<q lang="la" direct="unspecified">carmina dicunt</q>) as well as dance, and therefore he
probably intended to represent Orpheus as playing only. <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">Septem discrimina vocum</q>
refers in the first instance to the lyre, and could not very naturally be applied to the
voice: <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">vox</q> is used, like Gr. <foreign lang="greek">fwnh/</foreign>, for the <q lang="la" direct="unspecified">note</q> of an instrument. (See Welcker, Ep.
Cycl. vol. i. p. 329, and Kl. Schrift. vol. ii. p. 32.)</quote></p>
