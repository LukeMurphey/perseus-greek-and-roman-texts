                <p>
                    <milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>This man Spudias
                    and I, men of the jury, are married to two sisters, daughters of Polyeuctus.
                    Polyeuctus having died without male issue, I am forced to go to law with the
                    defendant in regard to the property which has been left. And if, men of the
                    jury, I had not shown all zeal and eagerness in my desire to find a settlement
                    and to submit the matters at issue to our friends, I should have blamed myself
                    for not choosing to suffer a trifling loss rather than engage in a troublesome
                    lawsuit. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>But, as it is, the more gentleness and
                    consideration I used in talking with the defendant, the more contempt he showed
                    toward me. And now it appears that in my contest with him we are in no sense on
                    equal terms, but he can take the matter lightly, since he has been accustomed to
                    come often before you, whereas I fear this very thing, that because of my lack
                    of experience I may prove unable to explain my case to you. None the less, men
                    of the jury, I beg you to give heed. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone
                        ed="P" unit="para"/>Polyeuctus was a man of Teithras,<note resp="Loeb"
                        anchored="yes">Teithras was a deme of the tribe Oene&iuml;s.</note> not
                    unknown, it may well be, to some of you. This Polyeuctus, since he had no male
                    children, adopted Leocrates, the brother of his own wife; but since he had two
                    daughters by the sister of Leocrates, he gave the elder to me in marriage with a
                    portion of forty minae, and the younger to Leocrates.<note resp="Loeb"
                        anchored="yes">Marriage between uncle and niece was allowed in ancient
                            <placeName key="tgn,7001393">Athens</placeName>. A man might even marry

                    <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>So matters stood, when a quarrel came about
                    between Polyeuctus and Leocrates, as to the nature of which I know of nothing
                    which it is incumbent upon me to relate, and Polyeuctus took away his
                        daughter<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">This can mean only that he induced
                        his daughter to go before the Archon and demand a divorce.</note> and gave
                    her in marriage to this man Spudias. After this Leocrates, being greatly
                    incensed, brought suit against Polyeuctus and Spudias here, and they were forced
                    to render an accounting in regard to all the matters at issue, and in the end a
                    settlement was reached on the terms that Leocrates, on receiving back all that
                    he had brought into the estate, should be reconciled with Polyeuctus, and that
                    final releases should be given from all demands made by each upon the other.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Now, why is it, men of the jury, that I
                    have told you this? Because I did not receive the whole of my wife's portion,
                    but a thousand drachmae were left unpaid with the understanding that I should
                    receive them on the death of Polyeuctus; and so long as Leocrates was the heir
                    of Polyeuctus, it was he who was responsible to me for the debt; but when
                    Leocrates had left the family, and Polyeuctus was seriously ill, then, men of
                    the jury, to secure the ten minae, I took a mortgage on this house, the rents
                    accruing from which Spudias seeks to prevent me from collecting. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="6"/>In the first place, then, I shall bring before you as
                    witnesses those who were present when Polyeuctus betrothed his daughter to me
                    with a portion of forty minae; then I shall prove that what I received was less
                    by a thousand drachmae; and further that Polyeuctus always admitted that he was
                    in my debt, and that he introduced to me Leocrates as guarantor<note resp="Loeb"
                        anchored="yes">That is, as the person who would be responsible for payment
                        after his own death.</note>; and that at his death he directed by his will
                    that pillars should be set up on the house in my favor for a thousand drachmae
                    due on account of my wife's portion.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Please call
                    the witnesses.<quote type="Witnesses">
                        <title>Witnesses</title>
                    </quote>
                    <milestone unit="section" n="7"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>This, then, men
                    of the jury, is one of the charges which I make against Spudias. And in this
                    matter what stronger or more solid ground could I have in coming before you than
                    the law which expressly ordains that, in all cases where men have given a
                    mortgage, there shall be no right of action for them or for their heirs? But
                    nevertheless it is to dispute this just provision that Spudias has come here.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>A second claim, men of the jury, is the
                    following: Aristogenes has deposed that Polyeuctus, when about to die, charged
                    that there were due him from Spudias two minae with interest &lpar;this was
                    the price of a domestic slave whom the defendant had bought from Polyeuctus, but
                    had neither paid the money nor has now entered it in the general
                    account&rpar;; and furthermore there are eighteen hundred drachmae,
                    regarding which I am myself at a loss to know what reasonable thing he will have
                    to say. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>He had borrowed the money from the wife
                    of Polyeuctus, and there are papers which that lady left behind at her death,
                    and the lady's brothers are witnesses, for they were present at all times and
                    questioned her on every point, that there might be no unpleasantness between us.
                    It is, then, an outrageous and cruel thing, men of the jury, when I on my part,
                    for everything which I either bought from Polyeuctus during his lifetime or
                    received from his wife, have duly paid the price and the interest as well, and
                    am now bringing into the general account everything which I owed, <milestone
                        unit="section" n="10"/>that this fellow should show no regard either for
                    your laws or for the will of Polyeuctus, or for the papers which have been left,
                    or for those who knew the facts, but in the face of all this should have come
                    into court to contest my plea.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Please take first
                    the law which denies the right of action for mortgaged property against the
                    holders of the mortgage, then the papers which were left, and the deposition of
                        Aristogenes.<quote type="Law">

                    of the jury, to instruct you in detail also regarding the other claims which I
                    make. They received from the wife of Polyeuctus a bowl, which they pawned
                    together with some pieces of jewelry, and this they have not redeemed and
                    brought into the general account, as Demophilus, to whom it was pawned, will
                    testify. They have also some stuff for hangings,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes"
                        >The word literally means &ldquo;tent,&rdquo; and it is so rendered
                        by some scholars in this passage. Harpocration takes it to mean &ldquo;a
                        parasol.&rdquo;</note> which they received, but they do not account for
                    this either; and many more articles of the same sort. And finally, although my
                    wife advanced a mina of silver and expended it on her father's behalf for the
                    feast of the dead,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Properly, &ldquo;the
                        Nemeseia,&rdquo; a festival celebrated every year on the fifth day of
                        the month Boedromion &lpar;September&rpar;.</note> the defendant
                    refuses to contribute his share even of this; nay, what he has received he
                    keeps; of other items he receives his due portion; but these claims he thus
                    openly refuses to meet.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Now that these matters too
                    may not be left neglected, take, please, the depositions regarding them
                        all.<quote type="Depositions">
                        <title>Depositions</title>
                    </quote>
                    <milestone unit="section" n="12"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>It may well be,
                    men of the jury, that Spudias will make no statement to meet these facts; for he
                    will not be able to do so, clever though he is; but will accuse Polyeuctus and
                    his wife, and will declare that they did all these things under my influence and
                    as favors to me, and that he is being greatly injured in many other respects,
                    and has brought action against me; for this is what he undertook to say before
                    the arbitrator also. <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>But for my part, men of
                    the jury, in the first place I do not think that a defence of that sort is
                    legitimate, or that it is proper, when one is manifestly shown to be in the
                    wrong, for him to shift the charges and have recourse to accusation and calumny;
                    nay, for his counter-charges, if he is suffering any wrong, he will plainly
                    receive satisfaction, but for the claims made on him, he will give it. For how
                    could I now defend myself against the slanders of these men, if I passed over
                    the matters upon which you are to give your verdict? <milestone unit="section"
                        n="14"/>In the next place I wonder, if he had true and just demands to make,
                    why it was that, when our friends wished to settle our differences, and many
                    conferences were held, he could not abide by their decision. And yet who could
                    better have exposed the baselessness of claims advanced by him or by me than
                    those who were present at all these transactions, who knew the facts as well as
                    we did ourselves, and who were impartial friends of us both? <milestone
                        unit="section" n="15"/>But this was plainly not to the interest of my
                    opponent&mdash;that he should be openly convicted by our friends and find a
                    settlement in this way. For do not imagine, men of the jury, that men who know
                    all these facts, and who now at their own risk are giving testimony in my favor,
                    would then, when they had been put under oath, have formed a different
                    conclusion about them. However, though you had none of these facts to aid you,
                    even so it is not difficult to form an opinion as to which of the two parties is
                    speaking the truth. <milestone unit="section" n="16"/>For regarding the house,
                    if he maintains that Polyeuctus was induced by me to order that mortgage-pillars
                    be set up for the thousand drachmae, yet surely, Spudias, I did not use my
                    influence to induce the witnesses to give false testimony in my
                    interest,&mdash;witnesses who were present when he betrothed to me his
                    daughter, who knew that I received less than the entire marriage portion, who
                    heard him when he acknowledged that he was in my debt and also when he had
                    introduced Leocrates as the one who should make payment, and who finally were
                    present when the will was made. For with all these persons it was no longer a
                    question of favoring me in these matters, but of risking a charge of giving
                    false testimony, if they deposed to what was not the truth. Let us, then, have
                    no more of that matter; but what will you say to this, Spudias? <milestone
                        unit="section" n="17"/>And see that you give these gentlemen a precise
                    answer. If he does not, do you all demand it of him. For, when Polyeuctus gave
                    these directions in his will, the defendant's wife was present, and you may be
                    sure that she reported to him the will of her father, especially if he did not
                    receive an equal share, but was at a disadvantage in all respects; and the
                    defendant himself was invited to be present, so that it is not open to him to
                    say that we managed this in secret and kept them in the dark. For although he
                    was invited to be present, he said that he was busy himself, but that it would
                    be enough if his wife were there. What more would you have? <milestone
                        unit="section" n="18"/>When Aristogenes gave him an exact account of all
                    these matters, even then he made no comment, and though Polyeuctus lived on more
                    than five days after this, he neither showed any vexation on going to the house,
                    nor made any protest, nor did his wife, who was present from the first on all
                    these occasions. It would appear, then, that Polyeuctus was not induced by me to
                    favor me in these matters; the act was your own. Keep these facts, then, clearly
                    in your minds, men of the jury, and if he now tries to make any slanderous
                    statements about the matter, confront him with them.<milestone ed="P"
                        unit="para"/>But first, that you may be fully assured that matters are as I
                    have stated, hear the witnesses. Read.<quote type="Witnesses">

                    <milestone unit="section" n="19"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Well then, men
                    of the jury, in the matter of the one thousand drachmae, to prove that
                    Polyeuctus mortgaged the house to me honestly, and for an existing debt, I have
                    the testimony of my opponent himself and his wife in addition to these other
                    witnesses whose depositions have been put in; for they concurred at the time,
                    and made no objection either to Polyeuctus who lived so many days after, or to
                    Aristogenes, when they first heard of the will. But assuredly, if the house was
                    honestly mortgaged, it is impossible for you, if you bear the law in mind, to
                    acquit Spudias as to this part of the case. <milestone unit="section" n="20"
                    />Now consider also the matter of the twenty minae, which he does not bring into
                    the account; for in this again the defendant himself will be my strongest

                    in order that, if he really dares to utter any slanders about the mother of our
                    wives or about the documents, your knowledge of the facts may make it impossible

                    just now said. The seals being acknowledged both by the defendant's wife and by

                    you. There was in the papers mention of the two minae, the price of the
                    slave&mdash;and it was not only Polyeuctus on his death-bed who had made
                    this claim&mdash;and there was mention of the eighteen hundred drachmae.
                    When he read this, if what was written did not concern him at all and was
                    untrue, why pray did he not at once protest about it? Why did he join in sealing
                    again papers which were false and of no worth? This of course no one in the
                    world would do, if he did not concur in all that was written. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="23"/>But surely, men of the jury, this is an outrageous
                    thing if these men are to be permitted now to dispute matters to which they have
                    themselves given assent, and you are to find no basis for judgement in the fact
                    that all of us are wont, when charges are made against us that are unjust and
                    untrue, not to keep silent, but to dispute them on the spot, and that those who
                    do not do this, if they contest them subsequently, are accounted rascals and

                    he feels no shame in saying things that contradict all that he has himself done.
                    And yet full often when you become conscious of one single piece of fraud, you
                    treat it as evidence against the other charges; but the defendant is found to
                    have been convicted by himself of falsehood on every point.<milestone ed="P"

                    these facts have been so convincingly established, there is no further need, I

                    my opponent himself, what further need can there be for a long argument?
                    However, if Spudias perchance waxes indignant about the marriage portion and
                    maintains that he is being defrauded to the amount of one thousand drachmae, he
                    will be lying. For, while he disputes my claim to this sum, he has received not

                    he chose to give a smaller portion to one daughter and a larger to the other,
                    should now be thwarted. For it was open to you, Spudias, not to marry his
                    daughter, unless the thousand drachmae were given to you as well as to me.

                    precisely what I am going to explain. For Spudias, men of the jury, received his

                    to Leocrates of more than a thousand drachmae, while in my case, if you set what

                    was becoming to a good citizen who wished to avoid quarrels not to rush headlong
                    into court, was persuaded &lpar;for why should I multiply words?&rpar;

                    appears before you as one who has transgressed two laws instead of
                    one;&mdash;first, that which declares that the inventory shall be presented
                    within three days after that on which one takes the oath, and, secondly, that
                    which declares that mutual covenants, agreed upon in the presence of witnesses,
                    shall be binding. <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>Yet, men of the jury, who
                    among you does not know that the day fixed by law and that agreed upon by the
                    contending parties are equally binding? Why, very often, although the thirtieth
                    day is appointed by law, we fix upon another by mutual agreement; and in all the
                    offices the magistrates put off trials and judgements for the contestants, when
                    these have come to a mutual agreement; and if anyone should hold that the
                    agreement thus entered upon was to be of no effect, you would despise him as a

                    just as though the law enjoined that one should do nothing that one had agreed
                    to, from the day on which he promised to meet me for a settlement and to give me
                    an inventory of his property and receive from me one of mine, never put in an
                    appearance; but I, when I saw that he was paying no heed to me or to the laws,
                    gave in my inventory at the office of the generals, whereas Phaenippus, as I
                    said a moment ago, gave me a paper only the other day with no other purpose than
                    that he might appear to have given me his inventory, but that I should be unable

                    themselves, having concocted a spurious will, and Theopompus, the father of
                    Macartatus here, joined with them in getting up this whole scheme, and was their
                    witness in most of the depositions that were put in. The will which they then
                    produced was proved to be spurious, and they not only lost their case, but went
                    out of court completely disgraced. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>And
                    Theopompus, the father of Macartatus here, although he was in town when the
                    herald asked by proclamation whether anyone wished to lay claim to the estate of
                    Hagnias by virtue of kinship or under a will, or to deposit security for the
                    costs of such claim, yet did not venture to make a deposit, but by his own act
                    gave judgement against himself that he had no conceivable claim on the estate of
                    Hagnias. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>But, although the mother of this boy
                    here became possessed of the inheritance, since she had prevailed in the suit
                    over all those who disputed her claim, these men are abominable, as you see, and
                    imagine that they need obey neither your laws nor the decisions of your courts,
                    but they are trying by fair means or foul once more to take away from the lady
                    the inheritance which you awarded to her. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>A
                    conspiracy was formed, and a written agreement entered into, and deposited with

                    themselves as a fourth another of their friends &lpar;Eupolemus was his
                    name&rpar;. All these men, having in common formed their plot, cited the
                    lady before the archon for the adjudication of claims to the estate of Hagnias,
                    declaring that the law prescribed that if anyone wished to enter a claim,
                    citation should be made of the one to whom the estate had been adjudged and who
                    had it in his possession. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>And when the archon
                    brought the case into court, and the trial was to be held, they had everything
                    cleverly arranged for the trial, and in particular the water which was to
                    measure their speeches was four times as much as that allowed to us. For the
                    archon, men of the jury, was obliged to pour into the water-clock an

                    matters as clearly as I could have wished, but could not even defend myself
                    against the smallest fraction of the lies which they told about us; for I had
                    but a fifth part of the water. Their scheme was this: to tell a wholly false
                    story about us, but to back one another up and agree in everything. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="10"/>So, since they had formed their plot in this way, and
                    each backed up the other's charges against us, when the four ballot-boxes<note

                        There were five in all, but the two brothers, Glaucus and Glaucon, were
                        apparently counted as one, since their title was the same. This problem is
                        discussed by Wyse in his introduction to <bibl n="Isaeus 11.1">Isaeus

                    naturally enough, as I think, were deceived and could not agree with one
                    another, and being led astray by this trick, they voted each as chance
                    determined. And there were a very few more votes&mdash;some three or
                    four&mdash;in the box of Theopompus than in that of the lady. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="11"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>This, then, was what
                    took place at that time. But when this boy was born, and it seemed a fitting
                    time, I, being in no way incensed at what had happened, but considering that the
                    former jurymen had met with a very natural experience, introduced this boy here
                    to the clansmen of Hagnias in the interest of Eubulides, seeing that the boy was
                    the son of his daughter, in order that the family might not become extinct.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>For the elder Eubulides, men of the jury,
                    who was next of kin to Hagnias, prayed to the gods above all else that a son
                    might be born to him as a daughter had been, the mother of this boy; but since
                    he failed of this hope and not a single male child was born to him, his next
                    dearest wish was that a son of his daughter should be adopted into his own
                    family and that of Hagnias and should be introduced to the members of his clan;
                    for he thought, men of the jury, that of his surviving relatives this boy was
                    nearest to him, and that in this way their house would best be preserved and
                    kept from extinction. <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>And I was the one to
                    render him this service, since I was husband to the daughter of Eubulides, she
                    having been adjudged to me as being the nearest of kin, and I introduced this
                    boy to the clansmen of Hagnias and Eubulides, to which fellowship Theopompus,
                    the father of Macartatus here, belonged during his lifetime, and to which
                    Macartatus now belongs. <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>And the
                    fellow-clansmen of Macartatus here, who knew better than any others the pedigree
                    of the family, seeing that he himself did not choose to risk a contest and did
                    not remove the victim from the altar, as he should have done had the
                    introduction of this boy not been legitimate, but demanded that they commit
                    perjury,6 took the ballot while the victims were still burning, and carried it
                    from the altar of Zeus Phatrius<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">So named, as god

                    just verdict, men of the jury&mdash;that this boy was duly and rightfully
                    introduced as the adopted son of Eubulides into the family of Hagnias.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>But when the fellow-clansmen of the
                    defendant Macartatus had passed this vote, this boy, as the son of Eubulides,
                    cited the defendant Macartatus for an adjudication of claims for the estate of
                    Hagnias, and had a day appointed by the archon for the hearing, inscribing his
                    brother's name as his guardian; for it was no longer open to me, men of the
                    jury, to stand inscribed as guardian, since I had got the boy adopted into the
                    family of Eubulides. And the citation was made by this boy according to the same
                    laws in accordance with which these men had cited his mother, who had won the
                    former suit in court, and was in possession of the estate of Hagnias. <milestone

                    that not all the jurymen would have an equally good view, but that those sitting
                    at a distance would be at a disadvantage, it is perhaps necessary to instruct
                    you by word of mouth, for thus all will be on the same footing. I, on my part,
                    will endeavor to the best of my ability to inform you regarding the family of
                    Hagnias in the fewest words possible. <milestone unit="section" n="19"
                        /><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Buselus, men of the jury, was a member of
                    the deme Oeon, and to him were born five sons, Hagnias and Eubulides and
                    Stratius and Habron and Cleocritus. And all these sons of Buselus grew up to
                    manhood, and their father Buselus divided his property among them all fairly and
                    equitably, as was fitting. And when they had divided the property among
                    themselves, each of them married a wife according to your laws, and sons and
                    grandsons were born to them all, and there sprang up five households from the
                    single one of Buselus; and they dwelt apart, each one having his own home and
                    begetting his descendants. <milestone unit="section" n="20"/>Now with regard to
                    three of the brothers, sons of Buselus, and the descendants born to them, why
                    should I trouble you, men of the jury, or myself by going into particulars about
                    each one? For although they are in the same degree of relationship as
                    Theopompus, and are as near of kin to Hagnias, whose estate is in question, not
                    one of them has ever troubled us either at an earlier time or now, nor has made
                    any claim to the estate of Hagnias or to the woman who is the heiress, who was
                    assigned in marriage to me; for they considered that they had no claim whatever
                    to anything belonging to Hagnias. <milestone unit="section" n="21"/>It seems to
                    me therefore that it would be entirely superfluous to say anything about them
                    save only what I cannot help mentioning. Of Theopompus, however, the father of
                    Macartatus, and of Macartatus the defendant himself, it is necessary for me to
                    speak. Yet the story, men of the jury, is a short one. As you have just heard,
                    Buselus had five sons. One of these was Stratius, the ancestor of Macartatus,
                    and another was Hagnias, the ancestor of this boy. <milestone unit="section"
                        n="22"/>To Hagnias was born a son, Polemon, and a daughter,
                    Phylomach&ecirc;, sister of Polemon by the same father and the same mother;
                    and to Stratius, the brother of Hagnias, there were born Phanostratus and
                    Charidemus, the grandfather of the defendant Macartatus. Now I ask you, men of
                    the jury, which is nearer of kin and more closely related to Hagnias, his son
                    Polemon and his daughter Phylomach&ecirc;, or Charidemus, the son of
                    Stratius, and nephew of Hagnias? For my part I think that to every one of us his
                    son and daughter are more nearly related than his nephew; and not only with us
                    does this hold good, but also among all other people whether Greeks or
                    barbarians. <milestone unit="section" n="23"/>Since, then, this is admitted, you
                    will now easily follow the rest of the argument men of the jury, and you will
                    see how arbitrary and how reckless these men are. To Polemon, son of Hagnias,
                    was born a son, Hagnias, having the name of his grandfather Hagnias, and this
                    second Hagnias died without issue. <milestone unit="section" n="24"/>But from
                    Phylomach&ecirc;, the sister of Polemon, and Philagrus, to whom her brother
                    Polemon had given her in marriage, he being his first cousin &lpar;for
                    Philagrus was the son of Eubulides, the brother of
                    Hagnias&rpar;&mdash;from Philagrus, I say, the cousin of Polemon, and
                    Phylomach&ecirc; the sister of Polemon, there was born Eubulides the father
                    of this boy's mother. These sons, then, were born to Polemon and to Polemon's
                    sister Phylomach&ecirc;. But to Charidemus, the son of Stratius, there was
                    born a son Theopompus, the father of the defendant Macartatus. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="25"/>Again, then, I ask you, men of the jury, which is
                    nearer of kin and more closely related to the first Hagnias, Hagnias, the son of
                    Polemon, and Eubulides, the son of Phylomach&ecirc; and Philagrus, or
                    Theopompus, the son of Charidemus and grandson of Stratius? I am of the opinion,
                    men of the jury, that if the son and the daughter are the nearest of kin, so,
                    too, the son's son and the daughter's son are more nearly related than the son

                        unit="section" n="26"/>Well, to Theopompus was born a son, Macartatus, the
                    defendant, and to Eubulides, the son of Phylomach&ecirc;, and cousin of
                    Hagnias on his father's side; this boy, who is to Hagnias the son of a first
                    cousin on the father's side; since Phylomach&ecirc;, the mother of Eubulides
                    and Polemon, the father of Hagnias, were brother and sister, born of the same
                    father and the same mother. But to Macartatus here, the son of Theopompus, there
                    has been no issue which is both in the family of Hagnias and in that of
                    Stratius. <milestone unit="section" n="27"/>Such being the facts, this boy here
                    has one of the titles mentioned in the law, and up to which the law ordains that
                    the right of succession should extend; for he is the child of the first cousin
                    of Hagnias, since his father Eubulides was cousin to Hagnias, whose inheritance
                    is in question. Theopompus, on the contrary, the father of the defendant
                    Macartatus, could not have appropriated to himself any one of the titles
                    mentioned in the law, for he belonged to another branch of the family, that of
                    Stratius. <milestone unit="section" n="28"/>But it is not fitting, men of the
                    jury, that any man whatsoever should possess the estate of Hagnias, one who
                    belongs to another branch, so long as there is left any one of those born of the
                    branch of Hagnias; no, nor is it right to expel such person by violence, as
                    these men are trying to do, while they are themselves more distantly related,
                    and not of the same branch of the family. For this, men of the jury, is the
                    point upon which Theopompus, the father of the defendant Macartatus, misled the
                    jury. <milestone unit="section" n="29"/>Who, then, are those still surviving in
                    the branch of Hagnias? Phylomach&ecirc;, my wife, who is the daughter of
                    Eubulides, the cousin of Hagnias, and this boy, who has been adopted into the
                    family of Eubulides and Hagnias. Theopompus, however, the father of the
                    defendant Macartatus, not being himself of the branch of Hagnias, told the
                    jurymen a monstrous lie regarding Phylomach&ecirc;, the sister of Polemon
                    and the aunt of Hagnias, alleging that she was not the sister of Polemon, the
                    son of Hagnias, by the same father and mother, and another in pretending that he
                    himself was of the same family as Hagnias, whereas he had never belonged to it.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="30"/>All these assertions Theopompus made

                    having only his associates to corroborate what he said; for they were leagued
                    with one another and did everything in concert, in order to rob the lady, the

                    I know well that he would say, Macartatus. Born of what father? Theopompus. And
                    of what mother? Apolexis, daughter of a Prospaltian,<note resp="Loeb"

                    sister of Macartatus, also a Prospaltian. And who was the father of Theopompus?
                    Charidemus. And of whom was Charidemus the son? Of Stratius. And of whom
                    Stratius? Of Buselus. This, men of the jury, is the branch of Stratius, one of
                    the sons of Buselus; and these whose names you have heard are descendants of
                    Stratius; and among them there is not one single name of those belonging to the

                    of Macartatus to the estate of Hagnias. The boy can make no other possible
                    answer, men of the jury, than that he is Eubulides. The son of what father? Of
                    Eubulides, the cousin of Hagnias. And of what mother? Of Phylomach&ecirc;,
                    who was the daughter of a first cousin to Hagnias on the father's side. But of
                    whom was Eubulides the son? Of Philagrus, the cousin of Hagnias. And of what
                    mother? Of Phylomach&ecirc;, the aunt of Hagnias. <milestone unit="section"
                        n="50"/>And of whom was Hagnias the son? Of Polemon. And of whom Polemon? Of

                    Hagnias, one of the sons of Buselus, and here there occurs not a single name
                    identical with those of the descendants in the branch of Stratius, or even one

                    of names, receiving them from one another. In every respect, then, and in every
                    way it is proved that these men belong to another branch of the family and are
                    more remote of kin, and that they are not entitled to inherit anything of the

                    of Hagnias, was not cousin to Hagnias, but aunt; for she was sister to Polemon,
                    the father of Hagnias. But Eubulides, the son of this woman, was cousin on his
                    father's side to Hagnias, whose inheritance is in question. And the mother of
                    this boy here was the daughter of Eubulides. <milestone unit="section" n="64"

                    wife of Theopompus; for she was in no way related to Hagnias, but was of another
                    tribe, the Acamantis, and of another deme, that of Prospalta, so that she was
                    not even apprised in any way at the time Hagnias lay dead. <milestone

                    inherit the body of Hagnias, when he was dead, and should perform all the proper
                    rites, as being relatives and nearest of kin, but that Macartatus should claim
                    the right to possess the estate of the dead Hagnias, though he belongs to the

                    has had his son introduced into the family of his mother. How could there be

                    of Leochares, the defendant, men of the jury, that he is himself being brought
                    to trial, and that I, despite my youth, am addressing you, for he claims the
                    right to inherit what does not belong to him, and has made a false affidavit of
                    objections before the archon in support of his claim. <milestone unit="section"
                        n="2"/>It was incumbent upon us&mdash;since the law grants the right of
                    succession to those nearest of kin, and we are relatives of Archiades, who
                    originally left the estate&mdash;not to suffer his house to become extinct,
                    and others, who had no right whatever to it, to inherit his property; while the
                    defendant, who was neither a son by blood of the deceased nor a son adopted
                    according to your laws, as I shall show, has thus recklessly made a false
                    affidavit, and is seeking to rob me of the inheritance. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="3"/>I beg you, men of the jury, to come to the aid of my
                    father and myself, if our pleading shall seem just, and not suffer men who are
                    poor and without influence to be crushed by the lawless men marshalled against
                    us. For we have come before you relying upon the truth, well content if we are
                    permitted to obtain our legal rights; while our adversaries have from the first
                    never ceased to rely upon intrigue and the spending of money, and very naturally
                    in my opinion; for they readily make expenditures from funds which belong to
                    others, and so have provided themselves with a host of people who will speak in
                    their behalf and give false testimony. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>My
                    father here &lpar; for the truth shall be told you&rpar; comes into
                    court with manifest signs that he is, as you are all aware, a poor man, and that
                    he knows nothing of pleading in court; for he has long been a public crier in
                    Peiraeus, and this is not only a sign of the poverty which is common to man, but
                    also of the fact that he has no time to meddle with the law; for a man so
                    employed has to spend the whole day in the market-place. If you bear this in
                    mind, you will be forced to conclude that, if we did not rely upon the justice
                    of our cause, we should never have come before you at all. <milestone

                    address, but I think I must now inform you about the affidavit and the case at
                    issue. If, men of the jury, Leochares, basing his defence upon the affidavit
                    itself, were going to prove that he is the lawfully born son of Archiades, there
                    would be no need of many words, nor any need that I should trace our family line
                    back to its origin; <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>but since the matters sworn
                    to in the affidavit are of a different nature, and most of the arguments of our
                    adversaries will be devoted to proving that they were adopted and should
                    properly inherit the estate by right of descent as lawful children, it is
                    necessary for this reason, men of the jury, to go back a little way and instruct
                    you regarding the pedigree; for when you understand this matter clearly, there
                    will be no danger of your being misled by their arguments. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="7"/>Very well then, the case before you is one to settle
                    the title to an inheritance. Our claim to the estate is based upon descent,
                    theirs upon adoption. We admit here in your presence that all adoptions, if
                    rightly made in accordance with the laws, ought to be valid. Bear in mind,
                    therefore, the bases upon which our respective claims rest, and if they prove to
                    you that the laws grant what they have sworn in their affidavit, adjudge the
                    estate to them. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>And even if they have not the
                    support of the laws, but it seems to you that what they say is in accordance
                    with justice and generosity, even so we withdraw our claim. However, that you
                    may know that, while we are by descent the nearest of kin, we do not rest our
                    case upon this alone, but upon all the other grounds as well, I will first
                    instruct you regarding the family itself from which the inheritance comes; for I
                    am sure that, if you follow with clear understanding this phase of the matter at
                    issue, you will have no difficulty in grasping any of the other facts.

                    which the estate belongs, is, men of the jury, substantially this. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="11"/>For we are the nearest of kin to Archiades in the
                    male line, and, as we deemed it right according to this law that we should
                    inherit his estate, and not allow the family to be brought to extinction, we
                    brought suit for the inheritance before the archon. Our opponents, who hold the
                    property without right, have now filed an affidavit of objections, basing their
                    entire claim upon adoption, but alleging also that they are near of kin.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>Now, with regard to this adoption, we will
                    show you plainly later on what its character was; but with reference to blood
                    relationship, I must prove to you that they are not nearer of kin than we. One
                    thing is admitted, that in the matter of inheritance males and those descended
                    from males have the precedence, for the law explicitly gives the inheritance as
                    their due to the nearest of kin in the male line, when there are no children.
                    Well, it is we who answer this description; for Archiades is admitted to have
                    died without issue, and we are the nearest of kin to him in the male line.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>And furthermore, we are also his nearest
                    of kin in the female line; for Meidylides was the brother of Archiades, and the
                    daughter of Meidylides was the mother of my father, so that Archiades, for whose
                    inheritance we are now prosecuting our claim, is uncle &lpar; their fathers
                    having been brothers&rpar; to the mother of my father, having this
                    relationship in the male line, not in the female line. But Leostratus here is in
                    kinship further removed, and is related to Archiades on the female side; for the
                    mother of Leocrates, the father of the defendant, was niece to the Archiades in
                    question and to Meidylides, as descendants of whom we claim the right to win the
                    inheritance. <milestone unit="section" n="14"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"

                    inheritances to the families and to those nearest of kin in the male line. For,
                    I take it, these are the essential points in the case and the matters upon which

                    concerning their pedigree and concerning ours, men of the jury, stand thus, and
                    so it is right that those who have proved on the basis of the affidavits
                    themselves that they are nearer of kin, should have the inheritance, and that
                    the madness of the one who made the affidavit of objections should not prove
                    stronger than your laws. For if they lay stress on the adoption, the nature of
                    which I shall make clear to you, yet surely after the death without issue of the
                    adopted son, when the house up to the filing of our suit had become extinct, it
                    is right that those who are nearest of kin should receive the inheritance, and
                    that you should give your aid, not to those citizens who are able to get up the
                    strongest backing, but to those who are suffering wrong. <milestone

                    matters regarding the pedigree and the affidavit itself, to leave the platform,
                    and to have no need of further words, since practically the most important
                    arguments would have been advanced, we should not trouble you further. But since
                    our opponents will not rely upon the laws, but through having forestalled us and
                    got some control of the situation long ago, and through having entered into
                    possession of the estate, will use these facts as proofs, and declare that they
                    are the heirs, it is perhaps necessary to discuss these matters as well, and to
                    prove that of all humankind our opponents are the most arbitrary. <milestone

                    beginning, men of the jury, Meidylides and Archiades gave their sister in
                    marriage to Leostratus of Eleusis; and after a time from this sister of theirs,
                    thus given in marriage, there was born Leocrates, the Iather of the defendant
                    Leostratus; observe how distantly related he is to Archiades, regarding whom
                    they have filed the affidavit of objections. When matters were as I have stated,
                    Archiades did not marry, but his brother Meidylides, the grandfather of my
                    father here, did marry. <milestone unit="section" n="18"/>They made as yet no
                    division of the property, but, both having enough to live on, Meidylides
                    continued to live in the city, and Archiades made his home in Salamis. Not long
                    afterward, when Meidylides, my father's grandfather, happened to go on a journey
                    out of the country, Archiades fell sick, and died during the absence of
                    Meidylides, being still unmarried. What is the proof of this? A maiden bearing

                    here, on the pretext of his relationship on the female side, got himself adopted
                    as son to Archiades, and so entered into possession of the estate, as though he
                    had been adopted by Archiades during his lifetime. When Meidylides returned, he
                    was incensed at what had been done, and was in a mood to enter suit against
                    Leocrates; but under the persuasion of his relatives and their pleas that he
                    should suffer Leocrates to remain in the family as the son by adoption of
                    Archiades, he yielded the point,&mdash;not through losing his case in court,
                    but absolutely through being deceived by these men here and partly also through
                    giving way to the persuasion of his relatives. <milestone unit="section" n="20"
                    />After this experience Meidylides died, and Leocrates continued in possession
                    of the estate of Archiades, and conducted himself as heir for many years, as
                    being his adopted son; and we, on our part, inasmuch as Meidylides had made this
                    concession, refrained from action. No long time afterwards,
                    however,&mdash;and now, men of the jury, pay close heed to what I am about
                    to say&mdash; <milestone unit="section" n="21"/>Leocrates, who had become
                    son by adoption to Archiades, himself returned to the Eleusinians, to whom he
                    originally belonged, leaving Leostratus here in the family as a lawfully born
                    son. Even then we did not as yet disturb any of the arrangements regarding the
                    estate, but continued as before. <milestone unit="section" n="22"/>Well now,
                    Leostratus here, although he was an adopted son and had been left in the family
                    of Archiades, himself returned, as his father had done, to the Eleusinians,
                    leaving in his place a lawfully born son, and, in defiance of the laws, setting
                    up the original adoption as valid through the lives of three persons. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="23"/>For how could it be other than contrary to the laws,
                    when one, being himself an adopted son, returned to his original family leaving
                    adopted sons in his place? That is what Leostratus has done up to this day, and
                    by this means they think to rob us of our inheritance, making profit from the
                    estate of Archiades, and supporting their children by it, and always returning
                    from it to the estate of their fathers, keeping that intact, while spending the

                    />Nevertheless, although matters were in this condition, as I have told you, we

                    Leostratus in the house as a son, died without issue. But since he died without
                    issue, we, who are nearest of kin to Archiades, claim to inherit the property;
                    and we claim that the defendant cannot, in order to rob us of what is ours, give
                    an adopted son to the dead man who was himself adopted. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="25"/>For if Leocrates had himself adopted a son during his
                    lifetime, even though the action was contrary to law, we should have made no
                    protest; but since he had no son born to him, nor had adopted one during his
                    lifetime, and as the law gives inheritances to the nearest of kin, how can it be
                    other than right that we should not be robbed of this inheritance, to which we
                    have a double title? <milestone unit="section" n="26"/>For we are nearest of kin
                    to Archiades, to whom the property originally belonged, and also to the adopted
                    Leocrates; for his father, seeing that he has returned to the Eleusinians,<note

                        residence. He renounced his membership in the deme Otryn&ecirc;, and

                    whereas we, to whose family he had come to belong, had the closest relationship,
                    being children of that father's first cousin. So, if you like, we claim the
                    inheritance as kinsmen of Archiades, or, if you like it better, as kinsmen of
                    Leocrates; for since he died without issue, no one is nearer of kin than we.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="27"/>So far as you are concerned, Leostratus,
                    the family has become extinct; for you sought to maintain a relationship with
                    the property, not with those who adopted you. After the death of Leocrates, so
                    long as no one laid claim to the estate, you sought to get no one adopted as a
                    son to Archiades; but now that we have come forward as kinsmen, then you get one
                    adopted, that you may get possession of the property. And you declare that
                    Archiades, into whose house you were adopted, had no property, yet you file an
                    affidavit of objections against us, seeking to exclude his acknowledged kindred.
                    If there is nothing in the estate, wherein do you suffer loss, if we inherit
                    this nothing? <milestone unit="section" n="28"/>But the fact is, men of the
                    jury, that his impudence and greed are such that he thinks it is legitimate for
                    him to return to the Eleusinians and retain the estate of his fathers, and at
                    the same time to be master of that into which he was introduced by adoption,
                    there being no son in the family. And all this he easily managed, for over us,
                    who are poor men and men without influence, he has a great advantage, since he
                    is able to spend what belongs to others. I consider, therefore, that it is your
                    duty, men of the jury, to give aid to us who are not seeking to gain an
                    advantage over others, but who are content if we are allowed to win our legal
                    rights. <milestone unit="section" n="29"/>For what are we to do, men of the
                    jury? When the adoption has been continued through three persons, and the one
                    last left in the family has died without issue, are we not at the last to
                    recover what is our own? Well then, having this just claim, we brought suit for
                    the inheritance before the archon. But this fellow Leochares here, having
                    lightly sworn a false affidavit, thinks that he has the right to rob us of the
                    inheritance in defiance of all the laws. <milestone unit="section" n="30"
                        /><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>First, then, to prove that what we have
                    stated about the adoptions and the pedigree of these men is true, and that the

                    depositions. After that we will instruct you plainly regarding the remaining

                    real meaning of this affair, men of the jury, and such the legal rights of
                    inheritance, plainly stated; and you have also heard what amounts to a summary
                    of all that has been done from the start. But I consider it necessary to tell
                    you also of what they have done since the suit for the inheritance was
                    instituted, and the manner in which they have treated us; for in my opinion no
                    other people have ever in an inheritance suit been dealt with in a manner so
                    contrary to law as we have been. <milestone unit="section" n="32"/>For when
                    Leocrates died, and his funeral had taken place, and we went to take possession
                    of his property, since he had died without issue and unmarried, Leostratus here
                    ejected us, declaring that it belonged to him. Now his preventing us from
                    performing any of the proper rites for the deceased is perhaps to be excused,
                    seeing that he was his father, although the act was contrary to law; for it is
                    proper that the care of the funeral should be committed to the natural father,
                    but, next after him, also to us the members of the family to whom the deceased
                    was related by virtue of the adoption. <milestone unit="section" n="33"/>But
                    after the funeral rites were finished, what law will be found to justify him,
                    when the family was extinct, in driving us, the nearest of kin, from the estate
                    of the deceased? Because, they will say, he was father to the dead man. Yes, but
                    he had returned to the family of his fathers, and was no longer master of the
                    estate over which he had left his son in charge. Otherwise what is the use of
                    the laws? <milestone unit="section" n="34"/>Well, after our ejectment had taken
                    place &lpar; to omit most of the details&rpar; we brought suit for the
                    inheritance before the archon, inasmuch as the deceased had no son, as I stated,
                    and had not adopted any according to the laws. After this, Leostratus here made
                    a deposit for costs, as being the son of the aforesaid Archiades, not taking
                    into account that he had returned to the Eleusinians, or that adopted children
                    are made such, not by themselves but by those who adopt them. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="35"/>But the truth is, I presume his one simple idea was
                    that he must by fair means or foul lay claim to the property of others. And
                    first he had the audacity to go and enroll himself on the assembly list<note

                        deme had its own assembly, presided over by the demarch, or

                        <milestone unit="section" n="36"/>We, seeing what was going on, called
                    witnesses and put a stop to it, holding the view that it was necessary that the
                    right of inheritance should first be decided in your court before anyone should
                    be named as the adopted son of Archiades. He was thwarted then, and convicted in
                    the presence of many witnesses of fraudulent action, both in the matter of the
                    list, and in the assembly for the election of the deme's officers, yet
                    nevertheless he persisted in trying to force his way in, and by his intrigues to
                    prove himself stronger than your laws. What is the proof of this? <milestone
                        unit="section" n="37"/>He got together some of the Otrynians with the
                    demarch, and persuaded them at the opening of the adult register to inscribe his
                    name. And after that on the occasion of the great Panathenaea<note resp="Loeb"
                        anchored="yes">The great Panathenea, the most important of all Athenian
                        festivals, was held every four years in the month of Hecatombaeon &lpar;

                    admission fee, and when the other demesmen were receiving it, he demanded that
                    it be given him also, and that he should be entered on the register under the
                    name of Archiades. But when we entered a solemn protest, and all the others
                    declared that what he was doing was an outrage, he went away without either
                    having his name inscribed or receiving the admission fee. <milestone

                    that a man, who in defiance of your decree claimed the right to receive the
                    admission fee before his name had been inscribed on the list of the Otrynians,
                    belonging as he did to another deme, would lay claim to an inheritance in
                    defiance of the laws? Or when a man, before the court has rendered its decision,
                    schemes to get advantages so unjust, can you think it reasonable to assume that
                    he relies upon the justice of his case? For he, who fraudulently claimed the
                    right to receive the admission fee, has now obviously practised the same design
                    regarding the inheritance. <milestone unit="section" n="39"/>Nay more, he even
                    deceived the archon, when he made his deposit for costs to thwart us, and in his
                    counter-statement declared that he was an Otrynian, when he was in fact a
                    demesman among the Eleusinians. When, however, he failed in all these schemes,
                    at the last election of officers the fellow got together some of the demesmen,
                    and demanded that he be registered as the adopted son of Archiades. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="40"/>Again we protested that the demesmen should give
                    their votes only when the inheritance suit should have been decided, and not
                    before; and to this they agreed, not on their own responsibility, but out of
                    respect for the laws; for it seemed to them an outrageous thing that a man who
                    had made a deposit for costs in an inheritance suit, should get himself adopted
                    as a son while the matter was still undecided; but the thing which this fellow
                    Leostratus contrived after this is the most outrageous of all. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="41"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>For when he failed to
                    get his own name inscribed, he entered his own son Leochares as an adopted son

                    been introduced to the clansmen of Archiades; yet when his name had been entered
                    on the list of the deme, only then did Leostratus, by bringing influence to bear
                    upon a certain member of the clan, get the name inscribed upon the clan
                        register.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">This should have normally have
                        been done shortly after birth, for the enrollment in the clan marked the

                    <milestone unit="section" n="42"/>And after that, in his affidavit before the

                    been dead many years past&mdash;Leochares, who had been registered with the
                    clan only a day or two before! So it results that they both lay claim to the
                    inheritance; for Leostratus here made the deposit for costs in the inheritance
                    suit as being the lawfully born son of Archiades, and Leochares here has filed

                    defendant has sworn, as you have heard, &ldquo; that the inheritance of
                    Archiades is not open to litigation, since he has children lawfully born and
                    rightfully established according to the statute.&rdquo; Let us, then,
                    inquire if there are any, or if the defendant has sworn to what is false. The
                    aforesaid Archiades, whose estate is in question, adopted as his son the
                    grandfather of the one who has now sworn this affidavit; he, leaving a lawfully
                    born son, Leostratus, the father of the defendant, returned to the Eleusinians.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="47"/>After this, Leostratus here himself
                    returned to the house of his fathers, leaving a son in the adoptive house; and
                    the son whom he left, and who was the last of all the adopted children, has died
                    without issue, so that the house thereby becomes extinct and the inheritance has
                    reverted again to those originally nearest of kin. <milestone unit="section"
                        n="48"/>How, then, could Archiades still have any sons, as the affidavit
                    claims, when it is admitted that his adopted children returned to their original
                    family and the last one left has died without issue? It follows, then, of
                    necessity that the family is extinct. But when the family is extinct, there
                    cannot be lawfully born sons still living. The fellow, then, has sworn that
                    non-existent persons exist, and has written in the affidavit &ldquo; since
                    he has children,&rdquo; alleging that he himself is one of them. <milestone

                    and rightfully established according to the statute,&rdquo; he is quibbling
                    and defying the laws. For the &ldquo; lawfully born&rdquo; exists, when
                    it is born of the body; and the law bears testimony to this, when it says,
                    &ldquo; Lawfully born are children of a woman whom her father or brother or
                    grandfather has given in marriage.&rdquo; But &ldquo; rightfully
                    established&rdquo; the lawgiver understood of adoptions, considering that
                    when a man, being childless and master of his property, adopts a son, this
                    action ought to be rightful. Well, our opponent says that Archiades had no son
                    of the body, but in the affidavit he has sworn to the words &ldquo; since
                    there are lawfully born children,&rdquo; thus making a sworn statement that
                    is contrary to the truth. <milestone unit="section" n="50"/>He admits that he is
                    an adopted son, yet it is manifest that he was not adopted by the dead man
                    himself; so how can you claim that this status is &ldquo; rightfilly
                    established according to the statute&rdquo; ? Because, he will say, he was
                    registered as the son of Archiades. Yes, by the arbitrary act of these men, and
                    that only the other day, when the suit for the estate had already been
                    instituted. Surely it is not right for a man to regard as evidence his own
                    illegal act. <milestone unit="section" n="51"/>For is it not an outrageous
                    thing, men of tlie jury, that he should state&mdash;as he will presently in
                    his speech&mdash;that he is an adopted son, while in his affidavit he did
                    not dare to write this? Or that, while in the affidavit the protest is made as
                    though for a son of the body, the speech that will presently be made will be on
                    behalf of an adopted son? If they are going to make their defence conflict with
                    the affidavit, surely either what they say, or what they swore, is false. It was
                    with good reason that they did not add to the affidavit mention of the adoption,
                    for in that case they would have had to add the words &ldquo; adopted by
                    so-and-so.&rdquo; But Archiades never did adopt them; they adopted
                    themselves, in order to rob us of the inheritance. <milestone unit="section"
                        n="52"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Now is not their next proceeding
                    absurd as well as outrageous?&mdash;that Leostratus here should have made
                    his deposit for costs in the inheritance suit before the archon, as being the
                    son of Archiades &lpar; while he was an Eleusinian, and Archiades of the
                    deme Otryn&ecirc;&rpar; , but that someone else should have sworn the
                    affidavit, as you see for yourselves, alleging that he, too, was a son of
                    Archiades? To which of the two should you pay attention, as telling the truth?
                        <milestone unit="section" n="53"/>This very thing is the strongest proof of
                    the falsehood of the affidavit&mdash;that it is not the same person who
                    makes the claim about the same matter. And this is not strange for, I fancy,
                    when Leostratus here made his deposit in the inheritance suit against us, the
                    one who has now sworn the affidavit had not yet registered himself as a member
                    of the deme. We should therefore be most cruelly treated if you should believe
                    an affidavit made after the suit was begun. <milestone unit="section" n="54"
                        /><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Nay more, Leochares has in the affidavit
                    sworn to facts actually older than himself. For how could a person who was not
                    yet a member of the house of Archiades when this suit for the inheritance was
                    instituted, know anything about these matters? Moreover, if he had sworn it of
                    himself alone, there would have been some sense in his action; he would have
                    written what was false, but nevertheless his statement would have concerned one
                    of an age to know. But as it is, he has written that the aforesaid Archiades had
                    lawfully born sons, meaning, of course, his own father and the one made such by
                    the original adoption, not taking cognizance of the fact that they had returned
                    to their original family. It follows, then, of necessity that he has sworn to
                    events older than himself, and not to things which have happened in his own day.
                    Are you, then, to credit one who has dared a thing like that, as though he were
                    speaking the truth? <milestone unit="section" n="55"/>Ah, but he will say that
                    he has heard from his father the facts to which he has sworn. But the law does
                    not admit hearsay evidence, save in the case of deceased persons; whereas this
                    fellow has dared to swear to acts done by his father, while that father is still
                    alive. Then again, why did Leostratus here inscribe on the affidavit the name,
                    not of himself, but of the defendant? For the older facts should have been sworn
                    to by the older man. It was, he might say, because I have had this youth adopted
                    as son to Archiades. <milestone unit="section" n="56"/>Well then, you who had
                    him adopted and concocted the whole affair ought to have rendered an account of
                    it, and made yourself responsible for what you have done. You ought absolutely
                    to have done so. But you evaded this, and wrote over the affidavit the name of
                    your son here, who knew nothing of the matter. You see, then, men of the jury,
                    that the statements in the affidavit are false, and they are admitted by these
                    men themselves to be so. Why, it would even be right for you to refuse to listen
                    to this man Leostratus, when he presently undertakes to make statements to which
                    he did not venture to swear in the affidavit. <milestone unit="section" n="57"

                    are of all forms of trial the most unjust, and that those having recourse to
                    them are most deserving of your resentment, one can see very clearly from the
                    following facts. In the first place, they are not necessary as the other forms
                    of procedure are, but they are instituted by the will and desire of the one

                    in the matter of disputed claims there is no other way of getting a judgement

                    objections to obtain a hearing before all tribunals, is not the use of one a
                    mark of recklessness and utter desperation? For the lawgiver did not make it
                    obligatory on the contending parties, but granted them the privilege of putting
                    in such an affidavit, if they chose, as though he were testing the character of
                    each one of us, to see how we stand with reference to a reckless procedure.<note
                        resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">There is, of course, the implication that those

                    <milestone unit="section" n="59"/>Further, if it rested with those who file
                    these affidavits, there would be neither courts of justice nor trials; for the
                    nature of affidavits of objections is to bIock all these things and to prevent
                    all cases from being brought into the court-room&mdash;at least so far as
                    the will of the one swearing the affidavit goes. Therefore I think we should
                    regard such people as the common enemies of all men, and that they should never
                    receive any indulgence when they are on trial before you; for each one of them
                    comes into court, not under compulsion, but having chosen to incur the risk of
                    the oath. <milestone unit="section" n="60"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Well
                    then, that the affidavit is false, you have learned pretty definitely from the
                    statements contained in it and from the arguments which you have heard. But that
                    the laws also give us this inheritance as our right, men of the jury, I wish to
                    prove in a few words&mdash;not as though this had not been made clear to you
                    in what I said at the outset, but that you may the better bear in mind the
                    justice of our case, and so meet the false statements of our opponents.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="61"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>To sum up
                    the matter briefly, we, since we are the nearest of kin in the male line to
                    Archiades, to whom this estate belonged, and since of the persons whom he
                    adopted some have gone back to the family of their fathers, and the one last
                    left had died without issue,&mdash;in these circumstances, we, I say, claim
                    to inherit. <milestone unit="section" n="62"/>We are not depriving Leostratus of
                    any property &lpar; for these men hold what is their own&rpar; , but we
                    claim the estate left by Archiades, which is ours according to the laws. For the
                    law, men of the jury, ordains that males and the sons of males should have
                    precedence; and such we are. Archiades had no children, and we are the ones
                    nearest of kin to him. <milestone unit="section" n="63"/>Further, it is surely
                    not just that an adopted son should bring other sons into a family by adoption;
                    he may leave in it children born to him, but in default of these he must restore
                    the inheritance to those related by blood. That is what the laws
                        ordain.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>For is it not plain that each one of
                    you is excluded from the right of inheritance by direct descent, if this licence
                    be granted to children by adoption? For you see that most people who adopt
                    children do so through being cajoled by flattery and often in a spirit of
                    contentiousness caused by family quarrels. But if an adopted son is to be
                    permitted in defiance of the law to adopt whomsoever he pleases, inheritances
                    will never be given to blood-relations. <milestone unit="section" n="64"/>It was
                    to guard against this that the lawgiver forbade a person who was himself adopted
                    to create a son by adoption. In what manner did he declare his view regarding
                    this? When he says &ldquo; a man may return to his own family, leaving
                    behind him a lawfully born son&rdquo; he makes it plain, I take it, that it
                    is not lawful for him to adopt; for it is impossible for a man to leave behind
                    him a lawfully born son, unless he have a son born of his body. But you,
                    Leostratus, claim the right to bring an adopted son into the inheritance of the
                    dead man, who had himself been adopted into our family, just as though you were
                    taking possession of your own property, and not that which the law declares
                    shall be given to the nearest of kin. <milestone unit="section" n="65"
                        /><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>For ourselves, men of the jury, if the
                    deceased had adopted anyone, even though the law does not allow it, we should
                    have submitted; or, if he had left a will, we should also have been ready to
                    abide by that; for from the beginning this has been our position; we made no
                    objection to their holding the property and returning to their original family
                    in whatever manner they pleased. <milestone unit="section" n="66"/>Now, however,
                    that the affair has at length been exposed both by these men themselves and by
                    the laws, we hold that it is right for us to inherit the estate of Archiades,
                    and that the son to be adopted should come from us who have not been adopted
                    before, and not from them. For it was just, in my opinion, that the lawgiver, as
                    he laid upon the nearest of kin the duty of relieving the misfortunes of their
                    relatives, and of giving in marriage their women-folk, so also has given to
                    these same people as their due the right of inheriting and of sharing in the
                    good things. <milestone unit="section" n="67"/>But that which is the most
                    significant thing, and the thing best known to you, is this: the law of Solon
                    does not allow an adopted son even to dispose by will of the property in the
                    family into which he comes by adoption. And there is good reason for this, in my
                    view; for a person who comes by legal adoption into possession of the property
                    of another, ought not to deal with it as if it were his own private estate. No,
                    he should act consistently with the laws, and do in each particular what the
                    laws prescribe. <milestone unit="section" n="68"/>&ldquo;All those who had
                    not been adopted,&rdquo; says the lawgiver,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes"
                        >This law is cited more fully in <bibl n="Dem. 46.14">Dem.

                    may bequeath their property by will, as they see fit,&rdquo; thus indicating
                    that those who were adopted might not so dispose of theirs, but that they might
                    return to their families in their lifetime, leaving a lawfully born son in their
                    place; otherwise, in case of death, they must give back the property to those
                    who from the first were relatives of the adoptive father.</p>

                    after this &lpar;for the whole truth shall be told you, men of the
                    jury&rpar;, many kindly overtures were made on the part of my mother, and
                    pleas on behalf of this man Phormio, and many overtures on the part of Phormio
                    himself that were both moderate and humble in their terms. <milestone

                    would not do one of the things to which he had agreed, and tried to withhold
                    from me the money which he held as capital in the bank; so then I was compelled
                    to enter suit against him at the earliest opportunity. Phormio on his part,
                    seeing that everything would be brought to light, and that he would be proved to
                    have acted toward me as the basest of humankind, contrived and concocted this
                    plot in furtherance of which the defendant Stephanus gave this false testimony
                    against me. In the first place, he entered a special plea in the suit in which
                    he was defendant, claiming that the suit was not admissible; and then he
                    produced false witnesses who stated that I had given him a release from my
                    claims, and who deposed to a forged lease and to a will which never existed.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>He had the advantage over me in being the
                    first speaker, because this was a special plea and the case was not coming to
                    trial upon the real issue, and by reading these documents and making other false
                    statements which he thought would favor his case, he made such an impression on
                    the jury that they refused to hear a single word from me. I was fined one-sixth

                    nothing else, this at least must have seemed strange to you, that it begins with
                    a challenge and ends with a will. However, I on my part, count it right, when I
                    shall have shown what may be called the main substance of the testimony to be
                    false, then, and not till then, to say something also about matters of that
                    sort. <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>Well, then, it is deposed by them that
                    Phormio challenged me to open the will which Amphias,
                    brother&mdash;in&mdash;law of Cephisophon, submitted to the arbitrator
                    Teisias; and that I refused to open it; and that the will to which they
                    themselves deposed was a copy of that original; and then follows a copy of the
                    will. <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>Now as to whether Phormio tendered me
                    this challenge or not, and whether the will is genuine or spurious I say nothing
                    as yet; I will discuss these matters before you presently; but I will take up
                    the testimony they have given, that I refused to open the document. I would have
                    you look at the matter in this way&mdash;what reason would anyone have had
                    for refusing to open it? In order, one may say, that the will might not be shown
                    to the jury. <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>Well and good. If they had not
                    deposed to the will as well as to the challenge, there would have been some
                    reason in my refusing to open the document; but since they deposed to both, and
                    the jurymen were going to hear the will in any case, what advantage was there
                    for me in refusing? None, assuredly. Quite the contrary, men of Athens; even if
                    these men had tendered no challenge, but had merely talked of the matter, and
                    someone had delivered a document to them as a will, <milestone unit="section"
                        n="13"/>it would have been my business to tender the challenge and to order
                    them to open it, in order that, if the contents differed from the statements
                    which these men had made in their deposition, I might have called a number of
                    the bystanders as witnesses, and have used this fact as a proof that the rest of
                    their story too was a fabrication; but, if the contents were the same, I might
                    have required the one presenting it to give evidence himself. If he consented, I
                    should have had a responsible witness, and, if he refused, this very fact again
                    would have been a convincing proof for me that the affair had been concocted.
                    And in the former case the result would have been that I had one person with
                    whom to deal, whereas according to the depositions of these men I have many. Is
                    there anyone among you who would have chosen the latter course? I think not one
                    of you would have. <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>Well then, you ought not to
                    believe it of anyone else either. For, men of Athens, in all courses of action
                    which involve anger or some getting of gain or exasperation or a spirit of
                    jealousy, different persons will act in different ways in accordance with their
                    several dispositions; but in all cases where none of these things is involved,
                    but merely a calm calculation of one's own interest, who would be so senseless
                    as to dismiss what would help him and do what would make it more difficult for
                    him to win his case? Yet a course of action which is neither natural nor
                    reasonable, which, in short, no human being would have undertaken&mdash;this
                    these witnesses have attributed to me. <milestone unit="section" n="15"
                        /><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Moreover, it is not only from what they
                    have stated in their deposition regarding my refusal to open the document that
                    one can tell that they are lying, but also from the fact that they have deposed
                    at one and the same time both to a challenge and to a will. For I think you are
                    all aware that challenges were devised for all transactions which it is
                    impossible to bring before you; <milestone unit="section" n="16"/>for instance,
                    a man may not be put to torture in your presence&mdash;for this it is
                    necessary that there be a challenge; again, if anything has been transacted and
                    has taken place somewhere out of the country, it is necessary that for this too
                    there should be a challenge to go by sea or land to the place where the thing
                    was done; and so for other things of that sort. But in cases where it is
                    possible to produce the things themselves before your eyes, what could be
                    simpler than to produce them publicly? <milestone unit="section" n="17"/>Well,
                    my father died at Athens, the arbitration took place in the Painted Stoa,<note

                    deposed that Amphias produced the document before the arbitrator. Then, if it
                    was genuine, the document ought to have been put into the box,<note resp="Loeb"

                    order that the jurymen might have reached a decision in accordance with the
                    truth and after an inspection of the seals; and I, on my part, if anyone was
                    wronging me, might have proceeded against him. <milestone unit="section" n="18"
                    />But, as it is, no one person has taken the whole matter upon himself or given
                    straightforward testimony, as one would do in testifying to the truth, but each
                    has deposed to a part of the story, fancying that he is very clever and that for
                    this reason he will escape punishment,&mdash;one of them deposing that he
                    holds a document on which is written &ldquo;the will of Pasio&rdquo;;
                    another that, being sent by the former person, he produced this document, but
                    had no knowledge as to whether it was genuine or spurious. <milestone

                    as a screen, deposed to a will in such a way that the jurymen believed this will
                    to be my father's, and I was debarred from obtaining a hearing regarding my
                    wrongs, but in such a way also that they on their part would most clearly be

                    to put the document into the box. But, I presume, he thought that this falsehood
                    would deserve your indignation, and that you would punish him for it, whereas to
                    testify that a document had been bequeathed to him was a trifling matter and one
                    of no consequence. And yet it is this very thing that makes the whole matter
                    clear, and proves that they have concocted it. <milestone unit="section" n="21"
                    />For if the inscription on the will had been &ldquo;the property of Pasio

                    something of that sort, he would naturally have kept it for him; but if, as he
                    has testified, the inscription was &ldquo;the will of Pasio,&rdquo; I
                    should certainly have appropriated it, knowing that I was about to go to law,
                    and knowing further that, if its contents were as represented, it was
                    prejudicial to my interests; for I was the heir, and if the will was my
                    father's, it belonged to me, as did also all the rest of my father's estate.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="22"/>Well then, by its having been produced to
                    Phormio, by its having been inscribed &ldquo;the will of Pasio,&rdquo;
                    and yet ignored by me, it is proved that the will is a forgery and that the
                    testimony of Cephisophon is false. But no more of Cephisophon; it is not with
                    him that I have to do at present, and he has given no testimony as to the

                    I would have you consider how strong a proof this also is that these men have
                    given false testimony. For when the witness who stated that he had the document
                    in his own possession did not dare to say that the one produced by Phormio was a
                    copy of the one in his own keeping; and when these men cannot state that they
                    were present in the first instance or that they saw the document opened before
                    the arbitrator, but have themselves actually deposed that I refused to open it,
                    to have testified now that the one is a copy of the other, is not this to have

                    to give this testimony, unless he had been present when my father drew up the
                    will. Instead, he would have said at once, &ldquo;How do we know if there is
                    any will of Pasio's?&rdquo;&mdash;and he would have demanded that
                    Phormio write, as in the beginning of the challenge: &ldquo;If I declared

                    there is a world of difference between a thing's being so, and Phormio's saying

                    spurious. For what man, who had taken precautions that the profits which Phormio
                    might make by banking should accrue to his own children and not to Phormio
                    himself, and to secure this end had stipulated that it should not be permitted
                    him to engage in banking for himself, lest his interests might be separated from
                    ours&mdash;what man, I ask, in these circumstances would have provided that

                    Nevertheless, to things which are proved to be false by the probabilities, the
                    dates and the facts, to these this man Stephanus has not hesitated to depose.

                    goes about, saying that Nicocles testified that he had served as guardian under

                    I hold that these very facts are proofs that neither these witnesses nor those
                    have testified to the truth. For a person who testifies that he served as
                    guardian under a will should certainly know what the nature of the will was, and
                    a person who testifies that he lived as ward under a will should certainly know
                    what the nature of the will was. <milestone unit="section" n="38"/>Why in the
                    world, then, Stephanus, did you people depose to the will under the form of a
                    challenge, instead of leaving the matter to them? If they on their part shall
                    declare that they do not know the contents of the will, how is it possible for
                    you to know them, you who have never in any way been connected with the matter?
                    Why, pray, is it that one group of witnesses testified to these facts, and
                    another group to those? It is as I have already told you: they divided the
                    fraud. The one so testifying saw no danger in deposing that he served as
                    guardian under the will, or that he lived as ward under the will, <milestone

                    written in the will by Phormio,&mdash;no danger in deposing that one's
                    father had left him a document with the word &ldquo;will&rdquo; written
                    on it, or anything of that sort. But to testify to the existence of a will in
                    which were involved the theft of such vast sums, the corruption of a lady, the
                    marriage of a mistress with her slave, matters which entailed such shame and
                    disgrace&mdash;nobody was ready to do this save these men who got up the
                    challenge; and from them it is right to exact the penalty for the whole of this
                    villainous fraud. <milestone unit="section" n="40"/><milestone ed="P"

                    fellow Stephanus has given false testimony&mdash;made clear not merely by my
                    accusations and proofs, but also by the acts of the person who brought him
                    forward as a witness&mdash;I wish to tell you what that person has done. As
                    I said at the beginning of my speech, I shall show that they are their own
                    accusers. In the suit in which this testimony was given, Phormio entered a
                    special plea to estop me on the ground that the suit was not admissible,
                    alleging that I had released him from all claims. <milestone unit="section"
                        n="41"/>Now I myself know that this is false, and I shall prove it so when I
                    proceed against those who gave this testimony; but Stephanus is not at liberty
                    to say it is false. If, then, you should believe in the genuineness of the
                    release, this, more than anything else, would prove that the fellow has given
                    false testimony, and has deposed to a will that is forged. For who would be so
                    senseless as to give a release in the presence of witnesses, that his discharge
                    might be binding, and yet to suffer the articles of agreement, the will, and the
                    other documents regarding which he gave the release, to remain under seal as
                    evidence against himself? <milestone unit="section" n="42"/>The special plea,
                    therefore, contradicts all the evidence, and the lease which I just now read to
                    you contradicts this will; not one of their acts is either reasonable or
                    straightforward or consistent with itself. In this manner their whole story is
                    shown to be a fiction and a fraud. <milestone unit="section" n="43"/><milestone
                        ed="P" unit="para"/>That the statements in the deposition are true I hold
                    that neither Stephanus himself nor anyone else in his behalf will be able to
                    prove. I hear, however, that he is prepared to make some such statement as this,
                    that he is responsible for a challenge, not for a deposition, and that he should
                    be held to account, not for everything written in it, but for two things
                    only&mdash;whether Phormio tendered me this challenge or not, and whether I
                    refused it; these matters and no more, he will say, were included in his
                    deposition; as for the rest, Phormio covered them in his challenge, but whether
                    they were true or not it was not the business of the witness to inquire.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="44"/>In answer to this argument and to the
                    man's impudence it is better that I say a few words to you in advance, that you
                    be not taken at unawares and misled. In the first place, when he tries to bring
                    forward the argument that he is not responsible for the entire content of the
                    deposition, bear in mind that the reason why the law requires people to give
                    evidence in written form is that it may not be open to them to strike out any
                    part of what has been written, or add anything to it. He should at the time have
                    demanded the erasure of the statements to which he will now deny having deposed,
                    and not try now to brazen it out, while they stand in the document. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="45"/>Moreover, consider this too, whether you would suffer
                    me in your presence to take the document and add to it. Of course you would not.
                    Well, then, neither is it fitting to suffer him to strike out any of its
                    contents. For who will ever be convicted of giving false testimony, if he is to
                    depose to what he pleases, and be accountable only for what he pleases? No, the
                    law does not thus make a distinction in these matters, and you ought not to
                    listen to such a thing either. The straightforward and honest course is this:
                    &ldquo;What stands written? To what have you deposed? Show that this is
                    true. For you have written in your plea in answer to the complaint these words,
                    'I have given true testiniony in testifying to what is contained in the

                    what the defendant has written in his own plea. <milestone unit="section" n="47"
                        /><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>I learn that they are going to speak about
                    my original suit and to denounce it as baseless and malicious. But I on my part
                    have already mentioned to you and explained in detail the manner in which
                    Phormio concocted the lease, in order to get into his possession the
                    banking-stock, and I should be unable to speak of these other matters and at the
                    same time convict these men of giving false testimony; for the amount of water
                    allotted me is not sufficient. <milestone unit="section" n="48"/>And that you
                    yourselves could not in fairness be willing to listen to them in regard to these
                    matters you will see at once, if you reflect that it is no difficult matter to
                    speak now about subjects concerning which no charge is made, just as it was no
                    difficult matter for Phormio to get himself acquitted by reading false
                    depositions. However, no man would say that either of these courses is right,
                    but that course rather which I am about to propose. <milestone unit="section"
                        n="49"/>Listen, and judge. I demand that they do not now seek for the proofs
                    regarding my charges, proofs which should have been mentioned at the former
                    trial, but of which they deprived me; but that they prove that the testimony by
                    which they deprived me of them was true. If, when I bring in my suit, they are
                    to demand that I refute their testimony, and, when I proceed against that, they
                    are to bid me speak regarding my original charges, what they propose will be
                    neither right nor in your interest. <milestone unit="section" n="50"/>For you
                    have sworn to give a verdict, not in regard to matters upon which the defendant
                    asks your decision, but in regard to those only which are raised by the
                    prosecution. The cause of action must be made clear by the complaint of the
                    prosecutor, and this in my case is a suit against this man for false testimony.
                    Let him not, then, leave this and talk about matters regarding which I am not
                    suing him; and do you, if he is so shameless, refuse to permit it. <milestone

                    no just argument to advance on any point, he will have recourse to this defence
                    also&mdash;that it is absurd for me, after having been worsted in the case
                    of the special plea, to sue those who gave evidence of a will; and he will
                    maintain that the jurymen in that trial were led to vote in favor of Phormio, by
                    the evidence of those who testified to the release rather than by that of those
                    who testified to the will. But, men of Athens, I think you all know that it is
                    your habit to examine the facts no less closely than the pleas which men make
                    regarding them; and these men, by giving false testimony against me regarding
                    the facts themselves, weakened my arguments on the special plea. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="52"/>However, besides this, it is absurd, when all have
                    given false evidence, to demonstrate who did the greatest amount of harm,
                    instead of making each one prove that he has himself testified to the truth. It
                    is not by proving that another has done more outrageous things than himself that
                    a witness is to be let off, but by showing that he has himself given testimony
                    that is true. <milestone unit="section" n="53"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"
                    />Now, men of Athens, let me show you the thing for which more than anything
                    else this fellow Stephanus deserves to be put to death. It is an awful thing to
                    bear false witness against anyone whomsoever, but it is a thing more awful by
                    far, and more deserving of indignation, to bear false witness against those of
                    your own blood; for a man of that stamp violates, not the written laws alone,
                    but also the ties of natural relationship. This, then, Stephanus shall be proved
                    to have done. <milestone unit="section" n="54"/>For his mother and the father of
                    my wife are a brother and sister, so that my wife is his first cousin, and the
                    children born to her and to me are his cousin's children. Do you think, then,
                    that this man, if he saw his female relatives driven by want to shameful
                    actions, would give them in marriage and add marriage portions out of his own
                    resources&mdash;a thing which many a man has done ere now&mdash;when he
                    has chosen to give false testimony in order to prevent their getting what
                    belongs to them, and has counted the wealth of Phormio of higher worth than the
                    strong ties of kinship? <milestone unit="section" n="55"/><milestone ed="P"

                    Observe the kind of a life he has lived, and judge. For so long as it was the

                    him as he walked beside him, adapting his pace to his, and this is well known to
                    many of you who are present here. <milestone unit="section" n="64"/>But when
                    Aristolochus was ruined and lost his property, chiefly through having been
                    plundered by this fellow and others of his stamp, Stephanus never stood by the
                    son of Aristolochus, who was overburdened with lawsuits, nor aided him, but it
                    was Apolexis<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Apolexis is a not unfamiliar name

                    flatterer of those in prosperity, and who betrays these same men if they fall
                    into adversity; who out of all the host of good and worthy citizens of Athens
                    deals with not a single one on the basis of equality, but willingly fawns upon
                    people like Phormio; who takes no thought whether he is going to injure any of
                    his kinsfolk by these actions, or whether he is going to win an evil reputation
                    in the minds of other men, but thinks only of one thing, how he may enrich

                    whole human race? I certainly think so. <milestone unit="section" n="66"/>This
                    course of action, involving so great disgrace, he has adopted, men of Athens,
                    with a view to evading his duties to the state and to conceal his wealth, that
                    he may make secret profits by means of the bank, and never serve as choregus or
                    trierarch, or perform any other of the public duties which befit his station.
                    And he has accomplished this object. Here is a proof. Although he has so large
                    an estate that he gave his daughter a marriage portion of one hundred minae, he
                    has never been seen by you to perform any public service whatever, even the very
                    slightest. And yet how much more honorable it would have been to be proved a man
                    of public spirit and one zealous in the performance of his duties to the state,
                    than a flatterer and a bearer of false testimony! But the fellow would do
                    anything to get money. <milestone unit="section" n="67"/>Surely, men of Athens,
                    you ought to feel indignation rather toward those who are rascals in wealth than
                    toward those who are such in poverty. In the case of the latter the pressure of
                    their needy state affords them some excuse in the eyes of those who look on the
                    matter with human sympathy, whereas those who, like this fellow, are rascals
                    while possessing abundance, could find no reasonable excuse to offer, but will
                    be shown to act as they do from a spirit of shameful greed and covetousness and
                    insolence, and a resolve to make their own plots stronger than the laws. Not one
                    of these things is to your interest, but rather that the weak, if he suffers
                    wrong, should be able to get redress from the wealthy. And he will be able, if
                    you punish those who are thus manifestly rascals while possessing wealth.

                    misanthropy. In my opinion a man whom no misfortune has befallen, and who is in
                    no lack of the necessaries of life, but who none the less habitually maintains
                    this demeanor,has reviewed the matter and reached the conclusion in his own
                    mind, that to those who walk in a simple and natural way and wear a cheerful
                    countenance, men draw near unhesitatingly with requests and proposals, whereas

                    deserved, yet to whom among the whole host of Athenians have you ever made a

                        <milestone unit="section" n="70"/>You could not name a single one; but while
                    lending money at interest and regarding the misfortunes and necessities of

                    house of his fathers, you have taken from your own mother-in-law the resources
                    upon which she lived, and you have, in so far as it depended upon you, rendered
                    homeless the son of Archedemus. No one ever exacted payment from a defaulter as
                    rigorously as you exact interest from your debtors. A man, then, whom you find
                    to be so brutal and so savage on all occasions, are you going to fail to punish
                    him when you have caught him in the very act of wrongdoing? In that case, men of
                    the jury, you will do what is an outrage and in no sense right. <milestone

                    therefore, men of Athens, that you should wax indignant also against Phormio,
                    for bringing this man forward as a witness, when you see the shamelessness of
                    his character and his ingratitude. For I fancy you all know that if, when the
                    fellow was for sale, a cook or an artisan in any other trade had bought him, he
                    would have learned the trade of his master and been far removed from the
                    prosperity which now is his. <milestone unit="section" n="72"/>But since my
                    father into whose possession he came, was a banker and taught him letters and
                    instructed him in his business and put him in control of large sums of money, he
                    has become wealthy, having found the good luck which brought him into our family
                    the foundation of all his present wealth. <milestone unit="section" n="73"/>It
                    is outrageous, then, O Earth and the gods, and worse than outrageous, that he
                    should suffer those who made him a Greek instead of a barbarian and a man of
                    note instead of a slave, and who brought him to such great prosperity, to live
                    in dire want while he has means and is rich, and that he should have come to
                    such a pitch of shamelessness that he cannot bring himself to share with us the
                    good fortune which we shared with him. <milestone unit="section" n="74"/>But for
                    himself he has not scrupled to marry his mistress, and he dwells as husband with
                    her who scattered the sweatmeats over him when he was bought as a slave,<note

                    large sums of which he became master, inasmuch as they were in the custody of my
                    mother&mdash;for why do you suppose he wrote in the will the clause

                    marriage&mdash;the sons of the slave would have claimed the daughters of the
                    master! For they are their uncles, since the man married my mother; but seeing
                    that it is we who are poor, he will not help to portion them off, but he talks
                    and talks, and reckons up the amount of property which I possess. <milestone

                    absurd thing of all. Up to this day he has never seen fit to render an account
                    of the money of which he has defrauded me, but enters a special plea that my
                    action is not even admissible; yet he charges against me what I have received
                    from the estate of my fathers. Other slaves one may see called to strict account
                    by their masters, but here we see the very opposite: the fellow, though a slave,
                    calls his master to account, thinking thereby to show him forth as a vile fellow
                    and a prodigal. <milestone unit="section" n="77"/>For myself, men of Athens, in

                    without benefiting myself, I am in many respects at a disadvantage; but since I
                    am moderate in all my personal expenses, it will be seen that I live a much more
                    orderly life than Phormio and others who are like him. <milestone unit="section"

                    are citizens by birth it is sufficient to perform public services as the laws
                    require; we on the contrary who are created citizens ought to show that we
                    perform them as a grateful payment of a debt. Cease, then, to fling into my

                    prostitution, as you have done? Show me. Whom have I deprived of the citizenship
                    of which I was deemed worthy, and of the right of free speech in the city, as
                    you did in the case of the man whom you dishonored? Whose wife have I debauched,

                    god-detested fellow built the monument near that of his mistress at a cost of
                    more than two talents. And he did not see that a structure, being of that sort,
                    would be a monument, not of her tomb, but of the wrong which because of him she
                    had done to her husband. <milestone unit="section" n="80"/>Do you, then, who
                    perform acts like these, and who have given such manifest proofs of your
                    outrageous conduct, dare to scrutinize the manner of life of anyone else? By day
                    you act soberly, but the whole night long you indulge in actions for which death
                    is the penalty. He is a knave, men of Athens, a knave and a villain, and has
                    been such from of old, ever since he left the temple of Castor and Pollux.<note

                    his master's business, and remained poor. But as it is, having got control of so
                    large an amount of money that he could steal from it all that he now possesses
                    without detection, he regards what he holds, not as a debt, but as an inherited
                    patrimony. <milestone unit="section" n="81"/>And yet, by the gods, if I had led
                    you off to prison as a thief caught in the act, piling upon your

                    you now possess, and had then demanded of you, if you denied having got this
                    wealth by thievery, to refer me to the source from which you got it, to whom
                    would you have referred me? Your father did not give it to you; you did not find
                    it; you had not got it from some other source when you come into our family; for
                    you were a barbarian when you were purchased. Have you, then, a man who ought to
                    have been publicly put to death for what you have done, after saving your skin,
                    after securing for yourself a city with our money, and after being allowed to
                    beget children as brothers to your own masters&mdash;have you entered a
                    special plea that our action for the sums claimed from you is inadmissible?
                        <milestone unit="section" n="82"/>And, then, did you speak evil of me, and
                    inquire what manner of man my father was? Men of Athens, who would not have been
                    indignant at this? For my part, though it beseem me to have less of pride than
                    any of you, yet I judge that I may at least have more than Phormio, while as for
                    him, though there be no one else than whom he should have less, yet he should
                    have less than I; for, assuming that we are the sort of people your words made
                    us out to be, you, Phormio, were none the less our slave. <milestone

                    something else which one of them may say: that Pasicles, although he is my

                    speak about Pasicles, too, men of Athens, though I beg and implore you to pardon
                    me, if I am so carried away by indignation at the outrages I have received from
                    my own slaves as to be unable to restrain myself; I will not keep silent, but
                    will declare what until now I pretended not to hear when others said

                    know; but I am afraid that the wrongs which Phormio has done us began with
                    Pasicles. For when he joins in pleading the cause of the slave and dishonors his
                    brother, when he fawns upon those, and curries the favor of those, who ought to
                    seek his favor, to what suspicion does this naturally give rise? Away, then,
                    with Pasicles, and let him be called your son instead of your master, and my
                    adversary &lpar;since he so chooses&rpar; instead of my brother.

                    five times served as trierarch, voluntarily equipping the ships and manning them
                    at his own expense. I remind you of this, not because I consider that you are
                    under obligation to me&mdash;for it is I that am under obligation to
                    you,&mdash;but in order that I may not suffer unworthy treatment without
                    your knowing it. For that would not be a credit to you any more than to me.

                    will all best come to know the enormity of the wrongs that have been done me.
                    You must each of you consider what slave he left at home, and then imagine that
                    you have suffered from him the same treatment that I have suffered from Phormio.
                    Do not take into consideration that they are severally Syrus or Manes or what
                    not, while this fellow is Phormio. The thing is the same&mdash;they are

                    of a verdict by giving false testimony, and make him an example to others,

                    have borne witness to all the facts, ask them these questions, &ldquo;What
                    stands written in the deposition? Why did you not strike it out at the time?
                    What is the counter-plea in the custody of the archons?&rdquo; <milestone

                    that he lived as ward under a will, another that he served as guardian, and
                    another that he has the will in his possession, demand of them, &ldquo;What

                    to which these men bore witness no one of the others has given corroborative

                    men of the jury, I could pretty well suspect that this fellow Stephanus would
                    not be at a loss for something to say in defence of his testimony; and that he
                    would seek to mislead and deceive you in his speech by alleging that he has not
                    borne witness to everything written in the deposition. For he is a knave, and
                    there are many to write speeches and give advice on Phormio's behalf.
                    Furthermore it is but natural that those who undertake to give false testimony
                    should at the start prepare some means of defending it. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="2"/>But I bid you to bear this in mind, that in his
                    address, long as it was, he nowhere brought forward witnesses to prove to you
                    either that he was himself present when my father made this will, so as to know
                    that this is a copy of the will which my father made, or that he saw the
                    document opened which they declare my father drew up and left as his will.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>When, however, my opponent has testified
                    that what was written in the document was a copy of the will of Pasio, but is
                    unable to prove either that my father made a will or that he was himself present
                    and saw it when my father drew it up, is he not manifestly proved to have given
                    false testimony? <milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"
                    />If, now, he maintains that it was a challenge and not a deposition, he is not
                    telling the truth. For all pieces of evidence which the parties to a suit bring
                    before the court when they tender challenges to one another, they bring in by
                    means of depositions. Otherwise you would not know whether what they severally
                    say is true or false, if they did not bring forward the witnesses also. But when
                    they do bring in witnesses, you rely upon these as being responsible, and so
                    from the statements and the testimony offered you cast your votes for what seems
                    to you to be a just verdict. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>I wish therefore
                    to prove to you that the deposition is not a challenge, and to show you how they
                    ought to have deposed if the challenge was given, which it was
                    not,&mdash;&ldquo;The deponents testify that they were present before
                    the arbitrator Teisias, when Phormio challenged Apollodorus to open the document
                    which Amphias, the brother-in-law of Cephisophon, produced, and that Apollodorus
                    refused to open it.&rdquo; If they had given their evidence in this way,
                    they would have appeared to be speaking the truth. But to depose that what was
                    written in the document which Phormio produced was a copy of the will of Pasio,
                    without having been present when Pasio made the will, or knowing that he had
                    made one, does this not seem to you to be a manifest piece of insolence?

                    if he says that he believed this to be true because Phormio said it was, it
                    would be like the same man to believe him when he said this, and to testify to
                    it at his bidding. The laws, however, do not say this, but ordain that a man may
                    testify to what he knows, or to matters at the doing of which he was present,
                    and that his testimony must be committed to writing in order that it may not be
                    possible to subtract anything from what is written, or to add anything to it.

                    which the jurymen were deceived, assuming that they were testifying to the

                    we should live as citizens, you would of course answer, the established laws.

                    How, then, could my father, not knowing that Phormio was to become an Athenian
                    citizen, have given him in marriage his own wife, and thus have outraged us,

                    if he have male children lawfully born. But these men declare that my father
                    made this will, yet they cannot prove that they were present at the time.
                    Another thing also deserves to be borne in mind, that it is to those who had not
                    been adopted, but were lawfully born, that the law gives the right, in case of
                    their being childless, to dispose of their property by will. Now my father had
                    been adopted as a citizen by the people, so that on this account also he had not
                    the right to make a will, especially in regard to his wife, of whom he was not
                    even the legal guardian; and besides he had children. <milestone unit="section"

                    impaired by disease or the effect of drugs, or be under the influence of a
                    woman, or be the victim of old age or madness, or be under constraint, the laws
                    ordain that he be incompetent. Now consider whether the will, which these men
                    say my father made, seems to you to be the will of a man of sound mind.

                    yet that he should give him his wife in marriage, and thus make him a partner in
                    his own fatherhood? And do not be surprised that, while they were arranging all
                    else in regard to the lease so cleverly, they overlooked this. For perhaps they
                    paid no heed to anything else, save to rob me of my money and to set my father

                    order that, if anyone by bringing forward witnesses testifying to what is false
                    or by citing challenges which were never tendered or depositions made contrary
                    to law, has deceived the jury, he may gain nothing by it, but the one who has
                    been wronged may impeach the testimony, and come into your court and show that
                    the witnesses have given false testimony regarding the matter at issue, and thus
                    exact the penalty from them and hold the one who brought them forward liable to
                    an action for subornation of perjury. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>And for
                    this reason they have made the fine less for the plaintiff, if he lose his case,
                    in order that those who have been wronged may not by the fine be deterred from
                    prosecuting witnesses for false testimony, while they have imposed a heavy
                    penalty upon the defendant, if he be convicted and be thought by you to have
                    given false testimony. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>And justly so, men of

                    you have believed the testimony which they have given. It is, therefore, to
                    prevent you from being deceived and those who come into your court from being
                    wronged that the lawgiver made the witnesses responsible. I, therefore, beg of

                    shall devote a larger part of my speech to exposing the character of these men
                    than to proving that their testimony is false. As to my charge that the
                    testimony to which they have deposed is false, they seem to me to have given

                    refused to deliver up the woman, whom they have testified that Theophemus was

                    as the witnesses who were then present in court testified, and will now testify.
                    And Theophemus has not impeached them for giving testimony that was not true,

                    unwilling to do so. And yet it was regarding this woman, whom I demanded for the
                    torture, but whom Theophemus offered to give up, as these men say; whom,
                    however, no one ever saw present in person either at that time before the
                    arbitrator or afterwards in the court-room, or produced at any other

                        <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>and the jury thought that the testimony was
                    true, and that I was seeking to evade the evidence which the woman might have
                    given in regard to the assault and the question as to which one of us delivered
                    the first blow &lpar;for this is what constitutes assault&rpar;. Is it
                    not, then, a necessary inference that these witnesses have given false
                    testimony, men who even up to this day dare not deliver up the woman in person,
                    as according to their statement Theophemus offered to do, and as they testified
                    for him? And they dare not establish by actual fact the truth of their testimony
                        <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>and free the witnesses from the risk of a
                    trial by making Theophemus, since he then refused to do so, deliver up the woman
                    in person, to be put to the torture regarding the assault for which I am suing
                    Theophemus, and so make the proof result from the very statements made at that
                    time by Theophemus with a view to deceiving the jurors. For he said in the
                    course of the trial for assault that the witnesses who had been present and who
                    testified to what had taken place by a deposition in writing, as the law
                    provides, were false witnesses and had been suborned by me; but that the woman
                    who had been present would tell the truth, deposing, not to a written document,
                    but under torture, giving thus the strongest kind of evidence as to which party
                    delivered the first blow. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>This is what he said
                    at that time, using the most vigorous language and bringing forward witnesses to
                    support his statements, and by this means deceiving the jurors; but now all this
                    is proved to be false; for he does not dare to deliver up the woman, whom the
                    witnesses have declared that he was ready to deliver up, but prefers that his
                    brother and his brother-in-law should have to stand trial on a charge of giving
                    false testimony, rather than that he should deliver up the woman in person, and
                    so be well rid of his troubles in a fair and legal way, and that they should not
                    try by arguments and entreaties to find a means of escape by deceiving you, if
                    they could; <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>although I challenged him again
                    and again, and asked for the woman, demanding to receive her for the torture
                    both at that time and after the trial, and again when I paid them the money, and
                    in my suit for assault against Theophemus, and in the examination before the
                    magistrate in the trial for false testimony. These men do not try to hide
                    anything; their words are perjury, their act is to refuse to deliver up the
                    woman; for they knew well that, if she should be put to the torture, it would be

                    woman in person, these men, I take it, would not have produced two witnesses
                    only, a brother and a brother-in-law, to testify to what was true, but many

                    people stand forth to hear what is said; so that they would not have been at a

                    produce the woman. That this is not true, I will show you. For if I had tendered
                    to Theophemus this challenge to which they have deposed, requiring him to

                    to which your witnesses have deposed, when you were forced to take refuge in

                    but had supplied it at my own private expense whenever need arose, in order that
                    I might have as little trouble as possible with the state. On this occasion,

                    absolutely necessary, therefore, for me to take over the names of those indebted
                    to the state, you have heard from the law and the decrees; and that I took them
                    over from the magistrate, the one who delivered them to me has testified. So,
                    then, the first question for you to consider at the outset, men of the jury, is
                    this, whether the wrongdoer was I, who was compelled to recover from Theophemus
                    what he owed, or Theophemus, who had long owed the equipment to the state and
                    refused to give it back. <milestone unit="section" n="26"/>For if you look at
                    each matter severally, you will find that Theophemus was wholly in the wrong,
                    and that this is not merely a statement of mine but a fact decided by vote of
                    the senate and the court. For when I had received his name from the magistrate,
                    I approached him and first demanded the ship's equipment; when he refused to
                    give it back on my making this statement, I subsequently fell in with him near

                    of the way and remain quiet until I should have sailed with the fleet, and some
                    time should have elapsed, thinking that I should have to pay for the equipment
                    which he owed to the state either when I returned here, or else to my successor
                    who should come from the navy-boards to take command of the ship. For what
                    answer could I have given this man, when he produced decrees and laws showing
                    that I was obliged to recover the equipment? <milestone unit="section" n="30"
                    />And Theophemus, after a lapse of time, when I had come back and made demands
                    upon him, would have said that he had paid back the equipment, and to show that
                    he had paid would have insisted upon these proofs&mdash;the crisis, the
                    urgency, and that I was not such a fool and had never been such a friend of his
                    as to wait; for what possible reason, then, when I was serving the state as
                    trierarch and was overseer of the navy-board, and when decrees of such a nature
                    and such a law were in force, should I have obliged him by delaying the
                    collection? <milestone unit="section" n="31"/>It was because Theophemus reasoned
                    in this way that he then refused to restore the equipment but kept himself out
                    of the way, and thought that later on he would he able to rob me; and besides
                    this, he could take refuge in an oath and perjure himself without trouble, a
                    thing which he has done to others also. For the greediness of the man's
                    character in matters where his interests are involved is dreadful, as I shall
                    show you in fact. For Theophemus, while owing this equipment to the state, made
                    a pretence of shifting the charge to Aphareus, but in actual fact he never
                    reported his name for an adjudication, well knowing that he would be convicted
                    of falsehood, if he should come into court. <milestone unit="section" n="32"
                    />For Aphareus proved that Theophemus had reckoned up against him the cost of
                    the equipment and had got the money from him, when he took over the trierarchy.
                    Now Theophemus maintains that he gave it over to Demochares, and he is suing the
                    children of Demochares, who is now dead. But, while Demochares lived, Theophemus
                    did not report his name for an adjudication when he was being sued by me for the
                    equipment; he merely wished, on the pretence of the lapse of time, to rob the

                    involved, and failing to recover the equipment from him, I approached the
                    despatching board and the senate, stating that Theophemus would not return to me
                    the equipment for which he was accountable by judgement of the court. And the

                    but it became valid, I approached this man Evergus, the brother of Theophemus,
                    since I was unable to see Theophemus; and having the decree in my hand I first
                    demanded the return of the equipment, and bade him inform Theophemus; then,
                    after allowing a few days to pass, since he refused to return the equipment, but
                    only jeered at me, I took some witnesses with me, and asked him whether he had
                    divided the estate with his brother, or whether their property was held in
                    common. <milestone unit="section" n="35"/>On Evergus's answering me that it had
                    been divided and that Theophemus lived in a house by himself, but that he
                    &lpar;Evergus&rpar; lived with his father, I thus learned where
                    Theophemus lived, and taking with me a servant from the magistrates, I went to
                    Theophemus's house. As I did not find him at home, I bade the woman who answered
                    the door to go and fetch him wherever he might be. This was the woman, whom,
                    according to the depositions of these men, Theophemus offered to deliver up, but
                    whom, after repeated demands, I cannot get from him, that you might learn the
                    truth as to which party began the assault. <milestone unit="section" n="36"/>But
                    when Theophemus came in, after the woman had gone to fetch him, I asked for the
                    inventory of the equipment, telling him that I was now on the point of sailing;
                    and I showed him the decree of the senate. When, on my saying this, he refused
                    to give it up, but began to threaten me and abuse me, I bade the boy call in
                    from the street any citizens<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Only a citizen
                        would be a competent witness. A slave or an alien would not suffice.</note>
                    whom he might see passing by, that I might have them as witnesses to what was
                    said, <milestone unit="section" n="37"/>and I again made demand upon Theophemus
                    either to go with me himself to the despatching board and the senate, and, if he
                    denied that he was liable, to convince those who had given over the names and
                    compelled us to seek to recover what was due, or else to pay back the equipment;
                    otherwise, I declared that I should take goods as security in accordance with
                    the laws and the decrees. Since he was not willing to do anything that was
                    right, I started to lead away the woman who was standing by the door, the same
                    one who had gone to fetch him. <milestone unit="section" n="38"/>He seized her
                    to prevent me, and I let go of the woman, but proceeded to enter the house to
                    take some security for the equipment due; for the door, as it happened, had been
                    opened when Theophemus came, and he had not yet gone in. I had already informed
                    myself that he was not married.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Hence the
                        speaker felt at liberty to enter the apartment.</note> As I was going in
                    Theophemus struck me on the mouth with his fist, and I, calling upon those who

                        n="39"/>Now the proof that what I am saying is true, and that Theophemus
                    began the assault, needs, I think, nothing else for its establishment than the
                    testimony of the woman whom these witnesses have stated that Theophemus was
                    ready to deliver up. By means of this testimony Theophemus, whose case came
                    first into court, seeing that I did not enter a special plea or an affidavit for
                    delay, since these measures had once been a disadvantage to me in a former suit,
                    deceived the jurors, saying that the witnesses whom I had brought forward gave
                    false testimony, but that this woman would tell the truth if she were put to the
                    torture. <milestone unit="section" n="40"/>But their actions now are shown to be
                    the very opposite of the language which they then used with such insistence; for
                    I am unable to get the woman for examination despite repeated demands, as has
                    been stated to you by witnesses. Since, therefore, they refuse to deliver up the
                    woman, whom they themselves declare that I was challenged to receive, I desire
                    to call before you the witnesses who saw Theophemus deal me the first blow. And
                    this is what constitutes assault, when a man commits the first act of violence,

                    back from my voyage, men of the jury, as Theophemus refused to refer to anyone
                    the matter of the blows which he had dealt me, I summoned him, and began an
                    action against him for assault. He summoned me in a cross-action, and while the
                    arbitrators had the causes before them, and the time came for making the award,
                    he put in a special plea and an affidavit for postponement; I, however, being
                    conscious that I had done no wrong, came in for trial before your court.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="46"/>Theophemus, by bringing this testimony to
                    which no one else has deposed, but only his brother and his brother-in-law, to
                    the effect that he was willing to deliver up the woman, and by pretending to be
                    a man without guile, deceived the jurors. But now I make of you a fair request,
                    both to decide regarding the testimony whether it is true or false, and at the
                    same time to consider the whole case from the beginning. <milestone

                    which party struck the first blow; for this is what constitutes assault. And it
                    is for this reason that I am suing the witnesses for false testimony, because
                    they deposed that Theophemus was willing to deliver up the woman, whereas he
                    never would produce her in person either at that time before the arbitrator or
                    subsequently, despite my repeated demands. <milestone unit="section" n="48"

                    the false testimony for which I am suing them, and the time for paying the
                    judgement was about to expire, I came up to Theophemus and begged him to oblige
                    me by waiting a little while, telling him what was true, that although I had got
                    together the money which I was going to pay him, a trierarchy had fallen to my
                    lot, <milestone unit="section" n="50"/>and it was necessary to despatch the
                    trireme with all speed, and that Alcimachus, the general, had ordered me to
                    furnish this ship for his own use; the money, therefore, which I had got
                    together to pay Theophemus, I had to use up for this purpose. So I asked him to
                    extend the time of payment until I should have sent off the ship. And he
                    answered me quite readily and guilelessly: &ldquo;There is no objection to
                    that,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but, when you shall have despatched the

                    and especially because I relied upon my impeachment for false testimony and his
                    unwillingness to deliver up the woman, and so thought he would take no violent
                    measures in my affair, I despatched the trireme, and a few days later, having
                    got the money together, I approached him and bade him to go with me to the bank

                    with the children in the court and with her was an elderly woman who had been my

                    when she herself was an old woman and there was nobody to care for her, she came

                    men burst in and found them there, and began to seize the furniture. The rest of

                    when they heard the tumult, closed the door leading to the tower, so the men did

                    although my wife forbade them to touch it, <milestone unit="section" n="57"/>and
                    declared that it was her property, mortgaged to secure her marriage portion; she

                    &lpar;for one of the neighbors knocked at the door and told her
                    this&rpar;. Furthermore she told them that the money was lying at the bank
                    for them, for she had heard me say so. &ldquo;And, if you will wait

                    and put it in her bosom to prevent these men from taking it, when she saw that

                    had lacerations on her throat, where they strangled her, and her breast was
                    black and blue. And they pushed their brutality to such extremes, that they did
                    not stop throttling and beating the old woman, until they had taken the cup from

                    went into the other street and seeing Hagnophilus passing by, bade him to come.
                    Hagnophilus, when he came up, summoned by a servant of Anthemion, who is a

                    had met her end because she would not surrender the cup. When the Interpreters

                    three days. And this is the advice which we give you: since you were not
                    yourself present, but only your wife and your children, and since you have no
                    other witnesses, we advise you not to make proclamation against anyone by name,

                    purify the house and what the Interpreters had prescribed, and abstained from

                    For they thought, men of the jury, that, if they took a large quantity of goods
                    from me as security, I should be glad to release the witnesses from the charge

                    might carry off as many goods as possible. It was for this reason that he
                    acceded to my request so guilelessly and so promptly in order to win my
                    confidence and keep me from seeing his plot; for he thought it was not possible
                    for him in any other way to get the witnesses released from the charge of false
                    testimony than by tricking me, catching me in default and carrying off as many
                    goods as possible; for he expected to get, not only what they actually have of
                    mine, but a great deal more. <milestone unit="section" n="76"/>And he waited the
                    rest of the time, thinking that I should not quickly get the money together, and
                    wishing to seize the goods as security just when the trial for false testimony
                    was coming on; but when I served notice on him to come and collect the amount of
                    the judgement, he went and seized my furniture and slaves and sheep instead of
                    receiving payment. I till a farm near the Hippodrome, so that he did not have
                    far to go. <milestone unit="section" n="77"/>That what I am saying is true let
                    this be a strong proof: he got the amount of the judgement the day after he
                    seized the security. And yet, if I had not got the money together, how could he
                    have got payment at once in cash, one thousand three hundred and thirteen

                    return to me, but up to this day he keeps them, as though I were in default. But
                    to prove that I was not in default, read me the deposition and the law which
                    ordains that all agreements entered into by the two parties shall be binding; I

                    has testified, and also that the ship was equipped as flagship for the admiral
                    Alcimachus. Surely, then, I was not in default to him when he had extended the

                    where Theophemus lived by himself, and when I did not find him at home, I did
                    not seize anything and carry it off, but bade someone fetch him, and I took the

                    had preferred my impeachment and had convicted him in the senate, I thought it
                    enough merely to recover the ship's equipment, and to leave the matter of the

                    Olympiodorus, who is a relative of mine and whose sister is my wife, I have been
                    forced to do so because of the magnitude of the wrongs which he has done me.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>If I were entering upon this course, men of

                    of the, jury, a relative of ours. This Comon died without issue after a very
                    short illness; he had lived, however, many years, and was an old man when he
                    died. When I saw that he could not possibly recover, I sent for the defendant
                    Olympiodorus that he might be with us, and join with us in taking all proper
                    measures. And Olympiodorus, when he had come to me and to my wife, who is his
                    own sister, aided us in making all the arrangements. <milestone unit="section"
                        n="6"/>While we were thus occupied, this fellow Olympiodorus suddenly flung
                    at me the statement that his mother also was related to Comon, the dead man, and
                    that it was fair that he, too, should receive his share of all the property
                    which Comon left. I for my part, men of the jury, as I knew that he was lying
                    and trying to put a bold face on it, and that there was nobody else nearer of
                    kin to Comon than myself, became at first exceedingly wroth and indignant at the
                    shamelessness of his claim; presently, however, I reflected that it was not a
                    proper time for anger, and I made answer to him, that for the present it was our
                    duty to bury the dead man and do all else that custom called for, and that after
                    we should have discharged all these duties we would talk with one another.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>And Olympiodorus, men of the jury, assented
                    to this, and said that I was quite right. So when we had finished all this, and
                    had done all that custom required, we called in all our relatives and quietly
                    discussed with one another the claims which this fellow advanced. Now, men of
                    the jury, why should I weary you or myself by relating the various differences
                    which arose between us as we talked these matters over? <milestone

                    necessary for you to hear. I myself reached the decision regarding his claims,
                    and he regarding mine, that we should each take half of what Comon left, and
                    there should be no further unpleasantness between us. I chose, men of the jury,
                    voluntarily to share the inheritance with him rather than come into court and
                    risk a trial with the fellow, who is a relative, and to say unpleasant things of
                    one who is a brother of my wife and the uncle of my children, and hear
                    disagreeable things from him. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Thinking of all
                    these things I came to terms with him.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>After this

                        n="10"/>For we suspected, men of the jury, that others besides ourselves
                    would come to lay claim to the estate of Comon. For instance, there was my
                    brother, on my father's but not my mother's side, who was out of the country;
                    and, if anyone else wished to put in a claim, there was no way for us to prevent
                    it; for the laws ordain that anyone who chooses may put in a claim. Foreseeing
                    all these contingencies, we drew up our articles of agreement and swore our
                    oaths in order that neither of us might have the opportunity of doing anything
                    whatever independently, whether he should wish to do so or not, but that we

                    exchanged oaths, and the articles had been deposited with Androcleides, I
                    divided the property into two shares, men of the jury. One share consisted of
                    the house in which Comon himself had lived, and the slaves engaged in weaving
                    sackcloth, and the other of another house and the slaves engaged in grinding
                    colors. Whatever ready money Comon left in the bank of Heracleides had been
                    nearly all spent on his burial and the other funeral rites, and on the building
                    of his tomb. <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>And after I had divided the
                    property into these two shares, I gave Olympiodorus his choice to take whichever
                    of the two shares he pleased; and he chose the color-grinders and the small
                    house, while I took the weavers and the dwelling-house. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="14"/>This is what each of us had. Now in the share of this
                    fellow Olympiodorus there was a man, one of the color-grinders, whom Comon used
                    to regard as most faithful to himself; the man's name was Moschion. This slave
                    had a pretty good knowledge of all Comon's other affairs, and in particular knew
                    where the money was which Comon kept in the house; <milestone unit="section"
                        n="15"/>and Comon, who was oldish and who had confidence in him, was unaware
                    that this slave Moschion was stealing his money. He first stole from him one
                    thousand drachmae, which sum was kept separate from the rest of the money, and
                    afterwards seventy minae more. He was doing this without Comon's suspecting it,
                    and the fellow kept all this money in his own possession. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="16"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Soon after we had
                    divided the shares between us, men of the jury, we became suspicious, and found
                    out something about this money; and as a result of this suspicion Olympiodorus
                    here and I decided to put the man to the torture. And the fellow, men of the
                    jury, before he was put to the torture, voluntarily confessed that he had stolen
                    a thousand drachmae from Comon, and said that he still had in his quarters all
                    the money which had not been spent; but of the larger sum he did not say a word
                    at that time. <milestone unit="section" n="17"/>So he paid back about six
                    hundred drachmae. And of this sum which the man paid back we made a just and
                    fair division in accordance with the oaths which we had sworn and the agreement
                    deposited with Androcleides, I taking one half and the defendant Olympiodorus
                    the other. <milestone unit="section" n="18"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Not
                    long after this, as a result of the suspicion against the slave in regard to the
                    money, the defendant had the man bound and again put to the torture. He did this
                    independently by himself without calling me in, although he had sworn to make
                    all inquiries and do everything in concert with me. And the fellow, men of the
                    jury, when racked by the torture made further confession that he had stolen from
                    Comon the seventy minae; and he restored this entire sum to the defendant
                    Olympiodorus. <milestone unit="section" n="19"/>I, on my part, men of the jury,
                    when I learned that the man had been tortured, and that he had restored the
                    money, supposed that Olympiodorus would pay me half the amount, just as he had
                    before paid me half of the one thousand drachmae. At first I did not press him,
                    thinking that he would recognize his obligation and arrange matters for my
                    interest and his own, so that each of us should have what was fair in accordance
                    with our oaths and our mutual agreement to share equally in all that Comon left;
                        <milestone unit="section" n="20"/>but since he delayed, and did nothing, I
                    had a talk with this man Olympiodorus, and demanded that I receive my share of
                    the money. But Olympiodorus here kept finding one excuse after another, and
                    putting me off. Moreover, at this very time some other people filed claims to
                    the estate of Comon, and Callippus, my brother on my father's side, returned
                    from abroad; and he too filed a claim for half the estate. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="21"/>So Olympiodorus found in this another excuse for not
                    paying me the money, since there were many who were laying claim to the estate;
                    and he said that I must wait until the suits were settled. And I had to consent
                    to this, and I did consent. <milestone unit="section" n="22"/><milestone ed="P"
                        unit="para"/>After this the defendant Olympiodorus and I took counsel
                    together, as we had sworn to do, to determine the best and safest way to deal
                    with the other claimants. And we decided, men of the jury, that the defendant
                    Olympiodorus should lay claim to the whole estate, and that,I should claim a
                    half, seeing that my brother Callippus claimed a half only. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="23"/>When all the claims had been heard before the archon,
                    and the cases were due to be tried in court, the defendant Olympiodorus and I
                    were wholly unprepared for an immediate trial because those who had suddenly
                    appeared as claimants were so many. However, in view of the situation that had
                    developed, we looked into things jointly to see if in any way a postponement
                    could be brought about for the present, so that we might get ourselves ready for
                    the trial at our leisure. <milestone unit="section" n="24"/>And it happened by a
                    piece of good luck that you were persuaded by the politicians to despatch troops
                    into Acarnania,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Acarnania was a state on the
                        west coast of Greece, north of the Gulf of Corinth.</note> and the defendant
                    Olympiodorus was among those called to service, and he departed with the others
                    on the expedition. Thus had come about, as we thought, an excellent ground for
                    postponement, the defendant being abroad on military service. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="25"/>So, when the archon summoned into court all those who
                    were filing claims according to law, I entered a sworn statement, asking
                    postponement on the ground that the defendant Olympiodorus was abroad on
                    military service, but to this sworn statement our adversaries opposed another,
                    attacking Olympiodorus; and as they had the last word, they induced the jurors
                    to decide that the defendant was absent on account of the trial and not on
                    public service. <milestone unit="section" n="26"/>When the jurors had thus
                    decided, the archon Pythodotus<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">The date was
                            <date value="-343">343</date> B.C.</note> in accordance with the law
                    struck out the claim of the defendant; and when this claim was stricken out I
                    necessarily had to abandon my claim to half the estate. After these steps had
                    been taken, the archon adjudged the estate of Comon to our opponents; for the
                    laws compelled him to do so. <milestone unit="section" n="27"/>They, as soon as
                    they had won the adjudication, went at once to the Peiraeus and proceeded to
                    take over all that either of us had received from the division. I, being at
                    home, voluntarily gave over to them what I had &lpar;for it was necessary to
                    obey the laws&rpar;, but since Olympiodorus was abroad, they carried off all
                    his effects except the money which he had separately taken from the
                    man&mdash;the slave whom he had put to the torture; for they had no means of
                    getting hold of that money. <milestone unit="section" n="28"/><milestone ed="P"
                        unit="para"/>Such were the events which happened in the absence of
                    Olympiodorus, and such the benefit I derived from my association with him. But
                    when he returned with the rest of the troops, the defendant Olympiodorus was
                    indignant, men of the jury, at what had occurred, and thought he had been
                    outrageously treated. However, when he was at the height of his indignation, we
                    again looked matters over, the defendant Olympiodorus and I, and took counsel
                    together to see how we could get back something of what we had lost. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="29"/>And as a result of our consultation we decided to
                    summon into court in due legal form those who had had the property adjudged to
                    them; and in the circumstances it seemed to be the safest course not to risk a
                    joint suit against the other claimants, but for each to act separately; and for
                    the defendant Olympiodorus to enter suit for the whole estate as he had done
                    before, and conduct his case by himself, and for me to enter suit for a half,
                    since my brother Callippus claimed the half only; <milestone unit="section"
                        n="30"/>so that, if Olympiodorus should win his case, I, in accordance with
                    our agreement and our oaths, might recover my share from him, while, if he
                    should lose it and the jurors give an adverse verdict, he might fairly and
                    honestly recover his share from me in accordance with our oaths and the
                    agreement made between us. After we had reached this conclusion, and it seemed
                    safest both for Olympiodorus and for me, all those who were in possession of the
                    estate of Comon were summoned according to law.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"

                    the archon conducted the preliminary examination for all claimants, and when he
                    had concluded this he brought the case into court. The defendant Olympiodorus
                    was the first to plead, and he said whatever he pleased and offered whatever

                    that if he made use of any falsehoods, he would be refuted by them on the spot,
                    whereas he thinks that now he may perhaps lie before you without being detected.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="41"/>Again I say, it is not consistent,
                    Olympiodorus, that I should act in opposition to you, and yet should join with
                    you in expending whatever from time to time became necessary, or that I should
                    myself voluntarily abandon my claim, when you were abroad and your claim was
                    stricken off because it was thought that you were absent on account of the trial
                    and not on public service. For it was open to me to press my own claim for
                    one-half the estate; no human being opposed my claim, but my opponents
                    themselves allowed it. <milestone unit="section" n="42"/>However, had I done
                    this, I should by that very act have perjured myself, for I had sworn and
                    contracted with you to do in concert with you whatever should seem to us on
                    consultation to be best. Therefore the pretexts and charges on which you base
                    your refusal to act fairly toward me are absolutely silly. <milestone

                    Olympiodorus, that in the last trial for the estate I should have permitted you
                    either to utter so recklessly the statements which you made to the jury, or to
                    bring forward witnesses as you did regarding the points you wished to prove, if
                    I had not been acting in concert with you in the trial? <milestone
                        unit="section" n="44"/>For the fellow, men of the jury, said everything else
                    that he pleased in the court-room, and emphatically stated to the jurymen that I
                    had rented from him the house which I received as part of my share, and that I
                    had borrowed of him the money which I received&mdash;the half, that is, of
                    the thousand drachmae recovered from the slave. And he not only made these
                    statements, but he produced depositions to support them. And I said nothing
                    whatever against all this, nor did any human being hear a syllable aloud or
                    muttered from me while he was supporting his claim, but I admitted the truth of
                    everything he chose to say. For I was cooperating with you, Olympiodorus,
                    according to our agreement. <milestone unit="section" n="45"/>If what I am
                    saying is not true, why did I not proceed against the witnesses who gave this
                    evidence instead of keeping absolute silence? Or why did you, Olympiodorus,
                    never sue me for the rent of the house which you alleged was your own and had
                    been rented by you to me; or for the money which you told the jurymen you had
                    lent me? Why, I say, did you do neither of these things? How, then, could any
                    man be more clearly convicted than you have been of lying, of making
                    contradictory statements, and of preferring charges that lack all foundation?

                    the strongest proof of all, which will convince you, men of the jury, of his bad

                    stated it and proved it before the trial came on, and before he tested the jury
                    as to how it would decide; and he should have taken a number of witnesses and
                    demanded that the articles of agreement be taken from the custody of
                    Androcleides on the ground that I was violating them, and acting against his
                    interests, and that the articles were no longer in force between him and me;
                    also he should have protested to Androcleides, who had the articles in his

                    he has no children nor has ever had any, but he keeps in his house a mistress

                    to the sixty trierarchs who set out on the voyage with him, which money he as
                    admiral had forced them to distribute among their crews for maintenance.

                    should give evidence against him and he should be convicted of lying, he
                    borrowed privately from each one of them seven minae, and gave them a mortgage
                    on his property. Yet he is now seeking to rob them of this money, and he has dug

                    and, furthermore, those who came from the army were reporting before the

                    was on the point of sailing home for his trial, the defendant, while still in
                    Calaureia, borrowed from Antiphanes of Lamptrae,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes"
                        >Lamptrae was a deme of the tribe Erectheis.</note> who sailed with Philip

                    among the Boeotian trierarchs, that they might remain with the fleet until his
                    trial should come off, for fear lest, if the Boeotian fleet should first be
                    broken up and the troops scattered here and there to their homes, you might be
                    the more incensed against him. <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>For although
                    our countrymen endured their privations and remained at their posts, the
                    Boeotians declared that they would not stay, unless somebody should furnish them
                    with their daily rations. Under stress of necessity, then, at that time he
                    borrowed the thousand drachmae from Antiphanes, who sailed with Philip, the
                    shipowner, as his treasurer, and gave them to the admiral of the Boeotian fleet.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="16"/>But when he got back to Athens, both
                    Philip and Antiphanes demanded of him the thousand drachmae which he had
                    borrowed in Calaureia, and were angry at not receiving their money at once.
                    Timotheus, then, fearing that his enemies might learn that the thousand
                    drachmae, which in his report he stated he had paid for the Boeotian fleet out
                    of the military fund, had in fact been lent by Philip, who could not get them
                    back, <milestone unit="section" n="17"/>and fearing also that Philip might give
                    testimony against him at his trial, came to my father and begged him to settle
                    with Philip, and to lend him the thousand drachmae to pay Philip. And my father,
                    seeing the seriousness of the trial in which the defendant was involved, and in
                    what plight he was, felt pity for him, and, taking him to the bank, bade
                    Phormio, who was cashier, to pay Philip the thousand drachmae, and to enter on
                    the books Timotheus as owing that amount. <milestone unit="section" n="18"
                        /><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>To prove that these statements are true, I
                    shall bring forward Phormio, who paid the money, as a witness, as soon as I
                    shall have explained to you the other loan, in order that, being informed
                    through the same deposition about the whole of the debt, you may know that I am
                    speaking the truth. I shall also call before you Antiphanes, who lent the sum of
                    one thousand drachmae to the defendant in Calaureia, and who was present when
                    Philip received payment of the money from my father here in Athens. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="19"/>That I did not put the deposition in the box before
                    the arbitrator was due to a trick of Antiphanes, who kept saying that he would
                    give evidence for me on the day set for the decision; but when the hearing was
                    in progress before the arbitrator, although he was summoned from his house
                    &lpar;for he was nowhere to be seen&rpar;, he was persuaded by Timotheus
                    to fail to appear as a witness. On my depositing a drachma in his name on a
                    charge of failing to appear, as the law prescribes, the arbitrator did not make
                    an award against the defendant, but decided in his favor, and then went off, for
                    it was already late. <milestone unit="section" n="20"/>Now, however, I have
                    entered suit on my own account for damages against Antiphanes because he neither
                    gave testimony for me, nor asked under oath for a postponement, as the law
                    provides. And I demand of him that he get up and state under oath before you,
                    first, whether he lent Timotheus a thousand drachmae in Calaureia, and secondly,
                    whether Philip received here payment of that sum from my father. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="21"/>The defendant himself practically admitted before the
                    arbitrator that my father paid Philip the thousand drachmae; but he declared
                    that it was not to him &lpar;Timotheus&rpar; that my father lent the
                    money, but to the Boeotian admiral, who, he alleges, gave some copper as
                    security for the sum. However, that in this he was not stating the truth, but
                    that he borrowed the money himself and is seeking to avoid payment, I shall
                    prove to you, when I shall have informed you in detail regarding his other debts

                    Alcetas and Jason came to visit Timotheus to be present at his trial and give

                    him ask for the loan of some bedding and cloaks and two silver bowls and to
                    borrow a mina of silver. <milestone unit="section" n="23"/>And my father,
                    hearing from Aeschrion, the body-servant of the defendant, that they had arrived
                    and the urgent need for which the request was made, both supplied the objects
                    for which the slave had come and lent the mina of silver which he asked to
                    borrow. Well, when he had been acquitted of the charge, the defendant found
                    himself in sore straits for money to pay his private debts and the taxes to the
                    state, and my father, seeing this, did not venture to demand repayment of the
                    money at once; <milestone unit="section" n="24"/>for, while he did not think
                    that Timotheus would defraud him when he had the means to pay, he did not
                    himself see any way to exact payment from him when he was without means. So,
                    after the departure of Alcetas and Jason, Aeschrion, the defendant's
                    body-servant, brought back the bedding and the cloaks, but he did not return the
                    two bowls, for which he had asked at the time he borrowed the bedding and the
                    mina of silver., when Alcetas and Jason arrived at the defendant's house.

                    an account and vouchers for his military administration here, he sent for my

                    and was employed in his service&mdash;he begged my father, that when
                    Philonidas &lpar;whom he then introduced to him&rpar; should come back

                    he declared the timber belonged to him. <milestone unit="section" n="27"/>At the
                    same time in preferring this request, he made statements which are quite
                    inconsistent with his present actions. For he said that even if he should not
                    obtain what he asked of my father, he would not be angry, as another might who
                    failed to obtain what he wanted, but would show his gratitude, if he should ever
                    find himself able to do so, for the services which my father had rendered him at
                    his request. On hearing this my father was pleased at his words and commended
                    him for remembering the favors shown him, and promised to do all that he asked.

                    on his journey to Macedonia. The time was about the month Thargelion,<note

                    service. He approached my father and asked him to furnish the freight for the
                    timber, in order that he might settle with the shipowner, as Timotheus had
                    begged my father to do, when he was about to sail and had introduced Philondas
                    to him. So my father took him to the bank and ordered Phormio to pay him the
                    freight of the timber, one thousand seven hundred and fifty drachmae. <milestone

                    when he set sail he had given to Phormio to put away for him along with other
                    articles two bowls of Lycian workmanship. By chance the boy, not knowing that
                    these bowls were the property of someone else, gave them to Aeschrion, the
                    body-servant of the defendant, when he was sent to my father by Timotheus and
                    requested the bedding and the cloaks and the bowls, and borrowed the mina of

                    for the return of the bowls, Timotheus being still abroad in the king's service,
                    my father persuaded him to accept the value of the bowls, as much as they were
                    worth by weight, namely two hundred and thirty-seven drachmae. So he paid to
                    Timosthenes the value of the bowls and entered on his books the defendant as

                    away from the harbor, seeing that it was pledeged as security to him for the
                    freight, and would not rather have set one of his servants to keep watch and to
                    receive the price as the timber was sold, until he had recovered his money, if
                    we suppose that the timber was the property of Philondas and was brought in for
                    the sake of trade? <milestone unit="section" n="36"/>Then, besides this, does it
                    seem to anyone likely, that if Timotheus had not bidden my father to supply the
                    freight for the timber given to him by Amyntas, my father would have trusted
                    Philondas, and have suffered him to deliver the timber to the defendant's house?
                    Or, how is it possible that Philondas, as is stated by the defendant, brought in
                    the timber for the sake of trade, and yet that the defendant on his return used
                    this timber for the building of his house? <milestone unit="section" n="37"/>And
                    observe this also, that many worthy citizens were friends of the defendant and
                    looked after his affairs while Timotheus was abroad in the service of the king,
                    and yet not one of these has dared to testify on his behalf either that
                    Philondas did not receive from the bank the freight of the timber, or that,
                    having received it, he paid it back; or, again, that any one of them settled for
                    the freight of the timber which Philondas brought and which had been given to
                    the defendant by Amyntas. For they deem it a matter of higher import to
                    themselves to preserve their character as worthy and honorable men than to do a
                    favor to Timotheus by giving false testimony. <milestone unit="section" n="38"
                    />But they declared that they would not testify to the truth against him; for
                    they said he was their friend. Since, then, no one of those who are his friends,
                    and who looked after his affairs when he was abroad in the service of the king,
                    has ventured to testify either that Philondas did not receive from the bank the
                    freight for the timber, or that any one of them paid it, is it not reasonable
                    that you should believe that I am speaking the truth? <milestone unit="section"
                        n="39"/>Surely he will not venture to say this, that anyone other than my
                    father paid the freight for the timber which Philondas brought. If he does
                    insist upon this argument, demand of him that he produce before you the
                    deposition of the person who paid the freight for the timber. For it is admitted
                    that he was himself abroad in the king's service, and as for Philondas, whom he
                    sent to fetch the timber and whom he introduced to my father&mdash;you found
                    on your return from the king's service, Timotheus, that he was dead. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="40"/>It must be, then, that some other of your relatives
                    and friends, whom you left to look after your affairs when you were about to go
                    abroad, knows from what source Philondas got the freight for the timber and paid
                    the shipowner, if you deny that you introduced my father to Philondas, or that
                    Philondas got the freight for the timber from my father. <milestone

                    your friends to prove that the freight for the timber was not received from the
                    bank, while you were abroad; therefore one or the other of two things follows:
                    either you are on good terms with no one of your friends and have no confidence
                    in any of your connections, or else, though knowing well that Philondas did

                    Timotheus was left by my father owing us the money as a debtor for which I am

                    brought out the books and allowed Phrasiendes to examine them and to copy out
                    the entries of all the sums that Timotheus owed. To prove that the defendant

                    brought the books to the arbitrator. Phormio and Euphraeus, who had paid the
                    money to the persons designated by Timotheus, were present, and they exposed his
                    falsehoods by showing the date at which he had contracted each loan, the person
                    who received the money, and the use for which he expended it. Regarding the one
                    thousand three hundred and fifty-one drachmae two obols, which he borrowed as
                    the first loan in the month Munichion in the archonship of Socratidas, when he
                    was about to set out on his voyage, and which the defendant ordered to be paid
                    to Antimachus, his treasurer, he declared that my father lent the money to
                    Antimachus on his own private account, and that he &lpar;the
                    defendant&rpar; did not himself receive it. <milestone unit="section" n="45"
                    />To prove the truth of this statement he has produced no witness, but is
                    vigorous in his assertion, in order that it may not appear that he is himself
                    defrauding us, but that Antimachus borrowed the money. And yet, men of the jury,
                    I will give you a convincing proof that my father lent the money, not to
                    Antimachus, but to Timotheus when he was about to sail. For which do you think
                    would have been the easier course for my father, to file a claim against the
                    estate of Antimachus, when his property was confiscated, for this sum as due to
                    him, supposing he had lent it to Antimachus, <milestone unit="section" n="46"
                    />or to wait until the defendant might be in better circumstances so as to
                    collect it from him, seeing that he had at that time little hope of deliverance?
                    Surely, if he had filed the claim, he would not have been at a loss to find the
                    deposit money,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">This was a small sum to cover
                        court charges.</note> nor would you have had any cause to disbelieve him.
                    For you all know that my father had no wish unjustly to acquire public funds,
                    but that he willingly expended his own money in your service whenever you bade
                    him do so; <milestone unit="section" n="47"/>and besides, Callistratus, who sold
                    the goods of Antimachus, was a friend of his, so that my father was meeting no
                    opposition. What possible motive then, could my father have had to leave
                    Timotheus inscribed in his books is our debtor, if he did not really owe the
                    money, rather than file his claim and recover his debt from the confiscated
                    estate of Antimachus? <milestone unit="section" n="48"/><milestone ed="P"
                        unit="para"/>Now with regard to the one thousand drachmae which he borrowed
                    from Antiphanes in Calaureia to distribute to the Boeotian trierarchs,when he
                    was about to sail home for his trial, and which he paid to Philip the shipowner
                    after he had got them from my father, he maintains that the Boeotian admiral
                    borrowed the money and gave my father some copper as security for it. That this,
                    however, is untrue, I will give you a convincing proof. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="49"/>In the first place, it is proved that the defendant
                    borrowed the thousand drachmae in Calaureia, and not the Boeotian admiral;
                    secondly, that Philip demanded payment of the thousand drachmae here from
                    Timotheus and not from the Boeotian admiral, and that Timotheus made payment and
                    not the Boeotian admiral; for it was quite proper that the Boeotian admiral
                    should receive from Timotheus the maintenance for the crews of his ships, since
                    the pay for the troops came out of a common contribution, and it was you,
                    Timotheus, who collected all the money from the allies, and you were bound to
                    account for it. <milestone unit="section" n="50"/>Again, supposing the Boeotian
                    fleet had disbanded and the troops had dispersed to their various homes, the
                    Boeotian admiral was in no danger from the Athenians, nor was any trial
                    impending over him; you, however, were in very great danger, and in your utter
                    terror you thought it would be a great aid to your defence, if the Boeotian
                    triremes should stay with the fleet until your trial should come off. Besides,
                    from what motive of friendship pray, would my father have lent the one thousand
                    drachmae to the Boeotian admiral whom he did not even know? Ah, but he says the
                    admiral pledged some copper as security. How much, then? and from what country
                    was it imported? <milestone unit="section" n="51"/>And from what source did the
                    Boeotian admiral get the copper? Was it imported by way of trade, or was it
                    obtained from prisoners? Then who were the persons who brought the copper to my
                    father? Were they hired men, or slaves? <milestone unit="section" n="52"/>And
                    which one of our slaves was it who received it? For, if slaves brought it, he
                    ought to have delivered them up for the torture, but if hired men, he ought to
                    have demanded for the torture the slave of ours who received and weighed the
                    copper; for, I fancy, neither would the one taking the copper in pledge accept
                    it, nor the one offering it give it over, without weighing; nor was my father
                    likely to carry the copper and weigh it himself, since he had slaves who were
                    accustomed to receive the articles given as security for loans. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="53"/>And I certainly wonder for what possible reason the
                    Boeotian admiral should have given the copper to my father as security, if he
                    owed a thousand drachmae to Philip. Was it that Philip would not have been glad
                    to receive interest, if his money was lent safely and on security? or that
                    Philip had no money? So, what need was there for the Boeotian admiral to ask my
                    father to lend the thousand drachmae and pay Philip, rather than give the copper
                    as security to Philip? <milestone unit="section" n="54"/>But, men of the jury,
                    the copper was not given as security, nor did the Boeotian admiral borrow the
                    thousand drachmae from my father, but this man Timotheus borrowed them, being in
                    great distress; and the urgent need, to meet which he used the money, I have
                    told you. But instead of evincing gratitude for the confidence shown him and the
                    loan which he received from my father, he thinks it proper to defraud us, if he
                    can, even of the principal. <milestone unit="section" n="55"/><milestone ed="P"

                    I asked him before the arbitrator if Aeschrion was still a slave, and demanded
                    that he be put to the test &ldquo;in his hide.&rdquo;<note resp="Loeb"

                    deposition from Aeschrion, as being free, nor would he deliver him up as a slave
                    that proof might be had from his body; for he was afraid that, if he produced a
                    deposition from him as being free, I should bring suit for false testimony, and
                    after proving that Aeschrion had testified falsely, should proceed against
                    Timotheus himself for subornation, as the law provides; and if, again, he should
                    deliver him up for the torture, he was afraid that Aeschrion would state the
                    truth against him. <milestone unit="section" n="57"/>And yet it was a fine
                    opportunity for him, if he was unable to produce witnesses concerning the other
                    receipts of money, to prove this at any rate by the words of
                    Aeschrion&mdash;that the bowls and the mina of silver were not received, and
                    that Aeschrion was not sent by him to my father; and then to use this as
                    evidence to you that I am uttering falsehoods in regard to my other claims upon
                    him, seeing that his slave, whom I declare to have received the bowls and the

                    received the bowls from my father and to have borrowed the mina of silver, let
                    it also be evidence for me to use before you, that knowing my claims to be true,

                    father supposed he would return the bowls which he had borrowed; but when he
                    went off without having returned them, and the bowls of Timosthenes were no
                    longer in the custody of Phormio, and the one who had deposited them came and
                    demanded their return, my father paid the price of the bowls to Timosthenes, and
                    wrote the defendant down as owing this sum in addition to the rest of his debt.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="63"/>If, then, he makes use of this defence,
                    that he was not in Athens at the time when he was debited with the cost of the

                    since you did not return them, and were abroad, and the bowls which the
                    depositor claimed were not there, you were debited with their value, that sum,

                    Timotheus. He trusted you in regard to the rest of your debt, and believed that
                    after your return to Athens he would recover his money from you, when you should
                    be better off for funds. Was he, then, going to distrust you in the matter of
                    the bowls? He promised at your request that he would provide the freight for the
                    timber when you were sailing to take service with the king; was he, then, going
                    to distrust you because of a couple of bowls? He did not demand of you that you
                    pay the rest of the debt, because he saw that you were without funds. Was he,

                    which I tendered the defendant, and he tendered me. For after I had put an oath
                    in the evidence-box, he thought that, by taking an oath himself, he could be
                    quit of the affair. And, if I had not known that he had flagrantly perjured
                    himself in many solemn oaths both to states and to individuals, I should have
                    allowed him to take the oath; but as it was, seeing that I had witnesses to
                    prove that the persons appointed by him had in fact received the money from the
                    bank, and conclusive circumstantial evidence as well, it seemed to me a
                    monstrous thing to give an oath to one who would not only take no care to swear
                    honestly, but who, when it was a question of gain, has not spared even temples.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="66"/>The specific instances of the perjuries
                    which he has committed without scruple would make a long story; but I will call
                    to your minds the most flagrant instances and those of which you are all well
                    aware. You know that he swore in the assembly, imprecating destruction upon
                    himself and dedicating his property to sacred uses, if he should fail to indict
                    Iphicrates as a usurper of the rights of citizenship. Yet, although he had sworn
                    and promised this in the assembly, no long time afterwards, in order to serve
                    his own interests, he gave his daughter in marraige to the son of Iphicrates.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="67"/>When a man, then, felt no shame in
                    deceiving you to whom he had pledged his word, though there are laws which
                    declare that, if a man deceive the people by a promise, he shall be liable to
                    impeachment,&mdash;when, after swearing and imprecating destruction upon
                    himself, he had no fear of the gods in whose name he had perjured
                    himself&mdash;was it strange that I was unwilling to allow him to take an
                    oath? Again, not very long ago, he once more solemnly declared in the assembly
                    that he had not adequate provision for his old age&mdash;he, who possesses
                    so large an estate; so insatiate and grasping is his character. <milestone

                    feel anger against bankers who have failed. For, if you have reason to feel
                    anger against them because they do you injury, is it not reasonable for you to
                    support those who do you no injury? Surely it is through men like Timotheus that
                    banks are caused to fail; for when they are in need they borrow money, and think
                    they should obtain credit because of their reputation; but when they are in
                    funds they do not make payments but seek to defraud their creditors. <milestone

                    that no successor had arrived to take command from whom they could expect any

                    interest of the defendant by serving beyond my term, since he did not come to
                    take over the ship, and all the dangers I myself incurred from storms and from
                    the enemy. For after we had convoyed the ships to Maroneia, and had arrived at
                    Thasos, Timomachus came and undertook again in conjunction with the Thasians to

                    arrayed their ships against us in defence of the place, and offered battle, and
                    our men were tired out with their long voyage and from towing the ships from
                    Thasos to Strym&ecirc; besides, it was stormy, and the place offered no
                    harbor, and it was impossible to go ashore and get a meal, for the country was
                    hostile, and all around the wall bands of mercenaries and barbarians from the
                    neighborhood lay encamped; so we were forced to ride at anchor all night long in
                    the open sea without food and without sleep, keeping watch lest the ships of the

                    was this all. It was our lot to have by night rain and thunder and a violent

                    desertion I had again to face after this? For the old sailors had borne many
                    hardships and received but little compensation&mdash;merely what I was able
                    to borrow and give to each man in addition to what they had had from me before,
                    since the general did not supply enough even for their daily sustenance. By now
                    I had served three months beyond my term, and the defendant had not yet come to
                    take over the ship; but I borrowed money and hired sailors to replace those who

                    />The defendant alone of the trierarchs appointed to succeed us has no excuse
                    left him for not having come to take over the ship long before. For Euctemon,
                    the pentecontarch, after he was sent home from the Hellespont on account of his
                    sickness, when he reached port and heard that Polycles had been appointed to
                    relieve me, knowing that the term of my trierarchy had expired and that I was
                    now serving over time, took with him my father-in-law, Deinias, and coming up to
                    Polycles in the sample market, bade him set sail and take over the ship with all
                    speed, telling him that the expenses which were incurred every day in addition
                    to the provision money supplied by the general were very heavy. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="25"/>He told him in detail of the pay given each month to
                    the rowers and the marines, both to the sailors whom he had himself hired at
                    Lampsacus and to those who came on board subsequently to replace those who had
                    deserted, and also of the additional sums which I had given to each of the old
                    sailors at their request after the term of my trierarchy had expired, and all
                    the rest of the money expended upon the ship from day to day. With all these
                    matters Euctemon was thoroughly acquainted, for it was through him as
                    pentecontarch that all purchases and disbursements were made. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="26"/>He told him, too, about the ship's equipment, that it
                    was wholly my own, and that I had nothing from the public stores.
                    &ldquo;Therefore,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;plan to come to an
                    agreement with him, or sail from here taking your own equipment with you. I
                    think, however,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that he will readily come to
                    terms with you; for he owes money there, which he will be glad to pay from the
                    price of the equipment.&rdquo; When the defendant heard these words from
                    Euctemon and Deinias my father-in-law, he made no answer to them regarding the
                    matters of which they spoke but, they said, he broke into a laugh, and said,
                    &ldquo;The mouse has just tasted pitch<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes"> A

                    friends and connections of mine, again approached him, and urged him to go and
                    take over the ship, as he had been designated as my successor; and they told him
                    about the equipment, that it was wholly my own, and that I had nothing from the

                    Regarding the wear and tear of the ship's equipment they were willing to draw up
                    an agreement with him, and themselves to be sureties for me, that he would

                    proofs from which I think I can show you that Polycles neither at the first

                    decree to go and join the ship, was he willing to take it over as my successor.
                    For after he arrived at Thasos, when I was serving for the fourth month after my
                    term had expired, I took witnesses with me, as many of the citizens as I could
                    and the marines and rowers, and, coming up to him in the market-place at Thasos,
                    I bade him take over the ship from me as my successor and repay me what I had
                    expended since the expiration of my term. <milestone unit="section" n="30"/>I
                    was ready to reckon it up item by item, while I had by me as witnesses to the
                    expenditures the sailors and the marines and the rowers, in order that, if he
                    disputed anything, I might refute him at once. Everything had been recorded so
                    accurately by me, that I had written down not only the disbursements themselves,
                    but also the objects for which the money had been spent, the nature of the
                    service rendered, what the price was, in the coinage of what country the payment
                    was made, and what the loss in exchange was, in order that I might be able to
                    give convincing proof to my successor, if he thought any false entries were
                    being made against him. <milestone unit="section" n="31"/>And besides I was
                    ready to take an oath to confirm my reckoning. Upon my giving him this
                    challenge, he answered that he had no interest in what I was saying. At this
                    point a servant came from the general with orders for me to set sail. The order
                    was given to me, not to the defendant, my successor, upon whom the duty was now
                    devolving; but the reason for this I will explain in the course of my address.
                    For the time being it seemed to me best to weigh anchor and sail where he
                    ordered me, <milestone unit="section" n="32"/>but when I put into Thasos again,
                    after towing the vessels to Strym&ecirc; as the general had ordered, bidding
                    the sailors and the marines and the rowers to remain on board, I went by myself
                    to the house where the general, Timomachus, lodged, wishing that he too should
                    be present, when I offered the ship with her full crew to the defendant
                    Polycles. <milestone unit="section" n="33"/>I found the defendant there and the
                    trierarchs and those who were to succeed them, and some others of our citizens;
                    and on coming in I spoke at once to Polycles in the presence of the general, and
                    called upon him to take over the ship from me, and to pay me for the
                    disbursements made during the period since my term of service had expired; and I
                    asked him about the ship's equipment, whether he would take it over, or whether
                    he had brought equipment of his own with him. <milestone unit="section" n="34"
                    />When I thus challenged him, he asked me why I was the only one of the

                    there were some people able to provide equipment for their ships, so that the
                    state itself did not need to do it. &ldquo;Or have you,&rdquo; he said,
                    &ldquo;so far surpassed the others in wealth as to be the only one of the

                    a ship, and able also to make use of the baths, and marines and rowers rendered
                    luxurious by high wages paid in full? Bad ways,&rdquo; he said,
                    &ldquo;are these you have taught the army. It is partly your fault that the
                    troops of the other trierarchs have become more unruly, seeking to have the same
                    treatment that yours enjoy; you ought to have done the same as the other
                    trierarchs.&rdquo; <milestone unit="section" n="36"/>Upon his saying this, I
                    answered that the reason I had taken no equipment from the docks was because,
                    &ldquo;You,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;have brought the stores into bad
                    repute. However, if you like, take this equipment of mine; if not, provide
                    equipment for yourself. As for the sailors and marines and rowers, if you say
                    that they have been corrupted by me, take over the ship, and get sailors and
                    marines and rowers for yourself, who will sail with you without pay. But take
                    over the ship, for it is not my place to serve any longer; the term of my

                        <milestone unit="section" n="37"/>When I said this to him, he answered that
                    his colleague in the trierarchy had not come to the ship.
                    &ldquo;So,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I will not take over the ship
                    alone.&rdquo; To prove that I am telling you the truth in this, that in the
                    market-place he made the answer mentioned above, that he cared nothing for what
                    I was saying, and that in the house where Timomachus lodged he declared that he

                    men of the jury, you want to hear for what possible reason the general failed to
                    compel the defendant to take over the ship, when he came to it as my successor,
                    the laws on the matter being so strict. In regard to this I wish to show you
                    clearly why it was. For Timomachus, men of the jury, wished above all things to
                    have the trireme well equipped for every service. <milestone unit="section"
                        n="44"/>He knew, however, that the defendant, if he took over the ship,
                    would manage wretchedly as trierarch; that he would get service neither from the
                    crew nor the marines nor the rowers, for not one of them would stay with him.
                    Besides, he knew that, if he ordered him to sail without giving him money, he
                    would not put out to sea at his bidding, as I should do, but would make trouble.
                    And in addition to this he borrowed from him thirty minae on the understanding
                    that he would not force him to take over the ship. <milestone unit="section"
                        n="45"/>But why it was that he was especially incensed against me and
                    treated me despitefully, and would never on any occasion listen to a word from
                    me regarding any matter, I wish to show you clearly, that you may understand
                    that I cared less at that time for my own comfort or for the general's power
                    than for the people of Athens and the laws, and that I endured ill-treatment and
                    abuse, which were far more grievous to me than the expenses I incurred.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="46"/>For, while the fleet was lying at Thasos,
                    a despatch-boat came from Methon&ecirc; in Macedonia to Thasos, bringing a
                    man with letters from Callistratus to Timomachus, which, as I afterward learned,
                    contained a request that he should send the swiftest-sailing ship he had to
                    bring Callistratus to him. At once, then, at daybreak the next morning, the
                    officer from the general came and ordered me to summon my crew to the ship.

                    trading post of the Thasians, and had gone ashore and were getting our dinner,
                    one of the sailors, Callicles, the son of Epitrephes, of Thria,<note resp="Loeb"
                        anchored="yes">Thria, a deme of the tribe Oene&iuml;s</note> came up to
                    me, and said that he wished to speak to me about a matter which concerned
                    myself. I bade him speak on, and he said that he wanted to make what return he
                    could for the help I had given him in his need. <milestone unit="section" n="48"
                    />&ldquo;Do you know, then,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;for what purpose
                    you are making this voyage, and where you are going?&rdquo; When I replied
                    that I did not know, he said, &ldquo;Then I will tell you; for you must
                    learn this in order to plan your action aright. You are going,&rdquo; said
                    he, &ldquo;to bring Callistratus, an exile whom the Athenians have twice
                    condemned to death, from Methon&ecirc; to Thasos to Timomachus, his kinsman
                    by marriage. I have found this out,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;from the
                    servants of Callippus. For your own part, then, if you are wise, you will not
                    permit any exile to come on board the ship; for the laws forbid it.&rdquo;
                        <milestone unit="section" n="49"/>On hearing this from Callicles, I
                    approached Callippus, and asked him to what place he was sailing, and whom he
                    was going to fetch. He spoke roughly to me and threatened me in a way you can
                    easily understand &lpar;for you are not without experience of the ways of
                    Callippus&rpar;, and I said to him, &ldquo;I hear that you are sailing
                    to fetch Callistratus. Now, I will transport no exile, nor will I go to fetch
                    him; for the laws forbid anyone to give harborage to any exile, and make one who
                    does so liable to the same punishment. I shall, therefore, sail back to the
                    general in Thasos.&rdquo; <milestone unit="section" n="50"/>So, when the
                    sailors came on board, I ordered the pilot to sail back to Thasos. Callippus
                    protested, and bade him sail for Macedonia in accordance with the general's
                    commands; but Posidippus, the pilot, answered him that I was trierarch of the
                    ship, and the one responsible, and that he got his pay from me; he would sail,
                    therefore, whither I bade him sail&mdash;to Thasos, to the general.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="51"/>When we reached Thasos the next day,
                    Timomachus sent for me to come to the place where he lodged outside the wall. I
                    was afraid that he would put me under arrest on false charges preferred by
                    Callippus, so did not obey the summons in person, but told the officer that, if
                    he had anything to say to me, I should be in the market-place; and I sent my
                    servant with him, in order that, if the general had any orders to give he might
                    hear and report to me. <milestone unit="section" n="52"/>It was for this reason,
                    which I have stated to you, men of the jury, that Timomachus did not force the
                    defendant to take over the ship, and besides, he wanted the use of the ship for
                    himself, as she was the best sailer. As for the trireme of Thrasylochus of
                        Anagyrus,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Anagyrus, a deme of the tribe
                        Erecthe&iuml;s.</note> on board which he was himself sailing, he induced
                    Thrasylochus to let his trierarchy to Callippus, that Callippus, being in full
                    control of the ship, might carry Callistratus about, as he pleased. Timomachus
                    himself came on board my ship, and sailed around here and there until he reached
                    the Hellespont. <milestone unit="section" n="53"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"
                    />When he had no longer need of ships of war, he put on board my vessel Eucinus
                    of Pallen&ecirc;,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">
                        <placeName key="perseus,Pallene">Pallene</placeName>, a deme of the tribe

                    money every day, ordered me to sail for home. When, then, on our homeward voyage
                    we were in Tenedos, and Lucinus, despite the orders given him by Timomachus, was
                    furnishing no money for sustenance to the sailors &lpar;he said he had none,
                    but should get some from Mytilen&ecirc;&rpar;, and the men had nothing
                    with which to buy provisions, and without food could not have continued rowing,
                        <milestone unit="section" n="54"/>again taking some of our citizens as
                    witnesses I approached the defendant in Tenedos, and bade him take over the ship
                    as my successor, and to reimburse me for the expenses I had incurred while I
                    serving as trierarch in his stead beyond my term. I did this in order that he
                    might not make use of the pretext, in his defence before you, that I refused to
                    hand over the ship to him because I was ambitious to sail home in a fast-sailing
                    ship and show off to you my lavish expenditure. <milestone unit="section" n="55"
                    />Since he refused to take over the ship, and the sailors were asking for money
                    that they might buy supplies, I came up to him again, having witnesses with me,
                    and asked whether he had come out with money with the purpose of taking over the
                    ship from me, or not. On his replying that he had brought money with him, I
                    urged him to lend me some on the security of the ship's equipment, that I might
                    distribute it among the sailors and bring the ship home, seeing that he refused
                    to take over the ship, although he was my successor. <milestone unit="section"
                        n="56"/>To this request of mine he replied that he would not lend me a
                    farthing. Accordingly I borrowed from Cleanax and Eperatus, friends of my father
                    in Tenedos, and gave the sailors their provision-money; for on account of my
                    being Pasion's son, and the fact that he was connected by ties of hospitality
                    with many, and was trusted throughout the Greek world, I had no difficulty in
                    borrowing money wherever I needed it.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>To prove

                    convincing circumstantial evidence, why it was that he refused to take over the

                    account of my expenses in detail for the period during which I served as
                    trierarch beyond my term on the defendant's behalf, and the sums which the
                    several deserters took with them when they ran away from the ship, and where
                    they went, in order that you may be assured that neither now nor at any time
                    before have I made false statements to you. I count it my duty to serve you in a
                    manner above reproach for the period prescribed by law, and as regards those who
                    scorn you and the laws, and will not obey the laws, to convict them and get them
                    punished in your courts. <milestone unit="section" n="66"/>Be assured that it
                    will be no more in my interest than in your own that you will punish Polycles,
                    nor will you be showing concern merely for those who have served as trierarchs
                    in the past; no, you will be taking thought also for those who are to serve in
                    the future, so that those who perform public services may not be discouraged,
                    and those who are designated as their successors may not show contempt toward
                    the laws, but may go to their ships when they are appointed. These matters you
                    should bear in mind, and reach a fair and just decision regarding all the points
                    at issue. <milestone unit="section" n="67"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>I
                    should gladly ask you, men of the jury, what opinion you would have had of me,
                    if, when my term of service had expired and the defendant had not come to take
                    over the ship, I had refused to serve longer when the general so ordered, but
                    had sailed away. Would you not have been indignant and have thought that I was
                    wronging you? If, then, you would have been indignant in that case, because I
                    refused to serve beyond my term, should you not now exact from the defendant the
                    money expended by me on his behalf, seeing that he did not take over the ship?

                    that it is not in my case only that he failed to take over his ship, but that on
                    a former occasion also, when he was the associate of Euripides in the trierarchy
                    and there was an agreement between them that each should sail for six months,
                    when Euripides had sailed and the term had expired, Polycles did not take over
                    the ship from him,&mdash;to prove this, I say, the clerk shall read the
                        deposition.<quote type="Deposition">
