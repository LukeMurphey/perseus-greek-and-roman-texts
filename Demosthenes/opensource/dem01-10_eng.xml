                    <milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>You would, I
                    expect, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, accept it as
                    the equivalent of a large amount of money, if it could be made clear to you what
                    will prove our best policy in the matters now under discussion. This then being
                    so, you are bound to give an eager hearing to all who offer advice. For not only
                    if someone comes forward with a well-considered plan, could you hear and accept
                    it, but also I count it part of your good fortune that more than one speaker may
                    be inspired with suitable suggestions on the spur of the moment, so that out of
                    the multitude of proposals the choice of the best should not be difficult.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="2"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The present
                    crisis, Athenians, calls on you, almost with an audible voice, to take into your
                    own hands the control of your interests in the North, if you are really anxious
                    to safeguard them. But, I confess, our attitude puzzles me. My own idea would be
                    to vote an expedition at once, to make instant preparation for its dispatch,
                    thus avoiding our previous blunder, and to send ambassadors to state our
                    intentions and watch events. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Our chief ground
                    for alarm is that this man, so unscrupulous, so quick to seize his opportunity,
                    now yielding a point when it suits his purpose, now threatening&mdash;and
                    his threats may well carry conviction&mdash;now misrepresenting us and our
                    failure to intervene, may divert to his own purpose and wrest from us something
                    of vital importance. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>And yet, men of <placeName
                        key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, it is reasonable to suggest that
                    the very thing which makes Philip's position most redoubtable is also most
                    encouraging for you. For the swift and opportune movements of war he has an
                    immense advantage over us in the fact that he is the sole director of his own
                    policy, open or secret, that he unites the functions of a general, a ruler and a
                    treasurer, and that he is always at the head of his army; but when it comes to a
                    composition such as he would gladly make with <placeName key="perseus,Olynthus"
                        >Olynthus</placeName>, the tables are turned. <milestone unit="section"
                        n="5"/>The eyes of the Olynthians are opened to the fact that they are now
                    fighting not for glory, not for a strip of territory, but to avert the overthrow
                    and enslavement of their fatherland. They know how he treated those
                    Amphipolitans who betrayed their city and those Pydnaeans who opened their gates
                    to him. And a despotism, I take it, is as a rule mistrusted by free
                    constitutions, especially when they are near neighbors. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="6"/>I bid you grasp these facts, men of <placeName
                        key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, and weigh well all the important
                    considerations. Make up your minds; rouse your spirits; put your heart into the
                    war, now or never. Pay your contributions cheerfully; serve in person; leave
                    nothing to chance. You have no longer the shadow of an excuse for shirking your
                    duty. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>It was long the common talk that the
                    Olynthians must be made to fight Philip; and now it has come about in the
                    natural course, and that too in a way that suits you admirably. For if they had
                    plunged into war in reliance on your advice, they would perhaps have proved
                    uncertain allies and only half-hearted in their resolve; but now that their
                    hatred of Philip is the outcome of their own grievances, it is natural that
                    their hostility should have a firm base in their apprehensions and their
                    experiences. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Men of <placeName
                        key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, you must not let slip the
                    opportunity that offers, nor make the blunder you have so often made before.
                    When we returned from the Euboean expedition<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">The
                        Athenians took <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName> from the
                        Thebans in 357.</note> and Hierax and Stratocles, the envoys of <placeName
                        key="perseus,Amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName>, mounted this platform and
                    bade you sail and take over their city, if we had shown the same earnestness in
                    our own cause as in defence of the safety of <placeName key="tgn,7002677"
                        >Euboea</placeName>, <placeName key="perseus,Amphipolis"
                        >Amphipolis</placeName> would have been yours at once and you would have
                    been relieved of all your subsequent difficulties. <milestone unit="section"
                        n="9"/>Once again, when news came of the siege of <placeName
                        key="perseus,Pydna">Pydna</placeName>, of <placeName key="tgn,6004814"
                        >Potidaea</placeName>, of <placeName key="perseus,Methone"
                        >Methone</placeName>, of <placeName key="tgn,7012084"
                        >Pagasae</placeName>,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">In 357, 356, 354, and
                        352 respectively.</note> and of the rest of them&mdash;not to weary you
                    with a complete catalogue&mdash;if we had at that time shown the required
                    zeal in marching to the help of the first that appealed, we should have found
                    Philip today much more humble and accommodating. Unfortunately we always neglect
                    the present chance and imagine that the future will right itself, and so, men of
                        <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, Philip has us to thank
                    for his prosperity. We have raised him to a greater height than ever king of
                        <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> reached before. Today
                    this opportunity comes to us from the Olynthians unsought, a fairer opportunity
                    than we have ever had before. <milestone unit="section" n="10"/><milestone
                        unit="para" ed="P"/>Men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName>, let anyone fairly reckon up the blessings we have
                    received of the gods, and though much is amiss, none the less his gratitude will
                    be great&mdash;and rightly so: for our many losses in the war<note
                        resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">i.e. the war about the possession of <placeName
                            key="perseus,Amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName>.</note> may be justly
                    imputed to our own supineness; that we did not suffer these losses long ago and
                    that this opportunity of alliance affords us some compensation, if we choose to
                    accept it, this I for my part should put down as a signal instance of the favor
                    of the gods. <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>I suppose it is with national as
                    with private wealth. If a man keeps what he gains, he is duly grateful to
                    fortune; if he loses it by his own imprudence, he loses along with it the sense
                    of gratitude. So in national affairs, those who fail to use their opportunities
                    aright, fail also to acknowledge the good that the gods have given; for every
                    advantage in the past is judged in the light of the final issue. It is therefore
                    our duty, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, to keep a
                    careful eye on the future, that by restoring our prosperity we may efface the
                    discredit of the past. <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>But if we leave these
                    men too in the lurch, Athenians, and then <placeName key="perseus,Olynthus"
                        >Olynthus</placeName> is crushed by Philip, tell me what is to prevent him
                    from marching henceforward just where he pleases. I wonder if any one of you in
                    this audience watches and notes the steps by which Philip, weak at first, has
                    grown so powerful. First he seized <placeName key="perseus,Amphipolis"
                        >Amphipolis</placeName>, next <placeName key="perseus,Pydna"
                        >Pydna</placeName>, then <placeName key="tgn,6004814">Potidaea</placeName>,
                    after that <placeName key="perseus,Methone">Methone</placeName>, lastly he
                    invaded <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="13"/>Then having settled Pherae, <placeName
                        key="tgn,7012084">Pagasae</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7002751"
                        >Magnesia</placeName>, and the rest of that country to suit his purposes,
                    off he went to <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>, and there, after
                    evicting some of the chiefs and installing others, he fell sick. On his
                    recovery, he did not relapse into inactivity, but instantly assailed <placeName
                        key="perseus,Olynthus">Olynthus</placeName>. His campaigns against Illyrians
                    and Paeonians and King Arybbas and any others that might be mentioned, I pass
                    over in silence. <milestone unit="section" n="14"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"
                    />&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; some of you may say, &ldquo;why tell us this
                    now?&rdquo; Because, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName>, I want you to know and realize two things: first, what
                    an expensive game it is to squander your interests one by one; and secondly, the
                    restless activity which is ingrained in Philip's nature, and which makes it
                    impossible for him ever to rest on his laurels. But if Philip adopts the
                    principle that he ought always to be improving his position, and you the
                    principle of never facing your difficulties resolutely, just reflect what is
                    likely to be the end of it all. <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>Seriously, is
                    anyone here so foolish as not to see that our negligence will transfer the war
                    from <placeName key="tgn,7002716">Chalcidice</placeName> to <placeName
                        key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>? Yet if that comes to pass, I am
                    afraid, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, that just as
                    men who borrow money recklessly at high interest enjoy a temporary accommodation
                    only to forfeit their estates in the end, so we may find that we have paid a
                    heavy price for our indolence, and because we consult our own pleasure in
                    everything, may hereafter come to be forced to do many of the dfficult things
                    for which we had no liking, and may finally endanger our possessions here in
                        <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName> itself. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="16"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now someone may tell
                    me that to find fault is easy and in any one's power, but that it needs a
                    statesman to expound the policy demanded by our circumstances. But I am not
                    unaware, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, that if
                    anything goes wrong, you often vent your disappointment, not on the responsible
                    agents, but on those who happen to have addressed you last. I shall not,
                    however, consult my own safety by keeping back what I believe to be for your
                    true interests. <milestone unit="section" n="17"/>I suggest then that the case
                    calls for two distinct expeditions; one military force must be dispatched to
                    rescue their cities for the Olynthians, and a second force, both naval and
                    military, to ravage Philip's territory. If you neglect either of them, I am
                    afraid your campaign will prove abortive. <milestone unit="section" n="18"/>For
                    if you send a marauding expedition, he will stand on the defensive until he has
                    made himself master of <placeName key="perseus,Olynthus">Olynthus</placeName>,
                    and then he will easily march to the relief of his own territory; or if you
                    confine yourselves to helping <placeName key="perseus,Olynthus"
                        >Olynthus</placeName>, he will know that his base is secure and will give
                    close and undivided attention to his operations, until at last he overcomes the
                    resistance of the besieged. Our expedition, you see, must be on a large scale
                    and twofold. <milestone unit="section" n="19"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"
                    />Such are my views on the expeditionary force. With regard to the supply of
                    money, you have money, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                    >Athens</placeName>; you have more than any other nation has for military
                    purposes. But you appropriate it yourselves, to suit your own pleasure. Now if
                    you will spend it on the campaign, you have no need of a further supply; if not,
                    you have&mdash;or rather, you have no supply at all.
                    &ldquo;What!&rdquo; someone will cry, &ldquo;do you actually move to
                    use this money for military purposes?&rdquo; Of course I do not. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="20"/>Only it is my opinion that we must provide soldiers
                    and that there must be one uniform system of pay in return for service. Your
                    opinion, however, is that you should, without any trouble, just appropriate the
                    money for your festivals.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">The Theoric Fund had
                        been instituted by Pericles, nominally to enable the poorer citizens to
                        attend the public festivals. It would seem that definite sums were alloted
                        to the various departments of State expenditure, and the surplus was at the
                        disposal of the democracy for special military or other objects. Somewhere
                        about 354 Eubulus, who was one of the board which controlled the Theoric

                        surplus revenue. He does not seem to have starved the defensive services,
                        but he left no provision for a war, except by means of an extraordinary levy

                        embarrassment.</note> Then the only alternative is a war-tax, heavy or

                    for raising supplies; choose whichever of them you think expedient, and, while

                        /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>It is worth while, however, to observe and
                    consider how Philip stands today. His present prospects are not so bright or
                    satisfactory as they seem and as a superficial observer might pronounce them;
                    nor would he ever have provoked this war had he thought that he would be bound
                    to fight himself. He hoped that on his first entry he would carry all before
                    him, and he finds himself completely mistaken. This unforeseen result confounds
                    and discourages him; and besides there is the question of <placeName
                        key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>. <milestone unit="section" n="22"
                    />The Thessalians were always, of course, born traitors, and Philip finds them
                    today just what everyone has found them in the past. They have formally resolved
                    to demand the restitution of <placeName key="tgn,7012084">Pagasae</placeName>
                    and have hindered him from fortifying <placeName key="tgn,7002751"
                        >Magnesia</placeName>. I have also been informed that they will no longer
                    hand over to him the profits of their harbors and markets, on the ground that
                    this sum ought to be applied to the government of <placeName key="tgn,7001399"
                        >Thessaly</placeName> and not find its way into Philip's coffers. Now if he
                    is deprived of this source of revenue, he will be hard put to it to pay for the
                    maintenance of his mercenaries. <milestone unit="section" n="23"/>But surely we
                    must assume that your Paeonian or Illyrian or any other of these tribes would
                    prefer freedom and independence to slavery. They are not accustomed to
                    acknowledge a master, and Philip is by all accounts a particularly harsh one.
                    And indeed that is not surprising. Undeserved success engenders folly in
                    unbalanced minds, and therefore it often proves harder to keep than to win
                    prosperity. <milestone unit="section" n="24"/>Look then, Athenians, upon his
                    difficulties as your opportunity. Be prompt to take up the challenge. Send
                    embassies when necessary. Take the field in person. Rouse all the other states.
                    Reflect how eagerly Philip would march against you, if he had such a chance as
                    we have, and if the war were on our frontiers. Are you not ashamed if, having
                    the opportunity, you lack the courage to do to him what he would certainly do to
                    you if he could? <milestone unit="section" n="25"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"
                    />One point more, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>. Do
                    not forget that you can today choose whether you must fight there or Philip must
                    fight here. If <placeName key="perseus,Olynthus">Olynthus</placeName> holds out,
                    you will fight there, to the detriment of his territory, while you enjoy in
                    security the land that is your home. But if Philip takes Olynthus, who is to
                    prevent his marching hither? The Thebans? <milestone unit="section" n="26"/>It
                    may be an unduly harsh thing to say, but they will join heartily in the
                    invasion. The Phocians then? What! the men who cannot protect their own country
                    without your help? Any others? &ldquo;But, my friend,&rdquo; cries
                    someone, &ldquo;he will not wish to attack us.&rdquo; Nay, it would be a
                    crowning absurdity if, having the power, he should lack the will to carry out
                    the threat which today he utters at the risk of his reputation for sanity.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="27"/>But indeed I think you want no speech to
                    prove how vast is the difference between a war here and a war yonder. Why, if

                    think, recognize the manifest favor of heaven towards our city, and not least at
                    the present crisis. That Philip has found men willing to fight him, situated on
                    his frontiers and possessed of considerable power, above all so determined that
                    they regard any accommodation with him as both delusive and fatal to their own
                    country&mdash;this has all the appearance of a super-human, a divine
                    beneficence. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>So the time has come, men of

                    not prove more unfriendly to ourselves than circumstances have been, for we
                    shall show ourselves the meanest of mankind, if we abandon not only the cities
                    and the places which we once called our own, but the very allies that fortune
                    has raised up for us and the chances she throws in our way. <milestone

                    Athenians, to enumerate the resources of Philip and by such arguments to call on
                    you to rise to the occasion. Do you ask why? Because it seems to me that any
                    dissertation on that topic is a tribute to his enterprise, but a record of our
                    failure. For the higher he has raised himself above his proper level, the more
                    he wins the admiration of the world; but the more you have failed to improve
                    your opportunities, the greater is the discredit that you have incurred. All
                    this then I will waive. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>For an impartial
                    investigation, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, would
                    trace the source of Philip's greatness not to himself, but to this very
                    platform. Of transactions, then, for which Philip should be grateful to those
                    whose policy has served his interests, and for which you might well demand
                    satisfaction, I do not find this the proper time for speaking. There are,
                    however other topics open to me; you will be the better for having heard them,
                    and if you will consent to scrutinize them accurately, men of <placeName
                        key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, you will find in them grave charges
                    against Philip. On these topics I shall endeavor to address you. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="5"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now to call a man
                    perjured and faithless, without drawing attention to his acts, might justly be
                    termed mere abuse; but to describe his conduct in detail and convict him on the
                    whole count fortunately requires only a short speech. Moreover, I have two
                    reasons for thinking the story worth the telling: Philip shall appear as
                    worthless as he really is, and those who stand aghast at his apparent
                    invincibility shall see that he has exhausted all the arts of chicanery on which
                    his greatness was founded at the first, and that his career has now reached its
                    extreme limit. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>For my own part, Athenians, I
                    too should be inclined to regard Philip with mingled fear and admiration, if I
                    saw that his success had crowned a career of integrity. But when I consider him
                    attentively, I find that at the outset, when the Olynthians were anxious to
                    consult you, but certain persons were for excluding them from our Assembly, he
                    won our simple hearts by promising to hand over <placeName

                    so much talked about. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>I find that next he won
                    the friendship of the Olynthians by capturing <placeName key="tgn,6004814"
                        >Potidaea</placeName>, which was yours, and thus wronging you, his former

                        355-346.</note> in their interests. In a word, he has hoodwinked everyone
                    that has had any dealings with him; he has played upon the folly of each party
                    in turn and exploited their ignorance of his own character. That is how he has
                    gained his power. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Now even as he has raised
                    himself by these arts, while every community imagined that they were to be the
                    recipients of his favors, so by these same arts he is bound to be brought low
                    again now that the utter selfishness of his conduct has been amply demonstrated.
                    Yes, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, this is the
                    turning point of Philip's career. If not, let someone step up and prove to
                    me&mdash;or rather to you&mdash;that my words are untrue, or that those
                    who have been once deceived will continue to trust him, or that the Thessalians
                    who stooped to become his slaves would not now welcome their emancipation.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="9"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Again, if
                    anyone here admits the truth of this, but fancies that Philip will remain master
                    of the situation, being already in possession of the fortresses and harbors and
                    other points of vantage, he is mistaken. For when a league is knit together by
                    goodwill, when all the allied states have the same interests, then the
                    individual members are willing to remain steadfast, sharing the toil and
                    enduring the hardships; but when a man has gained power, as Philip has, by
                    rapacity and crime, then the first pretext, some trifling slip, overthrows and
                    shatters all. <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>It is impossible, men of

                    show of blossom, but at the last they are detected and fall to pieces. For a
                    house, I take it, or a ship or anything of that sort must have its chief
                    strength in its substructure; and so too in affairs of state the principles and
                    the foundations must be truth and justice. There is no vestige of these today in

                    share his tastes. No: glory is his sole object and ambition; in action and in
                    danger he has elected to suffer whatever may befall him putting before a life of
                    safety the distinction of achieving what no other king of <placeName
                        key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> ever achieved. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="16"/>But his subjects have no share in the glory that
                    results. They are perpetually buffeted and wearied and distressed by these
                    expeditions north and south, never suffered to give their time to their business
                    or their private affairs, never able to dispose of such produce as they can
                    raise, because the war has closed all the markets in their land. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="17"/>Hence it is not difficult to see how the majority of
                    the Macedonians regard Philip. As for his household troops and footguards, they
                    have indeed the name of admirable soldiers, well grounded in the science of war;
                    but one who has lived on the spot, a man incapable of falsehood, has informed me
                    that they are no better than other soldiers. <milestone unit="section" n="18"
                    />If there is anyone among them who can be described as experienced in war and
                    battle, I was told that Philip from jealousy keeps all such in the background,
                    because he wants to have the credit himself of every action, among his many
                    faults being an insatiable ambition. Any fairly decent or honest man, who cannot
                    stomach the licentiousness of his daily life, the drunkenness and the lewd
                    dancing, is pushed aside as of no account. <milestone unit="section" n="19"/>All
                    the rest about his court, he said, are robbers and toadies, men capable of
                    getting drunk and performing such dances as I hesitate to name to you here. This
                    report is obviously true, for the men who were unanimously expelled from
                        <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, as being of far looser
                    morals than the average mountebank&mdash;I mean Callias the hangman and
                    fellows of that stamp, low comedians, men who compose ribald songs to raise a
                    laugh against their boon companions&mdash;these are the men he welcomes and
                    loves to have about him. <milestone unit="section" n="20"/>These are perhaps
                    trivial things, and yet, Athenians, to wise men they afford an important proof
                    of the infatuation of his character. For the present, however, his prosperity
                    throws all this into the shade &lpar;for success is apt to cover a multitude
                    of faults&rpar;; but if he trips, then we shall know all about his vices.
                    And it seems to me, Athenians, that we shall not have to wait long for the
                    exposure, if heaven wills and you so resolve. <milestone unit="section" n="21"
                    />For just as in our bodies, so long as a man is in sound health, he is
                    conscious of no pain, but if some malady assails him, every part is set
                    a-working, be it rupture or sprain or any other local affection; even so is it
                    with states and monarchies; as long as their wars are on foreign soil, few
                    detect their weaknesses, but when the shock of battle is on their frontiers, it
                    makes all their faults perfectly clear. <milestone unit="section" n="22"
                        /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But if any of you, Athenians, seeing
                    Philip's good fortune, thinks that he is in that respect a formidable
                    antagonist, he reasons like a prudent man. For fortune is indeed a great weight
                    in the scales; I might almost say it is everything in human affairs. All the
                    same, if you gave me the choice, I should prefer the fortune of <placeName

                    willing to do your duty yourselves, even to a limited extent; for I am sure you
                    have far greater claims than he upon the favor of the gods. Yet, I think, we sit
                    here doing nothing. <milestone unit="section" n="23"/>But one who is himself
                    idle cannot possibly call upon his friends, much less upon the gods, to work for
                    him. No wonder that Philip, sharing himself in the toils of the campaign,
                    present at every action, neglecting no chance and wasting no season, gets the
                    better of us, while we procrastinate and pass resolutions and ask questions. I
                    cannot wonder at this: the contrary would rather surprise me, that we,
                    performing no single duty of a combatant, should overcome the man who fulfils
                    them all. <milestone unit="section" n="24"/>Nay, I am surprised that you, men of

                    jeoparded your lives in the field that others might enjoy their rights, now
                    shrink from service and grudge to pay your contributions for the sake of your
                    own possessions. I am surprised that you, who have so often saved the other
                    states, both all of them together and each separately in turn, should sit down
                    under the loss of what is your own. <milestone unit="section" n="25"/>All this I
                    wonder at, and at another thing besides. I wonder that no one here, men of

                    years you have been at war with Philip, and what you have been doing all that
                    long time. Surely you must know that all that time you have been hesitating,
                    hoping that some other state would take action, accusing and sitting in
                    judgement on one another, and still hoping, hoping&mdash;doing in fact
                    pretty much what you are doing now. <milestone unit="section" n="26"/>And are
                    you so unintelligent, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>,
                    as to hope that the same policy that has brought our state from success to
                    failure will raise us from failure to success? Surely that is neither reasonable
                    nor natural; for in all things it is much easier to keep than to gain. But, in
                    the present instance, of what was once ours the war has left us nothing to keep
                    and everything to gain. This, then, is our own task today. <milestone

                    the wrongdoers, and render excuse impossible by mending your own deficiencies;
                    for you have no right to be severe critics of others' conduct, unless you first

                    pursue little wars of their own? It is because in this war the prizes for which
                    you contend are your own&mdash;&lpar;if, for instance, <placeName

                    to themselves and no remuneration; but in the other case the risks are smaller
                    and the prizes fall to the officers and the soldiers&mdash;<placeName
                        key="tgn,7002579">Lampsacus</placeName>, for example, and Sigeum, and the

                    to your reverses, sit in judgement on your officers, but acquit them whenever in

                    among yourselves, some taking this side and some that, while the interests of
                    the state suffer. You conduct your party-politics, Athenians as you used to

                        here is only a rough-and-ready one. Each political party in the Assembly has

                    Thebans maintain their present attitude towards us, and the Phocians have come
                    to the end of their money, and there is nothing to hinder Philip, when he has

                    surely if anyone of you would postpone the necessary action till then, he must
                    prefer to see danger at his very doors, rather than hear of it far away, and to
                    beg help for himself, when he might be lending help to others now; for I suppose
                    we all realize that that is what it will come to, if we throw away our present

                    expedition, and we are willing to do so; but tell us how.&rdquo; Then do not
                    be surprised, Athenians, if my answer comes as a shock to most of you. Appoint a
                    legislative commission. Do not use it to frame new laws&mdash;you have laws
                    enough for your purpose&mdash;but repeal those which hamper us in the
                    present crisis. <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>In plain language I mean the
                    laws for administering the Theoric Fund, and also some of the service
                    regulations. The former distribute the military funds as theatre-money among
                    those who remain in the city; the latter give impunity to deserters and in
                    consequence discourage those willing to serve. When you have repealed these laws
                    and made the way safe for wise counsel, then look round for someone who will
                    propose what you all know to be salutary measures. But until you have done this,
                    do not expect to find a statesman who will propose measures for your benefit,
                    only to be ruined by you for his pains. <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>You
                    will never find one, especially as the only result would be that the proposer
                    would get into trouble without improving the situation, and his fate would also
                    make good advice more dangerous for the future. Yes, men of <placeName

                    who made these laws should also repeal them. <milestone unit="section" n="13"
                    />It is not fair that those legislators should enjoy a popularity which has cost
                    the community dear, but that the patriotic reformer should be penalized by the
                    odium of proposals by which we may all be benefited. Until you have set this
                    right, Athenians, do not expect to find anyone so influential among you that he
                    can break these laws with impunity, or so wanting in discretion as to run
                    open-eyed into danger. <milestone unit="section" n="14"/><milestone unit="para"
                        ed="P"/>At the same time, Athenians, you must not forget this, that a mere
                    decree is worthless without a willingness on your part to put your resolutions
                    into practice. If decrees could automatically compel you to do your duty, or
                    could accomplish the objects for which they were proposed, you would not have
                    passed such an array of them with little or no result, and Philip would not have
                    had such a long career of insolent triumph. Long ago, if decrees counted for
                    anything, he would have suffered for his sins. <milestone unit="section" n="15"
                    />But that is not so. For in order of time action is subsequent to speaking and
                    voting, but in importance it comes first and ranks higher. It is action, then,
                    that must be added: of all else we have enough. You have among you, Athenians,
                    men competent to say the right thing, no nation is quicker-witted to grasp the
                    meaning of speech, and you will at once be able to translate it into action, if
                    only you do your duty. <milestone unit="section" n="16"/>Why, what better time

                    overwhelmed with dishonor? Are not those states actually at war which we so
                    readily engaged in that event to protect? Is not Philip our enemy? And in
                    possession of our property? And a barbarian? Is any description too bad for him?
                        <milestone unit="section" n="17"/>But, in the name of the gods, when we have
                    abandoned all these places and almost helped Philip to gain them, shall we then
                    ask who is to blame? For I am sure we shall never admit that it is ourselves. In
                    the panic of battle the runaway never blames himself; it is always his general's
                    fault, or his comrades', anyone's rather than his own. Yet surely to the
                    runaways collectively the defeat is due; for he might have stood firm who now
                    blames the others, and if every man had stood, the battle would have been won.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="18"/>So now: someone's suggestion is not the

                    it, and success attend it! But, you say, it is not a pleasant one. The speaker

                    such proposals the wish is father to the thought, and that is why nothing is
                    easier than self-deceit. For what each man wishes, that he also believes to be

                    before us were a new one, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName>, I should have waited until most of the regular speakers
                    had delivered their opinions, and if satisfied with any of their proposals, I
                    should have remained silent, but if not satisfied, I should then have tried to
                    express my own views. Since, however, it is our fortune to be still debating a
                    point on which they have often spoken before, I can safely claim your indulgence
                    if I am the first to rise and address you. For if in the past their advice had
                    been sound, there would be no need for deliberation today. <milestone

                    Athenians, there is no need to despair of our present position, however hopeless
                    it may seem. For that which is worst in the days that are past and gone is just
                    what affords the best assurance for the future. And what is that? It is that

                    how formidable the Spartans were, not many years ago, and yet how at the call of
                    honor and duty you played a part not unworthy of your country, and entered the

                    Athenians, because I want you to know and realize that, as no danger can assail
                    you while you are on your guard, so if you are remiss no success can attend you.
                    Learn a lesson from the former strength of the Lacedaemonians, which you
                    mastered by strict attention to your affairs, and the present arrogance of our

                        unit="section" n="4"/>But if anyone here, Athenians, is inclined to think
                    Philip too formidable, having regard to the extent of his existing resources and
                    to our loss of all our strongholds, he is indeed right, yet he must reflect that
                    we too, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, once held
                        <placeName key="perseus,Pydna">Pydna</placeName>, <placeName
                        key="tgn,6004814">Potidaea</placeName>, and <placeName key="perseus,Methone"
                        >Methone</placeName> and had in our own hands all the surrounding territory,
                    and that many of the native tribes now in his service were then free and
                    independent and were indeed more inclined to side with us than with Philip.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>If, therefore, Philip had then come to the
                    conclusion that it was a difficult task to fight the Athenians while they held
                    such strong outposts in his own territory and he was destitute of allies, in
                    that case he would never have gained his present successes, never acquired his
                    present power. But, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>,
                    Philip saw clearly that all these outposts were but the open prizes of war, that
                    by natural right the property of the absent belongs to those who are on the
                    spot, and the property of the careless to those who can face toil and danger.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>It was precisely by acting on this
                    principle that he has mastered and now holds them all. Some he has seized by
                    right of arms, others he has won by alliance and friendship. For indeed alliance
                    and respect are willingly offered by all men to those whom they see ready and
                    prompt to take action. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>And you too, men of
                        <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, if you are willing to
                    adopt this principle, now if never before, if each citizen is ready to throw off
                    his diffidence and serve the state as he ought and as he best may, the rich man
                    paying, the strong man fighting, if, briefly and plainly, you will consent to
                    become your own masters, and if each man will cease to expect that, while he
                    does nothing himself, his neighbor will do everything for him, then, God
                    willing, you will recover your own, you will restore what has been frittered
                    away, and you will turn the tables upon Philip. <milestone unit="section" n="8"
                    />Do not believe that his present power is fixed and unchangeable like that of a
                    god. No, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>; he is a mark
                    for the hatred and fear and envy even of those who now seem devoted to him. One
                    must assume that even his adherents are subject to the same passions as any
                    other men. At present, however, all these feelings are repressed and have no
                    outlet, thanks to your indolence and apathy, which I urge you to throw off at
                    once. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>For observe, Athenians, the height to
                    which the fellow's insolence has soared; he leaves you no choice of action or
                    inaction; he blusters and talks big, according to all accounts; he cannot rest
                    content with what he has conquered; he is always taking in more, everywhere
                    casting his net round us, while we sit idle and do nothing. <milestone

                    What are you waiting for? Until you are compelled, I presume. But what are we to
                    think of what is happening now? For my own part I think that for a free people
                    there can be no greater compulsion than shame for their position. Or tell me,
                    are you content to run round and ask one another, &ldquo;Is there any news
                    today?&rdquo; Could there be any news more startling than that a Macedonian
                    is triumphing over Athenians and settling the destiny of <placeName

                    />&ldquo;Is Philip dead?&rdquo; you ask. &ldquo;No, indeed; but he
                    is ill.&rdquo; And what is that to you? Even if something happens to him,
                    you will soon raise up a second Philip, if that is the way you attend to your
                    affairs; for even this Philip has not grown great through his own unaided
                    strength so much as through our carelessness. <milestone unit="section" n="12"
                    />Nor is this all. If anything happened to him, or if Fortune, which always
                    cares for us better than we care for ourselves, should bring that result about,
                    remember that you must be on the spot if you want to take advantage of the
                    general confusion and to control the situation at your pleasure; but in your
                    present condition you would be unable, even if the opportunity offered, to take
                    over <placeName key="perseus,Amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName>, having neither

                    this necessary effort, I say no more on that point. But as to the nature and
                    size of the force which I think adequate to relieve the situation, the means of
                    defraying the cost, and the best and speediest method of providing for its
                    equipment, I shall now endeavor to state my views, making just this appeal to
                    you, Athenians. <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>Wait till you have heard
                    everything before you pass judgement. Do not be premature; and even if at the
                    outset I seem to be suggesting a novel kind of expeditionary force, do not
                    imagine that I am trying to postpone our operations. It is not those who cry
                    &ldquo;at once&rdquo; or &ldquo;today&rdquo; that really speak
                    to the purpose, for no dispatch of forces now could prevent what has already
                    happened; <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>but it is the man who can indicate
                    the nature, the size, and the source of the expedition that will be able to keep
                    the field until we either defeat the enemy or consent to a termination of
                    hostilities; for that is how we shall avoid trouble in the future. Now I believe
                    that I can indicate this, without prejudice to anyone else's proposal. That is a
                    bold promise, but it will soon be put to a practical test, and you shall be my
                    judges. <milestone unit="section" n="16"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>First
                    then, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, I propose to
                    equip fifty war-galleys; next you must make up your minds to embark and sail in
                    them yourselves, if necessary. Further I recommend the provision of transports
                    and other vessels, sufficient for the conveyance of half our cavalry. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="17"/>All this is a necessary provision against Philip's
                    sudden raids from <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> against
                        <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae">Thermopylae</placeName>, the <placeName

                    out as you did at <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName>, and before
                    that, as we are told, at Haliartus, and quite recently at <placeName

                    <milestone unit="section" n="18"/>That, even if you should not act as I,
                    personally, think you ought, is not an altogether trivial matter; for its
                    purpose is that he may either hold his hand through fear, knowing that you are
                    on the alert&mdash;he will know it sure enough, for there are some on our
                    side, yes, too many, who report everything to him&mdash;or that he may
                    overlook it and so be taken off his guard, provided there is nothing to hinder
                    you from sailing against his country, if he gives you the chance. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="19"/>Such, in my opinion, are the resolutions which you
                    ought to adopt, and the force which must be equipped, at once. But in addition
                    to this, Athenians, I propose that you should get ready a corps to carry on a
                    continuous war of annoyance against Philip. Not an imposing army&mdash;on
                    paper&mdash;of ten or twenty thousand mercenaries! It shall be a real
                    Athenian contingent, and whether you appoint one general or more, whether it is
                    this man or that or the other, him it shall strictly follow and obey. I also
                    urge you to provide for its maintenance. <milestone unit="section" n="20"/>And
                    what will this force be, and how large? How will it be maintained, and how far
                    will it consent to effect its purpose? I will tell you, describing each detail
                    separately. Of mercenaries I propose&mdash;and beware of the mistake that
                    has so often thwarted your efforts. Thinking that the utmost is too little for
                    the occasion, you choose the biggest scheme in your resolutions, but when it
                    comes to performance, you fail to realize even the smallest. You should rather
                    act and provide on a small scale, adding more if this proves insufficient.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="21"/>So I propose that the whole force should
                    consist of two thousand men, but of these five hundred must be Athenians, chosen
                    from any suitable age and serving in relays for a specified period&mdash;not
                    a long one, but just so long as seems advisable; the rest should be mercenaries.
                    Attached to them will be two hundred cavalry, fifty at least of them being
                    Athenians, serving on the same terms as the infantry. There will also be cavalry
                    transports provided. <milestone unit="section" n="22"/>So far, so good; and what
                    besides? Ten fast-sailing war-galleys. Since Philip has a fleet, we must have
                    fast vessels if our force is to sail in safety. Now how is this army to be
                    maintained? That also I will explain fully, when I have told you why I think so
                    small a force sufficient, and why I insist that those serving shall be citizens.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="23"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I name a
                    force of this size, Athenians, because it is not in our power now to provide one
                    fit to meet him in pitched battle: we must adopt guerilla tactics to start with.
                    The force must therefore be neither unwieldy&mdash;for we cannot afford the
                    pay and maintenance&mdash;nor altogether insignificant. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="24"/>My reasons for insisting on the presence of citizens
                    in the expedition are these. I am told that on a previous occasion the state
                    maintained a mercenary force at <placeName key="perseus,Corinth"
                        >Corinth</placeName>,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">During the so-called

                    Chabrias, and others, and that you citizens also served in person; and I know
                    from history that you and these mercenaries, fighting shoulder to shoulder, beat
                    the Lacedaemonians in the field. But ever since exclusively mercenary forces
                    have been fighting for you, it is your friends and allies that they have beaten,
                    while the power of your enemies has increased beyond bounds. They cast a casual
                    glance at the war for which <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>
                    has hired them, and off they sail to join Artabazus or anyone else, and the
                    general naturally follows them, for he cannot command if he does not pay.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="25"/>What then do I recommend? Deprive both
                    general and men of all excuse by providing pay and by attaching to them citizen
                    soldiers as overseers, so to speak, of their conduct in the field; for at

                    be and how it will be raised. I now proceed to deal with that point. As to the
                    cost then: the maintenance, the bare rationing of this force, comes to rather
                    more than ninety talents; for the ten fast galleys forty talents, or twenty
                    minae a ship every month; for two thousand men the same amount, that each may
                    receive ten drachmas a month ration-money; for the two hundred cavalry twelve
                    talents, if each is to receive thirty drachmas a month.<note resp="Loeb"

                        drachma for cavalry. The crew of a trireme numbered 200. The daily pay would
                        therefore be: Galleys: 2 ob. x 200 x 10 = 4000 ob. Infantry: 2 ob. x 2000 =
                        4000 ob. Cavalry: 6 ob. x 200 = <date value="1200">1200</date> ob. Total,

                        for rations; the cavalry thrice this amount. Demosthenes' proposal amounts
                        to this, that the pay should be halved and the men encouraged to make it up
                        by looting. To appreciate these sums, it should he noted that an unskilled

                    were willing to rest satisfied with what he has already captured and subdued, I

                    to find that at the beginning of the war our aim was to punish Philip, but at
                    the end it is to escape injury at his hands. But surely it is obvious that he
                    will not stop, unless someone stops him. And is that what we are to wait for? Do

                    about your affairs by hearsay, but you will be witnesses on the spot. So
                    scandalous is our present system that every general is tried two or three times
                    for his life in your courts, but not one of them dares to risk death in battle
                    against the enemy; no, not once. They prefer the doom of a kidnapper or a
                    pickpocket to a fitting death; for malefactors are condemned to the gallows,
                    generals should die on the field of honor. <milestone unit="section" n="48"

                    dissolution of the free states, others that he has sent an embassy to the Great

                    with the magnitude of his achievements and dreams of further triumphs, when,
                    elated by his success, he finds that there is none to bar his way; but I cannot
                    for a moment believe that he is deliberately acting in such a way that all the
                    fools at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> know what he is
                    going to do next. For of all fools the rumor-mongers are the worst. <milestone

                    idle words and shall come to a right decision. Our business is not to speculate
                    on what the future may bring forth, but to be certain that it will bring
                    disaster, unless you face the facts and consent to do your duty. <milestone

                    gives rise to much vexation and perplexity, because not only have we suffered
                    serious losses, which cannot be mended by fine speeches, but there is also
                    complete divergence of opinion about the preservation of what is left of our
                    empire, one favoring this policy, another that. <milestone unit="section" n="2"
                    />While deliberation is naturally a vexatious and difficult task, you,
                    Athenians, have enhanced its difficulties; for all other people deliberate
                    before the event, but you after the event. And the result is that, as long as I
                    can remember, the man who attacks any mistakes you have made gains your applause
                    as an able speaker, but meanwhile the events and the real object of your

                    although this is so, I have come forward in the belief and confidence that, if
                    you will consent to still the noise of faction and listen with the attention
                    that befits men who are debating the most important interests of the state, I
                    shall be able to offer you advice which will ameliorate our present condition

                    assembly about oneself and one's own speeches is a very profitable practice, if
                    one has the necessary effrontery, I feel that it is so vulgar and so offensive
                    that, though I see the necessity, I shrink from it. I believe, however, that you
                    will form a better judgement of what I am going to propose, if I remind you of a
                    few things that I have said on former occasions. <milestone unit="section" n="5"
                    />For in the first place, Athenians, when it was proposed to take advantage of
                    the unrest in <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName><note resp="Loeb"

                        Plutarchus, the ruler of <placeName key="perseus,Eretria"
                            >Eretria</placeName>, applied to <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                            >Athens</placeName> for help against a rising. The request was supported
                        by Eubulus and Midias, but opposed by Demosthenes. A force was sent under
                        the command of Phocion and won a battle, but Plutarchus proved himself a
                        traitor and was expelled from <placeName key="perseus,Eretria"
                            >Eretria</placeName>.</note> and side with Plutarchus in a war that
                    would bring us more expense than glory, I was the first and indeed the only
                    speaker to oppose it, and I narrowly escaped being torn to pieces by those who
                    induced you for trifling gains to commit many serious errors. It was not long
                    before you incurred disgrace and suffered indignities<note resp="Loeb"
                        anchored="yes">According to the Scholiast, Plutarchus seized some of the

                    have ever received from those whom they have helped, and so you realized the
                    baseness of those to whom you then gave ear and the wisdom of the advice you
                    received from me. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Again, men of <placeName
                        key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, when I saw that Neoptolemus, the
                    actor, enjoying safe conduct under cover of his profession, was doing his best
                    to injure our city and was Philip's agent and representative at <placeName
                        key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, I once more came forward and
                    addressed you, not out of private animosity or love of informing, as indeed my
                    subsequent conduct has proved. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>And I shall not
                    in this case, as in the former one, find fault with those who spoke in defence
                    of Neoptolemus, for not a man defended him, but with yourselves. For if it had
                    been a tragedy in the theater of Dionysus that you were watching and not a
                    debate on the very existence of your state, you could not have shown more
                    partiality to him and more ill-will against me. <milestone unit="section" n="8"
                    />Yet I suppose that by this time you have all observed that after visiting the
                    enemy, in order, as he alleged, to collect sums owing to him there which he
                    might spend on public services here, and after making copious use of the
                    argument that it was too bad to arraign men who were transferring wealth from
                        <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> to <placeName
                        key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, he secured a safe conduct owing to
                    the peace, converted into cash all the real property that he held here, and has
                    absconded to Philip. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>There, then, you have two
                    of my warnings, bearing testimony to the value of my earlier speeches, and
                    uttered by me honestly and in strict conformity with the facts. Thirdly, men of
                    Athens&mdash;and when I have given just this one further instance, I will at
                    once pass on to some topics that I have omitted&mdash;when we ambassadors
                    returned from administering the oaths for the peace, <milestone unit="section"
                        n="10"/>at that time there were some who assured us that <placeName
                        key="tgn,5004258">Thespiae</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Plataea"
                        >Plataea</placeName> would be rebuilt, that Philip, if he gained the
                    mastery, would protect the Phocians and break up <placeName key="perseus,Thebes"
                        >Thebes</placeName> into villages, and that you would retain Oropus and
                    receive <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName> in exchange for
                        <placeName key="perseus,Amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName>. Led on by these
                    false hopes and cajoleries, you abandoned the Phocians against your own
                    interests and against justice and honor. But you will find that I neither took
                    part in this deception, nor passed it over in silence, but spoke out boldly, as
                    I am sure you remember, saying that I had neither knowledge nor expectation of
                    such results and that all such talk was nonsense. <milestone unit="section"

                    appear to have had a clearer foresight than the rest, I shall not refer to a
                    single cause, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                    >Athens</placeName>&mdash;my real or pretended cleverness<note resp="Loeb"
                        anchored="yes">The Greek here is difficult. Most edd. awkwardly render

                    and discernment were due to anything else than two things, which I will mention.
                    One, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, was good luck,
                    which my experience tells me is worth all the cleverness and wisdom in the
                    world. <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>The second is this: on public questions
                    my estimates and decisions are disinterested, and no one can show that my policy
                    and my speeches have been in any way bound up with my private gain. Hence I
                    always see accurately the advantageous course as suggested by actual
                    circumstances. But the instant you throw money into one scale, its weight bears
                    down the judgement with it; and for him that has once done this, accurate and
                    sound calculation becomes utterly impossible. <milestone unit="section" n="13"
                        /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now there is one precaution which I think
                    essential. If anyone proposes to negotiate for our city an alliance or a joint
                        contribution<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">A euphemism under the second
                        Athenian confederacy for the tribute &lpar;<foreign lang="greek"

                    sort, it must be done without detriment to the existing peace. I do not mean
                    that the peace is a glorious one or even creditable to you, but, whatever we may
                    think of it, it would better suit our purpose never to have made it than to
                    violate it when made, because we have now sacrificed many advantages which would
                    have made war safer and easier for us then than now. <milestone unit="section"
                        n="14"/>The second precaution, men of Athens, is to avoid giving the
                    self-styled Amphictyons now assembled any call or excuse for a crusade against
                    us. For if we should hereafter come to blows with Philip, about <placeName
                        key="perseus,Amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName> or in any private quarrel
                    not shared by the Thessalians or the Argives or the Thebans, I do not believe
                    for a moment that any of the latter would be dragged into the war, least of
                    all&mdash; <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>hear me before you shout me
                    down&mdash;least of all the Thebans. I do not mean that they regard us with
                    favor or that they would not readily oblige Philip, but they do realize quite
                    clearly, for all the stolidity that people attribute to them, that if they ever
                    fight you, they will have to take all the hard knocks themselves, and someone
                    else will sit quietly by, waiting for the spoils. Therefore they would never
                    make such a sacrifice unless the war had a common cause and origin. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="16"/>If we went to war again with the Thebans about
                        Oropus<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Oropus was in <placeName
                            key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>, close to the Boeotian frontier. A
                        war for its possession would therefore be confined to the Thebans and the
                        Athenians, and Demosthenes has no fear of the result.</note> or for some
                    other private reason, I do not think we should suffer, for both their allies and
                    ours would, of course, offer support, if their own territory were invaded, but
                    would not join either side in aggression. That is the way with every alliance
                    worth considering, and such is the natural result. <milestone unit="section"
                        n="17"/>No individual ally is so fond either of us or of the Thebans as to
                    regard our security and our supremacy in the same light. Secure they would all
                    have us, for their own sakes; that either nation should gain supremacy and be
                    their master would suit none of them. What, then, is the danger that I think we
                    must guard against? Lest the inevitable war should afford all states a common
                    pretext and a common ground of complaint. <milestone unit="section" n="18"/>For
                    if the Argives and Messenians and Megalopolitans, and other Peloponnesians who
                    side with them, quarrel with us because of our embassy to <placeName
                        key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> and because they think that we have
                    some interest in Lacedaemonian policy; and if the Thebans are, as people admit,
                    hostile and likely to be even more so, because we offer an asylum to their
                    exiles and make no disguise of our hostility to them in every way; <milestone
                        unit="section" n="19"/>and if the Thessalians dislike us because we protect
                    the Phocian fugitives, and Philip because we are trying to exclude him from the
                    Amphictyonic Council; then I am afraid that these separate powers, having each a
                    private grudge, may make common cause against us on the strength of the
                    Amphictyonic decrees, and may then be tempted to go beyond what their several
                    interests require, as they were in the case of the Phocians. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="20"/>For of course you realize that in the present case
                    the Thebans and Philip and the Thessalians have acted in complete unison, though
                    with widely different aims. The Thebans, for instance, were powerless to prevent
                    Philip from pressing on and seizing the passes, or from coming in at the finish
                    and usurping the credit of their previous exertions. <milestone unit="section"
                        n="21"/>Hence today the Thebans have been partially successful in recovering
                    territory, but have failed lamentably to win honor and glory; for they would
                    presumably have gained nothing if Philip had not passed <placeName

                    wanted, but they put up with it all because they had the will, though not the
                    power, to grasp <placeName key="tgn,7011034">Orchomenus</placeName> and

                        n="22"/>Now some people actually go so far as to say that Philip was
                    compelled, against his real wishes, to hand over <placeName key="tgn,7011034"
                        >Orchomenus</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7011235">Coronea</placeName>
                    to the Thebans. For my part I wish them joy of their opinion. I only know this,
                    that Philip was less interested in those towns than desirous to secure the pass,
                    to win for himself the credit of finishing off the Sacred War, and to preside at
                    the Pythian games. That was the summit of his ambition. <milestone

                    <milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Whenever, men of
                        <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, we are discussing
                    Philip's intrigues and his violations of the peace, I observe that all the
                    speeches on our side are manifestly inspired by justice and generosity, and
                    those who denounce Philip are all felt to be saying exactly the right thing; but
                    of the much needed action, which alone would make the speeches worth hearing,
                    little or nothing ensues. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Unfortunately all our
                    national affairs have now reached to such a pass, that the more completely and
                    manifestly Philip is convicted of violating the peace with us and of plotting
                    against the whole of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, the more
                    difficult it is to suggest the right course of action. <milestone unit="section"
                        n="3"/>The reason, Athenians, is this. Though all who aim at their own
                    aggrandizement must be checked, not by speeches, but by practical measures, yet,
                    in the first place, we who come before you shrink from any definite proposal or
                    advice, being reluctant to incur your displeasure; we prefer to dilate on
                    Philip's shocking behavior and the like topics; and, secondly, you who sit here
                    are indeed better equipped than Philip for making speeches about justice and for
                    appreciating them in the mouth of another, but, when it comes to hindering the
                    accomplishment of his present plans, you remain utterly inactive. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="4"/>The result is, I suppose, inevitable and perhaps
                    reasonable. Where either side devotes its time and energy, there it succeeds the
                    better&mdash;Philip in action, but you in argument. So if you still think it
                    enough to employ the sounder arguments, that is easy; your task entails no
                    trouble. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>But if you have to devise means
                    whereby our present fortunes shall be repaired, and their further decline shall
                    not take us completely by surprise, and we shall not be confronted by a mighty
                    power which we shall be unable even to withstand, then our method of
                    deliberation must be changed, and all who speak and all who listen must choose
                    the best and safest policy instead of the easiest and most agreeable. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="6"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In the first place,
                    Athenians, if anyone views with confidence the present power of Philip and the
                    extent of his dominions, if anyone imagines that all this imports no danger to
                    our city and that you are not the object of his preparations, I must express my
                    astonishment, and beg you all alike to listen to a brief statement of the
                    considerations that have led me to form the opposite conclusion and to regard
                    Philip as our enemy. Then, if you think me the better prophet, adopt my advice;
                    if you prefer those who have so confidently trusted him, give them your
                    allegiance. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Now I, men of <placeName
                        key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, reason thus. What did Philip first
                    get under his control after the Peace? <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae"
                        >Thermopylae</placeName> and the Phocian government. Well, what did he make
                    of these? He chose to act in the interests of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes"
                        >Thebes</placeName>, not of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName>. And why so? Because, I believe, guided in his
                    calculations by ambition and the desire of universal dominion, regardless of the
                    claims of peace and quietness and justice, <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>he
                    rightly saw that to our city and our national character he could offer nothing,
                    he could do nothing, that would tempt you from selfish motives to sacrifice to
                    him any of the other Greek states, but that you, reverencing justice, shrinking
                    from the discredit involved in such transactions, and exercising due and proper
                    forethought, would resist any such attempt on his part as stoutly as if you were
                    actually at war with him. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>But as to the
                    Thebans, he believed&mdash;and the event justified him&mdash;that in
                    return for benefits received they would give him a free hand for the future and,
                    so far from opposing or thwarting him, would even join forces with him, if he so
                    ordered. Today, on the same assumption, he is doing the Messenians and the
                    Argives a good turn. That, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName>, is the highest compliment he could pay you. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="10"/>For by these very acts you stand judged the one and
                    only power in the world incapable of abandoning the common rights of the Greeks
                    at any price, incapable of bartering your devotion to their cause for any favor
                    or any profit. And it was natural that he should form this opinion of you and
                    the contrary opinion of the Argives and Thebans, because he not merely looks to
                    the present, but also draws a lesson from the past. <milestone unit="section"
                        n="11"/>For I suppose he learns from history and from report that your
                    ancestors, when they might, at the price of submission to the Great King, have
                    become the paramount power in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>,
                    not only refused to entertain that proposal, conveyed to them by Alexander, an
                    ancestor of Philip's line, but chose to quit their homes and endure every
                    hardship, and thereafter wrought those deeds which all men are always eager to
                    relate, though no one has ever been able to tell them worthily; and therefore I
                    shall not be wrong in passing them over, for they are indeed great beyond any
                    man's power of speech. On the other hand, he learns that the ancestors of these
                    Thebans and Argives either fought for the barbarians or did not fight against
                    them. <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>He knows, then, that they both will
                    pursue their private interests, irrespective of the common advantage of the
                    Greeks. So he thought that if he chose you, he would be choosing friends, and
                    that your friendship would be based on justice; but that if he attached himself
                    to the others, he would find in them the tools of his own ambition. That is why,
                    now as then, he chooses them rather than you. For surely it is not that he
                    regards their fleets as superior to ours, nor that, having discovered some
                    inland empire, he has abandoned the seaboard with its harbors, nor yet that he
                    has a short memory for the speeches and the promises that gained for him the
                        Peace.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Had Philip renounced his hope of

                            >Macedonia</placeName>, his rejection of Athenian friendship would be
                        intelligible. As it is, it must be otherwise explained.</note>
                    <milestone unit="section" n="13"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But it may be
                    urged, by someone who claims to know all about it, that he acted on that
                    occasion, not from ambition or from any of those motives with which I find
                    fault, but because the claims of the Thebans were more just than ours. Now that
                    is precisely the one argument that he cannot use now. What! The man who orders
                    the Lacedaemonians to give up their claims to <placeName key="perseus,Messene"
                        >Messene</placeName>, how could he pretend that he handed over <placeName

                    because he thought it an act of justice? <milestone unit="section" n="14"

                    &lpar;for there is this excuse left&rpar;, &ldquo;he was forced to
                    yield against his better judgement, finding himself hemmed in between the
                    Thessalian cavalry and the Theban heavy infantry.&rdquo; Good! So they say
                    he is waiting to regard the Thebans with suspicion, and some circulate a rumor
                    that he will fortify Elatea.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">To rebuild the

                        Philip's occupation of Elatea in 339 is the theme of the well-known passage
                        in <bibl n="Dem. 18.169">Dem. 18.169</bibl> ff. Demosthenes is playing on

                    <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>That is just what he is
                    &ldquo;waiting&rdquo; to do, and will go on
                    &ldquo;waiting,&rdquo; in my opinion. But he is not
                    &ldquo;waiting&rdquo; to help the Messenians and Argives against the
                    Lacedaemonians: he is actually dispatching mercenaries and forwarding supplies,
                    and he is expected in person with a large force. What! The Lacedaemonians, the
                    surviving enemies of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, he is
                    engaged in destroying; the Phocians, whom he has himself already destroyed, he
                    is now engaged in preserving! And who is prepared to believe that? <milestone
                        unit="section" n="16"/>For my part I do not believe that Philip, if he acted
                    in the first place reluctantly and under compulsion, or if he were now inclined
                    to throw the Thebans over, would be persistently opposing their enemies. But if
                    we may judge from his present conduct, it is plain that on that occasion also he
                    acted from deliberate choice, and everything, if correctly observed, points to
                    the fact that all his intrigues are directed against <placeName

                    />And today at any rate this policy is in a measure forced upon him. For
                    observe! He wants to rule, and he has made up his mind that you, and you only,
                    are his rivals. He has long injured you; of nothing is he more conscious than of
                    that. For it is by holding the cities which are really yours that he retains
                    safe possession of all the rest, and he feels that if he gave up <placeName

                        key="tgn,6004814">Potidaea</placeName>, his own country would not be safe
                    for him. <milestone unit="section" n="18"/>He knows, then, these two
                    facts&mdash;that he is intriguing against you and that you are aware of it.
                    Assuming that you are intelligent, he thinks you are bound to hate him, and he
                    is on the alert, expecting some blow to fall, if you can seize an opportunity
                    and if he cannot get in his blow first. <milestone unit="section" n="19"/>That
                    is why he is wide awake and ready to strike, and why he is courting certain
                    people to the detriment of our city&mdash;Thebans, I mean, and those
                    Peloponnesians who share their views. He imagines that their cupidity will lead
                    them to accept the present situation, while their natural dullness will prevent
                    them from foreseeing anything that may follow. Yet men of even moderate
                    intelligence might perceive some clear indications, which I had occasion to
                    point out to the Messenians and the Argives, and which may perhaps with

                        The two accounts may be reconciled by assuming that he retained the old
                        fourfold division of the country, but set up an oligarchy of ten in each
                        division. Philip, whose policy was to divide and conquer, would be unlikely
                        to centralize the government. It is just possible that <foreign lang="greek"
                            >dekadarxi/an</foreign> may be a mistaken amplification of <foreign

                        Owing to the decarchies which Lysander imposed on so many free cities at the
                        end of the Peloponnesian war, the number ten would have the same sinister

                    said, &ldquo;gaze with wonder at Philip as he gives away this and promises

                    />Philip begins by saying that he offers you Halonnesus as his own property, but
                    that you have no right to demand it of him, because it was not yours when he
                    took it, and is not yours now that he holds it. Moreover, when we ambassadors
                    visited him, he used similar language, to the effect that he had captured the
                    island from pirates and that therefore it belonged absolutely to him. <milestone

                    of its unfairness. For all pirates seize places belonging to others and turn
                    them into strongholds from which to harry their neighbors. But a man who should
                    defeat and punish pirates would surely be unreasonable, if he said that the
                    stolen property wrongfully held by them passed thereby into his own possession.

                    claim is unjust, but, though he knows this as well as anyone, he thinks that you
                    may be hoodwinked by the men who have engaged, and are now fulfilling their
                    engagement, to direct Athenian policy in accordance with his own desires. Nor
                    again does he fail to see that in either case, however you dub the transaction,
                    the island will be yours, whether it is presented or restored to you. <milestone

                    It is not that he wants to debit you with a benefaction received, for such a
                    benefaction would be a farce; but that he wants all <placeName key="tgn,1000074"
                        >Greece</placeName> to take notice that the Athenians are content to receive

                    they are taking them home&mdash;though they are selling everything at home.

                    to the amendment of the peace, Philip's ambassadors conceded to us the right to
                    amend it, and our amendment, universally admitted to be fair, was that each side
                    should retain its own possessions. But he now contends that he never agreed to
                    this, and that his ambassadors never even raised the point. This simply means
                    that his friends here have persuaded him that you have no memory for what has
                    been stated publicly in the Assembly. <milestone unit="section" n="19"/>But that
                    is just the one thing that you cannot have forgotten; for at the same meeting of
                    the Assembly Philip's ambassadors put his case before you and the decree was
                    duly proposed, so that, as the decree was recited immediately after the
                    conclusion of the speeches, it was impossible for you to pass at once a
                    resolution which gives the lie to the ambassadors. So it is not against me but
                    against you that his letter is aimed, alleging that you have sent back to him
                    your decision on questions that were never put before you. <milestone

                    flatly contradicted, when you read them your answer and offered them
                    hospitality, did not venture to come forward and say, &ldquo;You

                    say we have said something that we never did say.&rdquo; No; they held their

                        unit="section" n="21"/>His language was pretty much that of Philip's present
                    letter. For while accusing those of us who misrepresent Philip, he at the same
                    time blamed you because, though Philip is eager to benefit you and prefers your
                    friendship to that of any other state, you constantly thwart him, lending an ear
                    to false accusers, who both beg money of him and slander him; for tales of that
                    sort, when he is told that he was traduced and that you believed what was said,
                    make him change his mind, since he finds himself distrusted by the very people
                    whom it has been his aim to benefit. <milestone unit="section" n="22"
                        /><placeName key="tgn,7010770">Pytho</placeName> therefore urged public
                    speakers not to attack the peace, because it was not good policy to rescind it,
                    but to amend any unsatisfactory clause, on the understanding that Philip was
                    prepared to fall in with your suggestions. If, however, the speakers confined
                    themselves to abusing Philip without drafting any proposals which, while
                    preserving the terms of peace, might clear Philip of suspicion, he asked you to
                    pay no attention to such fellows. <milestone unit="section" n="23"/>And you
                    approved these arguments and said that Pytho was right, as indeed he was. He
                    made these statements, however, not in order that all those advantages that
                    Philip had paid so much money to secure might be struck out of the treaty, but
                    because he had been so instructed by his schoolmasters here in <placeName

                    contrary of Philocrates' decree, as I can prove to you. For the decree of
                    Philocrates, through which you lost <placeName key="perseus,Amphipolis"
                        >Amphipolis</placeName>, was itself contrary to the earlier decrees by which

                    it was this decree of Philocrates that was unconstitutional, nor would it have
                    been possible to draft a constitutional proposal in conformity with his
                    unconstitutional decree. By drafting mine to agree with the earlier decrees,
                    which were constitutional and which also kept your territory intact, I both kept
                    within the constitution and was able to convict Philip of trying to deceive you
                    and of wishing, not to amend the peace, but to bring discredit on those who were
                    pleading your cause. <milestone unit="section" n="26"/>You are all aware that,
                    after conceding the right to amend the peace, he now denies it. He says that
                        <placeName key="perseus,Amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName> is his, because
                    your decree that he should keep what he held confirmed his right. It is true
                    that you passed that decree, but you never admitted his right to <placeName
                        key="perseus,Amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName>, for it is possible to
                    &ldquo;hold&rdquo; what belongs to another, and it is not all
                    &ldquo;holders&rdquo; who hold what is their own, but many are in
                    possession of what is really another's. So his clever quibble is merely foolish.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="27"/>Moreover he remembers the decree of
                    Philocrates, but he has quite forgotten the letter sent to you when he was
                    besieging <placeName key="perseus,Amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName>, in which
                    he admitted that <placeName key="perseus,Amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName> was
                    yours; for he said that when he had taken it he would
                    &ldquo;restore&rdquo; it to you, implying that it was your property, and
                    not that of the holders. <milestone unit="section" n="28"/>Apparently those who

                    to give no expression to their hatred or their partiality, but to put forward
                    just what each thinks the best counsel, especially when you are debating a
                    question of urgent public importance. But since there are speakers who are
                    impelled to address you, either as partisans or from some other motive, whatever
                    it may be, you citizens who form the majority ought to dismiss all else from

                    campaign, now in its eleventh month; yet most of the speeches have been confined
                    to what Diopithes is doing or what he is going to do. For my part, when charges
                    are brought against any of those whom you can legally punish whenever you like,
                    I hold that it is open to you either to deal with their case at once or to
                    postpone it; and it is quite unnecessary for me or anyone else to take a strong
                    line on the subject of such charges. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>But when
                    our national enemy, with a strong force, is trying to forestall us in the

                    when, if we are once too late, we shall never again be able to save the

                    preparations as quickly as we can, and not be diverted from our purpose by
                    clamorous accusations about extraneous matters. <milestone unit="section" n="4"

                    territory contrary to the terms of peace, and does not form a general coalition
                    against us, there is nothing more to be said and we must simply observe the
                    peace, and I perceive a readiness to do so on your part at any rate; but if the
                    oath that we took and the terms on which we made peace are published for all men
                    to read, <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>and if it is proved that from the
                    first, even before Diopithes set sail with colonists, whom they now accuse of
                    having started hostilities, Philip has unfairly taken much that is ours, about
                    which your decrees denouncing him still stand good, and that he is all the time
                    repeatedly seizing the property of the other Greeks and of the barbarians, and
                    so equipping himself for an attack upon us, what do they mean by saying that we
                    must either make war or keep peace? <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>For we have
                    no choice in the matter, but there remains the most righteous and most necessary
                    task of all, which these gentlemen deliberately pass over in silence. What then
                    is that task? To defend ourselves against the aggressor. Or perhaps they mean
                    that if Philip keeps his hands off <placeName key="tgn,7002681"
                        >Attica</placeName> and the <placeName key="perseus,Piraeus"
                        >Piraeus</placeName>, he is neither injuring our city nor provoking
                    hostilities. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>But if they ground their plea upon
                    this principle, if this is their interpretation of the peace, it is obvious to
                    all that their argument is assuredly impious and intolerable and dangerous to
                        <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>; and it follows besides
                    that their own words flatly contradict their indictment of Diopithes. For why on
                    earth are we to give Philip leave to do everything else, provided he keeps clear
                    of <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>, while Diopithes is not
                    allowed to help the Thracians, or else we shall have to admit that he is
                    starting a war? <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Yes, you may say, as to that
                    indeed the speakers are proved wrong, but the mercenaries are really acting
                    abominably in ravaging the shores of the <placeName key="tgn,7002638"
                        >Hellespont</placeName>, and Diopithes is wrong in detaining the
                    merchantmen, and we must not sanction it. Very well; be it so. I have no
                    objection. <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>Only I think that, if their advice
                    is really given in perfect good faith, even as they are trying to break up the
                    force belonging to our city by bringing charges before you against the
                    commander, who provides for its maintenance, so they are bound to show that
                    Philip's force will also be disbanded, if you accept their advice. If not, you
                    must observe that they are merely reducing our city to the same plight that has
                    already caused her to forfeit all her existing advantages. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="11"/>For I need not tell you that Philip owes his
                    successes to nothing in the world more than to his being the first in the field.
                    For the man who always keeps a standing army by him, and who knows beforehand
                    what he wants to do, is ready in an instant for anyone that he chooses to
                    attack, while it is only after we have heard of something happening that we
                    begin to bustle about and make our preparations. <milestone unit="section"
                        n="12"/>Hence, I believe, it results that Philip, quite at his leisure,
                    keeps whatever he assails, while we are too late, and whatever we have spent has
                    been lavished in vain; we have succeeded in showing our enmity and our will to
                    thwart him, but by being too late for action we only incur additional ignominy.

                    therefore, fail to observe, Athenians, that at present all else is mere talk and
                    pretence; the real object of this scheming and contriving is that you should
                    stay at home, with no Athenian force in field, while Philip, without the least
                    trouble, settles everything to suit his wishes. For you must first note what is
                    going on at the present moment. <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>He is now
                    established in <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName> with a large
                    force, and is sending for considerable reinforcements from <placeName

                        >Thessaly</placeName>, according to the statements of those on the spot.
                    Now, if he waits for the Etesian winds to blow and marches to the siege of
                        <placeName key="perseus,Byzantium">Byzantium</placeName>, do you think that
                    the Byzantines will remain in their present state of infatuation and will not
                    call upon you and demand your help? <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>I think
                    not. Nay, even if there are others whom they distrust more than us, I think they
                    will rather admit such within their walls than surrender their city to
                    Philip&mdash;if indeed he does not forestall them by capturing it.
                    Therefore, if we cannot sail from <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName>, and if there is no force ready to help them on the
                    spot, their doom is sealed. <milestone unit="section" n="16"
                    />&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; you say, &ldquo;the wretched creatures are
                    infatuated and stupid beyond measure.&rdquo; Quite so, but still we are
                    bound to preserve them in the interests of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName>. And then again we are not certain of another thing,
                    that he will not attack the <placeName key="tgn,7017285">Chersonese</placeName>.
                    Indeed, if we may judge from the letter which he sent you, he means to take
                    vengeance on the settlers there. <milestone unit="section" n="17"/>If,
                    therefore, our present force is still in being, it will be able both to save the
                        <placeName key="tgn,7010345">Chersonese</placeName> and to make raids upon
                    Philip's territory. But if it is once disbanded, what shall we do if he marches
                    against the <placeName key="tgn,7010345">Chersonese</placeName>?
                    &ldquo;Bring Diopithes to trial,&rdquo; you say. And how will that help

                    weighing these facts, it is the duty of all of you, not surely to try to
                    disparage and break up the force that Diopithes is doing his best to provide for
                    the state, but to provide an additional force yourselves and to keep him well
                    supplied with funds and in every way to give him your loyal co-operation.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="20"/>For suppose someone should ask Philip,
                    &ldquo;Tell me, which would you prefer? That the troops now serving with
                    Diopithes, whatever their character may be&rdquo;&mdash;for I am not

                    cause them to be broken up and destroyed?&rdquo; I think he would choose the
                    latter. And what Philip would pray the gods to vouchsafe him, are some of us
                    here trying to compass? And do you still ask how our interests are sacrificed
                    everywhere? <milestone unit="section" n="21"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I
                    want therefore to examine frankly the present state of our affairs, and to find
                    out what we are doing ourselves now and how we are dealing with the situation.
                    We refuse to pay war-taxes or to serve in person; we cannot keep our hands off
                    the public funds; we will not pay Diopithes the allowances agreed upon, nor
                    sanction the sums that he raises for himself; <milestone unit="section" n="22"
                    />but we grumble and criticize his methods, and ask what he intends to do, and
                    all that sort of thing; and yet, while maintaining that attitude, we refuse to
                    perform our own tasks; with our lips we praise those whose speeches are worthy
                    of our city, but our actions serve only to encourage their opponents. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="23"/>Now, you have a habit of asking a speaker on every
                    occasion, &ldquo;What then must be done?&rdquo;; but I prefer to ask
                    you, &ldquo;What then must be said?&rdquo; Because, if you are not going
                    to pay your contributions, nor serve in person, nor keep your hands off the
                    public funds, nor grant Diopithes his allowances, nor sanction the sums that he
                    raises for himself, nor consent to perform your own tasks, I have nothing to
                    say. You who have gone so far in granting license to those whose object is
                    fault-finding and calumny, that even about what they say he is going to do, even
                    on that ground they accuse him in advance and you listen to them&mdash;what
                    can anyone say? <milestone unit="section" n="24"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"
                    />Now, some of you ought to be told the possible result of all this. I shall
                    speak freely, for indeed I could not speak otherwise. All the generals that have
                    ever set sail from your land&mdash;if I am wrong, I submit myself to any
                    penalty&mdash;raise money from the Chians, from the Erythraeans, from
                    whatever people they can, I mean of the Greeks of <placeName key="tgn,7002294"
                        >Asia Minor</placeName>. <milestone unit="section" n="25"/>Generals with
                    only one or two ships raise less; those with a larger fleet raise more. Also
                    those who pay do not pay the sum, be it large or small, for nothing; they are
                    not such madmen. No, they purchase for the merchants sailing from their own
                    harbors immunity from injury or robbery, or a safe conduct for their own ships,
                    or something of that sort. They say that they are granting
                    &ldquo;benevolences.&rdquo; That is the name for these exactions.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="26"/>And so too in this case, while Diopithes
                    has a force with him, it is perfectly plain that all these people will pay up.
                    For where else do you suppose that he looks for the maintenance of his troops,
                    if he gets nothing from you and has no private fortune to furnish their pay? To
                    the sky? No, indeed; it is from what he can collect or beg or borrow that he
                    keeps things going. <milestone unit="section" n="27"/>So those who denounce him
                    to you are simply warning everybody not to grant him a penny, because he will be
                    punished for what he intends to do, apart from what he has done or what he has
                    acquired for himself. That is what they mean when they cry, &ldquo;He
                    intends to besiege the towns! He is betraying the Greeks!&rdquo; Do any of
                    these gentlemen really care about the Asiatic Greeks?&mdash;and yet they
                    would, I expect, be better champions of other countries than of their own.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="28"/>That, too, is the meaning of the dispatch
                    of a second general to the <placeName key="tgn,7002638">Hellespont</placeName>.
                    For if Diopithes is acting outrageously in detaining the merchantmen, a note,
                    men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, a brief note, could
                    put a stop to all this at once; and there are the laws, which direct us to
                    impeach such offenders, but not, of course, to mount guard over ourselves,<note
                        resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">i.e. to keep a jealous watch over our own
                        officers.</note> at such a cost and with so large a fleet; for that would be
                    the height of madness. <milestone unit="section" n="29"/>No, against our
                    enemies, who are not amenable to the laws, it is right and necessary to maintain
                    troops, to send out fleets, and to raise funds; but against ourselves we have
                    these resources, a decree, an impeachment, and a dispatch-boat. Those are what
                    right-minded citizens would employ; malignants, bent on the ruin of the State,
                    would do as these men are doing. <milestone unit="section" n="30"/>And that
                    there are some men of this type among you, though bad enough, is not the real
                    evil; but you who sit here are by now in such a mood that if anyone comes
                    forward and asserts that the cause of all our evil is Diopithes or Chares or
                    Aristophon, or any other citizen that he happens to name, you at once agree and
                    applaud the truth of the remark. <milestone unit="section" n="31"/>But if anyone
                    rises and tells you the real truth and says, &ldquo;Nonsense, Athenians! The
                    cause of all these evils and all these troubles is Philip, for if he had kept
                    quiet, our city would have been free from trouble,&rdquo; you cannot gainsay
                    it, but you seem to me to be vexed and to feel that you are, as it were, losing
                    something. <milestone unit="section" n="32"/>But as to the reason for
                    this&mdash;and in Heaven's name, when I am pleading for your best interests,
                    allow me to speak freely&mdash;some of our politicians have been training
                    you to be threatening and intractable in the meetings of the Assembly, but in
                    preparing for war, careless and contemptible. If, then, the culprit named is
                    someone on whom you know you can lay hands in <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName>, you agree and assent; but if it is someone whom you
                    cannot chastise unless you overcome him by force of arms, you find yourselves
                    helpless, I suppose, and to be proved so causes you annoyance. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="33"/>For it ought to have been the reverse, men of
                        <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>; all your politicians
                    should have trained you to be gentle and humane in the Assembly, for there you
                    are dealing with rights that concern yourselves and your allies, but in
                    preparing for war they should have made you threatening and intractable, because
                    there you are pitted against your enemies and rivals. <milestone unit="section"

                    and have no ear but for compliments, while in your policy and your practice you
                    are at this moment running the gravest risks. For tell me, in Heaven's name, if
                    the Greeks should call you to account for the opportunities that your

                    are we to say, Athenians? How are we to answer? For my part, I cannot tell.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="38"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now there
                    are some who think they confute a speaker the moment they ask, &ldquo;What
                    then ought we to do?&rdquo; To these I will give the fairest and truest
                    answer: not what you are doing now. I will not, however, shrink from going
                    carefully into details; only they must be as willing to act as they are eager to
                    question. <milestone unit="section" n="39"/>First, men of <placeName
                        key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, you must fix this firmly in your
                    minds, that Philip is at war with us and has broken the peace. Yes, let there be
                    no more wrangling over that question. He is ill-disposed and hostile to the
                    whole city and to the very soil on which the city stands, <milestone
                        unit="section" n="40"/>and, I will add, to every man in the city, even to
                    those who imagine that they stand highest in his good graces. If they doubt it,
                    let them look at Euthycrates and Lasthenes, the Olynthians, who thought they
                    were such bosom-friends of his, and then, when they had betrayed their city, met
                    the most ignominious fate of all. The chief object, however, of his arms and his
                    diplomacy is our free constitution; on nothing in the world is he more bent than
                    on its destruction. <milestone unit="section" n="41"/>And it is in a way natural
                    that he should act thus. For he knows for certain that even if he masters all
                    else, his power will be precarious as long as you remain a democracy; but if
                    ever he meets with one of the many mischances to which mankind is liable, all
                    the forces that are now under restraint will be attracted to your side.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="42"/>For nature has not equipped you to seek
                    aggrandizement and secure empire, but you are clever at thwarting another's
                    designs and wresting from him his gains, and quick to confound the plots of the
                    ambitious and to vindicate the freedom of all mankind. Therefore he does not
                    want to have the Athenian tradition of liberty watching to seize every chance
                    against himself. Far from it! Nor is his reasoning here either faulty or idle.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="43"/>This, then, is the first thing needful, to
                    recognize in Philip the inveterate enemy of constitutional government and
                    democracy, for unless you are heartily persuaded of this, you will not consent
                    to take your politics seriously. Your second need is to convince yourselves that
                    all his activity and all his organization is preparing the way for an attack on
                    our city, and that where any resistance is offered to him, that resistance is
                    our gain. <milestone unit="section" n="44"/>For no man is so simple as to
                    believe that though Philip covets these wretched objects in Thrace&mdash;for
                    what else can one call Drongilus and <placeName key="tgn,7010710"
                        >Cabyle</placeName> and Mastira and the other places that he is now
                    occupying and equipping?&mdash;and though he endures toil and winter storms
                    and deadly peril for the privilege of taking them, <milestone unit="section"
                        n="45"/>yet he does not covet the Athenian harbors and dockyards and
                    war-galleys and silver mines and the like sources of wealth, but will allow you
                    to retain them, while he winters in that purgatory for the sake of the rye and
                    millet of the Thracian store-pits. It is not so, but it is to win these prizes
                    that he devotes his activities to all those other objects. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="46"/>What, then, is the task of sound patriots? To know
                    and realize all this, to shake off our outrageous and incurable slothfulness, to
                    contribute funds, to call upon our allies, and to provide and arrange for the
                    permanent upkeep of our existing army, so that just as Philip has a force ready
                    to attack and enslave all the Greek states, so you may have one ready to protect
                    and assist them all. <milestone unit="section" n="47"/>For if you trust to mere
                    expeditions, you can never gain any of your essential objects. You must first
                    levy a force and provide for its maintenance, and appoint paymasters and clerks,
                    and arrange that there shall be the strictest watch kept over your expenditure,
                    and afterwards you must demand from your paymasters an account of their moneys,
                    and from the general an account of his campaign. If you do this, and if you are
                    really in earnest about it, you will either compel Philip to keep the peace
                    fairly and to abide within his own frontiers&mdash;and that would be the
                    greatest blessing of all&mdash;or you will fight him on equal terms.

                    pointing out that whenever any question arises that concerns Philip, instantly
                    up jumps someone and tells you how good a thing it is to preserve peace, and
                    what a bother it is to keep up a large army, and how certain persons want to
                    plunder your wealth, and all that sort of thing; and by these speeches they put
                    you off and afford leisure for Philip to do whatever he wishes. <milestone

                    consider dearly purchased&mdash;but for the speakers the popularity and the
                    payment. But in my view it is not to you that they should recommend peace, for
                    you have taken the advice and there you sit: it is to the man who is even now on

                    be ours if we shrink from that expense. As for the &ldquo;plunder of your
                    wealth, &rdquo;they ought to prevent that by proposing some way of checking
                    it and not by abandoning your interests. <milestone unit="section" n="55"/>And
                    yet, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, it is just this
                    that rouses my indignation, that some of you should be distressed at the
                    prospect of the plunder of your wealth, when you are quite competent to protect
                    it and to punish any offender, but that you are not distressed at the sight of
                    Philip thus plundering every Greek state in turn, the more so as he is

                    Philip is provoking war, when he is thus openly conducting campaigns, violating
                    rights, and subduing cities, but when others urge you not to give way to Philip
                    nor submit to these losses, they accuse them of trying to provoke war? I will
                    explain. <milestone unit="section" n="57"/>It is because they want the natural
                    anger that you would feel at any sufferings in the war to be diverted against
                    your wisest counsellors, so that you may bring them to trial instead of
                    punishing Philip, and that they may themselves be the accusers instead of paying
                    the penalty for their present wrong-doings. That is the meaning of their
                    suggestion that there is a party among you that desires war, and that that is
                    the question you now have to decide.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes"><foreign

                    of course he will deny that he is attacking us, just as he denied that he was
                    attacking the men of Oreus, when his troops were already in their territory, or
                    the Pheraeans before that, when he was actually assaulting their walls, or the
                    Olynthians at the start, until he was inside their frontiers with his army. Or
                    shall we say, even at that hour, that those who bid us repel him are provoking
                    war? If so, there is nothing left but slavery; for there is no alternative
                    between that and being allowed neither to defend ourselves nor to remain at

                    interests at stake as the other cities, for it is not our subjection that Philip
                    aims at, but our annihilation. He is well assured that you will not consent to
                    be slaves; or if you consent, will never learn how to be slaves, for you are
                    accustomed to rule others; but that you will be able, if you seize your

                    it is impossible to quell the foes without, until you have punished those within

                    beguiled by his generosity into their present state of servitude; no words can

                    what you did, and the union of the two brought about the practical result. But
                    if Timotheus had given you the best advice he could &lpar;as indeed he
                    did&rpar;, but you had shirked your duty and paid no heed to him, would the
                    State have reaped any of the effects that then followed? Not a bit of it. So the
                    same applies to whatever I utter now and whatever this man or that utters. For
                    deeds you must look to yourselves, but for advice, the best that skill in speech
                    can command, look to the speaker who rises to address you. <milestone

                    leave the platform. I say that we must pay our contributions and keep together
                    the force now in the field, rectifying whatever seems to be amiss, but not
                    disbanding the whole for any adverse criticism. We must send ambassadors in
                    every direction to instruct, to exhort, to act. While doing all this, we must
                    also punish those politicians who take bribes, and we must hate them wherever
                    found, in order that those who prove their own virtue and honesty may find that
                    their advice has been beneficial to themselves as well as to the citizens at
                    large. <milestone unit="section" n="77"/>If you deal thus with public affairs
                    and cease to neglect them entirely, perhaps, yes, perhaps even now there may be
                    a change for the better. If, however, you sit here, confining your zeal to cries
                    of dissent or approval, and drawing back from every call to duty, I see not that
                    any words, divorced from the necessary action on your part, can ever save the

                    <milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Many speeches
                    are delivered, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, at
                    almost every meeting of the Assembly, about the wrongs that Philip has been
                    committing, ever since the conclusion of peace, not only against you but also
                    against the other states, and all the speakers would, I am sure, admit in
                    theory, though they do not put it in practice, that the object both of our words
                    and deeds must be to check and chastise his arrogance; yet I perceive that all
                    our interests have been so completely betrayed and sacrificed, that&mdash;I
                    am afraid it is an ominous thing to say, but yet the truth&mdash;even if all
                    who address you had wanted to propose, and all of you had wanted to pass,
                    measures that were bound to bring our affairs into the worst possible plight, I
                    do not think they could have been in a worse condition than they are today.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Perhaps, indeed, this condition of our
                    affairs may be attributed to many causes and not just to one or two, but a
                    careful examination will convince you that it is above all due to those who
                    study to win your favour rather than to give you the best advice. Some of them,
                    Athenians, interested in maintaining a system which brings them credit and
                    influence, have no thought for the future &lsqb;and therefore think you
                    should have none either&rsqb;; while others, by blaming and traducing those
                    in authority, make it their sole aim that our city shall concentrate her
                    attention on punishing her own citizens, while Philip shall be free to say and
                    do whatever he pleases. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>But such methods of
                    dealing with public affairs, familiar though they are to you, are the cause of
                    your calamities. I claim for myself, Athenians, that if I utter some home-truths
                    with freedom, I shall not thereby incur your displeasure. For look at it this
                    way. In other matters you think it is so necessary to grant general freedom of
                    speech to everyone in <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> that
                    you even allow aliens and slaves to share in the privilege, and many more
                    menials may be observed among you speaking their minds with more liberty than
                    citizens enjoy in other states; but from your deliberations you have banished it
                    utterly. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Hence the result is that in the
                    Assembly your self-complacency is flattered by hearing none but pleasant
                    speeches, but your policy and your practice are already involving you in the
                    gravest peril. Therefore, if such is your temper now, I have nothing to say; but
                    if, apart from flattery, you are willing to hear something to your advantage, I
                    am ready to speak. For though the state of our affairs is in every way
                    deplorable, and though much has been sacrificed, nevertheless it is possible, if
                    you choose to do your duty, that all may yet be repaired. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="5"/>And what I am going to say may perhaps seem a paradox,
                    but it is true. The worst feature of the past is our best hope for the future.
                    What, then, is that feature? It is that your affairs go wrong because you
                    neglect every duty, great or small; since surely, if they were in this plight in
                    spite of your doing all that was required, there would not be even a hope of
                    improvement. But in fact it is your indifference and carelessness that Philip
                    has conquered; your city he has not conquered. Nor have you been
                    defeated&mdash;no! you have not even made a move. <milestone unit="section"
                        n="6"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&lsqb;If, then, we were all agreed
                    that Philip is at war with <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>
                    and is violating the peace, the only task of a speaker would be to come forward
                    and recommend the safest and easiest method of defence; but since some of you
                    are in such a strange mood that, though Philip is seizing cities, and retaining
                    many of your possessions, and inflicting injury on everybody, you tolerate some
                    speakers who repeatedly assert in the Assembly that the real aggressors are
                    certain of ourselves, we must be on our guard and set this matter right.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>For there is grave danger that anyone who
                    proposes and urges that we shall defend ourselves may incur the charge of having
                    provoked the war. I therefore first of all state and define this
                    question&mdash;whether it is in our power to discuss the alternative of
                    peace or war.&rsqb;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Probably the second
                        clause has no connection with the first, but is an alternative form of the

                    <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>If indeed <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName> can remain at peace and if the choice rests with
                    us&mdash; to take that point first&mdash;I personally feel that we are
                    bound to do so; and if anyone says that we can, I call upon him to move a
                    resolution and to do something and to play us no tricks; but if there is another
                    person concerned, with sword in hand and a mighty force at his back, who imposes
                    on you with the name of peace but himself indulges in acts of war, what is left
                    but to defend ourselves? If you choose to follow his example and profess that
                    you are at peace, I raise no objection. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>But if
                    anyone mistakes for peace an arrangement which will enable Philip, when he has
                    seized everything else, to march upon us, he has taken leave of his senses, and
                    the peace that he talks of is one that you observe towards Philip, but not
                    Philip towards you. That is the advantage which he is purchasing by all his
                    expenditure of money&mdash;that he should be at war with you, but that you
                    should not be at war with him. <milestone unit="section" n="10"/><milestone

                    of war with us, we are indeed the simplest of mortals; for even if he marches

                    miles from their city, he told them there must be one of two things, either they

                    ambassadors to justify his conduct. Again, when he was marching against the
                    Phocians, he still pretended that they were his allies, and Phocian ambassadors
                    accompanied him on his march, and most people here at <placeName

                    of sympathy in all goodwill, for he understood that they were suffering from
                    acute internal trouble, and it was the duty of true friends and allies to be at
                    their side on such occasions. <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>And do you
                    imagine that, while in the case of those who could have inflicted no harm,
                    though they might perhaps have protected themselves against it, he preferred to
                    deceive them rather than to crush them after due warning, in your case he will
                    give warning of hostilities, especially when you are so eager to be deceived?

                    at peace and who is at war with him? Surely no one. Now it was Philip who at the

                    injured; and again, when the Lacedaemonians had risen to power and succeeded to
                    your position of supremacy, and when they set to work to encroach on others and
                    interfered unduly with the established order of things, all the Greeks were up

                    saw the other states suffering. Yet all the faults committed by the

                    foolish argument advanced by those who want to reassure the citizens. Philip,
                    they say, after all is not yet what the Lacedaemonians were; they were masters
                    of every sea and land; they enjoyed the alliance of the king of <placeName

                    my own part, while practically all the arts have made a great advance and we are
                    living today in a very different world from the old one, I consider that nothing

                    enemy's territory with heavy infantry and levies of citizens, and would then

                    unchecked, not because he leads a phalanx of heavy infantry, but because he is

                    now control the city, were, as everyone knew, Philip's agents, but Euphraeus, a
                    man who once resided here at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>,
                    was working for the freedom and emancipation of his countrymen. <milestone

                    machinations of Philistides and his party, he denounced him as a traitor. Then a
                    number of fellows banded together, with Philip for their paymaster and managing
                    director, and dragged Euphraeus off to prison for setting the city in an uproar.

                    instead of rescuing him and knocking the others on the head, they showed no
                    resentment against them and gloated over Euphraeus, saying that he deserved all
                    he had got. Then having all the liberty of action they desired, they intrigued
                    for the capture of the city and prepared to carry out their plot, while any of
                    the common folk who saw what they were at were terrorized into silence, having
                    the fate of Euphraeus before their eyes. And so abject was their condition that,
                    with this danger looming ahead, no one dared to breathe a syllable until the
                    enemy, having completed their preparations, were approaching the gates; and then

                    have been its rulers and tyrants; those who sheltered them before, and had been
                    ready to take any measures against Euphraeus, were rewarded with banishment or
                    death; and the noble Euphraeus slew himself, giving thus a practical proof of
                    the honesty and disinterested patriotism of his opposition to Philip. <milestone

                    favorably inclined to Philip's advocates than to their own. The explanation is
                    the same as at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, that the
                    patriots, however much they desire it, cannot sometimes say anything agreeable,
                    for they are obliged to consider the safety of the state; but the others by
                    their very efforts to be agreeable are playing into Philip's hands. The patriots
                    demanded a war-subsidy, the others denied its necessity; the patriots bade them
                    fight on and mistrust Philip, the others bade them keep the peace, until they
                    fell into the snare. <milestone unit="section" n="64"/>Not to go into

                    the last there were many things that the people were induced to concede, not as
                    before for their own gratification nor through ignorance, but gradually yielding

                    by the Olynthians today, which would have saved them from destruction if only
                    they had then foreseen them. Many could be named by the Orites, many by the

                    show his zeal and to take care that it is not capsized by anyone's malice or

                    with a very great city, ample advantages, and the fairest repute&mdash;what
                    are we to do? Perhaps some of my hearers have long been eager to ask that
                    question. I solemnly promise that I will answer it and will also move a
                    resolution, for which you can vote if so disposed. To begin with ourselves, we
                    must make provision for our defence, I mean with war-galleys, funds, and men;
                    for even if all other states succumb to slavery, we surely must fight the battle
                    of liberty. <milestone unit="section" n="71"/>Then having completed all these
                    preparations and made our purpose clear, we must lose no time in calling upon
                    the other Greeks, and we must inform them by sending ambassadors &lsqb;in
                    every direction, to the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName>, to

                    his interests are not unaffected if we prevent Philip from subduing the whole
                    country&mdash;&rsqb; so that if you win them over, you may have someone
                    to share your dangers and your expenses when the time comes, or if not, that you
                    may at least delay the course of events. <milestone unit="section" n="72"/>For
                    since the war is against an individual and not against the might of an organized
                    community, even delay is not without its use; nor were those embassies useless
                    which you sent round the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName>
                    last year to denounce Philip, when I and our good friend Polyeuctus here and
                    Hegesippus and the rest went from city to city and succeeded in checking him, so
                    that he never invaded <placeName key="perseus,Ambracia">Ambracia</placeName> nor
                    even started against the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName>.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="73"/>I do not, however, suggest that you should
                    invite the rest, unless you are ready to do for yourselves what is necessary;
                    for it would be futile to abandon our own interests and pretend that we are
                    protecting those of others, or to overlook the present dangers and alarm our
                    neighbors with dangers to come. That is not my meaning. But I do contend that we
                    must send supplies to the forces in the <placeName key="tgn,7017285"

                    the Greeks. That is the duty of a city with a reputation such as yours enjoys.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="74"/>But if you imagine that <placeName

                    Megarians, while you run away from the task, you are wrong. For they may think
                    themselves lucky if they can save themselves separately. But this is a task for
                    you; it was for you that your ancestors won this proud privilege and bequeathed
                    it to you at great and manifold risk. <milestone unit="section" n="75"/>But if
                    every man sits idle, consulting his own pleasure and careful to avoid his own
                    duty, not only will he find no one to do it for him, but I fear that those
                    duties that we wish to shirk may all be forced upon us at once. <milestone

                <p>
                    <milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The matters that
                    you are debating, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, are
                    to my mind so important and even vital to the State, that I will endeavour to
                    offer you what I consider profitable advice on the subject. While the faults
                    that have produced this unhappy state of things are neither few nor recently
                    accumulated, there is nothing, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName>, more vexing at the present time than the way in which
                    you detach your thoughts from affairs, and display an interest only so long as
                    you sit here listening, or when some fresh item of news arrives; after that,
                    each man goes home, and not only pays no attention to public business, but does
                    not even recall it to mind. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Now the extent of
                    the recklessness and rapacity that Philip shows in his dealings with all men is
                    indeed as great as it has been described to you; but how impossible it is to
                    stay him in this career by argument and declamation, assuredly no one is
                    ignorant. For indeed, if no single thing else can teach a man the truth of that,
                    let him weigh the following consideration. When we have had to speak in defence
                    of our rights, we have never yet been defeated or proved in the wrong, but in
                    every case we vanquish all our opponents and have the best of it in argument.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Is, then, Philip any the worse off for
                    that, or <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> any the better? Far
                    from it; for afterwards, when he takes up arms and marches to battle, ready to
                    risk all he has, and we sit idle, alike those who have pleaded our cause and
                    those who have been listening to them, then, naturally enough, deeds outweigh
                    words, and the world in general gives heed, not to what we once said with
                    justice or might now say, but to what we do. And what we do is insufficient to
                    protect any of the victims of injustice; in fact, I need say no more about it.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Therefore, as the Greeks in every city are
                    divided into these two parties&mdash;the one desiring neither to rule others
                    by force nor to be slaves to any man, but to enjoy liberty and equality under a
                    free constitution; the other eager to rule their fellow-countrymen, but to take
                    their orders from some third person, who they think will enable them to compass
                    their ends&mdash;Philip's faction, those who hanker after tyrannies and
                    oligarchies, have everywhere gained the supremacy, and I doubt whether of all
                    the states there is any stable democracy left except our own. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="5"/>Moreover, this supremacy of the constitution-mongers
                    who rely on Philip's support has been gained by all the devices usual in
                    politics, first and foremost by providing a dispenser of wealth to such as covet
                    it, secondly, and not less effectively, by having at their back a force capable
                    of crushing their opponents on any occasion when they may call upon it.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>But we, Athenians, are not only behindhand
                    in this respect, but we cannot even rouse ourselves from sleep; we are like men
                    who have drunk mandragora or some such drug. Hence, I believe&mdash;for I
                    must speak the truth as I conceive it&mdash;we have been so discredited and
                    despised that of those who are involved in actual danger some dispute with us
                    about the right of leadership, others about the meeting-place for a congress,
                    and some have made up their minds to defend themselves single-handed rather than
                    with us. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>What is
                    my object in treating this matter so fully? For I protest in Heaven's name that
                    I have no ambition to incur your hostility. It is that each one of you,
                    Athenians, may know and realize this&mdash;that in state affairs, as well as
                    in private life, daily indifference and carelessness do not make their result
                    felt at once on each occasion when duty is neglected, but come home to us when
                    the total result of our policy is seen. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Look at
                    Serrium and Doriscus; for these were the places that were disregarded
                    immediately after the peace, and many of you perhaps do not even know of their
                    existence. Yet it was your neglect and abandonment of them that ruined
                        <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName> and Cersobleptes, who was
                    your ally. Again, Philip, seeing that these were overlooked and were receiving
                    no help from you, proceeded to raze Porthmus to the ground and founded a tyranny
                    in <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName> over against <placeName
                        key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName> as a menace to you. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="9"/>Because we neglected <placeName key="tgn,7002677"
                        >Euboea</placeName>, <placeName key="perseus,Megara">Megara</placeName> was
                    very nearly captured. You showed no concern nor anxiety about any of these
                    proceedings, and gave no indication that you would not allow Philip to continue
                    them; so he bought up Antrones and soon afterwards got Oreus under his control.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>I pass over many other instances, such as
                    Pherae, the raid against <placeName key="perseus,Ambracia">Ambracia</placeName>,
                    the massacres at <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>, and countless
                        others.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">For the places named in this

                            9.33</bibl>.</note> I have gone into these details, not to give you a
                    complete catalogue of the victims of Philip's oppression and injustice, but to
                    make it clear to you that he will never desist from molesting all of us and
                    bringing us under his sway, unless someone restrains him. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="11"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But there are some
                    who, without waiting to hear the speeches on these questions, are in the habit
                    of asking at once, &ldquo;What then ought we to do?&rdquo;&mdash;not
                    in order to do it, when they have heard it, for if so, they would be the most
                    helpful of all citizens, but simply to get rid of the speaker. Nevertheless, you
                    must be told what you ought to do. First, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName>, you must fix this firmly in your minds, that Philip is
                    at war with us and has broken the peace, and that he is ill-disposed and hostile
                    to the whole city and to the very soil on which the city stands, and, I will
                    add, to the gods that dwell in it; and may those same gods complete his ruin!
                    The chief object, however, of his arms and his diplomacy is our free
                    constitution, and on nothing in the world is he more bent than on its
                    destruction. <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>And it is in a way inevitable
                    that he should now be acting thus. For observe! He wants to rule, and he has
                    made up his mind that you, and you only, bar the way. He has long injured you;
                    of nothing is he more conscious than of that. For it is by holding the cities
                    that are really yours that he retains safe possession of all the rest;
                        <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>and if he gave up <placeName
                        key="perseus,Amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName> and <placeName
                        key="tgn,6004814">Potidaea</placeName>, even <placeName key="tgn,7006667"
                        >Macedonia</placeName> would be no safe place for him. He knows, then, these
                    two facts&mdash;that he is intriguing against you and that you are aware of
                    it. Assuming that you are intelligent, he concludes that you hate him. Besides
                    these weighty considerations, he knows for certain that even if he masters all
                    else, his power will be precarious as long as you remain a democracy, but if
                    ever he meets with some mischance &lpar;and there are many to which mankind
                    is liable&rpar;, all the forces that are now under restraint will be
                    attracted to your side. <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>For nature has not
                    equipped you to seek aggrandizement and secure empire, but you are clever at
                    thwarting another's designs and wresting from him his gains, and quick to
                    confound utterly the plots of the ambitious and vindicate the freedom of all
                    mankind. Therefore he does not want to have the Athenian tradition of liberty
                    watching to seize every chance against himself; nor is his reasoning here either
                    faulty or idle. <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>This, then, is the first thing
                    needful, to recognize in Philip the inveterate enemy of constitutional
                    government and democracy; and your second need is to convince yourselves that
                    all his activity and all his organization is preparing the way for an attack on
                    our city. For none of you is so simple as to believe that though Philip covets
                    these wretched objects in Thrace&mdash;for what else can one call Drongilus
                    and <placeName key="tgn,7010710">Cabyle</placeName> and Mastira and the other
                    places he is said to be now holding ?&mdash;and though he endures toil and
                    winter storms and deadly peril for the privilege of taking them, <milestone
                        unit="section" n="16"/>yet he does not covet the Athenian harbours and
                    dockyards and war-galleys and the place itself and the glory of it&mdash;and
                    never may Philip or any other man make himself master of these by the conquest
                    of our city!&mdash;but will allow you to retain them, while he winters in
                    that purgatory for the sake of the rye and millet of the Thracian store-pits.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="17"/>It is not so, but it is to win these
                    prizes that he devotes his activities to all those other objects. <milestone
                        unit="para" ed="P"/>Therefore each must know and feel in his own mind the
                    truth of this, but you must not, of course, call for a declaration of war from
                    the statesman who is trying, in all honesty, to give you the best advice; for
                    that would be the act of men who want to find someone to fight with, not of men
                    who seek the interests of their state.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">To
                        propose war on Philip would be dangerous to the speaker, as explained in the
                        speech <bibl n="Dem. 8.68">Dem. 8.68</bibl>, and unnecessary, as Philip is
                        already at war with <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName>.</note>
                    <milestone unit="section" n="18"/>For consider. If for his first violation of
                    the peace, or his second or third&mdash;for there was a long series of
                    them&mdash;someone had proposed a declaration of war against him, and if
                    Philip, just as he is doing now when no one proposes such a declaration, had
                    gone to the help of the Cardians, would not the proposer have been
                        suppressed,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">The word used is strong, but
                        purposely vague. He would have incurred the inevitable<foreign lang="greek"
                            >grafn\ paravo/mwn</foreign>.</note> and blamed by everybody as the real
                    author of Philip's expedition? <milestone unit="section" n="19"/>Then do not
                    look about for a scapegoat for Philip's sins, someone whom you can throw for his
                    hirelings to rend limb from limb. Do not vote for war and then fall to disputing
                    among yourselves whether you ought or ought not to have done so, but imitate his
                    methods of warfare, supplying those who are now resisting him with money and
                    whatever else they need, and raising a war-fund yourselves, Athenians, and
                    providing an army, swift-sailing galleys, horses, cavalry-transports, and
                    everything that war requires. <milestone unit="section" n="20"/>For at present
                    our system is a mockery, and, by Heaven, I do not believe that even Philip
                    himself would pray that <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> might
                    act otherwise than she is acting. You are behind your time and waste your money;
                    you look round for someone to manage the business and then quarrel with him; you
                    throw the blame on one another. I will explain how this comes about and will
                    tell you how to stop it. <milestone unit="section" n="21"/>Never yet, Athenians,
                    have you instituted or organized a single plan of action properly at the start,
                    but you always follow in the track of each event, and then, when you find
                    yourselves too late, you give up the pursuit; <milestone unit="section" n="22"
                    />when the next event occurs, you are again in a bustle of preparation. But that
                    is not the way. If you trust to occasional levies, you can never gain any of
                    your essential objects; but you must first raise a force and provide for its
                    maintenance, and appoint paymasters and clerks, and arrange that there shall be
                    the strictest watch kept over your expenditure, and afterwards you must demand
                    from your paymasters an account of their moneys, and from the general an account
                    of his campaign, and you must leave the general no excuse for sailing elsewhere
                    or engaging in any other business. <milestone unit="section" n="23"/>If you do
                    this, and you are really in earnest about it, you will either compel Philip to
                    keep the peace fairly and to stay in one place, or you will fight him on equal
                    terms; and perhaps&mdash;perhaps, just as you are now inquiring what Philip
                    is doing and where he is marching, so he may be anxious to know where the
                    Athenian force is bound for, and in what quarter it will appear. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="24"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But if anyone thinks
                    that all this means great expense and much toil and worry, he is quite correct,
                    but if he reckons up what will hereafter be the result to <placeName
                        key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> if she refuses to act, he will
                    conclude that it is to our interest to perform our duty willingly. For if you
                    have the guarantee of some god, since no mere mortal could be a satisfactory
                    surety for such an event, that if you remain inactive and abandon everything,
                    Philip will not in the end march against yourselves, <milestone unit="section"
                        n="25"/>by Zeus and all the other gods, it would be disgraceful and unworthy
                    of you and of the resources of your city and the record of your ancestors to
                    abandon all the other Greeks to enslavement for the sake of your own ease, and I
                    for one would rather die than be guilty of proposing such a policy. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="26"/>All the same, if someone does propose it and wins
                    your assent, so be it; offer no resistance, sacrifice everything. But if no one
                    approves of this, and if on the contrary we all of us foresee that the more we
                    allow him to extend his power, the stronger and more formidable we shall find
                    him in war, what escape is open to us, or why do we delay? When, men of
                        <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, shall we consent to do
                    our duty? <milestone unit="section" n="27"/>&ldquo;Whenever it is
                    necessary,&rdquo; you will say. But what any free man would call necessity
                    is not merely present now, but is long ago past, and from the necessity that
                    constrains a slave we must surely pray to be delivered. Do you ask the
                    difference? The strongest necessity that a free man feels is shame for his own
                    position, and I know not if we could name a stronger; but for a slave necessity
                    means stripes and bodily outrage, unfit to name here, from which Heaven defend
                    us! <milestone unit="section" n="28"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now, men of
                        <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, with regard to such

                    right&mdash;indeed, far from it&mdash;but still it does admit of some
                    excuse notwithstanding; but to refuse even to listen to all that you ought to
                    hear and all that you are bound to decide deserves, at such a time as this,
                    absolute condemnation. <milestone unit="section" n="29"/>Your habit, then, is
                    not to listen until, as now, the events themselves are upon you, and not to
                    discuss any question at your leisure but whenever Philip makes his preparations,
                    you neglect the chance of doing the same, and you are too remiss to make
                    counter-preparations; and if anyone speaks out, you drive him from the platform,
                    but when you learn of the loss of this place or the siege of that, then you pay
                    attention and begin to prepare. <milestone unit="section" n="30"/>But the time
                    to have listened and made your decision was just then, when you would not do it;
                    now, when you are listening, is the time to act and put your preparations to
                    use. Therefore in consequence of these bad habits you alone reverse the general
                    practice of mankind; for other people deliberate before the event, but you after

                    needs so much for the coming struggle as money. Some strokes of good fortune we

                    the very man who planned and carried them out, so that their credit is
                    established, and the only suggestion for our ambassadors to make is one which

                    are left to our own resources and anything happens to us, he will soon be

                    their duties as citizens; indeed, you will find that in every case where a man
                    has failed to do his duty, this has been given as the excuse. I am really afraid
                    to speak on this subject, but I will do so nevertheless; <milestone

                    State, to plead the cause both of the poor against the rich and of the
                    property-owners against the necessitous. If we could banish from our midst both
                    the obloquy which some heap on the Theoric Fund,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes"
                        >See note on <bibl n="Dem. 1.20">Dem. 1.20</bibl>.</note> and also the fear
                    that the Fund will not be maintained without doing a great deal of harm, we
                    could not perform a greater service nor one more likely to strengthen the whole
                    body politic. <milestone unit="section" n="37"/>Follow my argument while I state
                    first the case of those who are regarded as the poorer classes. There was a time
                    not long ago when the revenue of your state did not exceed a hundred and thirty
                    talents, and yet of those competent to undertake the trierarchy or pay the
                    property-tax there is not one that declined the duty that devolved on him in the
                    absence of a surplus; but the war-galleys sailed out, and the money came in, and
                    we did all that was required. <milestone unit="section" n="38"/>Since then
                    fortune has smiled on us and increased our revenues, and the exchequer now
                    receives four hundred instead of one hundred talents, though no property-owner
                    suffers any loss but is rather the gainer, for all the rich citizens come up to
                    receive their share of this increase, as indeed they have a perfect right to do.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="39"/>What then do we mean by reproaching one
                    another for this and making it an excuse for doing nothing, unless it is that we
                    grudge the relief which the poor have received at the hands of fortune? I for
                    one shall not blame them,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">i.e. blame the poorer
                        classes for upholding the Theoric Fund. The argument is that when revenue
                        was smaller, the property-owners did not refuse to pay up; now that the
                        revenue shows a big surplus, devoted to the Theoric Fund, in which all
                        classes have a share, why should the rich demand relief from their

                    man adopts that attitude towards his seniors, or that any human being is so
                    insensible or unreasonable that he refuses to do anything himself unless
                    everybody does the same; and indeed such a case would be covered by the laws for

                    anything that the State bestows, we ought, if there were no such grant, to look

                    I think they would be doing not only what is fair, but also what is expedient;
                    for to deprive one citizen of necessaries is to make many of them unite in
                    disaffection towards the government. I would also counsel the poorer classes to
                    abolish the grievance which makes the propertied class discontented with the
                    system, and gives them just cause for assailing it. <milestone unit="section"

                    does our practice break down, and where lies the grievance? It is when the rich

                    property; when the speaker is raised to instant greatness among you and even to
                    immortality, as far as his privilege can secure it; and when your shouts of open
                    approval are contradicted by your secret vote.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes"
                        >The recognized appropriation of public money for the Theoric Fund is

                        undue influence and, being privileged, is unassailable. Meanwhile the
                        people, sitting as a jury, applaud the rich man when he skilfully defends
                        his rights, but cast their votes against him.</note>
                    <milestone unit="section" n="45"/>All this breeds distrust and resentment. For
                    we are bound, Athenians, to share equitably with one another the privileges of
                    citizenship, the wealthy feeling secure to lead their own lives and haunted by
                    no fears on that account, but in the face of dangers making over their property
                    to the commonwealth for its defence; while the rest must realize that
                    State-property is common property, duly receiving their share of it, but
                    recognizing that private wealth belongs to the possessor. In this way a small
                    state grows great, and a great one is kept great. This may pass for a verbal
                    statement of the duties of each class; for the legal performance of those duties

                    force, and to help all the oppressed, is a superfluous task and an idle expense;

                    abandon all your possessions and let others seize them one by one, ensured
                    wonderful prosperity and complete security. <milestone unit="section" n="47"/>In
                    consequence of this, a rival has stepped into the position that you ought to
                    have filled, and it is he who has become prosperous and great and ruler over
                    many things. And rightly so; for there is a prize, honorable, great, and
                    glorious, a prize for which the greatest of our states once spent all their time
                    in contending, but since misfortune has dogged the Lacedaemonians, and the
                    Phocian War has left the Thebans no leisure, and we are heedless, he has grasped
                    it without a struggle. <milestone unit="section" n="48"/>Therefore fear is the

                    and such great and manifold troubles now encompass all the Greeks that it is not

                    confusion? For no other occasion than the present could possibly be named by
                    anyone. All during the past <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> was
                    divided into two camps, the Lacedaemonians' and ours, and of the other Greeks
                    some took their orders from us, others from them. The king of <placeName

                    all, but by taking up the cause of the losing side in the struggle, he retained
                    their confidence until he could put them on an equality with the others; but
                    thereafter he was no less hated by those he had saved than by those who had been
                    his enemies from the beginning. <milestone unit="section" n="52"/>But in the
                    first place, the king is now well-disposed to all the Greeks, and yet to us
                    least of all, unless we can effect some immediate improvement. In the second
                    place, many so-called &ldquo;protectors&rdquo; are springing up
                    everywhere, and all states are rivals for the leadership, but unfortunately some
                    hold aloof, in mutual jealousy and distrust, and so each state has isolated
                    itself&mdash;Argives, Thebans, Lacedaemonians, Corinthians, Arcadians,

                        key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>; and naturally so, for neither
                    through love nor trust nor fear does anyone hold communication with us.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="54"/>And this is not due to a single cause,
                    Athenians, or you might easily remedy it, but to many errors of every kind
                    throughout the past. Without enumerating these, I will mention one on which all
                    the rest turn, only beseeching you not to be offended with me, if I speak the
                    truth boldly. It is the selling of your interests at every opportunity; your
                    share in the bargain is leisure and inaction, which charm you out of your
                    resentment against your betrayers, but others reap the rewards. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="55"/>The other errors it is not worth while to investigate
                    now, but whenever any question arises that concerns Philip, instantly up jumps
                    someone and says there must be no nonsense talked, no declarationtion of war,
                    and he at once goes on to add how good a thing it is to preserve peace, and what
                    a bother it is to keep up a large army, and how &ldquo;certain persons want
                    to plunder your wealth&rdquo;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">i.e. by
                        diverting money from the Theoric Fund to military objects.</note>; and their
                    other statements are as true as they can make them. <milestone unit="section"
                        n="56"/>But surely it is not to you that they should recommend peace, for
                    you have taken the advice and there you sit; it is to the man who is even now on
                    the warpath; for if Philip can be won over, your share of the compact is ready
                    to hand. Again, they should reflect that the irksome thing is not the expense of
                    securing our safety, but the doom that will be ours if we shrink from that
                    expense. As for the &ldquo;plunder of your wealth,&rdquo; they ought to
                    prevent that by proposing some way of checking it and not by abandoning your
                    interests. <milestone unit="section" n="57"/>And yet it is just this that rouses
                    my indignation, that some of you should be distressed at the prospect of the
                    plunder of your wealth, when you are quite competent to protect it and to punish
                    any offender, but that you are not distressed at the sight of Philip thus
                    plundering every Greek state in turn, the more so as he is plundering them to
                    injure you. <milestone unit="section" n="58"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Why
                    then, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, has none of
                    these speakers ever admitted that Philip is violating rights and provoking war,
                    when he is thus openly violating rights and subduing cities, but when others
                    urge you not to give way to Philip nor submit to these losses, they say they are
                    provoking war? It is because they want the blame for the sufferings that the war
                    will entail&mdash;for it is inevitable, yes, inevitable that the war should
                    cause much distress&mdash;to be laid at the doors of those who believe they
                    are your wisest counsellors. <milestone unit="section" n="59"/>For they are
                    convinced that if you offer a whole-hearted and unanimous opposition to Philip,
                    you will beat him and they will have no further chance of earning his pay, but
                    that if at the first alarm of war you throw the blame on certain persons and
                    devote your energies to bringing them to trial, they themselves by accusing them
                    will gain both their ends&mdash;reputation with you and money from him,
                    while you will punish the men who have spoken in your interests for the faults
                    which you ought to punish in their accusers. <milestone unit="section" n="60"
                    />Such are their hopes, and such is the design of the accusation that
                    &ldquo;certain persons wish to provoke war.&rdquo; But I am absolutely
                    certain that, without waiting for any Athenian to propose a declaration of war,
                    Philip is in possession of much of our territory and has just dispatched a force
                    against Cardia. If, however, we like to pretend that he is not at war with us,
                    he would be the greatest fool alive if he tried to disprove that; for when the
                    victims deny the wrong, what should the malefactor do? <milestone unit="section"
                        n="61"/>But when our turn comes, what shall we say then? For of course he
                    will deny that he is attacking us, just as he denied that he was attacking the
                    men of Oreus, when his troops were already in their territory, or the Pheraeans
                    before that, when he was actually assaulting their walls, or the Olynthians at
                    the start, until he was inside their frontier with his army. Or shall we say,
                    even at that hour, that those who bid us repel him are provoking war? If so,
                    there is nothing left but slavery, for there is no other alternative. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="62"/>Moreover, you have not the same interests at stake as
                    some of the others, for it is not your subjection that Philip aims at; no, but
                    your complete annihilation. For he is well assured that you will not consent to
                    be slaves; or, if you consent, will never learn how to be slaves, for you are
                    accustomed to rule others; but that you will be able, if you seize your chances,
                    to cause him more trouble than all the rest of the world. For that reason he
                    will not spare you, if he gets you in his power. <milestone unit="section"
                        n="63"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Therefore you must needs bear in mind
                    that this will be a life-and-death struggle, and the men who have sold
                    themselves to Philip must be publicly cudgelled to death; for it is impossible,
                    impossible to quell the foes without, until you have punished the foes within
                    your gates, but if you let these stand as stumbling-blocks in your path, you
                    must fail against the others. <milestone unit="section" n="64"/>What do you
                    imagine is his motive in outraging you now&mdash;I think no other term
                    describes his conduct&mdash;or why is it that, in deceiving the others, he
                    at least confers benefits upon them, but in your case he is resorting to
                    threats? For example, the Thessalians were beguiled by his generosity into their
                    present state of servitude; no words can describe how he formerly deceived the
                    miserable Olynthians by his gift of <placeName key="tgn,6004814"
                        >Potidaea</placeName> and many other places; the Thebans he is now
                    misleading, having handed over <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName>
                    to them and relieved them of a long and trying war. <milestone unit="section"
                        n="65"/>So each of these states has reaped some benefit from him, but while
                    some have already paid the price by their sufferings, the others have yet to
                    suffer whatever shall fall to their lot. As for you, I do not say how far you
                    have been robbed, but in the actual making of the peace, how completely you were
                    deceived, how grievously you were robbed! Were you not deceived about <placeName
                        key="tgn,4003963">Phocis</placeName>, <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae"
                        >Thermopylae</placeName>, the Thrace-ward districts, Doriscus, Serrium,
                    Cersobleptes himself? Is not Philip now holding the city of the Cardians, and
                    admitting that he holds it? <milestone unit="section" n="66"/>Why then does he
                    deal in that way with the other Greeks, but with you in this way? Because yours
                    is the one city in the world where immunity is granted to plead on behalf of our
                    enemies, and where a man who has been bribed can safely address you in person,
                    even when you have been robbed of your own. It would not have been safe in
                        <placeName key="perseus,Olynthus">Olynthus</placeName> to plead Philip's
                    cause, unless the Olynthian democracy had shared in the enjoyment of the
                    revenues of <placeName key="tgn,6004814">Potidaea</placeName>. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="67"/>It would not have been safe in <placeName
                        key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName> to plead Philip's cause, if the
                    commoners of <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName> had not shared in
                    the advantages that Philip conferred, when he expelled their tyrants and
                    restored to them their Amphictyonic privileges. It would not have been safe at
                        <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, until he gave them back
                        <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName> and wiped out the Phocians.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="68"/>But at <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName>, though Philip has not only robbed you of <placeName
                        key="perseus,Amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName> and the Cardian territory,
                    but is also turning <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName> into a
                    fortress to overawe us and is even now on his way to attack Byzantium, it is
                    safe to speak on Philip's behalf. Indeed, of these politicians, some who were
                    beggars are suddenly growing rich, some unknown to name and fame are now men of
                    honour and distinction; while you, on the contrary, have passed from honour to
                    dishonour, from affluence to destitution. <milestone unit="section" n="69"/>For
                    a city's wealth I hold to be allies, credit, goodwill, and of all these you are
                    destitute. And it is because you are indifferent to these things and allow them
                    to be taken from you in this way, that Philip is prosperous and powerful and
                    formidable to Greeks and barbarians alike, while you are deserted and
                    humiliated, famous for your well-stocked markets, but in provision for your
                    proper needs, contemptible. <milestone unit="section" n="70"/><milestone
                        unit="para" ed="P"/>Yet I observe that some of our speakers do not urge the
                    same policy for you as for themselves; for you, they say, ought to remain quiet
                    even when you are wronged; themselves cannot remain quiet among you, though no
                    one does them wrong. And yet, raillery apart, suppose someone should ask,
                    &ldquo;Tell me, Aristomedes,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">An unknown
                        opponent. If with Dindorf we adopt the vulgate, it will refer to the
                        Athenian actor Aristodemus, who was a member of the first embassy to Philip
                        and is mentioned in <bibl n="Dem. 18.21">Dem. 18.21</bibl> and in several
                        passages of <bibl n="Dem. 19">Dem. 19</bibl></note> why, when you know
                    perfectly well&mdash;for no one is ignorant of such matters&mdash;that a
                    private station is secure and free from risk, but the life of a politician is
                    precarious, open to attack, and full of trials and misfortunes every day, why do
                    you not choose the quiet, sequestered life instead of the life of
                    peril?&rdquo; What would you reply? <milestone unit="section" n="71"/>For if
                    we should grant the truth of what would be your best possible answer, that you
                    do all this for love of glory and renown, I wonder what earthly reason you have
                    for thinking that you yourself ought for that object to make every exertion,
                    facing toil and danger, whereas you advise the State to abandon such efforts in
                    sheer indifference. For this you cannot say&mdash;that it is your duty to
                    make a figure in the State, but that the State is of no importance in the Greek
                    world. <milestone unit="section" n="72"/>And there is another thing I do not
                    see&mdash;that it is safe for the State to mind its own business, but
                    dangerous for you if you do not go beyond your fellow-citizens in meddling with
                    affairs. <milestone unit="section" n="73"/>Nay, on the contrary, I do foresee
                    the utmost danger, to you from your bustling and meddling, but to the State from
                    its inactivity. But you may say that you have the honour of your grandfather and
                    father to uphold, and it would be scandalous to subvert it in your person, but
                    that the State has inherited only nameless and paltry exploits from our
                    ancestors. But that too is untrue; for you had a thief for your father, if he
                    was like you, but our fathers, as all the Greeks know, preserved them from the
                    deadliest perils. <milestone unit="section" n="74"/>But indeed there are some
                    whose management both of private and of public business is neither fair nor
                    constitutional; for how is it fair that some of these men, just released from
                    jail, should be ignorant of their own worth, while that state, which was once
                    the champion of the rest and maintained the pre-eminence, should now be sunk in
                    all dishonour and humiliation? <milestone unit="section" n="75"/><milestone

                    topics, I will forbear; for indeed it is not, I think, lack of speeches either
                    now or at any other time that is the cause of our distress, but when you have
                    listened to the right sort of arguments, and when you are unanimous as to their
                    validity, you sit on and give equal attention to those who wish to overthrow and
                    distort them. It is not that you do not recognize these speakers, for as soon as
                    you have seen them, you know exactly who is speaking for pay and acting as
                    Philip's agent, and who is sincerely defending your best interests; but your aim
                    is to find fault with these latter and, by turning the subject into ridicule and
                    raillery, to avoid doing any part of your own duty. <milestone unit="section"

                    the State into our enemies' hands. Either, then, you must abandon these habits
                    of yours, or you must throw the blame for all our failures on no one but
