                <head>Against Meidias</head>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>The brutality
                    and insolence with which Meidias treats everyone alike are, I suppose, as well
                    known to you, gentlemen of the jury, as to all other citizens. For myself, I
                    have simply taken the course which anyone of you would have adopted, had he been
                    the victim of a similar outrage. I lodged a plaint in the Assembly against him
                    as an offender in connection with the festival, not only for his assault on my
                    person at the Dionysia, but for many other acts of violence during the whole
                    period when I served as chorus-master. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>But when
                    the whole people, acting honorably and rightly, evinced such anger, such
                    exasperation, such deep concern at the wrongs which they knew I had suffered,
                    that, in spite of the frantic efforts of the defendant and a few supporters,
                    they were deaf to their arguments, shut their eyes to their wealth and their
                    promises, and condemned him by an unanimous show of hands, thereupon, gentlemen
                    of the jury, many citizens, including some of you who are here in court, came to
                    me and demanded and even implored that I should take the further step of
                    bringing Meidias under your jurisdiction; and they did so, I think, for two
                    reasons, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, because, so
                    help me heaven! they thought that my own wrongs were serious, and they also
                    wished to punish Meidias for conduct which they had witnessed on other
                    occasions, as a scoundrel and a ruffian who could no longer be tolerated.
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>This being so, I have in your interests
                    taken all due precautions, and now that the case is before the court, I am here,
                    as you see, to accuse him, having refused large sums of money, men of <placeName
                        key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, which I might have accepted on
                    condition of dropping the prosecution, and having had to steel myself against
                    many appeals and favorable offers-yes, and even menaces. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/>What yet remains to do is in your hands; but my hope is that
                    the more the defendant has pestered you with his solicitations&mdash;I
                    observed just now what he was up to in front of the courthouse-more likely I am
                    to obtain justice. For I would not insult any of you by imagining that you will
                    be indifferent to the cause in which you so heartily supported me before, or
                    that, in order to grant Meidias immunity for future outrages, any juryman
                    remembering his oath will give other than what he considers a righteous verdict.
                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>Now if, men of <placeName
                        key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, I were going to accuse Meidias of
                    unconstitutional proposals or of misconduct on an embassy or of any offence of
                    that sort, I should not feel justified in appealing for your sympathy, for I
                    consider that in such cases the plaintiff ought to confine himself to proving
                    his case, though the defendant may have recourse to prayers. But since Meidias
                    bribed the umpires and so robbed my tribe unfairly of the prize, <milestone
                        n="6" unit="section"/>since I in person was struck by him and insulted as
                    perhaps no chorus-master was ever insulted before, and since I am here to follow
                    up the verdict which the Assembly pronounced in indignation and anger at such
                    conduct, for these reasons I shall not shrink even from an appeal to you. For,
                    if I may say so, it is now I who am in the position of a defendant, if indeed to
                    obtain no redress for an insult is the real calamity. <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/>Therefore, gentlemen of the jury, I appeal to you all, and
                    implore you first to grant me a favorable hearing, and secondly, if I prove that
                    the insults of Meidias touch, not me only, but you and the laws and the whole
                    body of citizens, to come at once to any rescue and to your own. For the case
                    stands thus, Athenians. I was the victim and it was my person that was then
                    outraged; but now the question to be fought out and decided is whether Meidias
                    is to be allowed to repeat his performances and insult anyone and everyone of
                    you with impunity. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>Therefore if perhaps anyone
                    of you hitherto assumed that this action was brought from private motives, when
                    he now reflects that this is a matter of general concern, and that public
                    interest demands that no one shall be allowed to act in this way, let him grant
                    me an attentive hearing, and then let him give what seems to him the fairest
                        verdict.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>But first the clerk shall read you
                    the law which provides for the lodging of plaints in the Assembly; after that I
                    will try to enlighten you on other points. Recite the law.<quote type="Law"

                        shall call a meeting of the Assembly in the temple of Dionysus on the day
                        next after the Pandia. At this meeting they shall first deal with religious
                        matters; next they shall lay before it the plaints lodged concerning the
                        procession or the contests at the Dionysia, namely such as have not been
                        satisfied.&rsqb;</quote>
                    <milestone n="9" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>This is the law,
                    Athenians, which provides for the lodging of a plaint. It directs, as you have
                    heard, that a meeting of the Assembly shall be held in the temple of Dionysus
                    after the Pandia, and that at this meeting, when the chairmen for the day have
                    dealt with the official acts of the chief Archon, they shall also deal with any
                    offences or illegal acts in connection with the festival&mdash;a sound and
                    expedient law, Athenians, as the facts of the present case attest. For when it
                    appears that certain persons, with this threat overhanging them, can be as
                    insolent as ever, how should we expect that such men would behave, if there were
                    no risk and no trial to be faced? <milestone n="10" unit="section"/><milestone
                        ed="P" unit="para"/>Now I want to read to you the next law as well, because
                    it will illustrate to all of you the self-restraint of the citizens in general
                    and the hardihood of the defendant. Read the law.<quote type="Law"

                        proposed that, on the occasion of the procession in honor of Dionysus in
                        Peiraeus with the comedies and tragedies, the procession at the Lenaeum with
                        the comedies and tragedies, the procession at the City Dionysia with the
                        boys' contests and the revel and the comedies and tragedies. and also at the
                        procession and contest of the Thargelia, it shall not be lawful on those
                        days to distrain or to seize any debtors' property, even if they are
                        defaulters. If anyone transgresses any of these regulations, he shall be
                        liable to prosecution by the aggrieved party, and public plaints against him
                        as an offender may be lodged at the meeting of the Assembly in the temple of
                        Dionysus, as is provided by statute in the case of other
                        offenders.&rsqb;</quote>
                    <milestone n="11" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>You will
                    observe, gentlemen of the jury, that whereas in the first law the public plaint
                    may be lodged against those who violate the laws of the festival, in the latter
                    law you have sanctioned plaints against those who exact money from defaulting
                    debtors or seize any property or use violence to that end. So far from thinking
                    it right that any man's person should be outraged on those days, or that any
                    equipment should be damaged which a citizen provides out of his private means
                    for a public service, you have even conceded that what by law and by verdict
                    belongs to the winner of a suit should remain the property of the loser and
                    original owner, at any rate during the festival. <milestone n="12"
                        unit="section"/>You therefore, Athenians, have all risen to such a height of
                    benevolence and piety that during those days you have even suspended the
                    exaction of penalties due for past offences; but Meidias, as I shall prove,
                    chose those very same days to commit offences that call for the severest
                    punishment. I intend to describe in order each outrage of which I have been the
                    victim, before I speak of the blows in which his attacks culminated, for there
                    is not a single one of those attacks for which he will not be shown to have
                    deserved death. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"
                    />Two years ago the tribe of Pandionis had failed to appoint a chorus-master,
                    and when the Assembly met at which the law directs the Archons to assign the
                    flute-players by lot to the choruses, there was a heated discussion and mutual
                    recrimination between the Archon and the overseers of the tribe.<note
                        resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Elected, one from each tribe, to help the Archon
                        in directing the procession at the Dionysia.</note> Thereupon I came forward
                    and volunteered to act as chorus-master, and at the drawing of the lots I was
                    fortunate enough to get first choice of a flute-player. <milestone n="14"
                        unit="section"/>You, Athenians, all of you, welcomed with the utmost
                    cordiality both these incidents&mdash;my voluntary offer and my stroke of
                    luck; and your cheers and applause expressed your approval of my conduct and
                    your sympathy with my good fortune. But there seems to have been one solitary
                    exception, Meidias, who in his chagrin kept up a constant fire of insults,
                    trifling or serious, during the whole period of my service. <milestone n="15"
                        unit="section"/>Now the trouble that he caused by opposing the exemption of
                    our chorus from military service, or by putting himself forward as overseer at
                    the Dionysia and demanding election, these and other similar annoyances I will
                    pass over in silence; for I am not unaware that although to myself, the victim
                    of his persecution and insolence, each of these acts caused as much irritation
                    as any really serious offence, yet to the rest of you, who were not directly
                    concerned, these things in themselves would hardly seem to call for litigation.
                    I shall therefore confine myself to what will excite indignation in all of you
                    alike. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/>His subsequent conduct, which I am now
                    going to describe, passes all limits; and indeed I should never have ventured to
                    arraign him today, had I not previously secured his immediate conviction in the
                    Assembly. The sacred apparel&mdash;for all apparel provided for use at a
                    festival I regard as being sacred until after it has been used&mdash;and the
                    golden crowns,which I ordered for the decoration of the chorus, he plotted to
                    destroy,men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, by a
                    nocturnal raid on the premises of my goldsmith. And he did destroy them, though
                    not completely, for that was beyond his power. And no one can say that he ever
                    yet heard of anyone daring or perpetrating such an outrage in this city.
                        <milestone n="17" unit="section"/>But not content with this, men of
                        <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, he actually corrupted
                    the trainer of my chorus; and if Telephanes, the flute-player, had not proved
                    the staunchest friend to me, if he had not seen through the fellow's game and
                    sent him about his business, if he had not felt it his duty to train the chorus
                    and weld them into shape himself, we could not have taken part in the
                    competition, Athenians; the chorus would have come in untrained and we should
                    have been covered with ignominy. Nor did his insolence stop even there. It was
                    so unrestrained that he bribed the crowned Archon himself; he banded the
                    choristers against me; he bawled and threatened, standing beside the umpires as
                    they took the oath he blocked the gangways from the wings,<note resp="Loeb"

                    authority; he never ceased to cause me untold damage and annoyance. <milestone
                        n="18" unit="section"/>Of those outrages which were committed in public or
                    before the umpires in the theater, you are yourselves my witnesses, all of you,
                    gentlemen of the jury. And surely the statements on which most reliance should
                    be placed are those of which the jury can themselves attest the truth. So after
                    he had already corrupted the umpires in the men's contest, he put the cap, as it
                    were, on all his previous acts of wantonness by two outrages: he assaulted my
                    person, and he was chiefly responsible for preventing my tribe, which was
                    winning, from gaining the prize. <milestone n="19" unit="section"/><milestone
                        ed="P" unit="para"/>These were the crimes and brutalities which Meidias
                    committed in connection with the festival against my fellow-tribesmen and
                    myself. It was for these, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName>, that I lodged my public plaint; and there are many
                    besides, of which I will describe to you immediately as many as I can. But I
                    have to tell of many other acts of unmitigated rascality and insolence, directed
                    against many of yourselves, and many daring crimes of this blackguard.

                    jury, suffered in silence, because they were cowed by him and his
                    self-confidence, or by his gang of bullies, his wealth and all his other
                    resources; others tried to obtain redress and failed; others again made terms
                    with him, perhaps because they thought that the best policy. Those, then, who
                    were induced to do so have obtained the satisfaction due to themselves; but of
                    the satisfaction due to the laws, by breaking which Meidias wronged them and is

                    come to that, I want to speak about the tricks by which I am told he will try to
                    deceive you; for I think it very necessary for me to put my remarks on that
                    subject before you, and very important for you to hear them. Why so? Because the
                    same argument that prevents your deception will help you to cast your votes in
                    accordance with justice and your oath. You must pay attention to this argument
                    above all others and bear it in mind, so as to meet each separate point in his
                    speech. <milestone n="25" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And
                    first, it is pretty evident from his private conversation as reported to me that
                    he will say that, if I had really suffered from him as I assert, I ought to have
                    brought various personal suits against him, one for willful damage, arising out
                    of the destruction of the robes and golden crowns, and another for assault,
                    arising out of his alleged attack on my person; but that I ought most
                    emphatically not to have brought him to a public trial and proposed a penalty or
                    a fine which he must pay. <milestone n="26" unit="section"/>But of one thing I
                    am perfectly certain, and you should be equally so-that if I had not lodged the
                    public plaint but had brought a civil action, the opposite argument would have
                    been used against me, that if there was any truth in my statements, I ought to
                    have lodged a public plaint and claimed redress at the time when the offences
                    were committed; for the chorus was a state-chorus, the apparel was being
                    prepared entirely for a public festival, and I, the aggrieved party, was
                    official chorus-master. Who then would dream of any other form of redress than
                    that which the law provides against those who profane a festival? <milestone
                        n="27" unit="section"/>I am sure that he would have said all that in those
                    circumstances. For it is, I believe, the cue for the defendant, the man who has
                    done a wrong, to try and shuffle out of the method actually adopted to bring him
                    to punishment and to say that a different method should have been employed; but
                    it is the duty of sensible jurymen to ignore such evasions and to chastise
                    anyone whom they convict of an outrage. <milestone n="28" unit="section"/>Do not
                    allow him to say that the law affords me a choice of personal suits or an
                    indictment for assault. That is true; but he has to prove that he has not done
                    what I have charged him with, or that in doing it he has not profaned the
                    festival, for that is the ground on which I based my public plaint against him,
                    and that is the question on which you must presently cast your votes. But if I,
                    waiving the profit which a private suit would bring, entrust his punishment to
                    the State, and if I have chosen this particular form of action from which I can
                    receive no benefit myself, then surely it ought to win me your favour and not
                    prejudice my case. <milestone n="29" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P"
                        unit="para"/>Now I know that he will also make great use of this argument:
                    &ldquo;Do not deliver me into Demosthenes' hands; do not ruin me to oblige
                    Demosthenes. Because I am at war with him, will you ruin me?&rdquo; That is
                    the sort of language that he will, I am sure, use again and again, with the
                    object of exciting prejudice against me. <milestone n="30" unit="section"/>But
                    the truth is quite otherwise. You never &ldquo;deliver&rdquo; a
                    malefactor to his accuser; for when someone has been wronged, you do not exact
                    the penalty in such a form as the injured party urges upon you in each case. On
                    the contrary, laws were laid down by you before the particular offences were
                    committed, when the future wrongdoer and his victim were equally unknown. What
                    is the effect of these laws? They ensure for every citizen the opportunity of
                    obtaining redress if he is wronged. Therefore when you punish a man who breaks
                    the laws, you are not delivering him over to his accusers; you are strengthening
                    the arm of the law in your own interests. <milestone n="31" unit="section"/>But
                    surely when he says, &ldquo;Demosthenes was insulted,&rdquo; he is met
                    by an argument that is just and impartial and in the interests of all. It was
                    not against the individual named Demosthenes that his brutality was directed on
                    that occasion, but also against your chorus-master; and what that implies you
                    may realize from the following considerations. <milestone n="32" unit="section"
                    />You know of course that of the judges who sit in this court none has the name
                    of Judge, but each has some name of his own. Therefore if a man is guilty of
                    assault or slander against anyone of them in his private capacity, he will stand
                    his trial on an indictment for assault or in a suit for slander; but if he
                    assails him as judge, he will incur total disfranchisement. Why so? Because at
                    once by the mere act he is outraging your laws, your public crown of office, and
                    the name that belongs to the State, for Judge is not a private name but a
                    state-title. <milestone n="33" unit="section"/>In the same way again, if you
                    strike or abuse the Archon when wearing his crown, you are disfranchised; but if
                    you assault him as a private citizen, you are liable to a private suit.
                    Moreover, this is true not only of these officials, but of everyone to whom the
                    State grants the inviolability of a crowned office or of any other honor.
                    Therefore in my case also, if on any other day in the year Meidias had wronged
                    me as a private citizen, he would have had to give me private satisfaction;
                        <milestone n="34" unit="section"/>but if all his outrages are shown to have
                    been aimed at your chorus-master during the holy days of the festival, it is
                    right that he should face public resentment and pay a public penalty. For the
                    chorus master was insulted as well as Demosthenes, and that is a concern of the
                    State, as well as the fact that this occurred on the very days on which the laws
                    expressly forbid it. When you are framing your laws, you must scrutinize their
                    purport; but when you have passed them, you must uphold them and put them in
                    force, for that is required by your oath and by justice as well. <milestone
                        n="35" unit="section"/>You had the law&mdash;an ancient one&mdash;of
                    damage; you had the law of battery and the law of assault. Now if it had been
                    sufficient that those guilty at the Dionysia of any of these offences should be
                    punished according to these laws, there would have been no need for this further
                    law. But it was not sufficient, and the proof of this is that you made a law to
                    protect the sanctity of the god during the Holy Month. If, then, anyone is
                    liable both under those pre-existing laws and under this subsequent one as well
                    as all the rest of the laws, is he for that reason to escape punishment, or
                    should he in fairness suffer a heavier one? I think that it should be the
                    heavier punishment. <milestone n="36" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P"
                        unit="para"/>I have been told that Meidias goes about inquiring and
                    collecting examples of people who have at any time been assaulted, and that
                    these people are going to give evidence and describe their experiences to you;
                    for instance, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, the
                    Chairman for the day who is said to have been struck by Polyzelus in your court,
                    the judge who was lately struck when trying to rescue the flute-girl, and
                    similar cases. He imagines that if he can point to many other victims of serious
                    assault, you will be less indignant at the assault committed upon me! <milestone
                        n="37" unit="section"/>But it seems to me, Athenians, that it would be
                    reasonable for you to do just the reverse, since your duty is to be solicitous
                    for the common good of all. For who of you is unaware that the reason for the
                    frequency of these assaults is the failure to punish the offenders, and that the
                    only way to prevent such assaults in the future is adequately to punish every
                    offender who is caught? Therefore, if it is to your interest to deter others,
                    those cases are an additional reason for punishing Meidias, and punishing him
                    the more severely in proportion to their number and their seriousness; but if
                    you want to encourage him and everybody, you must let him off. <milestone n="38"
                        unit="section"/>&lsqb;Then again we shall find that he has not the same
                    claim to consideration as these others. For in the first case the man who struck
                    the judge had three excuses: he was drunk, he was in love, and he did not know
                    what he was doing in the darkness and the night. Polyzelus again explained that
                    owing to his ungovernable temper he had lost his head when he committed the
                    offence; there was no hostility behind the act and no intention to insult. But
                    Meidias cannot plead any of these excuses, for he was my enemy, and he assaulted
                    me willfully by daylight, and not only on that, but on every occasion he has
                    shown a deliberate intention to insult me. <milestone n="39" unit="section"/>And
                    indeed I can see no comparison between my own conduct and that of those others.
                    In the first case it will be proved that the judge took no thought or concern
                    for you or for the laws, but was privately induced by a sum of money&mdash;I
                    cannot say how much&mdash;to drop his action. In the same way the man who
                    was struck by Polyzelus was privately squared, laughed in his sleeve at you and
                    your laws, and never even prosecuted his assailant. <milestone n="40"
                        unit="section"/>Such statements, then, are quite in point if one wishes to
                    accuse those men today, but as a defence of Meidias against my indictments they
                    are the very last pleas that should be urged. For my conduct was clean contrary
                    to theirs. It will be proved that I never got, or tried to get, any advantage
                    for myself, but religiously observed, and have now restored to your keeping, the
                    task of avenging the laws, the god, and your interests.&rsqb; Do not then
                    allow him to make these statements, or if he persists, do not give him credence
                    as if his plea were just. If he finds that this is your fixed determination, he
                    will have nothing to say, not a word. <milestone n="41" unit="section"/>For what
                    sort of pretext, what decent and moderate excuse, can he show for his conduct?
                    Anger? Possibly that will be his plea. But whereas in cases where a sudden loss
                    of self-control has impelled a man even to inflict a wanton insult, it is open
                    to him to say that he has acted in anger; if, on the other hand, he is detected
                    in a continuous course of law-breaking, spread over many days, surely this is
                    far from a mere fit of anger and he stands convicted of a deliberate policy of
                    insult. <milestone n="42" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Very
                    well; since he has clearly done what I accuse him of, and has done it by way of
                    insult, we must now consider the laws, gentlemen of the jury, for it is in
                    accordance with the laws that you have sworn to give your verdict. Observe,
                    moreover, that the laws treat the willful and insolent transgressors as
                    deserving more resentment and a heavier punishment than other classes of
                    offenders. <milestone n="43" unit="section"/>First then, all the laws of
                    damage&mdash;to take these first&mdash;order the offender to pay the
                    amount twice over if the damage is willful, but only once if it is involuntary.
                    This is reasonable, because, while the injured party is in any case entitled to
                    relief, the law does not ordain that the resentment against the aggressor should
                    be the same, whether his act is voluntary or involuntary. Again, the laws of
                    homicide punish willful murder with death, perpetual exile, and confiscation of
                    goods, but accidental homicide they treat with much consideration and charity.
                        <milestone n="44" unit="section"/>It is not only in these, but in all cases,
                    that the laws may be seen to be severe against premeditated outrages. For how is
                    it that if a man who has lost his case fails to pay, the law thereupon is not
                    content with a private suit for ejectment, but directs the imposition of a
                    further fine to the treasury? Or again, how is it that if a man takes from
                    another by mutual consent a sum of one, two, or ten talents, and then
                    fraudulently withholds it, the State has no concern with him; but if a man,
                    taking something that would merit only a trifling fine, keeps it back by force,
                    then the laws direct the jury to impose an additional fine for the treasury
                    equal to that paid to the private owner? <milestone n="45" unit="section"/>The
                    answer is that the legislator regarded every deed of violence as a public
                    offence, committed against those also who are not directly concerned. For force

                    transaction can right himself privately, but the victim of violence needs relief
                    at the hands of the State. On this principle, for the actual assault the law
                    grants everyone the right to prosecute, but makes over the whole of the fine to
                    the State. The legislator considered that the State, as well as the injured
                    party, was wronged by the author of the outrage, and that his punishment was
                    sufficient compensation for the victim, who ought not to make money for himself
                    out of such wrongs. <milestone n="46" unit="section"/>Indeed he went to such
                    extreme lengths that even if a slave was assaulted, he granted him the same
                    right of bringing a public action. He thought that he ought to look, not at the
                    rank of the sufferer, but at the nature of the act, and when he found the act
                    unjustifiable, he would not give it his sanction either in regard to a slave or
                    in any other case. For nothing, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"

                    many others addressed to our city, and excellent oracles they are. Now what
                    conclusion ought you to draw from them? That while they prescribe the sacrifices
                    to the gods indicated in each oracle, to every oracle that is published they add
                    the injunction to set up dances and to wear garlands after the manner of our
                    ancestors. <milestone n="55" unit="section"/>Therefore in the case of all the
                    choruses that are constituted, together with their chorus-masters, during the
                    days on which we meet in competition, these oracles make it clear that we wear
                    our crowns as your representatives, the winner as well as the one destined to be
                    last of all; it is not until the day of the prize-giving that the victor
                    receives his own special crown. If, then, a man commits a malicious assault on
                    any member or master of these choruses, especially during the actual contest in
                    the sacred precinct of the god, can we deny that he is guilty of impiety?
                        <milestone n="56" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Moreover,
                    you are aware that, although anxious to exclude aliens from the contest, you do
                    not grant unlimited right to any chorus-master to summon for scrutiny any member
                    of a chorus<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">If a chorus-master suspected that a
                        member of a rival chorus was an alien, he must not forcibly eject him nor
                        summon him before the Archon to prove his nationality.</note>; if he summons
                    him, he is fined fifty drachmas, and a thousand drachmas if he orders him to sit
                    among the spectators. What is the object? To protect the crowned official, who
                    is doing public service to the god, from being maliciously summoned or annoyed
                    or insulted on that day. <milestone n="57" unit="section"/>So even the man who

                    shall not he be punished who in contempt of all the laws thus publicly strikes
                    the master of a chorus? Surely it is useless for your laws to be thus well and
                    humanely framed for the protection of the humbler citizen, if those who disobey
                    and flout them are not to incur the resentment of you who are, for the time
                    being, entrusted with their administration. <milestone n="58" unit="section"

                    another point. I shall beg you not to be offended if I mention by name some
                    persons who have fallen into misfortune; for I swear to you that in doing so I
                    have no intention of casting reproach upon any man; I only want to show you how
                    carefully all the rest of you avoid anything like violent or insulting behavior.
                    There is, for instance, Sannio, the trainer of the tragic choruses, who was
                    convicted of shirking military service and so found himself in trouble.
                        <milestone n="59" unit="section"/>After that misfortune he was hired by a
                    chorus-master&mdash;Theozotides, if I am not mistaken&mdash;who was keen
                    to win a victory in the tragedies. Well, at first the rival masters were
                    indignant and threatened to debar him, but when they saw that the theater was
                    full and the crowd assembled for the contest, they hesitated, they gave way, and
                    no one laid a finger on him. One can see that the forbearance which piety
                    inspires in every one of you is such that Sannio has been training choruses ever
                    since, not hindered even by his private enemies, much less by any of the
                    chorus-masters. <milestone n="60" unit="section"/>Then again there is Aristeides
                    of the tribe of Oeneis, who has had a similar misfortune. He is now an old man
                    and perhaps less useful in a chorus, but he was once chorus-leader for his
                    tribe. You know, of course, that if the leader is withdrawn, the rest of the
                    chorus is done for. But in spite of the keen rivalry of many of the
                    chorus-masters, not one of them looked at the possible advantage or ventured to
                    remove him or prevent him from performing. Since this involved laying hands on
                    him, and since he could not be cited before the Archon as if he were an alien
                    whom it was desired to eject, every man shrank from being seen as the personal
                    author of such an outrage. <milestone n="61" unit="section"/>Then is not this,
                    gentlemen of the jury, a shocking and intolerable position? On the one hand,
                    chorus-masters, who think that such a course might bring them victory and who
                    have in many cases spent all their substance on their public services, have
                    never dared to lay hands even on one whom the law permits them to touch, but
                    show such caution, such piety, such moderation that, in spite of their
                    expenditure and their eager competition, they restrain themselves and respect
                    your wishes and your zeal for the festival. Meidias, on the other hand, a
                    private individual who has been put to no expense, just because he has fallen
                    foul of a man whom he hates&mdash;a man, remember, who is spending his money
                    as chorus-master and who has full rights of citizenship&mdash;insults him
                    and strikes him and cares nothing for the festival, for the laws, for your
                    opinion, or for the god's honor. <milestone n="62" unit="section"/><milestone

                    on private or on public grounds, no one has ever been so lost to shame as to
                    venture on such conduct as this. Yet it is said that the famous Iphicrates once
                    had a serious quarrel with Diocles of the Pitthean deme, and, to make matters
                    worse, Iphicrates' brother Teisias happened to be a chorus-master in competition
                    with Diocles. Iphicrates was a wealthy man with many friends and had a high
                    opinion of himself, as a man would naturally have who had earned so many honors
                    and distinctions at your hands; <milestone n="63" unit="section"/>but Iphicrates
                    never went under cover of night to the goldsmiths' shops, he never ripped up the
                    costumes intended for the festival, he never bribed the instructor and hindered
                    the training of the chorus, he never played any of the tricks that Meidias
                    repeatedly practised. No, he submitted to the laws and to the wishes of his
                    fellow-citizens, and patiently witnessed the victory and the crowning of his
                    enemy. And he was right; for he felt that such submission was due to the
                    constitution under which he himself had enjoyed such prosperity. <milestone

                    dispute, has taken his stand beside the umpires while they were being named, or
                    dictated the oath when they were being sworn, or paraded his hostility on any

                    Athenians, are partly excusable in a chorus-master who is carried away by

                    occasion, and to boast one's own power as superior to the laws, that, by Heaven!
                    is cruel and unjust and contrary to your interests. For if each man when he
                    becomes chorus-master could foresee this result: &ldquo;If So-and-so is my

                    and liberal with his money is the reflection that under a democracy each man has
                    his share of just and equal rights. Now I, men of <placeName

                    through this man's acts, and, quite apart from the insults I endured, I was
                    robbed of my victory. Yet I shall prove to all of you beyond a doubt that
                    Meidias, without committing any outrageous offence, without insulting or
                    striking me, had it in his power both to cause me trouble and to display his
                    public spirit to you in a legitimate way, so that I should not be able to open
                    my lips against him. <milestone n="68" unit="section"/>This is what he ought to
                    have done, Athenians. When I offered myself to the Assembly as chorus-master for
                    the tribe of Pandionis, he should have got up and offered himself as a rival
                    master for his own tribe of Erechtheis he should have put himself on equal terms
                    with me and spent his money as I was spending mine and tried in that way to
                    wrest the victory from me; but not even as my rival should he have thus insulted
                    and struck me. <milestone n="69" unit="section"/>As it was, he did not adopt
                    this course, by which he might have done honor to the people, nor did he work
                    off his high spirits in this way. No; I was his target, I who in my madness, men

                    and so brutal that neither the sacred costumes nor the chorus nor at last even
                    my own person was safe from his hands. <milestone n="70" unit="section"

                    contribute to the acquittal of a man who has put no check on his insolence. The
                    latter you should punish as if the results of his conduct had been utterly

                        language is strangely colloquial, not to say slip-shod. Many editors think

                        the sudden drop in style might be effective, if only the meaning were more
                        clear. Did the wrestler kill the prize-fighter or vice versa? The reader

                        unit="section"/>For it was not the blow but the indignity that roused the
                    anger. To be struck is not the serious thing for a free man, serious though it
                    is, but to be struck in wanton insolence. Many things, Athenians, some of which
                    the victim would find it difficult to put into words, may be done by the
                    striker&mdash;by gesture, by look, by tone; when he strikes in wantonness or
                    out of enmity; with the fist or on the cheek. These are the things that provoke
                    men and make them beside themselves, if they are unused to insult. No
                    description, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, can
                    bring the outrage as vividly before the hearers as it appears in truth and

                    />In the name of all the gods, Athenians, I ask you to reflect and calculate in
                    your own minds how much more reason I had to be angry when I suffered so at the
                    hands of Meidias, than Euaeon when he killed Boeotus. Euaeon was struck by an
                    acquaintance, who was drunk at the time, in the presence of six or seven
                    witnesses, who were also acquaintances and might be depended upon to denounce
                    the one for his offence and commend the other if he had patiently restrained his
                    feelings after such an affront, especially as Euaeon had gone to sup at a house
                    which he need never have entered at all. <milestone n="74" unit="section"/>But I
                    was assaulted by a personal enemy early in the day, when he was sober, prompted
                    by insolence, not by wine, in the presence of many foreigners as well as
                    citizens, and above all in a temple which I was strictly obliged to enter by
                    virtue of my office. And, Athenians, I consider that I was prudent, or rather
                    happily inspired, when I submitted at the time and was not impelled to any
                    irremediable action; though I fully sympathize with Euaeon and anyone else who,
                    when provoked, takes the law into his own hands. <milestone n="75"

                    no recourse to tears or supplications and made no effort, small or great, to win
                    the favour of his judges. Let us assume, then, that the judges who condemned him
                    did so, not because he retaliated, but because he did it in such a way as to
                    kill the aggressor, while the judges who acquitted him allowed even this licence
                    of revenge to a man who had suffered an outrage on his person. <milestone n="76"

                    think that you should set up a precedent for all to follow, that no one who
                    wantonly assaults and outrages another should be punished by the victim himself
                    in hot blood, but must be brought into your court, because it is you who confirm

                    first they forced the doors of the apartments, assuming that these became their

                    of their expressions&mdash;and they uttered unrestrained abuse of my mother

                    proceeded to deeds, and they were going to drop the lawsuits, claiming them as

                    actually able to recover, but all that I knew I had been robbed of; so I gave
                    them twenty minas, the sum which they had paid for the performance of their
                    trierarchy by deputy. Such was the scandalous treatment that I received at their

                    contrary to all the laws, because Meidias had not appended the name of a single
                    witness to the summons; he denounces Strato in his absence and in the absence of
                    witnesses, and gets him struck off the roll of arbitrators and disfranchised.
                    And so a citizen of <placeName key="tgn,7001393">Athens</placeName>, because
                    Meidias lost his suit by default, has been deprived of all his civic rights, and
                    has been irrevocably disfranchised; and it is unsafe for him to bring an action
                    against Meidias when wronged, or to act as arbitrator for him, or even, it
                    seems, to walk the same street with him. <milestone n="88" unit="section"
                    />&lsqb;Now you must consider the transaction from this point of view.
                    Estimate what loss Meidias must have suffered before he could plan such a dire
                    revenge against a fellow-citizen; and if it was something really terrible and
                    overwhelming, he may be forgiven, but if it was nothing of the sort, mark the
                    insolent brutality with which he treats all whom he comes across. Well, what
                    loss has he suffered? He was cast, you reply, in a big lawsuit, so big that he
                    has lost all his property. <milestone n="89" unit="section"/>But the lawsuit
                    only involved a thousand drachmas. True, you will say; but the galling thing is
                    to be made to pay unfairly, and it was the unfairness of it that caused him to
                    let the day of payment pass unnoticed.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">This, as
                        the scholiast remarks, seems to be obscure. The rankling injustice would be
                        more likely to keep his memory active.</note> But he noticed his mistake the
                    same day, which is the strongest possible proof that <persName><surname>Strato</surname></persName> had done him no wrong; and he has not
                    yet paid a single drachma. But of that later. <milestone n="90" unit="section"
                    />But of course he could have moved for a fresh trial on the ground of nullity,
                    and so made me the object of his litigation as at the first. But no; that was
                    not his game. To save him from defending a suit in which the penalty was fixed
                    by law at ten minas&mdash;the suit in which he neglected to
                    apppear&mdash;to save him from paying the penalty if guilty or if innocent,
                    a citizen of <placeName key="tgn,7001393">Athens</placeName> must needs be
                    disfranchised, and must obtain neither pardon nor right of defence nor any sort
                    of equitable treatment, privileges extended even to those whose guilt is
                    established. <milestone n="91" unit="section"/>But now that he has disfranchised
                    the man he wanted to, and you have indulged him in this; now that he has sated
                    that shameless temper that prompted him to this course, has he finished the
                    business? Has he paid the fine, to escape which he ruined the poor fellow? Not a
                    brass farthing of it to this day! He submits rather to be the defendant in an
                    action for ejectment. So the one man is disfranchised and ruined on a side
                    issue; the other is unscathed and is playing havoc with the laws, the
                    arbitrators, and everything else that he pleases. <milestone n="92"
                        unit="section"/>Moreover, he has secured the validity of the award against
                    the arbitrator, which he maneuvered to get without serving a summons, while the
                    suit which he lost to me, wittingly and after due summons, this he renders
                    invalid.&rsqb; Yet if such is the vengeance that he claims from arbitrators
                    who have given judgement against him by default, what vengeance ought you to
                    wreak on a man who openly and wantonly transgresses your laws? &lsqb;For if
                    disfranchisement and loss of all legal and civil rights is a fitting punishment
                    for that other offence, death seems an inadequate one for this reckless

                    him for the sake of those resources; for to allow such a reckless and abominable

                    and regaining his civil rights; he has been disfranchised absolutely, at one

                    him for any other purpose than to have this notice posted up before the Tribal
                    Heroes for all men to read, &ldquo;Euctemon of the Lusian deme has indicted

                    think he would have been delighted, if it had been in order, to add that Meidias
                    had hired him to indict me. But I pass that over, because Euctemon, having
                    disfranchised himself by failing to follow up the charge, has given me all the
                    satisfaction that I require. <milestone n="104" unit="section"/>But I will now
                    relate a serious act of cruelty committed by him, men of <placeName

                    merely a personal wrong but a public sacrilege. For when a grave criminal charge
                    was hanging over that unlucky wretch, Aristarchus, the son of Moschus, at first,
                    Athenians, Meidias went round the Market-place and ventured to spread impious
                    and atrocious statements about me to the effect that I was the author of the
                    deed; next, when this device failed, he went to the relations of the dead man,
                    who were bringing the charge of murder against Aristarchus, and offered them
                    money if they would accuse me of the crime. He let neither religion nor piety
                    nor any other consideration stand in the way of this wild proposal: he shrank
                    from nothing. <milestone n="105" unit="section"/>Nay, he was not ashamed to look
                    even that audience in the face and bring such a terrible calamity upon an
                    innocent man; but having set one goal before him, to ruin me by every means in
                    his power, he thought himself bound to leave no stone unturned, as if it were
                    only right that when any man, having been insulted by him, claimed redress and
                    refused to keep silence, he should be removed by banishment without a chance of
                    escape, should even find himself convicted of desertion, should defend himself
                    on a capital charge, and should be in imminent danger of crucifixion. Yet when
                    Meidias is proved guilty of all this, as well as of his insults when I was
                    chorus-master, what leniency, what compassion shall he deserve at your hands?
                        <milestone n="106" unit="section"/>My own opinion, men of <placeName

                    my murderer; that while at the Dionysia his outrages were confined to my
                    equipment, my person, and my expenditure, his subsequent course of action shows
                    that they were aimed at everything else that is mine, my citizenship, my family,
                    my privileges, my hopes. Had a single one of his machinations succeeded, I
                    should have been robbed of all that I had, even of the right to be buried in the

                    when outraged by Meidias in defiance of all the laws, then it will be best for

                    instead of making amends and repenting of the evil, should afterwards add more

                    the whole business. <milestone n="111" unit="section"/>Lastly, when I was made
                    senator by lot, he denounced me at the scrutiny, and the business proved a very
                    real danger for me; for instead of getting compensation for the injuries I had
                    suffered, I was in danger of being punished for acts with which I had no
                    concern. Having such grievances and being persecuted in the way that I have just
                    described to you, but at the same time being neither quite friendless nor

                    Council was in session and was investigating the murder, Meidias came in and
                    cried, &ldquo;Don't you know the facts of the case, Councillors? Are you

                    though up till then he had been as intimate with him as anyone could be, and
                    though Aristarchus in the day of his prosperity had often importuned me to
                    settle my suit with Meidias out of court. Now if he said this to the Council,
                    believing that Aristarchus had actually committed the crime which has since
                    proved his ruin, and trusting to the tale told by his accusers, yet even so the

                    condoned. But if it shall appear that he chatted familiarly under the same roof
                    with Aristarchus, as if he were perfectly innocent, and then uttered those

                    speech in the Council in which he had called Aristarchus a murderer and said the

                    the troop and saying that its dispatch was a scandal to the city. In connection
                    with that, you remember too the abuse that he heaped on Cratinus, who is, I
                    understand, going to support him in the present case. Now if he provoked such
                    serious but groundless quarrels with so many citizens at once, what degree of
                    wickedness and recklessness may we expect from him now? <milestone n="133"

                    the greater scandal to the city&mdash;the men who crossed to <placeName
                        key="perseus,Chalcis">Chalcis</placeName> in due order, and with the
                    equipment proper to those who were to take the field against the enemy and to
                    join forces with our allies, or you, who, when lots were drawn for the
                    expedition, prayed that you might draw a blank, who never donned your cuirass,
                    who rode on a saddle with silver trappings, imported from <placeName
                        key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName>, taking with you your shawls and
                    goblets and wine-jars, which were confiscated by the customs? We of the infantry
                    learned this by report, for we had not crossed at the same point as the cavalry.
                        <milestone n="134" unit="section"/>And then, because Archetion or someone
                    chaffed you on the subject, must you annoy them all?&rsqb; If you did what
                    your fellow-troopers say you did, Meidias, and what you complain of them for
                    saying, then you deserved their reproaches, because you were bringing harm and
                    disgrace both on them and on these jurymen here and on all the city. But if you
                    did not do it and it was all a fabrication, and if the rest of the soldiers,
                    instead of reproving the slanderers, chuckled over you, it only shows that from
                    your general manner of life they thought that such a story exactly fitted you.
                    It was yourself, then, that you ought to have kept more under control, instead
                    of accusing the others. <milestone n="135" unit="section"/>But you threaten all,
                    you bully all. You insist that everyone else shall consult your wishes; you do
                    not your self consult how to avoid annoying others. Yes, and what seems to me
                    the most damning proof of your audacity is this: you come forward, you shameless
                    ruffian, and include all these men in one sweeping accusation. Anyone else would
                    have shuddered at the thought of doing such a thing. <milestone n="136"

                    all other trials the defendants are charged with one or two offences only, but
                    they can rely on any number of appeals, such as these: &ldquo;Does anyone in
                    court know me to be capable of this? Who among you has ever seen me commit these
                    offences? No one. The plaintiffs are libelling me out of spite. I am the victim
                    of false testimony,&rdquo; and so on. But with Meidias the case is just the
                    reverse; <milestone n="137" unit="section"/>for I suppose you all know his way
                    of life, his arrogance and his superciliousness, and I even suspect that some
                    have long marvelled at things which they know themselves, but have not heard
                    from my lips today. But I note that many of his victims are reluctant to
                    disclose in evidence all that they have suffered, because they realize his
                    violence and his persistence and the extent of those resources which make him so
                    powerful and so dreaded, despicable though he is. <milestone n="138"
                        unit="section"/>For a man whose wickedness and violence are supported by
                    power and wealth is fortified against any sudden attack. So this fellow, if he
                    were deprived of his property, would perhaps discontinue his outrages, or if
                    not, he will be of less account in your courts than the most insignificant
                    criminal; for then he will rail and bluster to deaf ears, and for any act of

                    Timocrates and the ragamuffin Euctemon. Such are the mercenaries that he keeps
                    about him; and there are others besides, an organized gang of witnesses, who do
                    not openly force themselves upon you, but readily give a silent nod of assent to
                    his lies. &lsqb;I do not of course imagine that they make anything out of
                    him, but there are some people, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName>, who are strangely prone to abase themselves towards the
                    wealthy, to attend upon them, and to give witness in their favour.&rsqb;
                        <milestone n="140" unit="section"/>All this, I expect, is alarming for the
                    rest of you as individuals, depending each upon his own resources; and that is
                    why you band yourselves together, so that when you find yourselves individually
                    inferior to others, whether in wealth or in friends or in any other respect, you
                    may together prove stronger than any one of your enemies and so check his

                    not So-and-so, who suffered this or that at my hands, try to obtain redress from
                    me? Or why did not So-and-so?&rdquo;&mdash;naming perhaps another of his
                    victims. But I expect you all know the stock excuses for shirking the duty of
                    self-defence&mdash;want of leisure, a distaste for affairs, inability to

                    such language now; his duty is to prove that he has not done what I have accused
                    him of doing, and if he cannot, then he deserves death all the more. For if he
                    is so powerful that he can act like this and yet prevent you individually from
                    obtaining satisfaction from him, you ought all of you, in common and on behalf
                    of all, now that he is in your grasp, to punish him as the common enemy of the

                    tells us that Alcibiades lived at <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName> in the good old days of her prosperity, and I want you
                    to consider what great public services stand to his credit and how your
                    ancestors dealt with him when he thought fit to behave like a ruffian and a
                    bully. And assuredly it is not from any desire to compare Meidias with
                    Alcibiades that I mention this story. I am not so foolish or infatuated. My
                    object, men of Athens, is that you may know and feel that there is not, and
                    never will be, anything&mdash;not birth, not wealth, not
                    power&mdash;that you, the great mass of citizens, ought to tolerate, if it
                    is coupled with insolence. <milestone n="144" unit="section"/>For Alcibiades,
                    Athenians, was on his father's side one of the Alcmaeonidae, who are said to
                    have been banished by the tyrants because they belonged to the democratic
                    faction, and who, with money borrowed from <placeName key="perseus,Delphi"
                        >Delphi</placeName>, liberated our city, expelling the sons of Peisistratus,
                    and on his mother's side he claimed descent from Hipponicus and that famous
                    house to which the people are indebted for many eminent services. <milestone
                        n="145" unit="section"/>But these were not his only claims, for he had also
                    taken arms in the cause of democracy, twice in <placeName key="tgn,7002673"
                        >Samos</placeName> and a third time in <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName> itself, displaying his patriotism, not by gifts of money
                    or by speeches, but by personal service. He had also to his credit for the
                    Olympian chariot-race and victories there, and we are told that he was regarded
                    as the best general and the ablest speaker of the day. <milestone n="146"
                        unit="section"/>But yet your ancestors, for all these services, would not
                    allow him to insult them. They made him a fugitive and an outlaw, and in the day
                    of Lacedaemonian power they endured the fortification of Decelea, the capture of
                    their fleet, and every kind of loss, because they deemed any involuntary
                    suffering more honorable than a voluntary submission to the tyranny of
                    insolence. <milestone n="147" unit="section"/>Yet what was his insolence
                    compared with what has been proved of Meidias today? He boxed the ears of
                    Taureas, when the latter was chorus-master. Granted; but it was as chorus-master
                    to chorus-master that he did it, and he did not transgress the present law, for
                    it had not yet been made. Another story is that he imprisoned the painter
                    Agatharchus. Yes, but he had caught him in an act of trespass, or so we are
                    told; so that it is unfair to blame him for that. He was one of the mutilators
                    of the Hermae. All acts of sacrilege, I suppose, ought to excite the same
                    indignation, but is not complete destruction of sacred things just as
                    sacrilegious as their mutilation? Well, that is what Meidias has been convicted
                    of. <milestone n="148" unit="section"/>To contrast the two men, let us ask who
                    Meidias is and to whom he displayed his qualities. Do not then imagine that for
                    you, gentlemen, being the descendants of such ancestors, it would be in
                    accordance with justice or piety, to say nothing of honor, if, when you have
                    caught a rascally, violent bully, a mere nobody and son of nobody, you should
                    pronounce him deserving of pardon or pity or favour of any kind. For why should
                    you? Because of his services as general? But not even as a private soldier, much
                    less as a leader of others, is he worth anything at all. For his speeches then?
                    In his public speeches he never yet said a good word of anyone, and he speaks
                    ill of everyone in private. <milestone n="149" unit="section"/>For the sake of
                    his family perhaps? And who of you does not know the mysterious story of his
                    birth&mdash;quite like a melodrama? He was the sport of two opposing
                    circumstances. The real mother who bore him was the most sensible of mortals;
                    his reputed mother who adopted him was the silliest woman in the world. Do you
                    ask why? The one sold him as soon as he was born; the other purchased him, when
                    she might have got a better bargain at the same figure. <milestone n="150"
                        unit="section"/>And yet, though he has thus become the possessor of
                    privileges to which he has no claim, and has found a fatherland which is reputed
                    to be of all states the most firmly based upon its laws, he seems utterly unable
                    to submit to those laws or abide by them. His true, native barbarism and hatred
                    of religion drive him on by force and betray the fact that he treats his present
                    rights as if they were not his own&mdash;as indeed they are not. <milestone
                        n="151" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Such, then, being the
                    events that make up the life of this shameless blackguard, some of his
                    associates came to me, gentlemen of the jury, urging me to retire and drop this
                    action; but finding me unmoved, they did not venture to assert that he was
                    innocent of all these crimes and would not deserve the severest penalty for his
                    deeds. They took this line of argument. &ldquo;He has already been convicted
                    and condemned; what fine do you expect the court to impose on him? Do you not
                    see that he is a rich man and will talk about the equipment of war-galleys and
                    other public services? Then take care that he does not beg himself off by such
                    pleas, and make you his laughingstock, when he pays the State a far less sum
                    than he now offers you.&rdquo; <milestone n="152" unit="section"/>For
                    myself, in the first place, I do not charge you with anything dishonorable, nor
                    do I suppose that you will lay on him a lighter punishment than will effectually
                    check his insolence; and that means, for choice, death, or failing that, at
                    least the confiscation of all his property. In the next place, my own opinion
                    about his trierarchies and public services and pleas of that sort is this.
                        <milestone n="153" unit="section"/>If, men of <placeName
                        key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, public service consists in saying
                    to you at all the meetings of the Assembly and on every possible occasion,
                    &ldquo;We are the men who perform the public services; we are those who
                    advance your tax-money; we are the capitalists&rdquo;&mdash;if that is
                    all it means, then I confess that Meidias has shown himself the most
                    distinguished citizen of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>; for
                    he bores us at every Assembly by these tasteless and tactless boasts. <milestone
                        n="154" unit="section"/>But if you want to find out how he really performs
                    his services, I will tell you; and please mark with what fairness I shall test
                    him, for I will compare him with myself. This man, Athenians, who is about fifty
                    years old or only a trifle less, has not performed more public services than I,
                    who am only two and thirty. Moreover I, as soon as I had reached man's estate,
                    undertook the trierarchy in the days when only two shared the duty, and when we
                    paid all the expenses from our own purses and provided the crews ourselves.
                        <milestone n="155" unit="section"/>Meidias, when he was of my present age,
                    had not yet begun to perform services; he has only put his hand to the task
                    since you made twelve hundred citizens joint contributors, from whom such men as
                    Meidias exact a talent and then contract for the equipment of the war-galley at
                    the same price. After this the State provides the crews and furnishes the
                    tackle; so that some of them succeed in really spending nothing at all and by
                    pretending to have performed one public service enjoy exemption from the rest.
                        <milestone n="156" unit="section"/>Well, is there anything else? He has once
                    equipped a tragic chorus; I have furnished a band of male flute-players; and
                    everyone knows that the latter involves much greater expense than the former.
                    Moreover my service is voluntary; his was only undertaken after a challenge to
                    exchange property. Therefore no one could justly allow him any credit for it.
                    What else? I have feasted my tribe and equipped a chorus for the Panathenaea; he
                    has done neither. <milestone n="157" unit="section"/>I was chairman of one of
                    the tax-syndicates<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">See note on <bibl

                    same share as Phormio, Lysitheides, Callaeschrus, and the richest citizens, not
                    from my actual property, of which my guardians had robbed me, but from the
                    estimated wealth which my father had left and which I was entitled to inherit
                    when I had passed the scrutiny for citizenship. That is how I have borne myself
                    towards you; but how has Meidias? To this day he has never been chairman of a
                    syndicate, though no one has ever robbed him of any part of his inheritance and
                    he has received from his father a large property. <milestone n="158"
                        unit="section"/>In what, then, consist his splendor, his public services and
                    his lordly expenditure? I cannot for the life of me see, unless one fixes one's
                    attention on these facts. He has built at <placeName key="perseus,Eleusis"
                        >Eleusis</placeName> a mansion huge enough to overshadow his neighbors; he
                    drives his wife to the Mysteries, or anywhere else that he wishes, with a pair
                    of greys from <placeName key="tgn,7011104">Sicyon</placeName>; he swaggers about
                    the market-place with three or four henchmen in attendance, describing beakers
                    and drinking-horns and cups loud enough for the passers-by to hear. <milestone
                        n="159" unit="section"/>I do not see how the mass of Athenians are benefited
                    by all the wealth that Meidias retains for private luxury and superfluous
                    display; I do see that his insolence, fostered by his wealth, affects many of us
                    ordinary folk. You ought not to show respect and admiration for such things on
                    every occasion, nor judge a man's public spirit by such tests as

                    maid-servants or handsome furniture, but whether his splendor and public spirit
                    are displayed in those things in which the majority of you can share. There you
                    will find Meidias absolutely wanting. <milestone n="160" unit="section"
                        /><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>But, mark you, he gave us a war-galley! I
                    am sure he will brag about that vessel. &ldquo;I,&rdquo; he will say,
                    &ldquo;presented you with a trireme.&rdquo; Now this is how you must
                    deal with him. If, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, he
                    gave it from patriotic motives, be duly grateful and pay him the thanks that
                    such a gift deserves. But do not give him a chance to air his insolence; that
                    must not be conceded as the price of any act or deed. If, on the other hand, it
                    is proved that his motive was cowardice and malingering, do not be led astray.
                    How then will you know? This too I will explain. I will tell you the story from
                    the start: it is not a long one. <milestone n="161" unit="section"/>Voluntary
                    gifts were first introduced at <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName> for the expedition to <placeName key="tgn,7002677"
                        >Euboea</placeName>. Meidias was not one of those volunteers, but I was, and
                    my colleague was Philinus, the son of Nicostratus. There was a second call
                    subsequently for <placeName key="perseus,Olynthus">Olynthus</placeName>. Meidias
                    was not one of those volunteers either. Yet surely the public-spirited man ought
                    to be found at his post on every occasion. We have now these voluntary gifts for
                    the third time, and this time he did make an offer. But how? Though present in
                    the Council when the gifts were being received, he made no offer then.
                        <milestone n="162" unit="section"/>But when it was announced that the troops
                    at <placeName key="perseus,Tamynae">Tamynae</placeName> were blockaded, and when
                    the Council carried a preliminary decree to dispatch the rest of the cavalry, to
                    which he belonged, then, alarmed at the prospect of this campaign, he came
                    forward with a voluntary gift at the next meeting of the Assembly, even before
                    the Committee could take their seats. What makes it clear, beyond all
                    possibility of doubt, that his motive was not public spirit but the desire to
                    shirk the campaign? His subsequent proceedings. <milestone n="163"
                        unit="section"/>For in the first place, when it appeared, as the meeting
                    proceeded and speeches were made, that the services of the cavalry were not now
                    required, but that the proposed expedition had fallen through, he never set foot
                    on the ship he had presented, but dispatched a resident alien, the Egyptian
                    Pamphilus, while he himself stayed at home and behaved at the Dionysia in the
                    way that is the matter of the present trial. <milestone n="164" unit="section"
                    />Next, when the general, Phocion, summoned the cavalry from Argura to take
                    their turn of service, and the trickery of Meidias was exposed, then this
                    damnable coward quitted that post and hurried to his ship and never went out
                    with the cavalry whom he claimed to command here at home. But if there had been
                    any risk at sea, he would certainly have hastened to land. <milestone n="165"
                        unit="section"/>Not so behaved Niceratus, the beloved son of Nicias, though
                    he was himself physically an utter weakling. Not so behaved Euctemon, the son of
                    Aesion, nor Euthydemus, the son of Stratocles. Each of these men had made the
                    gift of a war-galley, yet did not run away from the campaign in this way. Each,
                    as an act of grace and a free gift, supplied the State with a ship ready for
                    sea, and where the law of the State assigned them their posts, there each
                    insisted on giving his personal service. <milestone n="166" unit="section"/>But
                    not so our cavalry-officer Meidias. He deserted the post assigned him by the
                    laws, and this, which is a punishable offence against the State, he is prepared
                    to count as a meritorious service. Yet, good heavens! what name best befits such
                    a trierarchy as his? Shall we call it patriotism, or tax-jobbing,
                    two-per-cent-collecting, desertion, malingering, and everything of that sort?
                    Unable in any other way to get himself exempt from service with the cavalry,
                    Meidias has invented this new-fangled cavalry-collectorship.<note resp="Loeb"

                    command has proved, not a public service, but a lucrative job for this
                    detestable creature. However, to prove to you the truth of my statements, though
                    most of the facts are known to you, I will nevertheless call witnesses.

                    enemies whenever he likes and in whatever way he can. For not even Harmodius and
                    Aristogeiton were so privileged, though indeed they received from you the

                    men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, to name those who
                    have been condemned by you, after an adverse vote of the Assembly, for violating
                    the festival, and to explain what some of them had done to incur your anger, so
                    that you may compare their guilt with that of Meidias. First of all then, to
                    begin with the most recent condemnation, the Assembly gave its verdict against
                    Euandrus of <placeName key="tgn,5004258">Thespiae</placeName> for profanation of
                    the Mysteries on the charge of Menippus, a fellow from <placeName
                        key="tgn,7002358">Caria</placeName>. The law concerning the Mysteries is
                    identical with that concerning the Dionysia, and it was enacted later.
                        <milestone n="176" unit="section"/>Well, Athenians, what had Euandrus done
                    to deserve your condemnation? He had won a commercial suit against Menippus, but
                    being, as he alleged, unable to catch him sooner, he had arrested him while he
                    was staying here for the Mysteries. You condemned him for that alone, and there
                    were no aggravating circumstances. When he came before the court, you were
                    inclined to punish him with death, and when his accuser was induced to relent,
                    you compelled Euandrus to refund the damages, amounting to two talents, which he
                    had won in the former action, and you also made him compensate the fellow for
                    the loss that he had sustained, on his own calculation, by staying here in
                    deference to your preliminary verdict. <milestone n="177" unit="section"/>There
                    you have one case of a man, in a merely private matter, with no added
                    circumstances of insolence, paying so heavy a penalty for a breach of the law.
                    With good reason; because that is what you are here to guard&mdash;the laws
                    and your oath. That is what you who serve on any jury hold as a trust from the
                    rest of the citizens, a trust which must be maintained inviolate in the
                    interests of all who appeal to you with justice on their side. <milestone

                    who in your opinion had profaned the Dionysia, and although he was actually
                    sitting as assessor to his son, who was Archon, you condemned him, because in
                    ejecting from the theater a man who was taking a wrong seat, he laid a hand on
                    him. That man was the father of the highly respected Charicleides, at that time
                    archon. <milestone n="179" unit="section"/>Yes, and you thought that his accuser
                    had a strong case when he said, &ldquo;If I was taking a wrong seat, fellow,
                    if as you assert I was disregarding the notices, what authority do the laws
                    confer on you or even on the archon himself? The authority to bid the attendants
                    remove me, but not to strike me yourself. If I still refuse to go, you may
                    impose a fine; anything rather than touch me with your own hand; for the laws
                    have taken every precaution to save a citizen from being insulted in his own
                    person.&rdquo; That was his argument. You gave your votes, but the accuser
                    died before he could bring the case before a jury. <milestone n="180"
                        unit="section"/>Then another man, Ctesicles, was unanimously condemned by
                    the Assembly for profaning the festival, and when he came before you, you
                    sentenced him to death, because he carried a leathern lash in the procession
                    and, being drunk, struck with it a personal enemy of his. It was thought that
                    insolence, not drink, prompted the stroke, and that he seized the excuse of the
                    procession and his own drunkenness to commit the offence of treating freemen
                    like slaves. <milestone n="181" unit="section"/>Now I am certain, men of

                    these men, of whom one, as I have shown, forfeited the damages he had already
                    received, while the other was actually punished with death. For Meidias, not
                    being in a procession, not having won a suit, not acting as assessor, having in
                    fact no other motive than insolence, behaved worse than any of them. About them
                    I will say no more; <milestone n="182" unit="section"/>but Pyrrhus, men of

                    your court and put to death. And yet it was from poverty, not from insolence,
                    that he tried to get the juryman's fee. And I could mention many others who were
                    put to death or disfranchised for far slighter offences than those of Meidias.
                    You yourselves, Athenians, fined Smicrus ten talents and Sciton a similar sum,
                    because he was adjudged to be proposing unconstitutional measures; you had no
                    pity for their children or friends and relations, or for any of those who

                    mere words and terms can be so galling to the great mass of you as the conduct
                    of a man who persistently insults any citizen who crosses his path. Beware,
                    Athenians, of bearing this testimony against yourselves, that if you detect a
                    man of the middle class or a friend of the people committing an offence, you
                    will neither pity nor reprieve him, but will punish him with death or
                    disfranchisement, while you are ready to pardon the insolence of a rich man.
                    Spare us that injustice, and show your indignation impartially against all

                    briefly before I sit down. The leniency of your disposition, men of <placeName
                        key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, is a great asset and advantage to
                    all wrongdoers. Give me, then, your attention while I show that you have no
                    right to admit Meidias to the least share in that advantage. My view is that all
                    men during their lives pay contributions to their own fortunes,<note resp="Loeb"
                        anchored="yes">See note on <bibl n="Dem. 21.101">Dem. 21.101</bibl>.</note>
                    not only those which are actually collected and paid in, but others also.
                        <milestone n="185" unit="section"/>For instance, one of us is moderate,
                    kindly disposed and merciful: he deserves to receive an equivalent return from
                    all, if he ever falls into want or distress. Yonder is another, who is shameless
                    and insulting, treating others as if they were beggars, the scum of the earth,
                    mere nobodies: he deserves to be paid with the same measure that he has meted to
                    others. If you will consent to look at it in a true light, you will find that
                    this, and not the former, is the kind of contribution that Meidias has made.
                        <milestone n="186" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Now I know
                    that he will set up a wail, with his children grouped about him, and will make a
                    long and humble appeal, weeping and making himself as pitiable a figure as he
                    can. But the more he humiliates himself, Athenians, the more he deserves your
                    hatred. Why so? If in his past life he was so brutal and violent because it was
                    impossible for him to be humble, it would be right to abate some of your anger
                    as a concession to his natural temper and to the destiny that made him the man
                    he is; but if he knows how to behave discreetly when he likes, but has
                    deliberately chosen the opposite line of conduct, it is surely obvious that, if
                    he slips through your fingers now, he will once more prove himself the man you
                    know so well. <milestone n="187" unit="section"/>Pay no attention to him; do not
                    let the present crisis in his affairs, expressly invented by him, carry more
                    weight and influence with you than the whole course of his life, of which you
                    have direct knowledge. I have no children to pose before you, while I weep and
                    wail over them for the insults I have received. For that reason shall I, the
                    victim, be of less account in your court than the perpetrator of the wrong? It
                    must not be. <milestone n="188" unit="section"/>When Meidias, with his children
                    round him, calls you to cast your votes for them, then you must imagine that I
                    am standing here with the laws by my side and the oath that you have sworn,
                    demanding and imploring each of you to vote for them. It is in every way more
                    just that you should side with the laws than with this man. The laws, Athenians,
                    you have sworn to obey; through the laws you enjoy your equal rights; to the
                    laws you owe every blessing that is yours&mdash;not to Meidias nor to the
                    children of Meidias. <milestone n="189" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P"
                        unit="para"/>Perhaps he will say of me, &ldquo;This man is an
                    orator.&rdquo; If an orator is one who offers you such counsel as he thinks
                    expedient for you, yet stops short of pestering or bullying you, then for my
                    part I would neither shun nor disclaim that title. But if by orator he means one
                    of those speakers such as you and I so often see, men who have shamelessly
                    enriched themselves at your expense, I cannot be one, for I have never received
                    a penny from you and I have spent upon you all but a trifle of my fortune. Yet
                    even if I were the most unscrupulous of that gang, I ought rather to be punished
                    according to the laws than insulted in the performance of a public service.
                        <milestone n="190" unit="section"/>Then again, none of these orators
                    supports me in this trial; nor do I blame them, for I have never said a word in
                    public in support of one of them. I make it a fixed rule to take my own line,
                    speaking and acting in whatever way I believe to be for your advantage. But you
                    will see very soon that Meidias has all the orators in turn ranged on his side.
                    Yet is it fair in him to brand me with the reproach of that title and then to
                    depend on these very men to rescue him? <milestone n="191" unit="section"
                        /><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Perhaps too he will say something of this
                    sort; that my present speech is all carefully thought out and prepared. I admit,
                    Athenians, that I have thought it out, and I should not dream of denying it;
                    yes, and I have spent all possible care on it. I should be a poor creature if
                    all my wrongs, past and present, left me careless of what I was going to say to
                    you about them. Yet the real composer of my speech is Meidias. <milestone
                        n="192" unit="section"/>The man who has furnished the facts with which the
                    speeches deal ought in strict justice to bear that responsibility, and not the
                    man who has devoted thought and care to lay an honest case before you today.
                    That is what I am doing, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName>; to that I plead guilty. As for Meidias, he has probably
                    never in his life troubled himself about honesty, for if it had entered his head
                    even for a moment to consider such a thing, he would not have missed it so
                    completely in practice. <milestone n="193" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P"
                        unit="para"/>Again, I expect that he will not shrink from vilifying the
                    people and the Assembly, but will repeat what he had the effrontery to say when
                    the plaint was first brought in: that the meeting was composed of men who had
                    stayed at home when they ought to have gone to the front and who had left their
                    posts unguarded, and that he was condemned by the votes of chorus-men and aliens
                    and the like. <milestone n="194" unit="section"/>As those of you who were
                    present know, gentlemen, he had risen on that occasion to such a height of
                    bravado and impudence that, by abusing and threatening and turning his glance to
                    any quarter of the Assembly that was inclined to be obstreperous, he thought he
                    could browbeat the whole body of citizens. That, I think, must surely make his
                    tears today seem ridiculous. Execrable wretch, what have you to say? <milestone
                        n="195" unit="section"/>Will you claim pity for your children and yourself
                    or a kindly interest in your fortunes from these men whom you have already
                    insulted publicly? Are you alone of living men privileged to be in your daily
                    life so notoriously possessed of the demon of arrogance that even those who have
                    no dealings with you are exasperated by your assurance, your tones and gestures,
                    your parasites, your wealth and your insolence; and then, the instant you are
                    put on your trial are you to be pitied? <milestone n="196" unit="section"/>It
                    would be indeed a great method that you have devised, or, rather, a great trick,
                    if you could in so short a time make yourself the object of two contradictory
                    sentiments, rousing resentment by your way of life and compassion by your
                    mummeries. You have no conceivable claim to compassion; no, not for an instant.
                    On the contrary, hatred, resentment and wrath&mdash;those are what your
                    conduct calls for. But let me come back to my point, that he intends to arraign
                    the people and the Assembly. <milestone n="197" unit="section"/>Now when he does
                    so, just reflect, gentlemen of the jury, that this same man brought accusations
                    against the cavalry who had served with him, coming into the Assembly after they
                    had sailed for <placeName key="perseus,Olynthus">Olynthus</placeName>; and now
                    once more, having stayed at home, he will address his denunciation of the people
                    to the men who were then away on service. Are you, then, prepared to admit that
                    you, whether at home or on service, are what Meidias proclaims you to be, or on
                    the contrary that he is, and always has been, an unhallowed ruffian? That is my
                    own opinion of him; &lsqb;for how else are we to describe a creature whom
                    his own troopers, his brother-officers and his friends cannot stomach?
                        <milestone n="198" unit="section"/>I swear solemnly by Zeus, by Apollo, and
                    by Athena&mdash;for I will speak out, whatever the result may
                    be&mdash;for when this man was going about, trumping up the story that I had
                    abandoned the prosecution, I observed signs of disgust even among his ardent
                    supporters. And by heaven! they had some excuse, for there is no putting up with
                    the fellow; he claims to be the only rich man and the only man who knows how to
                    speak; all others are in his opinion outcasts, beggars, below the rank of men.
                        <milestone n="199" unit="section"/>Since he stands on such an eminence of
                    pride, what do you think he will do, if he escapes now? I will tell you how you
                    may know it; you have only to observe the signs that followed the adverse
                    vote.&rsqb; For who is there that, if an adverse vote had been recorded, and
                    that on a charge of profaning the feast, even if there had been no further suit
                    pending and no danger ahead,&mdash;who is there, I say, that would not have
                    made that a reason for effacing himself and behaving decently, at any rate until
                    the time of the trial, if not for ever after? Anyone else would have acted so.
                    But not Meidias. <milestone n="200" unit="section"/>From that day onwards he has
                    been talking, railing, and bellowing. Is there an election on? Meidias of
                    Anagyrus is a candidate. He is the accredited agent of Plutarchus; he knows all
                    the secrets; the city cannot hold him. His object in all this is obvious;he
                    wants to proclaim that &ldquo;I am not a pin the worse for the vote of the
                    people: I have no fears or misgivings about the pending action.&rdquo;
                        <milestone n="201" unit="section"/>Now a man who thinks it degrading to show
                    any fear of you, Athenians, and a dashing thing to snap his fingers at you, does
                    not such a man deserve death ten times over? &lsqb;He really believes that
                    you will have no hold over him. Rich, arrogant, haughty, loud-voiced, violent,
                    shameless, where will you catch him if he gives you the slip now?&rsqb;
                        <milestone n="202" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>But in my
                    opinion, if for nothing else, yet for those harangues that he delivers at every
                    opportunity and for the occasions that he chooses for them, he would deserve the
                    severest penalty. For of course you know that if any welcome news is brought to
                    the city, such as we all rejoice to hear, Meidias has never on any of those
                    occasions been found in the ranks of those who share in the public satisfaction
                    or the public rejoicings; <milestone n="203" unit="section"/>but if it is
                    something untoward, something that no one else would wish to hear, he is the
                    first to jump up at once and harangue the people, making the utmost of his
                    opportunity and enjoying the silence by which you show your distress at what has
                    happened. &ldquo;Why, that is the sort of men you Athenians are. You do not
                    serve abroad; you see no need to pay your property-tax. And then do you wonder
                    that your affairs go wrong? Do you think I am going to pay my property-tax and
                    you spend the money? Do you think I am going to fit out war-galleys and you
                    decline to embark in them?&rdquo; <milestone n="204" unit="section"/>That is
                    how he insults you, seizing the chance to void the rancor and venom that he
                    secretes in his heart against the masses, as he moves about among you. Now is
                    the chance for you, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>,
                    now when he comes with his humbug and chicanery, with his lamentations, tears
                    and prayers, to throw this answer in his teeth. &ldquo;Yes, and that is the
                    sort of man you are, Meidias. You are a bully; you cannot keep your hands to
                    yourself. Then can you wonder if your evil deeds bring you to an evil end? Do
                    you think that we shall submit to you and you shall go on beating us? That we
                    shall acquit you and you shall never desist?&rdquo; <milestone n="205"
                        unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>As for the speakers who will
                    support him, their object, I swear, is not so much to oblige him as to insult
                    me, owing to the personal quarrel which that man there<note resp="Loeb"

                    He insists that it is so, whether I admit it or not; but he is wrong. Too much
                    success is apt sometimes to make people overbearing. For when I, after all that
                    I have suffered, do not admit that he is my enemy, while he will not accept my
                    disclaimer, but even confronts me in another's quarrel, and is prepared now to
                    mount the platform and demand that I shall even forfeit my claim to that
                    protection which the laws afford to all, is it not clear that he has grown
                    overbearing and is too powerful to suit the interests of each one of us?
                        <milestone n="206" unit="section"/>Furthermore, Athenians, Eubulus was in
                    his seat in the theater when the people gave their vote against Meidias, and
                    yet, as you know, he never stood up when called upon by name, though Meidias
                    begged and implored him to do so. Yet if he thought that the plaint had been
                    brought against an innocent man, that was the moment to help him by his
                    testimony, if he was really his friend;but if he withheld his support then,
                    because he had pronounced him guilty, but is now going to ask for his acquittal,
                    because he has fallen foul of me, it is not well that you should humor him.
                        <milestone n="207" unit="section"/>In a democracy there must never be a
                    citizen so powerful that his support can ensure that the one party submits to
                    outrages and the other escapes punishment. But if you are anxious to do me an

                    impossible to harm me in that way, it may be taken as a proof of my innocence
                    that you can readily censure others, but find no ground of censure in me.

                    beggars, and if he is stripped of the superfluous wealth that incites him to
                    such insolence. Surely such men have no right to ask of you, &ldquo;Do not

                    of Meidias and from the impossibility of his undoing any of his acts.

                    as long beforehand as possible. I perhaps am hated by Meidias, and each of you

                    power of doing to each of you what this man has done to me? I should think not

                    two hundred of you or a thousand or any other number, you would find that it is

                    earliest prime of manhood; it is due to no cause of that sort but simply to the

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/>Gentlemen of the jury, Euctemon finding himself
                    wronged by Androtion, thinks it his duty to obtain satisfaction for himself and
                    at the same time to up hold the constitution; and that is what I also shall
                    essay to do, if I am equal to the task. As a matter of fact the outrages that
                    Euctemon has endured, many and serious and utterly illegal as they were, are
                    slighter than the trouble that Androtion has caused me. Euctemon was the object
                    of a plot to get money out of him and to eject him unfairly from an office of
                    your appointment; but if the charges that Androtion trumped up against me had
                    been accepted in your courts, not a single living man would have opened his door
                    to me, <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>for he accused me of things that anyone
                    would have shrunk from mentioning, unless he were a man of the same stamp as
                    himself, saying that I had killed my own father. He also concocted a public
                    indictment for impiety, not against me directly, but against my uncle, whom he
                    brought to trial, charging him with impiety for associating with me, as though I
                    had committed the alleged acts, and if it had ended in my uncle's conviction,
                    who would have suffered more grievously at the defendant's hands than I? For
                    who, whether friend or stranger, would have consented to have any dealings with
                    me? What state would have admitted within its borders a man deemed guilty of

                    completely that my accuser failed to obtain a fifth of the votes; and upon
                    Androtion I shall endeavor, with your help, to avenge myself today and on every

                    that I might say about private matters; but there are other matters on which you

                    which Euctemon chose to pass over, but which it is better for you to understand,
                    I shall now try to explain briefly. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>If I could
                    see any straightforward defence that he could offer to these charges, I would
                    not make any reference to them; but I am quite certain that he cannot have any
                    simple and honest plea to put forward, but will try to hoodwink you, inventing
                    malicious answers to each charge and so leading you astray. For he is a skillful
                    rhetorician, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, and has
                    devoted all his life to that one study. Therefore, that you may not be deceived
                    and persuaded to vote contrary to the spirit of your oath and to acquit a man
                    whom you have every reason to punish, pray attend to what I shall say, so that
                    when you have heard me, you may have the right reply to every argument that he
                    will advance. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"
                    />There is one plea which he thinks a clever defence of the omission of the
                    preliminary decree. There is a law, he says, that if the Council by its
                    performance of its duties seems to deserve a reward, that reward shall be
                    presented by the people. That question, he says, the chairman of the Assembly
                    put, the people voted, and it was carried. In this case, he says, there is no
                    need of a preliminary decree, because what was done was in accordance with law.
                    But I take the exactly contrary view-and I think you will agree with
                    me&mdash;that the preliminary decrees should only be proposed concerning
                    matters prescribed by the laws, because, where no laws are laid down, surely no
                    proposal whatever is admissible. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>Now he will
                    say that all the Councils that have ever received a reward from you, have
                    received it in this way, and that in no case has a preliminary decree ever been
                    passed. But I think&mdash;or rather, I am certain&mdash;that this
                    statement is untrue. Even if it were absolutely true, yet surely where the law
                    says the opposite, we ought not to transgress the law now because it has often
                    been transgressed before; on the contrary we ought to enforce the observance of
                    the law, beginning with you, Androtion, first. <milestone n="7" unit="section"
                    />You must not tell us that this has often been done before; you must show us
                    that it is right to do it. If the practice has at any time been contrary to the
                    laws and you have only followed precedent, you cannot in fairness escape, but
                    ought all the more to be convicted; for if any of the former delinquents had
                    been condemned, you would never have proposed the resolution, and in the same
                    way, if you are punished now, no one else will propose it in the future.
                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Coming now
                    to the law which explicitly denies to the Council the right to ask a reward, if
                    they have not built the warships, it is worth while to hear the defence that he
                    will set up, and to get a clear view of the shamelessness of his behavior from
                    the arguments that he attempts to use. The law, he says, forbids the Council to
                    ask for the reward, if they have not built the ships. But, he adds, the law
                    nowhere prohibits the Assembly from giving it. &ldquo;If I gave it at their
                    request, my motion was illegal, but if I have never mentioned the ships in the
                    whole of my decree, but give other grounds for granting a crown to the Council,
                    where is the illegality of my motion?&rdquo; <milestone n="9" unit="section"
                    />It is surely not difficult for the jury to find the right answer to this: that
                    in the first place the Committee of the Council and the chairman, who puts these
                    proposals to the vote, duly put the question and called for a show of
                    hands&mdash;&ldquo;those who are of opinion that the Council have
                    deserved a reward, to vote aye; on the contrary, no.&rdquo; Yet surely men
                    who neither ask nor expect a reward should never have put the question at all.

                    brought certain accusations against the Council, the Councillors fairly leaped
                    up on to the platform and begged not to be robbed of their reward. There is no
                    need for me to tell the jury this, for you were present in the Assembly and know
                    what happened there. So when he says that the Council did not ask for it, have
                    that answer ready for him. But I will also prove to you that the people are
                    forbidden by the law to give the reward, if the Council have not built the
                    ships. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>For the law, that the Council should
                    not ask for the reward if they have not built the war ships, was framed in that
                    way, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, to prevent the
                    possibility of the people being influenced or misled. The legislator held that
                    the question should not depend on the abilities of the speakers, but that
                    whatever he could devise that was at once just and expedient for the people,
                    should be fixed by law. &ldquo;You have not built the ships? Then don't ask
                    for the reward.&rdquo; Where the law does not permit the asking, does it not
                    absolutely forbid the giving? <milestone n="12" unit="section"/><milestone
                        ed="P" unit="para"/>Now there is another question, men of <placeName

                    it that when the Council have performed all their other duties satisfactorily,
                    and no one has any complaint to make, yet, if they have not built the ships,
                    they are not allowed to ask for the reward? You will find that this stringent
                    enactment is in the interests of the people. For I suppose no one would deny
                    that all that has happened to our city, in the past or in the present, whether
                    good or otherwise&mdash;I avoid an unpleasant term&mdash;has resulted in
                    the one case from the possession, and in the other from the want, of warships.

                        <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName>, it was because they had
                    the war galleys that they won the sea-fight and saved the city and all their
                    belongings, and made themselves the authors for the rest of the Greeks of many
                    great benefits, of which not even time can ever obliterate the memory.

                    history. But take something that you have all seen. You know that lately you

                    have resulted from our being provided with these ships in sound condition.

                    ships? I will pass over most of them; but in the Decelean war<note resp="Loeb"

                    she did not succumb till her fleet was destroyed. But why need me cite ancient
                    instances? You know how it stood with our city in the last war with the

                    you obtained peace on your own terms. <milestone n="16" unit="section"
                    />Therefore, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, seeing
                    that warships have such weight in either scale, you nave done rightly to set
                    this strict limit to the Council's claim to the reward. For if they should
                    discharge all their other duties satisfactorily, but fail to build these ships,
                    by which we gained our power at the first and by which we retain it today, all
                    their other services are of no avail, for it is the safety of the whole State
                    that must be ensured for the people before every thing. Now the defendant is so
                    obsessed with the idea that he can make any speech or proposal he wishes, that
                    though the Council has discharged its other duties in the way that you have
                    heard, but has not built the warships, he moved to grant them their reward.
                        <milestone n="17" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>That this
                    is not a violation of the law, he could not possibly assert nor could you be
                    brought to believe it. But I understand that he will put before you some such
                    plea as this&mdash;that the Council was not to blame for the shortage of
                    ships, but the treasurer of the shipbuilders, who absconded with two and a half
                    talents, and so the business ended in a fiasco. But I must first express my
                    surprise that he should have demanded a crown for the Council to reward a
                    fiasco. I thought such honors were reserved for successes. Next, I have another
                    consideration to put before you. <milestone n="18" unit="section"/>I submit that
                    it is not fair to combine the two pleas, that the gift was not illegal and that
                    the Council are not responsible for the lack of ships. For if it is right to
                    give them the reward even when they have not built the ships, what need is there
                    to say who is responsible for the omission? But if it is not right, why were the
                    Council any the more entitled to it, because he can point to this or that man as
                    responsible for the shortage? <milestone n="19" unit="section"/>Apart from that,
                    it seems to me that such arguments offer you a choice, whether you think you
                    ought to hear excuses and pleas from men who have done you harm, or whether you
                    ought to have some ships. For if you accept the defendant's plea, it will be
                    clear to every future Council that their business is to find you plausible
                    excuses, not to build you ships, with the result that your money will be spent,
                    but there will be no ships for you. <milestone n="20" unit="section"/>But if, as
                    the law says and as your oath enjoins, you sternly and absolutely reject their
                    excuses, and make it clear that you have withheld the reward because they have
                    not built the ships, then every Council, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName>, will deliver to you the ships duly built, because they
                    will see that in your eyes everything else is of less consequence than the law.
                    Now I shall show you clearly that no other human being is responsible for the
                    shortage of ships; for the Council, having made the law null and void, elected
                    this treasurer themselves.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">The treasurer should

                    regard to the law<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">The little that is known of
                        this law is derived from Aeschines' speech against Timarchus<bibl

                    make out that we are insulting him and attacking him with baseless calumnies. He
                    says too that if we believed the charges true, we ought to have faced him in the
                    Court of the Thesmothetae, and asked a fine of a thousand drachmas if our
                    charges had been proved false; as it is, we are trying to hoodwink you by
                    accusations and idle abuse, and are confusing you by matters outside your
                    jurisdiction. <milestone n="22" unit="section"/>But I think you ought first of
                    all to reflect in your own minds that abuse and accusation are very far removed
                    from proof. It is an accusation when one makes a bare statement without
                    supplying grounds for believing it; it is proof when one at the same time
                    demonstrates the truth of one's statements. Those, therefore, who are proving a
                    case must supply evidence sufficient to establish its credibility with you, or
                    must advance reasonable arguments, or must produce witnesses. Of some facts it
                    is impossible to put eye-witnesses in the box, but if one can establish any of
                    these tests, you rightly consider in every case that you have a sufficient proof
                    of the truth. <milestone n="23" unit="section"/>We then base our proof, not on
                    probabilities nor on circumstantial evidence, but on a witness from whom the
                    defendant may easily obtain satisfaction&mdash;a man who has prepared a
                    document containing an account of the defendant's life, and who makes himself
                    responsible for this evidence. So that when Androtion says that this is mere
                    abuse and accusation, reply that this is proof, but that abuse and accusation
                    describe his own performance; and when he says that we ought to have denounced
                    him to the Thesmothetae, reply that we intend to do so, and that we are now
                    quite properly citing this statute. <milestone n="24" unit="section"/>For if we
                    were bringing these charges against him in any other kind of trial, he could
                    have just cause of complaint; but if the present trial is one that concerns
                    illegal proposals, and if men who have led a life like his are forbidden by the
                    laws to make even a legal proposal, and if we prove that he has not only made an
                    illegal proposal but has also led an illegal life, then is it not proper to cite
                    this law which determines his illegal status? <milestone n="25" unit="section"
                        /><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Moreover you should grasp this fact, that
                    Solon, who framed these and most of our other laws, was a very different kind of
                    legislator from the defendant, and provided not one, but many modes of procedure
                    for those who wish to obtain redress for various wrongs. For he knew, I think,
                    that for all the citizens to be equally clever, or bold, or moderate folk, was
                    impossible. If, then, he was going to frame the laws to satisfy the moderate
                    man's claim to redress, many rascals, he reflected, would get off scot-free, but
                    if he framed them in the interests of the bold and the clever speakers, the
                    plain citizen would not be able to obtain redress in the same way as they would.
                        <milestone n="26" unit="section"/>But he thought that no one should be
                    debarred from obtaining redress in whatever way he can best do so. How then will
                    this be ensured? By granting many modes of legal procedure to the injured
                    parties. Take a case of theft. Are you a strong man, confident in yourself?
                    Arrest the thief; only you are risking a thousand drachmas. Are you rather weak?
                    Guide the Archons to him, and they will do the rest. Are you afraid even to do
                    this? Bring a written indictment. <milestone n="27" unit="section"/>Do you
                    distrust yourself, and are you a poor man, unable to find the thousand drachmas?
                    Sue him for theft before a public arbitrator, and you will risk nothing. In the
                    same way for impiety you can arrest, or indict, or sue before the Eumolpidae, or
                    give information to the King-Archon. And in the same way, or nearly so, for
                    every other offence. <milestone n="28" unit="section"/>Now just suppose that a
                    man, instead of rebutting the charge of crime or impiety or whatever else he may
                    be tried for, should claim his acquittal on these grounds-in the case of an
                    arrest, that you might have brought an action before an arbitrator and that you
                    ought to have indicted him, or, if he is defendant in an arbitrator's court,
                    that you ought to have arrested him, so that you might risk a fine of a thousand
                    drachmas. Surely that would be a farce. A defendant, if innocent, need not
                    dispute the method by which he is brought.to justice: he ought to prove hat he
                    is innocent. <milestone n="29" unit="section"/>In just the same way, if you,
                    Androtion, propose a decree after having been guilty of prostitution, do not
                    imagine that you ought to escape punishment because we might also have denounced
                    you to the Thesmothetae, but either prove that you are innocent or submit to
                    punishment for any decrees that you have proposed, being what you are; or you
                    have no right to propose them. If we do not punish you by every process that the
                    laws allow, be grateful to us for those that we omit: do not on that ground
                    claim to pay no penalty at all. <milestone n="30" unit="section"/><milestone

                        key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, to study too the character of
                    Solon, who framed this law, and to observe what care he took of the constitution
                    in all the laws, how much more zealous indeed he was for the constitution than
                    for the matter on which he was legislating. This may be seen in many ways, but
                    especially from this law, which forbids persons guilty of prostitution to make
                    speeches or to propose measures. For he saw that the majority of you do not
                    avail yourselves of your right to speak, so that the prohibition seemed no great
                    hardship, and he could have laid down many harsher penalties, if his object had
                    been the chastisement of these offenders. <milestone n="31" unit="section"/>But
                    that was not his aim; he imposed this disability in the interests of you and of
                    the State, for he knew&mdash;I say, he knew that of all states the most
                    antagonistic men of infamous habits is that in which every man is at liberty to
                    publish their shame. And what state is that? A democracy. He thought it would be
                    dangerous if there ever happened to coexist a considerable number of men who
                    were bold and clever speakers, but tainted with such disgraceful wickedness.
                        <milestone n="32" unit="section"/>For the people may be led astray by them
                    to make many mistakes, and such men may attempt either to overthrow the
                    democracy completely,&mdash;for in an oligarchy, even if there are viler
                    livers than Androtion, no one may speak evil of dignities&mdash;or to
                    debauch the people, so that they may be as nearly as possible like themselves.
                    He therefore absolutely forbade such men to take any share in the counsels of
                    the State, lest the people should be deluded into some error. Disregarding all
                    this, our honorable gentleman here thought fit not only to make speeches and
                    proposals, though not entitled to do so, but even ventured to make illegal ones.
                        <milestone n="33" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Again, with
                    regard to the law which forbids him to speak or move resolutions, because his
                    father owed money to the exchequer and has never paid it, you have a fair and
                    reasonable answer to him, if he says that we ought to have laid an information
                    against him. We will do that later, certainly not now, Androtion, when you have
                    to render an account of your other crimes, but when it is proper to do so
                    according to the law. For the present, we are content to prove that the law does
                    not permit you to move resolutions, not even such as every other citizen may
                    move. <milestone n="34" unit="section"/>Prove, therefore, that your father was
                    not a defaulter, or that he left the prison, not by running away, but by paying
                    his debts. If you cannot prove that, then you had no right to move your
                    resolution; for the law makes you a partner in the disqualification of your
                    father, and being disqualified you had no right either to speak or move. Also
                    with regard to the laws which we have cited in court, I think that if he tries
                    to cheat and mislead you, gentlemen, you must give him the reply that I have
                    indicated. <milestone n="35" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>On
                    other points also he has arguments admirably calculated to deceive you, and it
                    is better that you should be told of them beforehand. One of them runs like
                    this: &ldquo;Do not steal the reward from five hundred of yourselves, nor
                    involve them in disgrace; they are on their trial, not I.&rdquo; But, had
                    you been going to deprive them of something without otherwise benefiting the
                    State, I should not have asked you to show any great keenness in the matter; but
                    if by this action you are going to convert more than ten thousand others into
                    better citizens, what a far finer thing it is to make so many men honest than to
                    confer an unjust favour on five hundred. <milestone n="36" unit="section"/>But I
                    am in a position to assert that the question does not concern the whole Council,
                    but only Androtion and some others, who are the cause of the mischief. For
                    should the Council receive no crown, who suffers disgrace, if he makes no speech
                    and moves no resolution himself, and perhaps even does not attend most of the
                    meetings? No one surely. The disgrace attaches to him who moves resolutions and
                    meddles with politics and tries to impose his wishes on the Council; because it
                    is through such men that the deliberations of the Council have proved
                    undeserving of the crown. <milestone n="37" unit="section"/>And yet, even if we
                    grant freely that the whole Council is on its trial, reflect how much more
                    advantage you will gain if you condemn Androtion, than if you do not. If you
                    acquit him, the talkers will rule in the Council chamber, but if you convict
                    him, the ordinary members. For when the majority see that they have lost the
                    crown through the misconduct of the orators, they will not leave the transaction
                    of business in their hands, but will depend on themselves for the best advice.
                    If this comes to pass, and if you are once rid of the old gang of orators, then,
                    men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, you will see
                    everything done as it ought to be. For this, if for no other, reason you ought
                    to convict. <milestone n="38" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Now
                    attend to another point that must not escape you. Perhaps Philippus will get up
                    and defend the Council; perhaps too Antigenes and the checking-clerk<note
                        resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">The <foreign lang="greek">a)ntigrafeu\s th=s

                        men named are unknown.</note> and some others, who along with the defendant
                    kept the Council-chamber as their private preserve, and who are the cause of the
                    present discontents. Now you must all observe that their pretence is that they
                    are supporting the cause of the Council, but really they will be fighting for
                    their own interests, to support the audit which they have to render of their
                    official acts. <milestone n="39" unit="section"/>For the case stands thus. If
                    you dismiss this impeachment, they are all acquitted and not a single one of
                    them will pay the penalty, for who henceforth would give his verdict against
                    them when you have crowned the Council of which they were the leading spirits?
                    But if you convict, in the first place you will have kept your judicial oath;
                    and further, when you have each of these men before you at their audit, anyone
                    whom you think guilty you will punish; and anyone who is not, then will be the
                    time to acquit him. Do not, therefore, accept their words as spoken on behalf of
                    the Council and of the general public, but be incensed against them as impostors
                    defending their own interests. <milestone n="40" unit="section"/><milestone

                    Cholargas,&mdash;for he too was a Councillor last year-will plead on their
                    behalf in his character of respectable citizen. But I suggest that you should
                    meet his plea in some such way as this. Ask him whether the conduct with which
                    the Council are charged seems to him honorable or the reverse, and if he says
                    &ldquo;honorable,&rdquo; pay him no longer the attention due to a
                    respectable man; if he says &ldquo;dishonorable,&rdquo; ask him a second
                    question: why did he let it pass, if he claims to be a respectable man?
                        <milestone n="41" unit="section"/>If he says that he spoke against it but
                    could persuade no one, surely it is ridiculous for him now to defend this
                    Council that rejected all his excellent advice; but if he says that he held his
                    tongue, is he not guilty of an injustice if he neglected his chance of
                    dissuading them from the offence they were contemplating, and yet ventures now
                    to say that having actually done so much evil they deserve to be crowned?
                        <milestone n="42" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>I expect
                    too that Androtion will not refrain from pleading that all this has come upon
                    him because of his success in collecting on your behalf large arrears of taxes,
                    which a few citizens &lpar;so he will tell you&rpar; shamelessly
                    neglected to pay; and he will denounce these men&mdash;undertaking an easy
                    task, I think&mdash;&lsqb;for not paying their property-tax&rsqb;,
                    and will prophesy complete impunity for all who do not pay, if you give your
                    verdict against him. <milestone n="43" unit="section"/>But I must first ask you,
                    men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, to reflect that the
                    question you are sworn to decide is not this, but whether his proposal was in
                    accordance with the laws. Next reflect that it is outrageous in one who charges
                    others with violating the constitution to claim exemption from punishment for
                    his own more serious violations; because it is obviously more serious to propose
                    an unconstitutional decree than to fail to pay the property-tax. <milestone
                        n="44" unit="section"/>Then even if it were certain that after this man's
                    conviction no one would pay the tax or be willing to collect it, even so you
                    must not acquit him, as you will see from this consideration. Upon the
                    property-taxes from the archonship of Nausinicus&mdash;say three hundred
                    talents or a trifle more<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">This figure is probably
                        corrupt, being too large for a single year, and too small for the
                        twenty-three years from the archonship of Nausinicus
                        &lpar;378-377&rpar; to the date of this speech.</note>&mdash;you
                    have a deficit of fourteen talents, of which he levied seven; but I am assuming
                    that he levied the whole amount. Now you do not need Androtion to deal with the
                    willing payers, but with the defaulters. <milestone n="45" unit="section"/>So
                    you have now to consider whether that is the value that you put on the
                    constitution, the existing laws, and your regard for your oath;for if you acquit
                    him, though his proposal was manifestly illegal, everyone will conclude that you
                    have preferred this sum of money to the laws and to your good faith. Why, even
                    if a man gave you this sum out of his own pocket, it would not be worth taking,
                    much less if it has to be exacted from others. <milestone n="46" unit="section"
                    />Therefore, when he uses this argument, remember your oath, and reflect that
                    this indictment concerns not the collection of taxes, but the sovereignty of the
                    laws. And as to all this&mdash;how he will try to hoodwink you by
                    distracting you from the subject of this law, and what points you must bear in
                    mind so as not to give way to him&mdash;though I might say more on these
                    subjects, I will refrain, as I think that this will suffice. <milestone n="47"
                        unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>I desire also to subject the
                    politics of this honorable gentleman to a scrutiny, from which it will be clear
                    that he has not stopped short of the utmost limits of depravity; for I shall
                    prove him to be shameless and reckless, a thief and a bully, fit for anything
                    rather than to play a public part in a democracy. And first of all let us
                    examine this levying of taxes, on which he chiefly prides himself. Without
                    paying any attention to his boasts, let us look at the facts in their true
                    light. <milestone n="48" unit="section"/>He said that Euctemon was retaining
                    your taxes, and he undertook to prove the charge or pay the sum out of his own
                    pocket. On that pretext he got you to vote for the dismissal of an official
                    appointed by lot, and so wormed his way into a collectorship. He delivered
                    sundry harangues on the subject, telling you that you had a choice of three
                    courses, either to break up the sacred plate, or to impose a fresh tax, or to
                    squeeze the money out of the defaulters; and you naturally chose the last.
                        <milestone n="49" unit="section"/>Having you under his thumb, thanks to his
                    promises, and having liberty of action owing to the state of affairs at the
                    time, he did not think it necessary to employ the existing laws for his purpose,
                    nor to make new laws, if he considered the old ones inadequate; but he proposed
                    in your Assembly monstrous and unconstitutional decrees, by means of which he
                    created a job for himself and has stolen a great deal that belongs to you,
                    putting in a clause that the Eleven should attend on him. <milestone n="50"
                        unit="section"/>Then, with the Eleven, he led the way to the homes of his
                    fellow-citizens. Against Euctemon he could prove nothing, though he had said
                    that he would get the taxes out of him or pay them himself; but it was from you
                    that he levied them, as if his motive was hostility, not to Euctemon, but to
                    you. <milestone n="51" unit="section"/>Let no one understand me to say that the
                    money ought not to have been wrung from the defaulters. It ought; but how? Even
                    as the law enjoins, for the benefit of the other citizens. That is the spirit of
                    democracy. For what you, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName>, have gained by the exaction of such paltry sums of
                    money in this way, is nothing to what you have lost by the introduction of such
                    habits into political life. If you care to inquire why a man would sooner live
                    under a democracy than under an oligarchy, you will find that most obvious
                    reason is that in a democracy everything is more easy-going. <milestone n="52"
                        unit="section"/>I shall not, then, trouble to show that the defendant has
                    proved himself more brutal than any oligarchy anywhere in the world. But here,
                    in our own city, at what period were the most outrageous things done? You will
                    all say, &ldquo;Under the Thirty Tyrants.&rdquo; Now under the Thirty,
                    as we are informed, no man forfeited the power to save his life who could hide
                    himself at home; what we denounce the Thirty for is that they arrested men
                    illegally in the market-place. This man displayed a brutality so far in excess
                    of theirs that he, a public man under a democracy, turned every man's private
                    house into a jail by conducting the Eleven into your homes. <milestone n="53"
                        unit="section"/>But what do you think of this, Athenians? What if a poor
                    man, or a rich man for that matter who has spent much money and is naturally
                    perhaps rather short of cash, should have to climb over the roof to a neighbor's
                    house or creep under bed, to avoid being caught and dragged off to jail, or
                    should degrade himself in some other fashion, fit for slaves and not for
                    freemen, and should be seen thus acting by his own wife, whom he espoused as a
                    freeman and a citizen of our state? And what if the cause of all this was
                    Androtion, a man who is debarred by his own conduct and mode of life from
                    seeking redress for himself, much more for the State? <milestone n="54"
                        unit="section"/>Yet if he were asked whether the taxes are due from our
                    property or from our persons, he would admit, if he cared to speak the truth,
                    that they are due from our property; it is from property that our contributions
                    come. Then why did you drop the sequestration and scheduling of lands and
                    houses, and proceed to imprison and insult Athenian citizens and the unfortunate
                    resident aliens, whom you have treated with more insolence than your own slaves?
                        <milestone n="55" unit="section"/>Indeed, if you wanted to contrast the
                    slave and the freeman, you would find the most important distinction in the fact
                    that slaves are responsible in person for all offences, while freemen, even in
                    the most unfortunate circumstances, can protect their persons. For it is in the
                    shape of money that in the majority of cases the law must obtain satisfaction
                    from them; but Androtion on the contrary exacted vengeance from their persons,
                    as if they had been bond-slaves. <milestone n="56" unit="section"/>So corrupt
                    and selfish was his attitude towards you that he thought that his own father,
                    imprisoned by the State for moneys due, had a right to escape, without payment
                    and without trial, but that any other citizen, not having the means to pay,
                    might be dragged from his own home to prison. And then, on the top of all this,
                    as though he could do whatever he liked, he distrained upon Sinope and
                    Phanostrate, who were prostitutes certainly, but owed no property-tax.
                        <milestone n="57" unit="section"/>Should anyone possibly think that those
                    women were fitting people to suffer, yet assuredly it was not a fitting
                    procedure&mdash;that men should be so puffed up by a chance opportunity as
                    to march into houses and carry off the furniture of people who are not in debt.
                    For one could point to many who are and have been &ldquo;fitting
                    persons&rdquo; for such treatment. But surely such is not the language of
                    the statutes or of the principles of the constitution, which it is your duty to
                    uphold. In them we find pity, pardon, everything that becomes free citizens.
                        <milestone n="58" unit="section"/>To all such feelings the defendant is of
                    course a stranger by birth and breeding. Many are the outrages and insults that
                    he has had to submit to when consorting with men who had no love for him but
                    could pay his price. For such insults, Androtion, it would have been right to
                    vent your spite, not on the next citizen you meet, not on the women who follow
                    your own profession, but on the father who gave you such a bringing up.
                        <milestone n="59" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Now that
                    these are serious offences, contrary to every statute, he will not be able to
                    deny; but he is so impudent that in the Assembly, contriving always an
                    anticipation of his defence against this indictment, he dared to say that it was
                    in your interests and for your sake that he had drawn down enmity on himself and
                    was now in desperate peril. But I want to prove to you, men of <placeName
                        key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, that he has never suffered, nor is
                    likely to suffer, any inconvenience at all through his services to you, but that
                    for his abominable and monstrous wickedness he has hitherto not paid the
                    penalty, but will pay it now, if you on your part do what is right. <milestone
                        n="60" unit="section"/>Consider this point. What did he undertake to do for
                    you, and what did you appoint him to do? To collect moneys. Anything else
                    besides? Not a single thing! Very well; I will remind you of the items of his
                    accounts. He collected from Leptines of Coele thirty-four drachmas, from
                    Theoxenus of Alopece seventy drachmas or a trifle more, and from Callicrates,
                    the son of Eupherus, and from the young son of Telestes, whose name I cannot
                    give you&mdash;but without going into details, of all those from whom he
                    collected money, I doubt if anyone owed more than a mina. <milestone n="61"
                        unit="section"/>Then do you suppose that all these men are his inveterate
                    enemies merely because he collected this money from them? Is it not rather
                    because he said of one of them, in the hearing of all of you in the Assembly,
                    that he was a slave and born of slaves and ought by rights to pay the

                    an inventory of one man's peculations from the start of his career, that another
                    had done this or that, and that a third had committed every conceivable

                    feel sure that of all whom he has abused in his cups, each one looked upon the
                    tax as a necessary item of expenditure, but has been deeply wounded by all these
                    indignities and insults. I feel sure too that he was elected by you to collect
                    money due, and not to reproach every man with his private misfortunes and so
                    make them public. For if the charges were true, Androtion &lpar;and we all
                    have our undesirable experiences&rpar;, you had no right to publish them;
                    and if you invented them without any authority, is any punishment too light for
                    you? <milestone n="63" unit="section"/>Here is yet another proof that will
                    convince you that they all hate him, not because of the collection, but for his
                    acts of drunken insolence. Satyrus, the superintendent of the dock-yards,
                    collected for you not seven, but thirty-four talents from these very same men,
                    and used the money to equip the ships that were put in commission; and he can
                    tell you that he has made no enemies in consequence, and that none of those from
                    whom he levied the taxes is at open war with him. Naturally! He, I suppose,
                    simply discharged the duty assigned to him, but you in your wanton, headstrong
                    effrontery, being armed with authority, thought fit to terse with foul and lying
                    reproaches men who had spent large sums on the State, better men than yourself
                    and of better birth. <milestone n="64" unit="section"/>After this, are the jury
                    to believe that you did it all for their sakes? Are they to make themselves
                    responsible for your acts of callous wickedness? They ought in justice to detest
                    you all the more for this rather than protect you. For the man who is acting for
                    the State ought to imitate the spirit of the State, and you, Athenians, ought to
                    encourage such men and hate men like the defendant. For though you are probably
                    aware of it, I must none the less tell you this: whatever sort of men you are
                    seen to honor and protect, you will be thought to be like them yourselves.

                    cost of maintaining their children, or of household expenses, or of other public

                    than thirty years, and though during that time many commanders have defrauded
                    the commonwealth, and many politicians as well, who have been tried in this

                    them or expressed any indignation at the wrongs of the city, bold and clever
                    speaker though you are, but made your first exhibition of anxiety for our
                    welfare on an occasion that called for harsh treatment of a great many people?
                        <milestone n="67" unit="section"/>Do you wish me to tell you the reason, men

                    the collection of revenue. In his insatiable greed he reaps a double harvest
                    from the State. Now it is not an easier matter to make enemies of a multitude of
                    petty offenders than of a few big offenders; neither of course is it a more
                    popular thing to have an eye for the sins of the many than for the sins of the

                    that he is one of them, one of the criminals, but he thought you beneath his

                    repeatedly offered you in the marketplace, binding and arresting aliens and
                    citizens alike, bawling from the platform in the Assembly, calling men slaves
                    and slave-born who were better men than himself and of better birth, and asking
                    if the jail was built for no object. I should certainly say it was, if your
                    father danced his way out of it, fetters and all, at the procession of the
                    Dionysia. All his other outrages it would be impossible to relate; they are too
                    numerous. For all of them taken together you must exact vengeance today, and
                    make an example of him to teach the rest to behave with more restraint.

                    be said, this is the sort of man he was in his public conduct, but there are
                    other things which he has managed with credit. On the contrary, in every respect
                    his behavior towards his fellow-citizens has been such that the story you have
                    heard is the least of the reasons you have for hating him. What do you wish me
                    to mention? How he &ldquo;repaired&rdquo; the processional ornaments?
                    How he broke up the crowns? His success as a manufacturer of saucers? Why, for
                    those performances alone, though he had committed no other fraud on the city, it
                    seems to me he deserves not one but three sentences of death; for he is guilty
                    of sacrilege, of impiety, of embezzlement, of every monstrous crime. <milestone

                    in your eyes I will leave unnoticed; but, by alleging that the leaves of the
                    crowns were rotten with age and falling off,&mdash;as though they were
                    violet-leaves or rose-leaves, not leaves made of gold&mdash;he persuaded you
                    to melt them down. And then, in providing for the collection of taxes, he had
                    put in a clause that the public accountant should attend. That was very honest
                    of him; only every taxpayer was certain to check the accounts. But in dealing
                    with the crowns that he was to break up, he left out that very proper
                    regulation; one and the same man was orator, goldsmith, business manager, and
                    auditor of accounts. <milestone n="71" unit="section"/>Now if you, sir, had
                    claimed our entire confidence in all your public business, your dishonesty would
                    not have been equally manifest; but, seeing that in the matter of the taxes you
                    laid down the just principle that the city must trust, not you, but her own
                    servants, and then, when you took up another job and were tampering with the
                    consecrated plate, some of it dedicated before we were born, you forgot to
                    provide the precaution that was taken at your own instance in respect of the tax
                    collection, is it not perfectly clear what you were aiming at? Of course it is.

                    enviable inscriptions that he has obliterated for all time, and the strange and
                    blasphemous inscriptions that he has written in their stead. You all, I suppose,
                    used to see the words written under the circlets of the crowns: &ldquo;The
                    Allies to the Athenian People for valor and righteousness,&rdquo; or
                    &ldquo;The Allies to the Goddess of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName>, a prize of victory&rdquo;; or, from the several
                    states of the alliance, &ldquo;Such-and-such a City to the People by whom
                    they were delivered,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;The liberated
                    Euboeans,&rdquo; for example, &ldquo;crown the People&rdquo;; or
                    again, &ldquo;<persName><surname>Conon</surname></persName> from the
                    sea-fight with the Lacedaemonians.&rdquo; Such, I say, were the inscriptions
                    of the crowns. <milestone n="73" unit="section"/>They were tokens of emulation
                    and honorable ambition; but now they have vanished with the destruction of the
                    crowns, and the saucers which that lewd fellow has had made in their place bear
                    the inscription, &ldquo;Made by direction of Androtion.&rdquo; And so
                    the name of a man whom the laws forbid to enter our temples in person because of
                    his prostitution, has been inscribed on the cups in those temples. Just like the
                    old inscriptions, is it not? and an equal incentive to ambition? <milestone
                        n="74" unit="section"/>&lsqb;You may, then, mark three scandalous crimes
                    committed by these persons. They have robbed the Goddess of her crowns. They
                    have extinguished in the city that spirit of emulation that sprang from the
                    achievements which the crowns, while in being, commemorated. They have deprived
                    the donors of a great honor,&mdash;the credit of gratitude for benefits
                    received. After this long series of evil deeds they have grown so callous and so
                    audacious that they recall those crimes as admirable examples of their
                    administration, so that one of them expects you to acquit him for the sake of
                    the other, and the other sits by his side and does not sink into the ground for
                    shame at his conduct.&rsqb; <milestone n="75" unit="section"/>Not only is he
                    lost to shame when money is in question, but he is so dull-witted that he cannot
                    see that crowns are a symbol of merit, but saucers and the like only of wealth;
                    that every crown, how ever small, implies the same regard for honor as if it
                    were large. that drinking-cups and censers, if very numerous, attach to their
                    owners a sort of reputation for wealth, but that, if a man takes pride in
                    trifles, instead of winning some honor by them, he is disdained as a man of
                    vulgar tastes. This man, then, has destroyed the possessions of honor, and made
                    the possessions of wealth mean and unworthy of your dignity. <milestone n="76"
                        unit="section"/>There is another thing that he did not understand, that the
                    Athenian democracy, never eager to acquire riches, coveted glory more than any
                    other possession in the world. Here is the proof: once they possessed greater
                    wealth than any other Hellenic people, but they spent it all for love of honor;
                    they laid their private fortunes under contribution, and recoiled from no peril
                    for glory's sake. Hence the People inherits possessions that will never die; on
                    the one hand the memory of their achievements, on the other, the beauty of the
                    memorials set up in their honor, yonder Propylaea, the Parthenon, the porticoes,
                    the docks,&mdash;not a couple of jugs, or three or four bits of gold plate,
                    weighing a pound apiece, which you, Androtion, will propose to melt down again,
                    whenever the whim takes you. <milestone n="77" unit="section"/>To dedicate those
                    buildings they did not tithe themselves, nor fulfil the imprecations of their
                    enemies by doubling the income-tax, nor was their policy ever guided by such
                    advisers as you. No; they conquered their enemies, they fulfilled the prayers of
                    every sound-hearted man by establishing concord throughout the city; and so they
                    have bequeathed to us their imperishable glory, and excluded from the

                    lips,&mdash;I who, on a former occasion, when I sailed for the <placeName

                    from being our benefactor, he is particularly ill-disposed to us, and that
                    exactly the wrong conception has been formed of his character. <milestone n="7"

                        >Athens</placeName>, the most serious offence committed by Aristocrates had
                    been that in his decree he was so solicitous for the safety of such a man as I
                    undertake to prove Charidemus to be that he provided a special and illegal

                    point at once, for the purpose of proving that the man is very far from
                    deserving the favour of this decree. There is, however, a much graver iniquity
                    involved in the decree, of which you must first be informed, and against which

                    circumstances, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, are
                    these. On the demise of Cotys three persons instead of one became kings of
                    Thrace&mdash;Berisades, Amadocus, and Cersobleptes; and the natural result
                    was that they competed with one another and that they all flattered you and
                    courted your favour. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>Well, men of <placeName
                        key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, certain persons who wanted to put a

                    Cersobleptes in possession of an undivided monarchy, contrived to equip
                    themselves with this provisional resolution. If one listened only to the
                    wording, they were far from appearing to pursue any such purpose; and yet such
                    was in fact their main object, as I will proceed to explain. <milestone n="10"
                        unit="section"/>On the death of Berisades, one of the three kings,
                    Cersobleptes, in violation of a sworn treaty concluded with you, began to levy
                    war upon the sons of Berisades and upon Amadocus; and it was at once foreseen
                    that Athenodorus would come to the aid of the sons of Berisades, and Simon and
                    Bianor to that of Amadocus, the former being related by marriage to Berisades
                    and the two latter to Amadocus. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>Accordingly
                    the persons I have mentioned began to consider by what means those commanders
                    might be compelled to remain inactive, so that, the rival princes being
                    friendless, Charidemus, who was striving to win the monarchy for Cersobleptes,
                    might make himself master of the situation. The first plan was to get a decree
                    enacted by you, making any man who should kill Charidemus liable to arrest; and
                    the second was that Charidemus should receive from you a general's commission.
                        <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>For neither Simon nor Bianor, both of whom
                    had been admitted to your citizenship, and who were, apart from that, thoroughly
                    well affected towards you, was likely to take the field against a general of
                    yours while Athenodorus, an Athenian citizen by birthright, would never dream of
                    doing so, nor would he incur the criminal charge set up by the decree, which
                    would certainly be brought against those commanders, if anything happened to
                    Charidemus. By these means, the kings being denuded of allies, and impunity
                    provide for themselves, they hoped easily to drive them out and seize the
                    monarchy. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>Of such intentions and of such
                    artifices they are accused by the evidence of facts; for, at the moment when
                    they began hostilities, Aristomachus of Alopece visited you as their ambassador,
                    and in his oration before the assembly, not content with commending Cersobleptes
                    and Charidemus and enlarging on their generous sentiments towards you,
                        <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>he declared that Charidemus was the only
                    man in the world who could recover <placeName key="perseus,Amphipolis"

                        >Athens</placeName>, and advised you to appoint him as general. But this
                    preliminary resolution had already been drafted and preconcerted by them, in
                    order that, if you should be captivated by the promises and expectations which
                    Aristomachus held out to you, it might be ratified there and then by the
                    Assembly, and no impediment might remain. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/>Yet
                    what more ingenious and cunning device could these men have concocted to obtain
                    the expulsion of the other kings, and the subjection of the whole realm to the
                    monarch whom they preferred, than when they intimidated the commanders who would
                    otherwise have supported the two rivals, and put them on their guard against
                    that spiteful accusation which they might reasonably expect to encounter by the
                    operation of this decree; and when on the other hand they conferred upon the man
                    who was scheming to get the monarchy for one king, and was laying plans entirely
                    opposed to your interests, such ample licence to proceed without fear?

                    only these considerations that prove that such was the purpose for which the
                    resolution was moved: the decree itself supplies evidence of great weight. After
                    drafting the words &ldquo;if any person put Charidemus to death,&rdquo;
                    and omitting any proviso of what Charidemus might be doing, whether for or
                    against your advantage, the mover forthwith added, &ldquo;he shall be liable
                    to seizure and removal from the territory of our allies.&rdquo; <milestone

                    Charidemus will ever enter allied territory, whether he has put him to death or
                    not, and therefore it is not against such men that this retribution has been
                    directed. The man who will be alarmed by this decree, and will be on his guard
                    against be coming our certain enemy, is one who is a friend of ours, and also an
                    enemy of his, if he should attempt anything inimical to us. And that man is

                    ratified by a deluded Assembly; and such the reasons why we, desiring to
                    frustrate its ratification, have brought this present indictment. As I have
                    undertaken to prove three propositions,&mdash;first that the decree is
                    unconstitutional, secondly that it is injurious to the common weal, and thirdly
                    that the person in whose favour it has been moved is unworthy of such
                    privilege,&mdash;it is, perhaps, fair that I should allow you, who are to

                    must disregard the person, and the character of the person, in whose favour the

                    illegal,&mdash;that and that alone. When I am bringing the man's deeds home
                    to him, and relating in what fashion you have been overreached by him, you must

                        >Athens</placeName>, and you have also heard the decree. Let me tell you how
                    you will more readily grasp the arguments on the question of illegality.
                    Consider the status of the person in whose favour the decree has been proposed:
                    is he an alien, a resident alien, or a citizen? If we call him a resident alien,
                    we shall not be telling the truth; and if we call him an alien, we shall be
                    doing him wrong, for it is only fair to him to admit the validity of that grace
                    of the people by which he was made a citizen. It seems, then, that we must treat
                    him as a citizen in our arguments. <milestone n="24" unit="section"/>Now I beg
                    you to observe how candidly and honestly I am going to treat the question; for I
                    assign him to that class which entitles him to the greatest respect, though I do
                    deny his right to acquire illegally privileges not enjoyed by us who are
                    citizens by birthright,&mdash;the privileges, I mean, which the defendant
                    has specified in this decree. In the statute it is provided that the Council
                    shall take cognizance of homicide, intentional wounding, arson, and poisoning,
                    if a man kills another by giving him poison. <milestone n="25" unit="section"
                    />The legislator, while he presumes the killing, has nevertheless directed a
                    judicial inquiry before specifying what is to be done to the culprit, and
                    thereby has shown a just respect, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName>, for the religious feeling of the whole city. I say of
                    the whole city, because it is impossible that all of you should know who the
                    manslayer is. He thought it scandalous to give credit to such accusations, when
                    made, without a trial; and he conceived that, inasmuch as the avenging of the
                    sufferer is in our hands, we ought to be informed and satisfied by argument that
                    the accused is guilty, for then conscience permits us to inflict punishment
                    according to knowledge, but not before. <milestone n="26" unit="section"
                    />Moreover he argued that before the trial is held such expressions as
                    &ldquo;if a man kill,&rdquo; &ldquo;if a man rob a
                    temple,&rdquo; &ldquo;if a man commit treason,&rdquo; and the like,
                    are merely phrases of accusation: they become definitions of crime only after
                    trial and conviction. To a formula of accusation he thought it proper to attach
                    not punishment, but only trial; and therefore, when enacting that, if one man
                    killed another, the Council should take cognizance, he did not lay down what
                    should be done to the culprit if found guilty. <milestone n="27" unit="section"
                    />So much for the legislator; but what of the author of the decree?
                    &ldquo;If any man kill Charidemus,&rdquo; he says. So he defines the
                    injury in the same phrase, &ldquo;if any man kill,&rdquo; as the
                    legislator; but the sequel is not the same. He struck out submission to trial,
                    and made the culprit liable to immediate seizure; he passed by the tribunal
                    appointed by law, and handed over to the accusers, to be dealt with as they
                    chose, a man untried, a man whose guilt is not yet proven. <milestone n="28"

                    him, or maltreat him, or extort money from him. Yet the next ensuing statute
                    directly and distinctly forbids such treatment even of men convicted and proved
                    to be murderers. Read to the jury the statute that follows.<quote type="Law"

                    you to examine it and observe how admirably and most righteously it is framed by
                    the legislator. He uses the term &ldquo;murderers&rdquo;; but in the
                    first place you see that by murderer he means a man found guilty by verdict; for
                    no man comes under that designation until he has been convicted and found
                    guilty. <milestone n="30" unit="section"/>That is made clear both in the earlier
                    statute and in this one; for in the former, after the words &ldquo;if any
                    man kill,&rdquo; the legislator directs the Council to take cognizance, and
                    here, after designating the man as &ldquo;the murderer,&rdquo; he has
                    directed what is to be done to him. That is to say, when it is a question of
                    accusation, he has ordered a trial, but when the culprit, being found guilty, is
                    liable to this designation, he has specified the penalty. Therefore he should be
                    speaking only of persons found guilty. Well, what does he direct? That it shall
                    be lawful to kill them and to put them under arrest. <milestone n="31"
                        unit="section"/>Does he say that they are to be taken to the house of the
                    prosecutor, or as he pleases? No, indeed. How are they to be arrested?
                    &ldquo;As directed on the first turning-table,&rdquo; is the phrase; and
                    you all know what that means. The judicial archons are there authorized to
                    punish with death persons who have gone into exile on a charge of murder. Only
                    last year you all saw the culprit who was arrested by them in the Assembly. It
                    is to the archons, then, that the murderer is to be taken on arrest; <milestone
                        n="32" unit="section"/>and that differs from being taken to the house of the

                    judges gives control of the malefactor to the laws, while the captor who takes
                    him home gives such control to himself. In the former case punishment is
                    suffered as the law enjoins; in the latter, as the captor pleases; and of course
                    it makes a vast difference whether the retribution is controlled by the law or
                    by a private enemy. <milestone n="33" unit="section"/>&ldquo;Not to maltreat
                    or amerce,&rdquo; says the statute. What does that mean? Every one, I am
                    sure, understands that not to maltreat means that there is to be no scourging,
                    no binding nor anything like that, and that not to amerce means not to extort
                    blood-money, for the ancients called fining amercement. <milestone n="34"
                        unit="section"/>Note that in this manner the law lays down not only how the
                    murderer or convict is to be punished, but also where, for it specifies the
                    country of the person injured, and it directly prescribes that the penalty is to
                    be inflicted in that way and in no other, in that place and in no other. Yet the
                    author of the decree is far indeed from making this distinction,&mdash;his
                    proposals are exactly contrary. After the words, &ldquo;if anyone shall kill
                    Charidemus,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;he shall be liable to seizure
                    everywhere.&rdquo;&mdash; <milestone n="35" unit="section"/>What do you
                    mean, sir? The laws do not allow even convicted criminals to be arrested
                    elsewhere than in our own country, and do you propose that a man shall be liable
                    to seizure without trial in any allied territory? And when the laws forbid
                    seizure even in our own territory, do you permit seizure? Indeed, in making a
                    man liable to seizure you have permitted everything that the law has
                    forbidden,&mdash;extortion of blood-money, maltreatment and misusage of a
                    living man, private custody and private execution. <milestone n="36"

                    unconstitutional proposal, or of drafting a resolution more outrageously than in
                    this fashion? You had two phrases at your disposal: &ldquo;if any man
                    kill,&rdquo; directed against a person under accusation, and &ldquo;if
                    any man be a murderer, directed against a culprit found guilty; yet in your
                    description you adopted the expression that applies to a man accused, while you
                    propose for untried culprits a penalty which the law does not permit even after
                    conviction. You have eliminated the intermediate process, for between accusation
                    and conviction comes a trial.&mdash;There is not a word about trial in the

                    Court shall adjudicate.&rdquo; What does this mean? In his opinion it was
                    just that, if a man who had gone into exile, when convicted on a charge of
                    murder, should make good his flight and escape, he should be excluded from the
                    country of the murdered man; but that it was not righteous to put him to death
                    anywhere and everywhere. His view was that, if we put to death people who have
                    gone into exile elsewhere, others will put to death people who have come into
                    exile here; <milestone n="39" unit="section"/>and that, in that event, the only
                    chance of salvation left for all those who are unfortunate will be destroyed,
                    that is to say, the power of migrating from the country of those whom they have
                    injured to a country where no one has been wronged by them, and there dwelling
                    in security. To avert that misfortune, and to prevent an endless succession of
                    retributions, he wrote: &ldquo;if any man kill a murderer, so long as he
                    absents himself from the frontier-market,&rdquo;&mdash;meaning thereby
                    the confines of the man's own country. It was there, I suppose, that in old
                    times borderers of our own and neighboring countries used to forgather; and so
                    he speaks of a &ldquo;frontier-market.&rdquo; <milestone n="40"
                        unit="section"/>Or take the words, &ldquo;from Amphictyonic
                    sacrifices.&rdquo; Why did he also exclude the murderer from them? He debars
                    the offender from everything in which the deceased used to participate in his
                    lifetime; first from his own country and from all things therein, whether
                    permitted or sacred, assigning the frontier-market as the boundary from which he
                    declares him excluded; and secondly from the observances at Amphictyonic
                    assemblies, because the deceased, if a Hellene, also took part therein.
                    &ldquo;And from the games,&rdquo;&mdash;why from the games? Because
                    the athletic contests of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName> are
                    open to all men,&mdash;the sufferer was concerned in them because everybody
                    was concerned in them; therefore the murderer must absent himself. <milestone
                        n="41" unit="section"/>Accordingly the law excludes the murderer from all
                    these places; but if anyone puts him to death elsewhere, outside the places
                    specified, the same retribution is provided as when an Athenian is slain. He did
                    not describe the fugitive by the name of the city, for in that name he has no
                    part, but by that of the act for which he is chargeable. Accordingly he says:
                    &ldquo;if any man kill the murderer;&rdquo; and afterwards, when he
                    prescribed the places from which the man is debarred, he introduces the name of
                    the City for the lawful assignment of punishment: &ldquo;he shall be liable
                    to the same penalty as if he killed an Athenian.&rdquo; Gentlemen, that
                    phrase is very different from the wording of the decree before us. <milestone
                        n="42" unit="section"/>Yet is it not scandalous to propose the surrender of
                    men whom the law has permitted to go into exile and to live in security,
                    provided they absent themselves from the places I have mentioned, and to rob
                    them of that benefit of mercy which the unfortunate may justly claim from those
                    who are unconcerned in their crimes, although, in our ignorance of the future
                    destiny of every man, it is uncertain for which of us that benefit is in store?
                    In this case, if the man who slays Charidemus &lpar;supposing the thing
                    really to happen&rpar; is slain in his turn by men who capture him as an
                    outcast, after he has gone into exile, and while he absents himself from the
                    places specified in the law, they will be liable to a charge of

                    migrated by reason of involuntary manslaughter. That is quite clear, because it
                    speaks of those who have &ldquo;quitted the country,&rdquo; not of those
                    who have gone into exile, and because it specifies persons &ldquo;whose
                    goods are not confiscate,&rdquo; for the property of willful murderers is
                    forfeited to the State. The legislator, I say, is speaking of involuntary
                    offenders. To what purport? <milestone n="46" unit="section"/>If they are
                    pursued or violently seized, he says, &ldquo;outside the
                    frontier.&rdquo; What is the significance of &ldquo;outside the
                    frontier&rdquo;? For all homicides alike the &ldquo;frontier&rdquo;
                    implies exclusion from the country of the person slain. From that country he
                    permits them to be pursued and seized; but outside of it he permits neither
                    seizure nor pursuit. For anyone who contravenes this rule he orders the same
                    punishment as if he had done the man wrong at home, in the words,
                    &ldquo;shall incur the same penalty as if he had so acted at
                    home.&rdquo; <milestone n="47" unit="section"/>Now suppose the defendant
                    Aristocrates were asked,&mdash;you must not think it a silly
                    question&mdash;first if he knows whether Charidemus will be killed by
                    someone, or will die in some other way. He would reply, I take it, that he does
                    not know. However, we will presume that somebody will kill him. Next question:
                    will the man who is to do it be a voluntary or an involuntary agent, an alien or
                    a citizen,&mdash;do you know, Aristocrates? You cannot say that you do know.
                        <milestone n="48" unit="section"/>Then of course you ought to have supplied
                    these particulars, and written, &ldquo;if any man, whether alien or citizen,
                    shall kill, with or without intention, rightfully or wrongfully,&rdquo; in
                    order that any man soever, by whom the deed should have been done, might have
                    received his deserts according to law; but assuredly, after merely naming an
                    accusation, you ought not to have added, &ldquo;he shall be liable to
                    seizure.&rdquo; What boundary have you left in this clause? <milestone
                        n="49" unit="section"/>Yet the law distinctly provides that beyond the
                    frontier a man shall not be pursued, whereas you permit him to be seized
                    anywhere. Beyond the frontier the law forbids not only pursuit but also seizure;
                    and yet according to your decree anyone who chooses will take as an outcast and
                    forcibly seize a man who has slain without intention, and carry him by violence
                    into the country of the slain man. Are you not treating human conduct
                    indiscriminately, and ignoring the motives according to which a given act is
                    either virtuous or immoral?&mdash; <milestone n="50" unit="section"
                    />Observe, gentlemen, that this is a universal distinction: it does not apply
                    only to questions of homicide. &ldquo;If a man strike another, giving the
                    first blow,&rdquo; says the law. The implication is that he is not guilty,
                    if the blow was defensive. &ldquo;If a man revile
                    another,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;with false hoods,&rdquo; the law
                    adds, implying that, if he speaks the truth, he is justified. &ldquo;If a
                    man slay another with malice aforethought,&rdquo;&mdash;indicating that
                    it is not the same thing if he does it unintentionally. &ldquo;If a man
                    injures another with intention, wrongfully.&rdquo; Everywhere we shall find
                    that it is the motive that fixes the character of the act. But not with you: you
                    say, without qualification, &ldquo;if any man slay Charidemus, he shall be
                    seized,&rdquo; though he do it unwittingly, or righteously, or in
                    self-defence, or for a purpose permitted by law, or in any way whatsoever.

                    and you must pay attention to his meaning. &ldquo;No man is to be liable to
                    prosecution for murder for laying information against manslayers who return from
                    exile illegally.&rdquo; Herein he exhibits two principles of justice, both
                    of which have been transgressed by the defendant in his decree. In the first
                    place, though he allows information to be laid against the homicide, he does not
                    allow him to be seized and carried off; and secondly, he allows it only if an
                    exile returns, not to any place, but to a prohibited place. <milestone n="52"
                        unit="section"/>Now the prohibited place is the city from which he has gone

                    other city except that from which he has fled; for of course a man cannot return
                    from exile to a place from which he was never expelled. What is allowed by the
                    statute is an information, and that only in case of return to a prohibited
                    place; whereas Aristocrates has proposed that a man shall be liable to seizure

                    than that which has just been read. Though the law so clearly gives permission
                    to slay, and states under what conditions, the defendant ignores all those
                    conditions, and has drawn his penal clause without any suggestion as to the
                    manner of the slaying. <milestone n="54" unit="section"/>Yet mark how
                    righteously and admirably these distinctions are severally defined by the
                    lawgiver who defined them originally. &ldquo;If a man kill another in an
                    athletic contest,&rdquo; he declared him to be not guilty, for this reason,
                    that he had regard not to the event but to the intention of the agent. That
                    intention is, not to kill his man, but to vanquish him unslain. If the other
                    combatant was too weak to support the struggle for victory, he considered him
                    responsible for his own fate, and therefore provided no retribution on his

                    unwittingly&rdquo;&mdash;the man who so slays is free of
                    bloodguiltiness. Good: If I have destroyed a man supposing him to be one of the
                    enemy, I deserve, not to stand trial, but to be forgiven. &ldquo;Or in
                    intercourse with his wife, or mother, or sister, or daughter, or concubine kept
                    for the procreation of legitimate children.&rdquo; He lets the man who slays
                    one so treating any of these women go scot-free; and that acquittal, men of
                        <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, is the most righteous of
                    all. <milestone n="56" unit="section"/>Why? Because in the defence of those for
                    whose sake we fight our enemies, to save them from indignity and licentiousness,
                    he permitted us to slay even our friends, if they insult them and defile them in
                    defiance of law. Men are not our friends and our foes by natural generation:
                    they are made such by their own actions; and the law gives us freedom to
                    chastise as enemies those whose acts are hostile. When there are so many
                    conditions that justify the slaying of anyone else, it is monstrous that that
                    man should be the only man in the world whom, even under those conditions, it is
                    to be unlawful to slay. <milestone n="57" unit="section"/>Let us suppose that a
                    fate that has doubtless befallen others before now should befall
                    him&mdash;that he should withdraw from <placeName key="tgn,7002756"
                        >Thrace</placeName> and come and live somewhere in a civilized community;
                    and that, though no longer enjoying the licence under which he now commits many
                    illegalities, he should be driven by his habits and his lusts to attempt the
                    sort of behavior I have mentioned, will not a man be obliged to allow himself to
                    be insulted by Charidemus in silence? It will not be safe to put him to death,
                    nor, by reason of this decree, to obtain the satisfaction provided by law.
                        <milestone n="58" unit="section"/>If anyone interrupts me with a question,
                    &ldquo;And where, pray, are such things likely to happen?&rdquo; there
                    is nothing to prevent me from asking, &ldquo;And who is likely to kill
                    Charidemus?&rdquo; Well, we need not go into those questions; only, inasmuch
                    as the decree now on trial refers, not to any past transaction, but to something
                    of which nobody knows whether it will happen or not, let the uncertainty of the
                    future be common ground to both sides; let us, as mankind are wont, adjust our
                    expectations thereto, and consider the matter on the presumption that both the
                    one contingency and the other may possibly happen. <milestone n="59"

                    Charidemus, the legitimate means of avenging him are still there. On the other
                    hand, if you let it stand, and if before he dies he maltreats any man, the man
                    whom he insults has been defrauded of his legal remedy. Therefore on every
                    ground the decree is contrary to law, and ought to be annulled. <milestone

                    By adding the word &ldquo;straightway&rdquo; after indicating the
                    conditions of lawful homicide, the legislator has excluded any long

                    actual sufferer, and to no other man. Thus the law permits homicide in immediate
                    self-defence; but Aristocrates has made no such exception. He says, without
                    qualification, &ldquo;if anyone ever kills,&rdquo;&mdash;that is,

                    Take the laws which deal with courts of homicide, and which order the contending
                    parties to summon one another, or to tender evidence, or to take their oaths, or

                    and that a penalty forbidden by the laws? Yet all the proceedings I have named

                    I say that of all the proposals ever laid before you I know of none more
                    outrageous than this decree, and that of all the tribunals to be found in the

                    righteous than ours. I desire to speak briefly of certain truths, the relation
                    of which reflects credit and honor upon the city, and which you will be
                    gratified to hear. I will begin with a statement which you will find especially
                    instructive, first referring to the free gift which has already been conferred
                    upon Charidemus. <milestone n="65" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"
                    />It was we, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, who made
                    Charidemus a citizen, and by that gift bestowed upon him a share in our civil
                    and religious observances, in our legal rights, and in everything in which we
                    ourselves participate. There are many institutions of ours the like of which are
                    not to be found elsewhere, but among them one especially peculiar to ourselves
                    and venerable,&mdash;I mean the Court of Areopagus. Concerning that Court I
                    could relate a greater number of noble stories, in part traditional and
                    legendary, in part certified by our own personal testimony, than could be told
                    of any other tribunal. It is worth your while to listen to one or two of them by
                    way of illustration. <milestone n="66" unit="section"/>First, then, in ancient
                    times, as we are told by tradition, in this court alone the gods condescended
                    both to render and to demand satisfaction for homicide, and to sit in judgement
                    upon contending litigants,&mdash;Poseidon, according to the legend, deigning
                    to demand justice from Ares on behalf of his son Halirrothius, and the twelve
                    gods to adjudicate between the Eumenides and Orestes. These are ancient stories;
                    let us pass to a later date. This is the only tribunal which no despot, no
                    oligarchy, no democracy, has ever dared to deprive of its jurisdiction in cases
                    of murder, all men agreeing that in such cases no jurisprudence of their own
                    devising could be more effective than that which has been devised in this court.
                    In addition to these great merits, here, and here alone, no convicted defendant
                    and no defeated prosecutor has ever made good any complaint against the justice
                    of the verdict given. <milestone n="67" unit="section"/>And so, in defiance of
                    this safeguard of justice, and of the lawful penalties that it awards, the
                    author of this decree has offered to Charidemus a free licence to do what he
                    likes as long as he lives, and to his friends the right of vindictive
                    prosecution when he is dead. For look at it in this light. You are all of course
                    aware that in the Areopagus, where the law both permits and enjoins the trial of
                    homicide, first, every man who brings accusation of such a crime must make oath
                    by invoking destruction upon himself, his kindred, and his household; <milestone
                        n="68" unit="section"/>secondly, that he must not treat this oath as an
                    ordinary oath, but as one which no man swears for any other purpose; for he
                    stands over the entrails of a boar, a ram, and a bull, and they must have been
                    slaughtered by the necessary officers and on the days appointed, so that in
                    respect both of the time and of the functionaries every requirement of solemnity
                    has been satisfied. Even then the person who has sworn this tremendous oath does
                    not gain immediate credence; and if any falsehood is brought home to him, he
                    will carry away with him to his children and his kindred the stain of
                    perjury,&mdash;but gain nothing. <milestone n="69" unit="section"/>If, on
                    the other hand, he is believed to be laying a just charge, and if he proves the
                    accused guilty of murder, even then he has no power over the convicted criminal;
                    only the laws and the appointed officers have power over the man for punishment.
                    The prosecutor is permitted to see him suffering the penalty awarded by law, and
                    that is all. Such are the prosecutor's rights. As for the defendant, the rules
                    for his oath are the same, but he is free to withdraw after making his first
                    speech, and neither the prosecutor, nor the judges, nor any other man, has
                    authority to stop him. <milestone n="70" unit="section"/>Now why is that so, men
                    of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>? Because they who
                    originally ordained these customs, whoever they were, heroes or gods, did not
                    treat evil fortune with severity, but humanely alleviated its calamities, so far
                    as they honestly could. All those regulations, so nobly and equitably conceived,
                    the author of the decree now in question has manifestly infringed, for not a
                    single shred of them is to be found in his decree.&mdash;That is my first
                    point: here is one tribunal whose written laws and unwritten usages he has
                    contravened in drafting his decree. <milestone n="71" unit="section"/><milestone
                        ed="P" unit="para"/>Secondly, there is another tribunal, the court by the
                    Palladium, for the trial of involuntary homicide; and it shall be shown that he
                    nullifies that tribunal also, and transgresses the laws there observed. Here
                    also the order is first the oath-taking, secondly the pleadings, and thirdly the
                    decision of the court; and not one of these processes is found in the
                    defendant's decree. If the culprit be convicted, and found to have committed the
                    act, neither the prosecutor nor any other person has any authority over him, but
                    only the law. And what does the law enjoin? <milestone n="72" unit="section"
                    />That the man who is convicted of involuntary homicide shall, on certain
                    appointed days, leave the country by a prescribed route, and remain in exile
                    until he is reconciled to one of the relatives of the deceased. Then the law
                    permits him to return, not casually, but in a certain manner; it instructs him
                    to make sacrifice and to purify himself, and gives other directions for his
                    conduct. In all these provisions, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName>, the law is right. <milestone n="73" unit="section"/>It
                    is just to allot a lesser penalty for involuntary than for willful homicide; it
                    is quite right, before ordering a man to go into exile, to provide for his safe
                    departure; and the provisions for the reinstatement of the returning exile, for
                    his purification by customary rites, and so forth, are excellent. Well, everyone
                    of these ordinances, so righteously enacted by the original legislators, has
                    been transgressed by the defendant in drafting his decree. So we have now two
                    tribunals, of great antiquity and high character, and usages handed down from
                    time immemorial, which he has insolently overridden. <milestone n="74"
                        unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Besides these two tribunals
                    there is also a third, whose usages are still more sacred and awe-inspiring, for
                    cases in which a man admits the act of slaying, but pleads that he slew
                    lawfully. That is the court held at the Delphinium. It appears to me, gentlemen
                    of the jury, that the first inquiry made by those who originally defined the
                    rules of jurisprudence in these matters was, whether we are to regard no act of
                    homicide as righteous, or whether any kind of homicide is to be accounted
                    righteous; and that, arguing that Orestes, having slain his own mother,
                    confessing the fact, and finding gods to adjudge his case, was acquitted, they
                    formed the opinion that there is such thing as justifiable
                    homicide,&mdash;for gods could not have given an unjust verdict. Having
                    formed this opinion, they immediately set down in writing an exact definition of
                    the conditions under which homicide is lawful. <milestone n="75" unit="section"
                    />The defendant, however, admitted no exception; he simply makes an outcast of
                    any man who kills Charidemus, even though he kill him justly or as the laws
                    permit. And yet to every act and to every word one of two epithets is
                    applicable: it is either just or unjust. To no act and to no word can both these
                    epithets be applied at the same time, for how can the same act at the same time
                    be both just and not just? Every act is brought to the test as having the one or
                    the other of these qualities; if it be found to have the quality of injustice,
                    it is adjudged to be wicked, if of justice, to be good and honest.&mdash;But
                    you, sir, used neither qualification when you wrote the words, &ldquo;if any
                    man kill.&rdquo; You named the mere accusation, without any definition, and
                    then immediately added, &ldquo;let him be liable to seizure.&rdquo;
                    Thereby you have evidently ignored this tribunal and its usages as well as the
                    other two. <milestone n="76" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"
                    />There is also a fourth tribunal, that at the Prytaneum. Its function is that,
                    if a man is struck by a stone, or a piece of wood or iron, or anything of that
                    sort, falling upon him, and if someone, without knowing who threw it, knows and
                    possesses the implement of homicide, he takes proceedings against these
                    implements in that court. Well, if it is not righteous to deny a trial even to a
                    lifeless and senseless thing, the object of so grave an accusation, assuredly it
                    is impious and outrageous that a man who may possibly be not guilty, and who in
                    any case,&mdash;and I will assume him to be guilty,&mdash;is a human
                    being endowed by fortune with the same nature as ourselves, should be made an
                    outcast on such a charge without a hearing and without a verdict. <milestone
                        n="77" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Then there is a fifth
                    tribunal which he has overruled,&mdash;and I beg you to take note of its
                    character; I mean the court held in the precinct of Phreatto. In that court, men
                    of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, the law orders every man
                    stand his trial who, having gone into exile on a charge of unintentional
                    homicide, and being still unreconciled to the persons who procured his
                    banishment, incurs a further charge of willful murder. The author of the several
                    rules of court did not let such a man alone, on the ground that he was unable to
                    return to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, nor did he,
                    because the man had already committed a like offence, treat the similarity of
                    the accusation as proof positive against him; <milestone n="78" unit="section"
                    />he found a way of satisfying the requirements of religion without depriving
                    the culprit of a fair hearing and a trial. How did he manage it? He conveyed the
                    judges who were to sit to a place to which the accused was able to repair,
                    appointing a place within the country but on the sea-coast, known as the
                    precinct of Phreatto. The culprit approaches the shore in a vessel, and makes
                    his speech without landing, while the judges listen to him and give judgement on
                    shore. If found guilty, the man suffers the penalty of willful murder as he
                    deserves; if acquitted, he goes his way scot-free in respect of that charge, but
                    still subject to punishment for the earlier homicide. <milestone n="79"
                        unit="section"/>Now with what object have these regulations been made so
                    carefully? The man who drew them up accounted it equally irreligious to let slip
                    the guilty, and to cast out the innocent before trial. But if such great pains
                    are taken in the case of persons already adjudged to be homicides, to ensure for
                    them a hearing, a trial, and fair treatment in every respect upon any subsequent
                    accusation, surely it is most outrageous to provide that a man who has not yet
                    been found guilty, and of whom it is still undecided whether he committed the
                    act or not, and whether the act was involuntary or willful, should be handed
                    over to the mercy of his accusers. <milestone n="80" unit="section"/><milestone
                        ed="P" unit="para"/>In addition to all these provisions for legal redress
                    there is a sixth, which the defendant has equally defied in his decree. Suppose
                    that a man is ignorant of all the processes I have mentioned, or that the proper
                    time for taking such proceedings has elapsed, that for any other reasons he does
                    not choose to prosecute by those methods; if he sees the homicide frequenting
                    places of worship or the market, he may arrest him and take him to jail; but
                    not, as you have permitted, to his own house or wherever he chooses. When under
                    arrest he will suffer no injury in jail until after his trial; but, if he is
                    found guilty, he will be punished with death. On the other hand, if the person
                    who arrested him does not get a fifth part of the votes, he will be fined a
                    thousand drachmas. <milestone n="81" unit="section"/>The proposals of the
                    defendant are quite different: the accuser is to prosecute without risk, the
                    culprit to be given up incontinently and without trial; and if any person, or
                    indeed any entire city, shall intervene to prevent the destruction of all those
                    usages which I have described and the overthrow of all the tribunals I have
                    mentioned; tribunals introduced by the gods and frequented by mankind from that
                    day to this,&mdash;and to rescue the victims of outrage and lawless
                    violence, he proposes that any such person shall be banned; for him also he
                    allows no hearing and no trial, but punishes him instantly and without trial.

                    the spirit of equity and the remarkable humanity with which it is drawn up.
                        <milestone n="83" unit="section"/>&ldquo;If any man die a violent
                    death,&rdquo; says the legislator. First, by adding the epithet
                    &ldquo;violent,&rdquo; he has given an indication by which we understand
                    his meaning to be, &ldquo;if a man die wrongfully.&rdquo; &ldquo;His
                    kinsmen may take and hold hostages in respect of such death, until they either
                    submit to trial for bloodguiltiness, or surrender the actual
                    manslayers.&rdquo; You will note what an admirable provision this is. He
                    requires the hostages, in the first instance, to stand trial; and then if they
                    refuse, he enjoins them to give up the murderers; but, if they decline both
                    these duties, he adds that the right to hold hostages is limited to three and no
                    more. The whole of this statute is defied in the wording of the decree.
                        <milestone n="84" unit="section"/>In the first place, when writing the
                    words, &ldquo;if any man shall kill,&rdquo; he did not add
                    &ldquo;wrongfully,&rdquo; or &ldquo;violently,&rdquo; or any
                    qualification at all. Secondly he proposes that the culprit shall be liable to
                    seizure instantly and before any claim of redress has been made. Furthermore,
                    while the statute ordains that, if the persons in whose house the death took
                    place will neither submit to trial nor give up the perpetrators, as many as
                    three may be detained as hostages, <milestone n="85" unit="section"
                    />Aristocrates dismisses those persons scot-free, and takes no account of them
                    whatever, but proposes to put under a ban those who, in obedience to that common
                    law of mankind which enjoins hospitality to a fugitive, have harbored the
                    culprit, who, as I will assume, has already gone into exile, if they refuse to
                    surrender their suppliant. Thus, by omitting to specify the mode of the
                    homicide, by not providing for a trial, by omitting the claim of redress, by
                    permitting arrest in any place whatsoever, by punishing those who harbor the
                    fugitive, and by not punishing those in whose house the death took
                    place,&mdash;in every respect I say that his proposal is in manifest

                    opinion that, as every citizen has an equal share in civil rights, so everybody
                    should have an equal share in the laws; and therefore he moved that it should
                    not be lawful to propose a law affecting any individual, unless the same applied
                    to all Athenians. Now seeing that it is agreed that the drafting of decrees must
                    conform to the law, a man who draws a decree for the special benefit of
                    Charidemus, such as is not applicable to all the rest of you, must evidently be
                    making a proposal in defiance of this statute also; of course what it is

                    without tampering with your existing laws respecting such offences, they enhance
                    the dignity of those laws by making it an act of grace to allow a share in them
                    to others. Not so Aristocrates: he does his very best to drag the laws through
                    the mire; anyhow, he tried to compose something of his own, as though they were
                    worth nothing; and he makes light even of that act of grace which you bestowed
                    your citizenship upon Charidemus. For when he assumes that you still owe the man
                    a debt of gratitude, and has proposed that you should protect him into the
                    bargain, so that he may do just what he likes with impunity, does not such
                    conduct merit my description? <milestone n="90" unit="section"/><milestone

                    make an attempt to shuffle away the most serious part of the
                    accusation,&mdash;namely, that from beginning to end of his decree he does
                    not order any trial of a very grave indictment. On that point I do not think I
                    need say much; but I will prove clearly from the actual phrasing of the decree
                    that he himself does not suppose that the man accused will get any trial at all.
                        <milestone n="91" unit="section"/>The words are: &ldquo;If any man kill

                    refuse to give up for trial the man they have rescued, but absolutely and
                    without more ado. And yet if he were permitting instead of disallowing a trial,
                    he would have made the penal clause against the rescuers conditional upon their

                        resolution,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">An order of Council not valid

                    if you acquit him today, the commonwealth can take no harm in respect of his
                    decree. <milestone n="93" unit="section"/>I think your rejoinder to that
                    argument should be that the defendant's purpose in drafting the decree was, not
                    that it should be inoperative and have no disagreeable results,&mdash;for it
                    was open to him not to draft it at all, if he had wished to consult the best

                    certain people might be enabled to carry through projects opposed to your
                    interests. That the decree has been challenged, that its operation has been
                    delayed, and that it has now become invalid, you owe to us; and it is
                    preposterous that the very reasons that ought to make you grateful to us should
                    be available as reasons for acquitting our opponents. <milestone n="94"

                    there were no other man likely to propose decrees like his without regard to
                    your interests, the matter might, perhaps, be a simple one. But in fact there
                    are many such; and that is why it is not right that you should refuse to annul
                    this decree. If it is pronounced flawless, who will not move decrees in future
                    without misgiving? Who will refuse to put them to the vote? Who will impeach
                    them? What you have to take into account is, not that this decree has become
                    invalid by lapse of time, but that, if you now give judgement for the defendant,
                    by that verdict you will be offering impunity to every man who may hereafter

                    resort to such fallacious arguments as this,&mdash;that many similar decrees
                    have been made before now in favour of many persons. That is no proof,

                    nevertheless it would have been moved contrary to law. Or suppose that a decree,
                    being impeached, was pronounced flawless, because the prosecutors, either
                    collusively or through incompetence, had failed to make good their case: that
                    failure does not make it legal. Then the jurors do not give conscientious
                    verdicts? Yes, they do; I will explain how. They are sworn to decide to the best
                    of an honest judgement; but the view that commends itself to their judgement is
                    guided by the speeches to which they listen, and, inasmuch as they cast their
                    votes in accordance with that view, they are true to their oath. <milestone

                    deserve to be punished for his lack of intelligence. The man who is amenable to
                    the curse is the advocate who deceives and misleads the jury. That is why, at
                    every meeting, the crier pronounces a commination, not upon those who have been
                    misled, but upon whosoever makes a misleading speech to the Council, or to the

                    proof that the thing has happened, but only to proof that it ought to have

                    ours. Failing that, I do not think that you ought to give greater weight to the

                    to argue that his proposal had been to the public advantage, and insisted
                    strongly on that point,&mdash;a simple-minded argument, surely, if it was
                    not an impudent one. <milestone n="101" unit="section"/>Admit a man's
                    proposition to be in every other respect advantageous; it is still
                    disadvantageous in so far as he begs you, who are sworn to give judgement
                    according to law, to ratify a decree which he himself cannot prove to have been
                    honestly drawn, seeing that every man is bound to set the highest value upon
                    fidelity to his oath. At the same time the plea, though impertinent, has reason
                    in it; but not a reason which Aristocrates will be able to submit to you.
                    Entirely opposed as his decree is to the laws, it is not less pernicious than
                    illegal. <milestone n="102" unit="section"/>That is the point which I wish now
                    to make good to you; and, in order to do what I wish in as few words as
                    possible, will cite an illustration that is well known to you all. You are aware
                    that it is for the advantage of Athens that neither the Thebans nor the
                    Lacedaemonians should be powerful; that the Thebans should be counterbalanced by
                    the Phocians, and the Lacedaemonians by other communities; because, when that is
                    the position of affairs, you are the strongest nation, and can dwell in
                    security. <milestone n="103" unit="section"/>You must, then, take the view that

                    trustworthy guarantee of the safety of the <placeName key="tgn,7017285"
                        >Chersonese</placeName>. Now the decree before us, by offering security to
                    the minister who controls the affairs of Cersobleptes, and by putting the
                    commanders of the other kings in imminent fear of being accused of crime, makes
                    those kings weak, and the king who stands by himself strong. <milestone n="104"

                    made in <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> have so powerful an
                    effect, I will remind you of a piece of history within the knowledge of all of
                    you. After the revolt<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">In 361; See Grote, chap.
                        80.</note> of Miltocythes against Cotys, when the war had already lasted a
                    considerable time, when Ergophilus had been superseded, and Autocles was on the
                    point of sailing to take command, a decree was proposed here in such terms that
                    Miltocythes withdrew in alarm, supposing that you were not well disposed towards
                    him, and Cotys gained possession of the Sacred Mountain and its treasures. Now
                    observe that later, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>,
                    although Autocles was put on his trial for having brought Miltocythes to ruin,
                    the time for indicting the author of the decree was past; and, so far as
                        <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> was concerned, the whole
                    business had come to grief. <milestone n="105" unit="section"/>Even so today, if
                    you do not annul this decree, the kings and their commanders will be immensely
                    discouraged. They will regard themselves as altogether slighted, and will
                    imagine that your favour is inclining towards Cersobleptes. Now suppose that on
                    this assumption they surrender their royalty, whenever Cersobleptes seizes
                    opportunity and attacks them; and again observe what will happen.&mdash;

                    Cersobleptes attacks us,&mdash;and he is more likely than not to do so, when
                    he has the power,&mdash;shall we not have recourse to those kings? Shall we
                    not try to reduce him through them? Very well; then suppose they reply:
                    &ldquo;Athenians, so far from helping us when we were ill-treated, you made

                    should be liable to seizure. Therefore you have no right to call upon us to help
                    you in a matter which you mismanaged for us as well as for

                    was not too powerful to be trusted, they were his allies and fought us on his
                    account, when they found that his strength had grown too great for their
                    confidence, they did not make a decree that whosoever should kill any man who
                    had helped to consolidate Philip's power should be liable to seizure in the
                    country of their allies. <milestone n="109" unit="section"/>No, indeed; they

                    of all men in the world would be most delighted to kill Philip's friends or even
                    Philip himself. When mere Olynthians know how to provide for the morrow, will
                    not you, who are Athenians, do likewise? It is discreditable that you, who have
                    a reputation for superior ability in political deliberation, should be convicted
                    of a duller perception of your own advantage than Olynthians. <milestone n="110"

                    Aristocrates will also say something to the same effect as a speech once made in
                    the Assembly by Aristomachus,&mdash;that it is inconceivable that
                    Cersobleptes would ever deliberately provoke your enmity by trying to rob you of
                    the <placeName key="tgn,7012057">Chersonesus</placeName>, because, even if he
                    should take it and hold it, it will be of no use to him. Indeed when that
                    country is not at war, its revenue is no more than thirty talents, and when it
                    is at war, not a single talent. On the other hand the revenue of his ports,
                    which, in the event supposed, would be blockaded, is more than two hundred
                    talents. They wonder,&mdash;as they will put it,&mdash;what he could
                    possibly mean by preferring small returns and a war with you, when he might get
                    larger returns and be your friend. <milestone n="111" unit="section"/><milestone
                        ed="P" unit="para"/>But I am at no loss for plenty of instances in the light
                    of which a man might reasonably be skeptical, instead of putting his trust in
                    those orators, and allowing Cersobleptes to become a potentate. However, I will
                    be content with the instance that lies nearest to hand. Of course, gentlemen,
                    you all know that Macedonian, Philip. It was certainly more profitable for him
                    to draw the revenues of all <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>
                    in safety, than the revenue of <placeName key="perseus,Amphipolis"
                        >Amphipolis</placeName> with risks attached; and more agreeable to have you,
                    his hereditary friends, on his side, than the Thessalians who once ejected his
                    own father. <milestone n="112" unit="section"/>Apart from that, it may be
                    observed that you, Athenians, never yet betrayed any of your friends, while the
                    Thessalians have betrayed every one of theirs. Nevertheless, in spite of all
                    that, you see that he has deliberately chosen small gains, faithless friends,
                    and big risks, in preference to a life of security. <milestone n="113"
                        unit="section"/>Now what can be the reason? For the logic of the thing is
                    certainly not so very obvious. The truth is, men of <placeName
                        key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, that there are two things that are
                    excellent for everybody: good luck, the chiefest and greatest of goods, and good
                    counsel, inferior to good luck, but greater than any other; but men do not get
                    both these good things at once, and no successful man sets any limit or end to
                    his desire to get more. And that is why men, in the desire for more, so often
                    throw away what they already have. <milestone n="114" unit="section"/>But what
                    need to name Philip, or any other man? Why, Cersobleptes' own father, Cotys,
                    whenever he had a quarrel on hand, used to send his ambassadors, and was ready
                    to do anything, and then he could see that being at war with <placeName
                        key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> was quite unprofitable. But, as soon
                    as he had all <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName> at his command, he
                    would occupy cities, do mischief, discharge his drunken fury, first on himself,
                    and then on us; he must needs subjugate the whole country; there was no dealing
                    with the fellow. For everybody who attempts improper enterprises for the sake of
                    aggrandizement is apt to look, not to the difficulties of his task, but to what
                    he will achieve if successful. <milestone n="115" unit="section"/>My own
                    opinion, then, is that your policy should be fashioned in such a way that, if
                    Cersobleptes' views in regard to you are what they should be, he shall not be
                    unjustly treated by you, but that, if he is so unreasonable as to treat you
                    unjustly, he may not be too strong to be punished. I will read to you the letter
                    which Cersobleptes sent at the time of the revolt of Miltocythes, and also that
                    which, when the whole kingdom was his, he sent to Timomachus before seizing your

                    a mind to injure him, they would not have the power; &ldquo;for,&rdquo;

                    crowns; and you would never have done that, if you had thought him your enemy.

                    for any man to try to give him due punishment for his subsequent violence and
                    brutality? <milestone n="121" unit="section"/>But why need one talk about the
                    other instances? Take Philip, who is now accounted our very worst enemy. At the
                    time when, having caught some of our citizens in the act of trying to restore
                    Argaeus, he released them and made good all their losses, when he professed in a
                    written message that he was ready to form an alliance with us, and to renew his
                    ancestral amity, if at that time he had asked us for this favour, and if one of
                    the men he had released had proposed that &ldquo;whoever shall kill
                    Philip&rdquo; should be liable to seizure, a fine insult we should have had
                    to swallow! <milestone n="122" unit="section"/>Do you not see, gentlemen, do you
                    not understand, how you would have been chargeable with sheer lunacy in every
                    one of these instances, if you had carried by vote any such resolution as this?
                    I say it is not the part of sane men either to put such confidence in a man,
                    whenever they imagine him to be friendly, as to deprive themselves of all
                    defence against possible aggression, or, on the other hand, when they regard
                    anyone as an enemy, to hate him so fiercely that, if he ever wants to reform and
                    be their friend, they have taken it out of his power to do so. But we should, I
                    think, carry both our friendship and our hatred only so far as not to exceed the
                    due measure in either case. <milestone n="123" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P"

                    or Athenodorus, or thousands more. No; if we make the same decree in favour of
                    the whole company, we shall unconsciously make ourselves a bodyguard for every

                    our customs and laws, will make his home in our midst, as soon as he receives
                    our franchise, and will enjoy his share in the advantages he coveted. But as for
                    those who are not moved by any desire or emulation of those institutions, but
                    value only the advantage they derive from the credit of being distinguished by
                    you, I fancy, indeed I am quite certain, that as soon as they discern a prospect
                    of larger advantage elsewhere, they will devote their attention to that
                    prospect, without the least concern for you. <milestone n="127" unit="section"
                    />For example, to make clear to you my purpose in saying this, when that man
                    <persName><surname>Pytho</surname></persName>, having just killed Cotys,
                    did not think it safe to take his chance of a place of refuge, he came to you,
                    applied for your citizenship, and thought you the finest people in the world.
                    But now that he thinks relations with Philip more advantageous to him, he takes
                    Philip's side, without the slightest regard for you. No, men of <placeName
                        key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>; when men give their lives to the
                    pursuit of their own ambitions, I say that there is no stability and no honesty
                    to be found in them. Every sensible man must get the better of such people by
                    wary conduct: he should not begin by trusting and end by denouncing them.
                        <milestone n="128" unit="section"/>Athenians, if we should
                    assume,&mdash;though it is the reverse of the truth,&mdash;that
                    Charidemus himself has been, is still, and will remain devoted to us, and that
                    he will never entertain any other sentiment, it is not a whit the more wise to
                    pass such decrees for him. If he had accepted the security offered by the decree
                    for any other purpose than the interests of Cersobleptes, the danger would have
                    been less; but, in fact, I find on a calculation of probabilities that the man
                    for whose benefit he will turn to account the advantage given by the decree is
                    himself equally unworthy of his confidence and of ours. <milestone n="129"
                        unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Observe how honestly I
                    examine the several points, and how entirely reasonable are my apprehensions. I
                    look at Cotys, and I find that he was related by marriage to Iphicrates in the
                    same degree as Cersobleptes to Charidemus; and that the achievements of
                    Iphicrates on behalf of Cotys were far more important and meritorious than
                    anything that Charidemus has done for Cersobleptes. Let us consider it in this
                    way. <milestone n="130" unit="section"/>No doubt you remember, men of <placeName
                        key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, that Iphicrates was a very
                    fortunate man, with his bronze effigy, his free board at the Town Hall, and
                    other grants and distinctions. Nevertheless he had the courage to fight a battle
                    at sea against our commanders in defence of Cotys, setting a higher value on the
                    salvation of that king than upon all the honors he enjoyed in your city. If your
                    resentment had not been more restrained than his impetuosity, nothing could have
                    saved him from being the most miserable of mankind. <milestone n="131"
                        unit="section"/>In spite of that, when Cotys, who owed his deliverance to
                    Iphicrates, and had had practical experience of his loyalty, believed himself to
                    be permanently out of danger, he took no pains to reward him, and never showed
                    you any civility through his agency in the hope of winning forgiveness for his
                    past conduct. On the contrary, he claimed his help in besieging the rest of your
                    strongholds, <milestone n="132" unit="section"/>and, on his refusal, he made an
                    attack in person on the strongholds, taking with him the forces collected by
                    Iphicrates as well as his barbarian troops, and engaging the services of
                    Charidemus. He reduced Iphicrates to such helplessness that he withdrew to
                        <placeName key="perseus,Antissa">Antissa</placeName>, and afterwards to
                    Drys, and lived there; for he did not think he could honorably return to you,
                    whom he had slighted for the sake of a Thracian and a barbarian. On the other
                    hand, he thought it dangerous to remain at the court of a king whom he had found
                    so negligent of his safety. <milestone n="133" unit="section"/>Now suppose, men
                    of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, that Cersobleptes also,
                    having his power enhanced by the immunity that is being procured for Charidemus,
                    should disdain that man, and initiate plots and disturbances against
                    you,&mdash;are you content, as long as Charidemus is misled, to have
                    furnished the Thracian with strength to fight you? I hope not! Here is the view
                    that I think the just one: if Charidemus makes it his business to get these
                    decrees, after perceiving and foreseeing that peril, you must distrust him as an
                    intriguer. <milestone n="134" unit="section"/>On the other hand, if he has
                    failed to discern the peril, the more you credit him with good intentions, the
                    more forethought you should exercise for his sake as well as your own. Honest
                    friends should not bestow upon their well-wishers such favours as will bring
                    disaster to both alike, but should rather cooperate in any action that tends to
                    their common advantage; and when a man is more far-sighted than his friend, he
                    should order things for the best, and not treat the gratification of the moment
                    as of more value than all future time. <milestone n="135" unit="section"
                        /><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Moreover, I cannot discover on reflection
                    that Cersobleptes, though both barbarous and faithless, is likely to take any
                    pains not to injure Charidemus so seriously; for when I look backwards and
                    observe the advantages of which Cotys was going to deprive Iphicrates without
                    the slightest consideration for him, I really cannot think that Cersobleptes
                    would trouble himself about the losses that will fall on Charidemus. <milestone
                        n="136" unit="section"/>Cotys expected to rob Iphicrates of honors, of
                    maintenance, of statues, of the country that made him a man to be envied, I may
                    almost say of everything that made life worth living; yet he had no scruple.
                    But, really, what is there of which this man should be anxious not to deprive
                    Charidemus? He has no possessions whatsoever in your city,&mdash;neither

                    justly distrusted because of his past behavior, and if there is nothing in the
                    political situation that should induce him, even against his judgement and his
                    character, to promote the welfare of Charidemus, for what reason should we, in
                    sheer absolute stupidity, help him to accomplish his desires, even to our own

                    the interest of our city to be known to have enacted anything of the sort. If,

                    unwarranted; but in fact it has been made for Charidemus, a man not domiciled in
                    any free state at all, but commanding an army for a Thracian and an autocrat,
                    and maltreating people by royal authority. <milestone n="139" unit="section"

                    anybody who comes his way, and to have given notice of expulsion from your

                    distinction is drawn as to what his general may or may not do, but when all who
                    resist his attacks are menaced with such terrors. <milestone n="141"

                    Philiscus,&mdash;just as you have recently given it to Charidemus for the
                    sake of Cersobleptes. Philiscus, who resembled Charidemus in his choice of a
                    career, began to use the power of Ariobarzanes by occupying Hellenic cities. He
                    entered them and committed many outrages, mutilating free-born boys, insulting
                    women, and behaving in general as you would expect a man, who had been brought
                    up where there were no laws, and none of the advantages of a free constitution,
                    to behave if he attained to power. <milestone n="142" unit="section"/>Now there
                    were two men in <placeName key="tgn,7002579">Lampsacus</placeName>, one named
                    Thersagoras and the other Execestus, who had formed views about tyranny very
                    much like those that prevail here. These men put Philiscus to death, as he
                    deserved, because they felt it their duty to liberate their own fatherland. Now
                    suppose that one of those orators who spoke on behalf of Philiscus, at a time
                    when he was paymaster of the mercenaries at Perinthus, when he held all the
                        <placeName key="tgn,7002638">Hellespont</placeName>, and was the most
                    powerful of viceroys, had then, like Aristocrates today, moved a resolution that
                    whosoever killed Philiscus should be liable to seizure in allied territory. I
                    entreat you to reflect upon the depth of ignominy to which our city would have
                    fallen. <milestone n="143" unit="section"/>Thersagoras and Execestus came to
                        <placeName key="tgn,7002672">Lesbos</placeName> and lived there. Well, if
                    any son or any friend of Philiscus had laid hands on them, they would have been
                    given up to justice in pursuance of your decree; and assuredly you would have
                    been guilty of a shameful and a scandalous act if, while ostentatiously setting
                    up bronze statues of the men who performed a similar feat in your own city, and
                    loading them with unparalleled honors, you had condemned to outlawry those who
                    in some other country had exhibited the selfsame spirit of patriotism. I am glad
                    to say that, in the case of Philiscus, it was not your fate to be ensnared and
                    to incur that great dishonor; but in the present case, if you will heed my
                    warning, you will be very careful; for, if there is no limiting clause and if
                    the phrase &ldquo;whosoever shall kill Charidemus&rdquo; is unqualified,
                    it is quite possible that the outcome will be such as I have described.

                    purpose is briefly to examine the past history of Charidemus, and to unmask the
                    extraordinary audacity of his flatterers. I pledge myself simply to
                    this,&mdash;and I hope no one will take my pledge in bad
                    part,&mdash;that I will satisfy you, not only that he is unworthy of the
                    protection proposed by the defendant, but that he deserves to be most severely
                    punished, if chastisement is justly due to those who wish you ill, and cheat
                    you, and are always trying to thwart you. <milestone n="145" unit="section"/>I
                    dare say that some of you, reflecting that the fellow has first been made a
                    citizen, and thereafter has been decorated with crowns of gold, are astonished
                    that it has been such an easy task to delude you so completely. Well, you may be
                    quite sure, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, that you
                    have been deluded; and I will explain why such a result was to be expected. You
                    have plenty of good judgement; but you do not apply it persistently. <milestone
                        n="146" unit="section"/>I mean this, for instance: suppose you were asked
                    which you regard as the most unprincipled breed of citizens you have; you would
                    not name the farmers, or the traders, or the silver-miners, or any class like
                    those, but if any one named the people who make speeches and move resolutions
                    for hire, I am sure that your assent would be unanimous. So far your judgement
                    is excellent; but it is no longer sound in the sequel. <milestone n="147"
                        unit="section"/>For it is on the very people whom you regard as most
                    unprincipled that you rely for a right opinion of a man's character and they
                    describe this or that man as virtuous or wicked, not when the description is
                    honest and true, but when it brings money into their own pockets. And that is
                    what the orators have constantly done in respect of Charidemus, as you will
                    agree when I have given you an account of his past career. <milestone n="148"
                        unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>I do not reckon among his
                    misdeeds those campaigns of his early life, in which he served against
                        <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> as a slinger or
                    light-infantry man; nor that he once owned a piratical ship and preyed on your
                    allies. But I pass these things by. And for what reason? Because, gentlemen,
                    hard necessity does away with all consideration of what anyone should or should
                    not do; and therefore in such matters a candid examiner must not be too
                    fastidious. But let me tell you of the mischief he did to you at the outset of
                    his career as a mercenary officer with troops under his command. <milestone
                        n="149" unit="section"/>First of all, he was hired by Iphicrates, and drew
                    pay in his army for more than three years. When you had cashiered Iphicrates,
                    and dispatched Timotheus as commander-in-chief to <placeName
                        key="perseus,Amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName> and the <placeName
                        key="tgn,7012057">Chersonesus</placeName>, the man's first performance was
                    to surrender to the Amphipolitans those hostages of theirs whom Iphicrates had
                    taken from Harpalus, and put under his care, although you had ordered them to be
                    conveyed to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>. That act
                    prevented you from occupying <placeName key="perseus,Amphipolis"
                        >Amphipolis</placeName>. Secondly, when Timotheus in his turn wanted to hire
                    him and his troops, he refused the engagement, and repaired by sea to Cotys,
                    taking with him your light galleys, though he was perfectly well aware that
                    Cotys was the most bitter enemy you had in the world. <milestone n="150"
                        unit="section"/>Subsequently, after the decision of Timotheus to take the
                    operations against <placeName key="perseus,Amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName>
                    before those against the <placeName key="tgn,7012057">Chersonesus</placeName>,
                    finding that there was no mischief he could do you in that country, he again
                    hired himself out,&mdash;this time to the Olynthians, who were your enemies
                    and were then holding <placeName key="perseus,Amphipolis"
                    >Amphipolis</placeName>. He set sail from Cardia for <placeName
                        key="perseus,Amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName>, with the intention of
                    fighting against <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, but on the
                    voyage he was captured by our fleet. But in view of the needs of the hour, and
                    because mercenaries were wanted for the war against <placeName
                        key="perseus,Amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName>, instead of being punished
                    for his refusal to deliver the hostages, and for deserting with the light
                    galleys to your enemy Cotys, guarantees were exchanged, and he entered the
                    campaign as your auxiliary. <milestone n="151" unit="section"/>He ought to have
                    been grateful to you because his life was spared when he might justly have been
                    put to death; but instead of that the city, as though she owed gratitude to him,
                    has bestowed upon him crowns and franchise and favours known to you
                    all.&mdash;To prove the truth of these allegations, please read the decree
                    respecting the hostages, the dispatch of Iphicrates, the dispatch of Timotheus,
                    and lastly this deposition.&mdash;You will find that what I am telling you
                    is not mere gossip and recrimination, but the plain truth.&mdash;Read.<quote

                    the evidence of the dispatch and the deposition, proving that at the outset
                    Charidemus sold his services to a country where he expected to fight against
                    you, though he had the choice of many other markets; that later, finding that in
                    that country he could do you no harm, he sailed back to a place where he had a
                    chance of operating against <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>;
                    and that he was the chief cause of your failure to take <placeName
                        key="perseus,Amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName>. Such were the early
                    exploits of Charidemus. You must now look at his later conduct. <milestone
                        n="153" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>After a certain lapse
                    of time, when the war with Cotys had already broken out, he sent a letter to
                    you; or rather, not to you but to Cephisodotus, for, being conscious of his
                    transgressions, he was very much of the opinion that the beguilement of
                        <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> was a task beyond his own
                    powers. In this letter he undertook to recover the <placeName key="tgn,7012057"
                        >Chersonesus</placeName> for <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName>; but his real intention was exactly the opposite. You
                    must be informed of the nature of this epistolary transaction,&mdash;it is
                    not a long story&mdash;and so get an insight into the fashion of this man's
                    dealings with you from first to last. <milestone n="154" unit="section"/>Being
                    at that time discharged from the service of Timotheus, he withdrew from
                        <placeName key="perseus,Amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName>, crossed the
                    straits to <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, and there, because of
                    the recent arrest of Artabazus by Autophradates, he hired out his forces and
                    himself to the sons-in-law of Artabazus. He had taken and given pledges, but he
                    ignored and broke his oaths, and, finding the inhabitants of the country, who
                    thought they were dealing with a friend, off their guard, he seized their towns,
                    Scepsis, Cebren, and <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilium</placeName>. <milestone
                        n="155" unit="section"/>Having taken possession of these strongholds, he had
                    a misadventure into which even an ordinary person, not to say a man calling
                    himself a commander, could never have blundered. Although he held no position on
                    the sea-coast, and had no means of supplying his troops with provisions, and
                    although he had no food in the towns, he remained within the walls, instead of
                    looting the towns and making off in pursuance of his intention to do mischief.
                    But Artabazus, having been released by Autophradates, collected an army, and
                    appeared on the scene; and he could draw supplies from the friendly countries of
                    upper <placeName key="tgn,7002613">Phrygia</placeName>, <placeName
                        key="tgn,7016631">Lydia</placeName>, and <placeName key="tgn,7016760"
                        >Paphlagonia</placeName>, while for Charidemus nothing remained but to stand
                    a siege. <milestone n="156" unit="section"/>When he realized what trouble he was
                    in, and came to the conclusion that he would be reduced by famine, if by no
                    other means, he made the discovery, whether by suggestion or by his own wits,
                    that his only chance of salvation lay where there is salvation for everybody.
                    And where is that? In your good-nature, if that is the right term, men of
                        <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>,&mdash;or call it
                    what you will. Having reached that conclusion, he dispatched the letter to
                    you,&mdash;and it is worth your while to hear it read. His desire was, by
                    means of a promise to recover the <placeName key="tgn,7012057"
                        >Chersonesus</placeName> for you, and on the pretence that such was also the
                    wish of Cephisodotus, as an enemy of Cotys and Iphicrates, to get a supply of
                    galleys from you, and so scuttle safely out of <placeName key="tgn,1000004"
                        >Asia</placeName>. <milestone n="157" unit="section"/>Do you remember the
                    immediate sequel, by which the trick was exposed in the very act? Memnon and
                    Mentor, the sons-in-law of Artabazus, were young men, enjoying unexpected good
                    fortune by their relationship to Artabazus. What they wanted was to govern the
                    country peaceably without delay, and to win distinction without warfare and
                    peril. Accordingly, they persuaded Artabazus to forgo his vengeance upon
                    Charidemus, and to send him off under an armistice, advising him that you would
                    bring Charidemus across with or without his consent: he could not possibly stop
                    you. <milestone n="158" unit="section"/>Having gained this unaccountable and
                    unforeseen deliverance, Charidemus crossed the sea to the <placeName
                        key="tgn,7012057">Chersonesus</placeName> without your authority by reason
                    of the armistice; but then, so far from attacking Cotys,&mdash;although he
                    had told you in his letter that Cotys would not repel his attack,&mdash;and
                    so far from helping you to recover the <placeName key="tgn,7012057"
                        >Chersonesus</placeName>, he entered the service of Cotys once more, and
                    began to beleaguer your last remaining strongholds, Crithote and Elaeus. You
                    will find proof in his route across the straits that he had already decided on
                    this action at the time when he was in <placeName key="tgn,1000004"
                        >Asia</placeName> and was sending you the letter, and therefore that he was
                    cheating you; for he crossed from <placeName key="tgn,6000031"
                        >Abydus</placeName>, a place always hostile to you, and the base from which
                    Sestus was captured, to Sestus, which was in the possession of Cotys. <milestone
                        n="159" unit="section"/>Yet you must not imagine that either the Abydenes or
                    the people at Sestus would have admitted him, after that letter had been sent to
                    you, if they had not been aware that he was cheating you, or if they had not
                    been actually parties to the deception. They wanted you to provide a safe
                    passage for the troops, and then, after the passage, to get the use of them for
                    their own purposes; as in fact they did, when Artabazus had granted a
                    safe-conduct.&mdash;To prove that such are the facts read the
                    letters,&mdash;I mean the letter sent by Charidemus, and those that came
                    from the authorities in the <placeName key="tgn,7012057"
                    >Chersonesus</placeName>.&mdash;You will learn from them that the facts are

                    not already clear from these facts, it will be more evident in the light of

                    Cersobleptes, the present king, was a mere boy, and so were all the sons of
                    Cotys; and Charidemus had got control of affairs, because he was on the spot and
                    had a force at his back. Cephisodotus, the man to whom he sent the famous
                    letter, had arrived in command of an army, and so had the galleys, which were to
                    have rescued him, even without the consent of Artabazus, when his deliverance
                    was in doubt. <milestone n="164" unit="section"/>Now what, men of <placeName

                    By no means. For seven whole months he persisted in making war on us, openly
                    displaying his hostility and withholding even the language of goodwill. At the
                    outset we took anchorage at Perinthus with only ten ships, having heard that he
                    was in the neighborhood, and hoping to meet him and talk matters over. He waited
                    till our men were having their breakfast, and then tried to take our ships,
                    killed a number of our sailors, and hunted every man of them into the sea with
                    his cavalry and light infantry. <milestone n="166" unit="section"/>Afterwards,
                    when we set sail&mdash;,no, it was not to attack any part of <placeName

                    damage,&mdash;in self-defence, you know, and to protect himself.&rdquo;
                    That is not true; we never went to any place in <placeName key="tgn,7002756"
                        >Thrace</placeName>; we went to Alopeconnesus, and that is in the <placeName

                    up his position, and persuaded or constrained your commander not to serve your
                    interests, instead of letting himself be persuaded by him to carry out some part
                    of his covenant and undertaking; and then he must needs draw up that convention
                    with Cephisodotus, by which you were so deeply annoyed and exasperated that you
                    dismissed your commander, and fined him five talents, and there was a majority

                    when Cephisodotus had been discharged from his command, and you held the view
                    that the convention made with him was improper and unfair, Miltocythes, who had
                    been consistently well-affected to you, was betrayed by Smicythion, and fell
                    into the hands of our honest friend. Knowing that the man's life would be spared
                    if he were taken to Cersobleptes,&mdash;for killing one another is not
                    customary among the Thracians,&mdash;Charidemus handed him over to your

                    deep water, cut the boy's throat, and then threw the father overboard, after he
                    had witnessed the murder of his son. <milestone n="170" unit="section"/>These
                    atrocities moved the whole population of <placeName key="tgn,7002756"
                        >Thrace</placeName> to resentment; Berisades and Amadocus made a coalition;
                    and Athenodorus, recognizing a favorable opportunity, formed alliance with them,
                    and so was in a position to make war. Then Cersobleptes took fright, and
                    Athenodorus proposed a convention, under which he compelled Cersobleptes to make
                    a sworn engagement with you and with the other princes that the kingdom of
                        <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName> should be held in common,
                    and divided among the three, and that they should all restore to you your
                    territory. <milestone n="171" unit="section"/>At the election of magistrates you
                    appointed Chabrias to command in that campaign; but unluckily Athenodorus
                    disbanded his army, because he had no money from you, and no resources for
                    carrying on war; and Chabrias started on his expedition with only one ship. And
                    how does this man Charidemus turn his coat? He repudiates his sworn covenant
                    with Athenodorus, persuades Cersobleptes to disclaim it, and proposes new terms
                    to Chabrias,&mdash;terms more monstrous than those made with Cephisodotus.
                    Chabrias was obliged to acquiesce, I suppose because he had no force at his
                    back. <milestone n="172" unit="section"/>When the news reached you, a great many
                    speeches were made in the Assembly; the conventions were read and compared; and,
                    without any respect for Chabrias's good name or for any of his supporters, you
                    in your turn cancelled the new convention, and resolved, on the motion of
                    Glauco, to elect ten citizens as ambassadors. If Cersobleptes would abide by his
                    covenant with Athenodorus, they were to make him renew his oath;if not, they
                    were to accept the oaths of the two kings, and concert measures for making war
                    on him. <milestone n="173" unit="section"/>The ambassadors took their departure;
                    but by mere lapse of time the business came to such a pass, with these men
                    dawdling and refusing to take any plain, honest action in your service, that we
                    sent a relief expedition to <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName>, and
                    Chares, on returning with his mercenaries, was sent out by you to the <placeName

                    two kings: here it is,&mdash;the best and most equitable of the lot. He has

                    to some of his misdeeds, let them all pass; why I did not object either when you
                    made him a citizen or when you gave him a vote of thanks; why, in short, I found
                    nothing to say at any time earlier than the passing of this decree. Men of

                        key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, I imagined that a great many men
                    glibly telling lies about him would overpower one man, namely myself, telling
                    the truth alone. Then as for the favours that he won by misleading you, I
                    solemnly protest that it never entered my head to grudge him any one of them. I
                    could not see that you would buffer any very grievous calamity, if you forgave a
                    man who had done you much wrong, and so encouraged him to do you good service in
                    future. Both these considerations applied to the grant of citizenship and to the

                    serve you and to stop him from acting against you,&mdash;I mean such men as
                    Athenodorus, Simon, Archebius of <placeName key="perseus,Byzantium"

                    might accept without being likely to do serious injury to the State, is the act
                    of one who has either a private grievance or the spirit of an informer, but that
                    to set myself in opposition to a project by which he was concerting very serious
                    detriment to the commonwealth is the act of an honest man and a patriotic

                    same sort by which they hope to lead you off the track. &ldquo;Cersobleptes
                    and Charidemus,&rdquo; they will say, &ldquo;did perhaps oppose
                        <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> at a time when they were
                    unfriendly; but now they are our friends, and wish to be useful friends. We
                    really must not be vindictive. When we were rescuing the Lacedaemonians, we
                    dismissed from our minds the injuries they had done to us as enemies; so too
                    with the Thebans, and, quite recently, with the Euboeans.&rdquo; <milestone
                        n="192" unit="section"/>&mdash;But I hold that this plea would have been
                    rightly offered, if they had offered it on some occasion when an expedition in
                    relief of Cersobleptes and Charidemus had been proposed, and we were trying to
                    block it. But, as we have here no such occasion and no such proposal, but only
                    the argument of men trying to make Cersobleptes more powerful than he deserves
                    by means of an immunity received from you by his generals, I regard their action
                    as dangerous. It is not fair, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName>, that the pleas of men seeking deliverance should be
                    offered to you in justification of men whose object is the power to do you
                    wrong. <milestone n="193" unit="section"/>Apart from that, if he had injured you
                    as an enemy, but had been reformed after claiming to be your friend, such an
                    excuse might, perhaps, have been acceptable; but, inasmuch as that is not so,
                    and as most of his deceptions fall after the date of his profession of
                    friendship, you ought to distrust him for his later, if not to dislike him for
                    his earlier, conduct. With regard, however, to not being
                    &ldquo;vindictive,&rdquo; I have this to say. The vindictive man is the
                    man who hunts up grievances in order to inflict injury; the man who bears them
                    in mind in order to be on his guard and not suffer injury, is a reasonable man.

                    they will make a suggestion of this sort: the man has now embarked on a course

                        >Athens</placeName> a good turn; if we condemn the decree, we shall be
                    discouraging him, and filling him with mistrust of us. Well, men of <placeName

                    consider it. If he were our friend honestly and in all sincerity, if he really
                    did intend to do us all manner of good, even then I should not think this
                    argument worthy of your attention. In my judgement there is no man who could
                    possibly do you so much service that for his sake you ought to perjure
                    yourselves and vote against proven justice. <milestone n="195" unit="section"

                    or else, if it is his desire to be really on good terms with us, he will make a
                    genuine effort to serve us well, having discovered that he can no longer
                    accomplish his purposes by chicanery. For that reason alone, if for no other,
                    you will do well to give your verdict against him. <milestone n="196"
                        unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>It is also opportune, men of

                    you will do well to follow their example; if you prefer your own, it rests with

                        <milestone n="197" unit="section"/>So they were not grateful to those who

                    a manner that was equally creditable to themselves and the recipients. They were
                    all men of merit, but they chose those men to lead them; and to men of sobriety,
                    who have a keen eye for realities, being raised to the primacy of a brave and
                    noble people is a far greater distinction than any effigy of bronze. <milestone

                        >Athens</placeName>, it is commonly said that <placeName key="tgn,7010886"
                        >Corcyra</placeName> was captured by Timotheus, that the Spartan battalion

                    But what about those bestowed on strangers? When Meno of <placeName

                    slew Meno should be liable to seizure; they made him a citizen, and thought that
                    distinction adequate. <milestone n="200" unit="section"/>Or take Perdiccas, who
                    was reigning in <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> at the time
                    of the Persian invasion, and who destroyed the Persians on their retreat from

                    in some way, besides conferring on him all manner of great rewards, they
                    associated with him Phrasierides and Polysthenes, who were not even free-born,

                    while concentrating on that, they attached two other names to his. One is the
                    man of whose many misdeeds you have just heard the story. The other is named

                    bring them in guilty, you assess the penalty at five-and-twenty drachmas. In
                    those old times the State was wealthy and splendid, but in private life no man
                    held his head higher than the multitude. <milestone n="207" unit="section"/>Here
                    is the proof: if any of you know the sort of house that Themistocles or
                    Miltiades or any of those distinguished men of old lived in, you may observe
                    that it is no grander than the common run of houses. On the other hand, both the
                    structure and the equipment of their Public buildings were on such a scale and
                    of such quality that no opportunity of surpassing them was left to coming
                    generations. Witness those gate-houses, docks, porticoes, the great harbor, and
                    all the edifices with which you see our city adorned. <milestone n="208"

                    such superfluity of wealth that some of them have built private dwelling-houses
                    more magnificent than many public buildings; and others have bought larger
                    estates than all you people in this court possess between you; while, as for the
                    public buildings that you put up and whitewash, I am ashamed to say how mean and
                    shabby they are. Can you name anything that you have acquired and that you will

                    citizens like these are squandering as fast as they can,&mdash;but they
                    cannot annihilate it, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>;

                    public expense. Whenever you wanted anything, you had more money in your
                    treasury than any other Hellenic people, insomuch that you always started on any
                    expedition with pay for the full period named in the decree authorizing such
                    expedition. Now, while the administrators of public affairs have risen from
                    poverty to affluence, and are provided with ample maintenance for a long time to
                    come, you have not enough money laid by for a single day's expenditure, and when
                    something must be done, you are at once without the means of doing it. The
                    nation was then the master, as it is now the servant, of the politicians.

                        <milestone n="215" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Before I
                    leave the tribune, gentlemen of the jury, I wish to add some brief observations
                    upon the statutes that we have adduced. If you will bear them in mind, I think
                    that you will keep a better look-out for any attempts these men may make to
                    cajole and mislead you. The first statute expressly ordains that, if any man
                    slay another, the Areopagus shall take cognizance. Aristocrates proposes that
                    such a manslayer shall be liable to seizure without more ado. Mark that
                    carefully, and remember that to make a man an outlaw without trial is exactly
                    the opposite of trying him. <milestone n="216" unit="section"/>The second
                    statute forbids personal maltreatment or extortion even in the case of a
                    convicted homicide. Aristocrates, by making him liable to seizure, has permitted
                    such misusage; for it will be competent for captors to treat the man as they
                    will. The statute provides that the culprit shall be conveyed to the judges,
                    even though arrested in the country of his victim. He allows the homicide on
                    seizure to be taken to the house of the prosecutor, even though the capture be
                    effected in foreign parts. <milestone n="217" unit="section"/>There are certain
                    injuries for which the statute permits life to be taken. Aristocrates, even
                    though the life be taken in such circumstances, makes no reservation, but
                    permits a man whom the laws release without penalty to be handed over for
                    punishment. When a man has suffered this misfortune, the law enjoins that
                    satisfaction be first claimed. In defiance of this law he proposes no trial,
                    demands no redress from the persons on whom he has such claim, but declares
                    incontinently that the man is liable to seizure, and puts under an immediate ban
                    anyone who tries to rescue him. <milestone n="218" unit="section"/>The statute
                    provides that not more than three hostages may be taken from the people with
                    whom the offender lives, if they refuse to give satisfaction. The defendant puts
                    under ban without more ado whosoever rescues the accused from his captors
                    because he is unwilling to surrender him before judgement. The statute forbids
                    anyone to introduce a new law without making it applicable to all men alike; he
                    composes a special decree in favour of a particular man. The statute does not
                    permit any decree to override the law. The relevant laws are many, but
                    Aristocrates annuls them all and makes a mere decree supreme. <milestone n="219"
                        unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Bear all this in mind and
                    memory so long as you sit in that box. Dismiss all the fallacious reasons they

                    in which he has proposed a trial, or the clause that punishes a man duly
                    convicted of murder. If he had provided for the due punishment of a man tried
                    and found guilty elsewhere, or if he had himself proposed a trial to determine
                    whether homicide has been committed or not, and if so whether justifiably or
                    not, he would have done no wrong. <milestone n="220" unit="section"/>But
                    inasmuch as, after a phrase of mere accusation, &ldquo;if any man

                    murder,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;is adjudged to have killed,&rdquo; or,
                    &ldquo;he shall submit to judgement for the murder,&rdquo; or,
                    &ldquo;he shall be liable to the same penalty as if he had killed an
                    Athenian,&rdquo; he has omitted every just precaution, and has simply made
                    the man liable to seizure, do not be led astray, but be assured that in this
                    decree the laws have been absolutely contravened.</p>

                    gentlemen of the jury, that even Timocrates can lay the blame of the present
                    prosecution upon anyone else: he has brought it on himself. Moved by desire to
                    deprive the State of a large sum of money, he has most illegally introduced a
                    law which is both inexpedient and iniquitous. You shall presently learn in
                    detail, if you will listen to me, in how many respects this law, if ratified,
                    will be injurious and detrimental to the common weal; but there is one result,
                    the most important and the most obvious that I can name, which I shall not
                    hesitate to put before you. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>For it is the
                    decision that you pronounce on oath on every question which is annulled and made
                    worthless by the law proposed by the defendant; and his object is not any public
                    benefit to the State,&mdash;that is impossible, for his law robs those
                    Courts of Justice, which are the pillars of the constitution, of all power to
                    impose the additional penalties attached by the laws to
                    transgressions,&mdash;but that certain of those men who have long battened

                    certain persons than to stand up in defence of your rights that, while
                    Timocrates has their fee in his pocket, and never introduced his law until he
                    got it, I,so far from getting any reward from you, am risking a thousand

                    the question for you today is this: shall all the laws that you have enacted for
                    the restraint of evil-doers be invalidated, and this law alone be valid; or
                    shall this law be annulled and the rest allowed to remain? That, to put it in

                    to offer a brief explanation, which will not be irrelevant to the issue. Men of
                        <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, I once fell out with a
                    worthless, quarrelsome, unprincipled fellow, with whom in the end the whole city

                    this man I was far more grievously wronged than Euctemon, inasmuch as Euctemon
                    suffered the loss of some money, but I, if he had made good his attack upon me,
                    should have lost my life as well as my property; indeed, even the common
                    privilege of an easy exit from life would have been denied me. He accused me of
                    a crime which a man of good feeling would be loath even to mention,&mdash;of
                    having killed my own father; he concocted an indictment for impiety, and brought
                    me to trial. At that trial he failed to get a fifth part of the votes of the
                    jury, and was fined a thousand drachmas. I was deservedly acquitted, for which I
                    thank first the gods, and secondly those of you who were on the jury; <milestone
                        n="8" unit="section"/>but the man who had wickedly brought me to that pass I
                    accounted an enemy with whom I could make no terms. When I discovered that he
                    had defrauded the whole commonwealth in the collection of the property-tax and
                    in the manufacture of processional utensils, and that he held and refused to
                    restore a great deal of money belonging to the Goddess, the Heroes, and the
                    State, I proceeded against him with the aid of Euctemon, thinking it a favorable
                    opportunity for doing the State a service, and at the same time getting
                    satisfaction for the wrongs I had suffered. My purpose would naturally be that I
                    should accomplish my desire, and that he should get his deserts. <milestone

                    him; the Assembly spent a whole day over the case; two juries, each a
                    thousand-and-one strong, brought in their verdict; and then, when there was no
                    subterfuge left by which you could be kept out of your money, this man
                    Timocrates, with the most insolent contempt of the whole proceeding, proposes

                    was moved by Aristophon in the Assembly, appointing a commission of inquiry, and
                    directing anyone, who knew of any sacred or public money in private hands, to
                    give information to the commission. Thereupon Euctemon laid an information that
                    Archebius and Lysitheides, who had served as naval captains, held property
                    captured in a ship of <placeName key="tgn,7001241">Naucratis</placeName> to the
                    value of nine talents and thirty minas. He approached the Council, and a

                    at the time of capture. He reminded you of the statutes by which in such
                    circumstances the property belongs to the State. <milestone n="13"

                    Glaucetes, and Melanopus sprang to their feet,&mdash;and here you may judge
                    whether I am telling the truth,&mdash;made noisy, indignant, abusive
                    speeches, exonerated the captains, admitted that the money was in their hands,
                    and asked that the inquiry should proceed at their own houses. You listened to
                    them; and, when their clamor had subsided, Euctemon offered a proposal, the
                    fairest that could possibly be made, that you should demand payment from the
                    captains, that they should apply in turn to the men in possession, and that any
                    dispute as to liability should be adjudicated, the loser of such action to be
                    indebted to the State. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>They challenge the
                    decree; it is brought before this Court; and to cut the story short, it was held
                    to be legal, and escaped condemnation. Now what should have been the sequel? The
                    State should have got the money, and the embezzler should have been punished;
                    but assuredly there was no need of any new statute whatsoever. So far no wrong
                    had been done to you by Timocrates, the defendant in this case; but afterwards
                    he took over responsibility for everything that I have recounted, and it will be
                    shown that the whole of your injuries are due to him. He made himself the hired
                    agent of the artifices and impostures of these men, and, by that offer of his
                    services, as I will prove to your satisfaction, he took upon himself the burden
                    of their iniquities. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/>However, to begin with, I
                    must remind you of dates, and of the conjuncture at which he proposed his new
                    law; and indeed it will be apparent that he was impertinently laughing in your
                    faces. It was the month of Scirophorion when those men lost the action they
                    brought against Euctemon. Then they hired this man, and, without making the
                    least preparation to satisfy your claim, they put up some newsmongers to tell
                    people in the market-place that they were ready to pay the bare amount of the
                    debt, but that they really could not afford to pay it twice over.<note

                    over a shilling of the money, while they disannulled most of the established

                    useful for the rest of my speech. In our laws at present in force, men of

                    prescribed time for legislation; but even at the proper time a man is not
                    permitted to propose his law just as he pleases. He is directed, in the first
                    place, to put it in writing and post it in front of the Heroes for everyone to
                    see. Then it is ordained that the law must be of universal application, and also
                    that laws of contrary purport must be repealed; and there are other directions
                    with which I do not think I need trouble you now. If a man disobeys any of these
                    directions, anyone who chooses is empowered to indict him. <milestone n="19"
                        unit="section"/>Now if Timocrates had not been liable to prosecution on
                    every count, if he had not contravened every one of these directions when he
                    introduced his law, a single charge, whatever it might be, would have been
                    preferred against him; but, as the matter stands, I am compelled to take the
                    points one by one and address you on each in its turn. I will therefore take his
                    first offence first, that is, that he tried to legislate in defiance of all the
                    statutes. Afterwards I will deal in turn with any other topic on which you are
                    willing to hear me.&mdash;Please take the statutes,&mdash;here they
                    are,&mdash;and read them.&mdash;You will find that he has not satisfied

                    whose operation had been deferred to a date later than their enactment, and so

                    transactions. He did not even define the initial date by naming an archonship;

                    that your law was disadvantageous to the State, you might not have been

                    discussion it is surely that which the clerk has just read. The author of that

                    sanction of law should enjoy the benefit of your good-nature, falling back upon
                    prayers and solicitation in their distress. Accordingly he strictly forbade
                    either the culprit himself or anyone else to supplicate you or make speeches
                    upon such complaints; they must do what justice demands in silence. <milestone

                    you have put outside your law, you cannot claim that you have made the same law
                    for all alike. <milestone n="60" unit="section"/>And there is another thing that
                    you cannot say,&mdash; that of all persons punished by imprisonment tax
                    farmers are the greatest offenders and do us the gravest wrong, and that that is
                    why you do not give them the benefit of your law. Surely men who are traitors to
                    the commonwealth, men who maltreat their own parents, men who enter the
                    market-place with unclean hands, offend far more heinously; and all those
                    criminals are threatened with imprisonment by the standing laws, while your law
                    offers them instant release. But here again you reveal the men in whose favour
                    you moved your law. They got into our debt not by tax-farming, but by
                    embezzling, or rather by plundering, our money; and that, I warrant you, is the
                    true reason why you had no consideration for the tax-farmers. <milestone n="61"

                    that the law is altogether disadvantageous to the citizens. On the other hand,
                    even if it is repugnant to one only of the existing laws, you can have no doubt
                    that it is open to the indictment. What, then, is my decision? To pass over all
                    the other laws, but to discuss one law proposed on a former occasion by the
                    defendant himself, before I proceed to that part of my accusation in which I
                    allege that the law, if operative, will be most injurious to the commonwealth.

                    that, so far as effrontery goes, such a man is ready to do anything. Inasmuch,
                    therefore, as the laws provide that evil doers of other kinds shall upon

                    is now, I suppose, manifest to every one of you. I really wonder what he will
                    have the face to say about those statutes. He cannot show that his law does not
                    contradict the others; and he will not be able to convince you that he is a
                    simple layman who did not know what he was doing through lack of experience,
                    because for a long time past he has been celebrated for composing and
                    introducing laws at so much apiece. Moreover, there is another course that is

                    done wrong and then plead that he deserves forgiveness; for it is quite clear
                    that he did not propose his law unwillingly, or to help the distressed, or his
                    own family, or people who have a claim upon him. He did it by intention, on
                    behalf of men who have done you a grave injury, and who are in no way related to
                    him,&mdash;unless he pretends that payment of wages is a bond of kinship.

                    do my best to prove that the law he introduced is unacceptable and
                    disadvantageous to the citizens. I presume that you will all agree with me that
                    a really wholesome law, such as is calculated to benefit the people, ought, in
                    the first place, to be drawn simply and intelligibly, not in such terms that one
                    man thinks it means this and another that; and, secondly, that the proceedings
                    prescribed by the law ought to be practicable, for if a law, though well-meant,
                    were to enjoin what is impossible, it would be attempting the work not of a law,
                    but of a prayer. <milestone n="69" unit="section"/>Furthermore, it should
                    plainly appear that it does not offer an easy time to any wrongdoer. For if
                    anyone supposes that indulgent laws are the mark of popular government, let him
                    ask this further question: to whom are they to be indulgent? If he will look at
                    the matter rightly, he will find that the answer is, to persons who are going to
                    be tried, not to persons already convicted. For of the former we may say that it
                    is still uncertain whether they have been unjustly calumniated; but the latter
                    can no longer plead that they are not evil-doers. <milestone n="70"

                    none of the traits I have enumerated, but the very opposite, taking them one by
                    one. There are many ways in which I might make good that statement; the best
                    will be to go through the law itself, phrase by phrase. It is not a law
                    well-conceived in parts, and defective in parts; from beginning to end, from the

                    the most scandalous provision of the whole statute. I do not think that any
                    other man, when introducing a law for the use of his fellow-citizens, ever
                    ventured upon an attempt to rescind judgements passed under earlier statutes.
                    Yet that is what the defendant Timocrates has done without shame and even
                    without concealment, inserting these plain words: &ldquo;if the additional
                    penalty of imprisonment has been or shall hereafter be inflicted in pursuance of
                    any law or decree upon any person in debt to the treasury.&rdquo; <milestone

                    the future, there would have been no harm in it but, when a court of justice has
                    given its verdict and determined the issue, is it not outrageous to introduce a
                    law by which that verdict is to be rescinded? It is as though, after allowing
                    the law of Timocrates to become operative, someone should draft a second law to
                    this effect: &ldquo;if any persons being indebted, and having had the
                    further penalty of imprisonment passed upon them, shall have put in sureties as
                    the law directs, they shall not be entitled to such bail, and it shall not be
                    lawful hereafter to release anyone on bail.&rdquo; <milestone n="74"
                        unit="section"/>I suppose that no man in his senses would do such a thing;
                    and you, sir, were guilty when you tried to annul those other provisions. For if
                    he thought it a fair thing to do, his proper course was to introduce a law
                    governing future transactions; not to lump together all offences, past and
                    future, proven and unproven, and then register an indiscriminate judgement upon
                    all together. Surely it is outrageous that men who have already been convicted
                    of offences against the common weal should be deemed worthy of the same judicial
                    treatment as men of whom it is not yet known whether they will ever do anything
                    that deserves prosecution? <milestone n="75" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P"
                        unit="para"/>Again, we may discern how monstrously he has acted in making
                    his law retrospective, by asking ourselves what is the real difference between
                    government by law and oligarchy; and why we regard those who prefer to live
                    under laws as honest, sober-minded persons, and those who submit to oligarchical
                    rule as cowards and slaves. <milestone n="76" unit="section"/>The outstanding
                    difference you will find to be really this: under oligarchical government
                    everybody is entitled to undo the past, and to prescribe future transactions
                    according to his own pleasure; whereas the laws of a free state prescribe what
                    shall be done in the future, such laws having been enacted by convincing people
                    that they will be beneficial to those who live under them. Timocrates however,
                    legislating in a democratically governed city, has introduced into his law the
                    characteristic iniquity of oligarchy; and in dealing with past transactions has
                    presumed to claim for himself an authority higher than that of the convicting
                    jury. <milestone n="77" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Nor is
                    this the only example of his arrogance. It is further enacted that &ldquo;if
                    hereafter the additional penalty of imprisonment shall have been imposed, the
                    prisoner may be released on producing sureties for payment of his
                    fine.&rdquo; If he really thought imprisonment such a dreadful infliction,
                    his proper course was to enact that no man who produces sureties shall be
                    committed to prison; but not, having first found that you have passed sentence
                    of imprisonment and so incurred the resentment of the convict, then to give him
                    a discharge on bail. In fact, he has introduced his law in this fashion by way
                    of advertising himself as one who will, on his own authority, release prisoners,
                    though you may have decided to keep them in jail. <milestone n="78"
                        unit="section"/>Can anyone see any public advantage in a law that is to

                    to cancel the judgements of sworn juries ? I hope not. It is clear that the law
                    of Timocrates has both these faults; and if you have, each one of you, any
                    regard for the constitution, or if you claim authority for your own decision of
                    the questions on which you give your verdict under oath, you must abrogate a law

                    destroying the authority of this court in respect of additional penalties, but
                    you will find that even the proceedings which he has prescribed in his law, and
                    imposed upon culprits who have been condemned, have not been drafted with
                    honesty and sincerity, but as though his main purpose was to mislead and
                    overreach you. Observe the phrasing: &ldquo;Moved by Timocrates that, if the

                    pursuance of any law or decree upon any person in debt to the treasury, it shall
                    be competent for him or for any other person on his behalf to nominate as
                    sureties for the debt such persons as shall be approved on vote by the

                    has taken from the court of justice and its sentences! Even to the Assembly; for
                    he steals the person of the criminal, as well as the right to hand him over to
                    the Eleven. What magistrate will ever hand over the delinquent? What member of
                    the Eleven will ever accept custody? The order of Timocrates is that sureties
                    are to be nominated in the Assembly; it is impossible for the Assembly and the
                    Courts to be in session on the same day; and there is no injunction to keep the
                    man in custody until he has named his sureties. <milestone n="81" unit="section"
                    />Why should he have been afraid to add a distinct injunction that
                    &ldquo;the magistrate shall keep the delinquent in custody until he shall
                    have put in his sureties&rdquo;? Is not that quite fair? I am sure you will
                    all say yes. Would it have been contrary to any statute ? No, indeed; it would
                    have been the only clause that does conform to the statutes. Then what was his
                    reason? There is no discoverable reason except this,&mdash;that his purpose
                    was not to help but to obstruct the punishment of criminals condemned by you.
                        <milestone n="82" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Well, how
                    does it go on? &ldquo;To nominate sureties on an undertaking to pay in full
                    the amount in which he was indebted.&rdquo; Here again he has stolen away
                    the right of the sacred funds to a tenfold payment, and one-half of the claim of
                    the civil treasury, in cases where double payment is required by law. And how
                    does he manage that? By writing &ldquo;the amount&rdquo; instead of
                    &ldquo;the penalty,&rdquo; and &ldquo;in which he was
                    indebted&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;which has accrued.&rdquo;
                        <milestone n="83" unit="section"/>The difference is this: if he had proposed
                    that sureties should be appointed to guarantee the payment of the accruing
                    penalty, he would have embraced in his enactment the statutes under which
                    certain debts are doubled, and others multiplied by ten; and so the debtor would
                    have been obliged not only to pay in full the amount of the debt as recorded,
                    but also to liquidate the penal payments legally added thereto. As it is, by the
                    words &ldquo;nominate sureties on an undertaking to pay in full the amount
                    in which he was indebted,&rdquo; he makes the payment depend on the plaint
                    and the documents upon which the several delinquents were brought to trial; and

                    such a big hole in the laws by juggling with words, he adds: &ldquo;the

                    any debtor wishes to nominate sureties,&rdquo; for right through his law he
                    thinks it his business to rescue the criminal who has been convicted in this
                    court. By allowing the nomination of sureties to take place at the pleasure of
                    the delinquent, he puts it into his power never to pay, and never to go to
                    prison. <milestone n="85" unit="section"/>Of course he will put forward men of
                    straw, and by the time you have rejected them, he will be out of your reach. For
                    if anyone demands his retention in jail for failing to produce sureties, he will
                    reply that he has done so, and intends to do so; and then he will point to the
                    statute of Timocrates, which bids him nominate sureties whenever he likes, but
                    says nothing about custody in the meantime, which gives no instruction for
                    imprisonment in case you reject the sureties, which is, in short, a sort of
                    universal talisman for would-be evil-doers. <milestone n="86" unit="section"

                    sureties,&rdquo; he goes on, &ldquo;shall be released from the penalty
                    of imprisonment on payment to the State of the money in respect of which he gave
                    sureties.&rdquo; Here again he persisted in the trick I mentioned just now;
                    he had not forgotten it; he enacted that the man shall be released from prison
                    on payment, not of the accruing penalty, but of the original debt. <milestone

                    the sureties shall be confiscated.&rdquo; In this final clause, you will
                    find, he has at last become the accuser of his own iniquities in the fullest
                    sense. He did not forbid imprisonment on the broad ground that to imprison a
                    free citizen is something shameful or terrible; but he stole from you your
                    chance of catching your criminal in the place where he is, and so he left to
                    you, who are the party aggrieved, the empty name of retribution, but robbed you
                    of the reality. Without your consent he gave a discharge to people who forcibly
                    appropriate your money; and he was within an ace of adding a clause enabling an
                    action at law against the juries that had imposed the penalty of imprisonment.
                        <milestone n="88" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>But of all
                    the objectionable enactments of his law, that of which I will now speak deserves
                    our most vehement indignation. From beginning to end it is addressed to
                    delinquents who put in sureties; but there is neither prosecution nor penalty
                    for the man who offers no sureties, good or bad, but simply defies you. For that
                    man he has provided the fullest imaginable impunity. The days of grace, defined
                    as extending to the ninth presidency, he offers to the man who has put in bail.
                        <milestone n="89" unit="section"/>You will see the point by observing that
                    he adds a clause to the effect that the property of the sureties shall be
                    confiscated, if they do not pay the debt in full. Yes, but suppose a man has not
                    named any sureties,&mdash;then of course there are no sureties to punish. He
                    compels the Commissioners, men chosen for that office by lot from the ranks of
                    the citizens, to accept sureties whenever named; but on men who defraud the
                    commonwealth he imposes no sort of compulsion,&mdash;he treats them as
                    benefactors, and gives them the right to choose whether they will be punished or
                    not. <milestone n="90" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Could any
                    conceivable statute be more unsound or more opposed to your interests? First, it
                    enjoins the reversal of your judgements in cases long ago decided; and secondly,
                    in cases still to be tried, while instructing sworn jurors to inflict penalties,
                    it makes those penalties inoperative. Further, it enfranchises state-debtors who
                    do not discharge their liabilities, and, in general, it makes an exhibition of
                    you jurors as men whose oaths, whose penalties, whose verdicts, whose censures,
                    whose acts, in short, are all utterly futile. For my part, I conceive that if
                    the author of the statute had been Critias of the Thirty Tyrants, he would
                    hardly have framed and introduced it in any other fashion than this. <milestone

                    easily be convinced that this law upsets the constitution, throws public
                    business into confusion, and denudes the commonwealth of many honorable
                    ambitions. For you cannot be unconscious that our city has often owed her safety
                    to the warlike adventures of our navy and our land forces; and that you have
                    frequently performed glorious achievements in the deliverance, or the
                    chastisement, or the reconciliation, of other cities. What do I infer?

                    organized by the aid of those decrees and laws under which you levy
                    contributions on some citizens, and require others to furnish war-galleys; bid
                    some to serve in the navy, and others to perform their several duties. With that
                    object, therefore, you impanel juries, and punish the insubordinate with
                    imprisonment. Now mark how this gallant gentleman's statute vitiates and makes
                    havoc of all that business. <milestone n="93" unit="section"/>His clause reads,
                    you remember: &ldquo;if the penalty of imprisonment has been or shall
                    hereafter be inflicted upon any debtor, he shall, on nominating sureties on an
                    undertaking to pay the money during the ninth presidency, be released from
                    imprisonment.&rdquo; Then where are our resources? How shall any expedition
                    be dispatched? How shall we collect ways and means, if every defaulter nominates
                    sureties under this man's act instead of discharging his obligation? <milestone
                        n="94" unit="section"/>I presume that our reply to the Hellenic world will
                    be: &ldquo;We have a law here,&mdash;the statute of Timocrates. Kindly
                    wait till the ninth presidency; then after that we will start.&rdquo; No
                    other excuse is left. And if you have to fight in self-defence, do you really

                    for her own discomfiture, laws exactly contrary to her own interests, do you

                    law that makes havoc of everything by which our city has earned the respect and
                    admiration of the world, is there any punishment that you do not deserve to

                    />Moreover, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, the law
                    shatters our financial system, both sacred and civil; and I will tell you how.
                    You have a law in operation, as good a law as ever was enacted, that holders of
                    sacred or civil moneys shall pay the money in to the Council house, and that,
                    failing such payment, the Council shall recover the money by enforcing the
                    statutes applicable to tax-farmers; <milestone n="97" unit="section"/>and on
                    that law the administration of the treasury depends. That is the law that
                    ensures the supplementary supply for the expenses of meetings of the Assembly,
                    religious services, the Council, the cavalry, and so forth, because the revenue
                    from taxation is not sufficient for current expenses, and what we call the
                    supplementary payments are made under the constraint of that law. <milestone
                        n="98" unit="section"/>It follows that the whole business of the State must
                    go to rack and ruin when, the payments on account of taxation being
                    insufficient, there is a large deficiency, when that deficiency cannot be made
                    up until towards the end of the year, and when, as regards the supplementary
                    payments, neither the Council nor the law-courts have authority to imprison
                    defaulters, if they put in sureties until the ninth presidency. <milestone
                        n="99" unit="section"/>What are we to do for the first eight ? Tell us this,
                    Timocrates: are we never to meet and deliberate? If so, shall we still be living
                    under popular government? Shall there be no sessions of the courts, civil or
                    criminal? If so, what security will there be for complainants? Shall the Council
                    not attend at their office to transact their legal business? If so, what remains
                    but complete disorganization? You nay reply that we shall go on without payment
                    of fees. Then is it not monstrous that the Assembly, the Council, and the
                    law-courts must go unpaid for the sake of a statute which you were paid to
                    introduce? <milestone n="100" unit="section"/>You ought at least to have added a
                    clause, as you did in dealing with the tax-farmers and their sureties, that
                    &ldquo;if in any other statute or decree it is provided that the debts of
                    any defaulter may be recovered as in the case of tax-farmers, recovery from such
                    defaulters shall be effected in accordance with the existing laws.&rdquo;
                        <milestone n="101" unit="section"/>&mdash;But in fact he went out of his
                    way to avoid the statutes of tax-farming; and, because Euctemon's decree did
                    authorize recovery from losers of suits according to those statutes, for that
                    very reason he omitted to add the clause. In that manner, by cancelling the
                    existing punishment of public defaulters without substituting any other, he
                    makes havoc of all our business,&mdash;the Assembly, the cavalry, the
                    Council, the sacred funds, the civil revenue. And for that offence, men of
                        <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, if you are wise men, he
                    will be chastised and treated as he deserves, and so made an example to deter
                    others from bringing in such laws. <milestone n="102" unit="section"/><milestone
                        ed="P" unit="para"/>Not only, then, does he deprive the court of authority
                    in respect of supplementary payments, offer immunity to defrauders of the State,
                    cripple our national service, and undermine our financial system, but also, by
                    abrogating the penalties imposed by the existing statutes, he has enacted his
                    law for the benefit of swindlers, parricides, and shirkers. <milestone n="103"
                        unit="section"/>The statutes enacted by Solon, a very different legislator
                    from the defendant, provided that if a man is convicted of theft, and not

                    ill-treating his parents intrudes upon the market-place, he shall go to jail;
                    and that if a man, having been convicted of shirking military service, behaves
                    as though he were not disfranchised, he also shall be imprisoned. Timocrates
                    gives impunity to all these offenders, for he abolishes imprisonment if they put
                    in bail. <milestone n="104" unit="section"/>Therefore, in my judgement
                    &rpar;and though you may think what I am going to say rather coarse, I will
                    say it without hesitation&lpar;, he deserves, on that very account, to be
                    punished with death, so that he may pass this law in Hell for the benefit of the

                    I propose to reckon up how I have fulfilled the promises I made at the outset of
                    my address. I undertook to prove that he is amenable to the indictment in every
                    respect, first, because he legislated illegally; secondly, because his proposals
                    were contrary to existing statutes; and thirdly, because they were injurious to
                    the commonwealth. Well, you have now heard the statutes, and what they enjoin
                    upon the author of a new law; and again I have satisfied you that the defendant

                    manifestly at variance; and you are aware that he has introduced it without
                    repeal of those statutes. And you have certainly heard that the law is
                    detrimental, for I have only just left off telling you so. Therefore he is
                    unquestionably guilty on every count, and in nothing has he shown consideration
                    or scruple; but, as it seems to me, if anything else had been forbidden by the

                    propose a law to deprive you of the double repayment of civil, and the tenfold
                    repayment of sacred, liabilities! Thus the whole mass of you citizens has been
                    attacked by a man who was immediately afterwards to pretend that he had framed
                    his law as a friend of the people. <milestone n="112" unit="section"/>In my
                    view, no punishment could be too severe for a man who, when some market-clerk,
                    or street-inspector, or judge of a local court,&mdash;some poor, unskilled
                    man, without experience, and appointed to his office by lot,&mdash;has been
                    found guilty of peculation at the audits, demands from him a tenfold
                    restitution, and has no new law to propose for the relief of such delinquents,
                    and then, when ambassadors, elected by vote of the people, men of substance,
                    have embezzled and long retained large sums of money, the property in part of
                    the temples, in part of the treasury, is at great pains to invent for them a way
                    of escape from penalties ordained both by decree and by statute. <milestone
                        n="113" unit="section"/>And yet Solon, gentlemen of the jury,&mdash;and
                    even Timocrates cannot pretend to be a legislator of the same calibre as
                    Solon,&mdash;so far from providing such defaulters with the means of
                    swindling in security, actually introduced a law to ensure that they should
                    either refrain from crime or be adequately punished. For a theft in day-time of
                    more than fifty drachmas a man might be arrested summarily and put into custody
                    of the Eleven. If he stole anything, however small, by night, the person
                    aggrieved might lawfully pursue and kill or wound him, or else put him into the
                    hands of the Eleven, at his own option. A man found guilty of an offence for
                    which arrest is lawful was not allowed to put in bail and refund the stolen
                    money; no, the penalty was death. <milestone n="114" unit="section"/>Or suppose
                    that he stole a cloak, or an oil-flask, or any such trifle, from the Lyceum, or
                    the Academy, or Cynosarges, or any utensil from the gymnasia or the harbors,
                    above the value of ten drachmas, for such thefts also Solon enacted the capital
                    penalty. If a man was found guilty on a private prosecution for theft, while the
                    normal penalty was double reparation, the court was empowered to add to the fine
                    the extra penalty of imprisonment for five days and as many nights, so that
                    everybody might see the thief in jail. You heard those laws read not long ago.
                        <milestone n="115" unit="section"/>Solon's view was that the doer of
                    infamous deeds ought not to get off with mere repayment of the money stolen; for
                    it seemed to him that there would be no lack of thieves on such
                    terms,&mdash;if they had the chance of keeping their booty if undetected,
                    and of simply restoring it if caught. They must pay double; they must be
                    imprisoned as well as fined, and so live in disgrace for the rest of their
                    lives. Not so Timocrates; he made arrangements for a simple, instead of a
                    double, reparation, and for no sort of additional penalty. <milestone n="116"
                        unit="section"/>Nor was he content to be guilty of this iniquity in respect
                    of future offences only; he released even the man who had already committed his
                    crime, and already been punished. I, however, used to suppose that legislators
                    were concerned with the future, making laws to direct how people should behave,
                    how every thing should he managed, and what should be the proper penalties for
                    different transgressions. That is what is meant by making the laws the same for
                    all citizens. To frame statutes for past transactions is not to legislate, but
                    to rescue malefactors. <milestone n="117" unit="section"/>You may judge that
                    what I am telling you is true by reflecting that, if Euctemon had been convicted
                    on the charge of illegal legislation, Timocrates would never have proposed his
                    law, and the State would never have wanted his law; his friends would have been
                    content to plunder the property of the State, without any concern for other
                    people. But in fact Euctemon was acquitted and therefore Timocrates demands that
                    your decision, the judgement of the court, and every other statute shall be
                    invalidated, and that he and his law shall alone be authoritative. <milestone
                        n="118" unit="section"/>&mdash;And yet, Timocrates, laws which are still
                    authoritative have given supreme authority to the gentlemen of the jury. The
                    laws permit them, after hearing the case, to adjust their condemnation of the
                    offender to their view of the gravity of the offence; light for light, heavy for
                    heavy. Whenever the phrase is, &ldquo;what penalty, corporal or pecuniary,
                    should be awarded,&rdquo; the award is at the discretion of the jury.
                        <milestone n="119" unit="section"/>You, then, abolish the corporal penalty
                    by remitting imprisonment. For whom? For thieves and temple-robbers, for
                    parricides, murderers, shirkers, and deserters. All such men you protect by your
                    law. And yet does not a man who, under a free constitution, legislates, not to
                    protect the temples, not to protect the people, but to protect such people as I
                    have named, deserve to suffer the extreme penalty? <milestone n="120"
                        unit="section"/>&mdash;Certainly he cannot deny that such people ought
                    to be, and that the laws make them, liable to the heaviest punishments. Neither
                    can he deny that the men for whose protection he has invented his law are
                    thieves and temple-robbers; for the have robbed the temples of the ten per cent
                    due to Athena and of the two per cent due to the other gods; they keep the money
                    in their own pockets instead of making restitution, and they have stolen the
                    public share, which belonged to you. Their sacrilege differs from other forms of
                    sacrilege to this extent,&mdash;that they never even paid the money into the
                    Acropolis as they ought. <milestone n="121" unit="section"/>As Heaven is my
                    witness, gentlemen of the jury, I believe Androtion became the victim of this
                    arrogant, overbearing temper, not by accident, but by the visitation of the
                    gods, to the end that, as the mutilators of the statue of Victory perished by
                    their own hands,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Nothing is known of this
                        incident.</note> so these men should perish by litigation among themselves,
                    and should either make tenfold restitution, as the laws direct, or be cast into
                    prison. <milestone n="122" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>I
                    should like to make an observation about his law which occurred to my mind while
                    I was speaking about these matters,&mdash;something quite out of the common,
                    indeed surprisingly so. The defendant, gentlemen of the jury, has proposed that
                    the penalty inflicted upon farmers of taxes, if they did not pay their dues,
                    should be in accordance with the earlier statutes, in which the penalty provided
                    is imprisonment and double restitution for men who, in consequence of losses on
                    their contract, might possibly do the State a wrong unintentionally. On the
                    other hand, he abolishes imprisonment for men who steal the property of the
                    State and rob the temples of the Goddess.&mdash;If you tell us, Timocrates,
                    that the latter are guilty of a less serious offence than the former, you must
                    admit that you are out of your senses; and if you think their offence more
                    serious, as indeed it is, and yet release them and refuse to release the others,
                    is it not evident that you have sold your services to these men for a bribe?
                        <milestone n="123" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Another
                    remark worth making, gentlemen of the jury, is that you are far more magnanimous
                    than the politicians. Anyhow you do not repeal the harsh enactments made against
                    the common people,&mdash;against those, for instance, who take fees from
                    both parties, or attend the Assembly or sit on a jury while in debt to the
                    treasury, or do anything else forbidden by the laws,&mdash;although you know
                    that any man who commits one of these offences may do so because he is poor. You
                    do not enact laws to give liberty of transgression, but rather to take it away.
                    They, on the other hand, make laws to rescue from punishment persons guilty of
                    the most infamous and outrageous misconduct. <milestone n="124" unit="section"
                    />And then in private they talk insultingly about you, as though they were
                    superior persons, though they are really behaving like ill-conditioned,
                    ungrateful servants. Servants who have been manumitted, you know, gentlemen of
                    the jury, are never grateful to their masters for their liberation, but hate
                    them more bitterly than they hate anyone else, as sharing in the secret of their
                    former servitude. In the same spirit politicians are not satisfied with having
                    risen from poverty to affluence at the expense of the City, but calumniate the
                    common people,&mdash;because the common people know what their style of life
                    was when they were young and poor. <milestone n="125" unit="section"/><milestone

                    great shame for Androtion to be sent to prison, or for Glaucetes, or Melanopus.
                    No, indeed, gentlemen of the jury! It will be a far greater shame if an injured
                    and insulted commonwealth shall exact no retribution for the Goddess or for
                    itself. Does not imprisonment run in Androtion's family? Why, you know
                    yourselves that his father often went to jail for five years at a stretch; and
                    then he was not discharged&mdash;he ran away. <milestone n="126"
                        unit="section"/>Or has he earned forgiveness by his conduct in youth? Why,
                    he deserves imprisonment for that conduct just as much as for his embezzlements.
                    Do you mean because he frequented the market-place before he was qualified, and
                    with his own hands haled men of respectable life from the market-place to the
                    jail? But there is Melanopus, you say, and what a dreadful thing it would be if
                    Melanopus were committed to prison today! <milestone n="127" unit="section"
                    />Well, about his father I will say nothing disrespectful; though I could tell
                    you a long story about thieving,&mdash;however, so far as I am concerned,
                    let his father be worthy of all the compliments that Timocrates may lavish upon
                    him. But suppose that the son of this virtuous father was himself a rascal and a
                    thief; suppose that he once paid a fine of three talents on conviction for
                    treason; suppose that, after he had sat in the Allied Congress,<note resp="Loeb"

                    uninterrupted honesty in public dealings. The previous honesty of such a person

                    the Inner Treasury was burned down, were lodged in yonder building pending their
                    trial; so too were the persons suspected of the corn-market frauds, and many

                    tolerate any insult to yourselves or to the State. Remember how, no longer ago
                    than the archonship of Evander, you put Eudemus of Cydathenaeum to death,
                    because you held him to have proposed an objectionable statute; and that you
                    were within an ace also of putting to death Philip, the son of Philip the
                    ship-owner, but, by a very small majority, you accepted his own
                    counter-assessment of the penalty, and made him pay a very heavy fine. Treat the
                    defendant today in the same spirit of severity. And there is another
                    consideration for you to bear in mind,&mdash;how injuriously you would have
                    been treated by Timocrates, if he alone had been your ambassador. I really
                    believe that there is nothing from which such a fellow would have kept his
                    hands. Have regard also to the disposition of the man; for the law which he has
                    had the audacity to propose is significant of his character. <milestone n="139"

                    the jury, to give you a description of the method of legislation among the
                    Locrians. It will do you no harm to hear an example, especially one set by a
                    well-governed community. In that country the people are so strongly of opinion
                    that it is right to observe old-established laws, to preserve the institutions
                    of their forefathers, and never to legislate for the gratification of whims, or
                    for a compromise with transgression, that if a man wishes to propose a new law,
                    he legislates with a halter round his neck. If the law is accepted as good and
                    beneficial, the proposer departs with his life, but, if not, the halter is drawn
                    tight, and he is a dead man. <milestone n="140" unit="section"/>In very truth
                    they are not bold enough to propose new laws, but punctually obey the old ones.
                    And, during quite a long series of years, we are told, gentlemen of the jury,
                    that they have enacted only one new statute. They had a law in that country
                    that, if any one destroyed his neighbor's eye, he must submit to the destruction
                    of one of his own eyes; and there was no alternative of a fine. The story goes
                    that a man, whose enemy had only one eye, threatened to knock that one eye out.
                        <milestone n="141" unit="section"/>The one-eyed man was much perturbed by
                    the threat, and, reflecting that his life would not be worth keeping after such
                    a loss as that, he plucked up courage, as we are told, to introduce a law that
                    whosoever struck out the eye of a man who had only one, should submit to the
                    loss of both his own eyes, in order that both might suffer the same affliction.
                    And that, according to the story, is the only new statute adopted by the
                    Locrians for more than two hundred years. <milestone n="142" unit="section"/>But
                    in this city, gentlemen of the jury, our politicians rarely let a month go by
                    without legislating to suit their private ends. When in office they are always
                    haling private citizens to jail; but they disapprove of the application of the
                    same measure of justice to themselves. They arbitrarily repeal those well-tried
                    laws of Solon, enacted by their forefathers, and expect you to obey laws of
                    their own, proposed to the detriment of the community. <milestone n="143"
                        unit="section"/>If, then, you decline to punish the men before you, in a
                    very little time the People will be in slavery to those beasts of prey. But you
                    may be sure, gentle men of the jury, that, if you are really very angry with
                    them, their ferocity will soon be mitigated. If not, you will have plenty of
                    ruffians to insult you under pretence of patriotic fervor. <milestone n="144"
                        unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Let me now say a word,
                    gentlemen of the jury, about the statute which, as I am informed, he intends to
                    cite as a precedent and which he will claim to have followed in his own
                    proposal. I mean the statute which contains these words: &ldquo;Nor will I
                    imprison any Athenian citizen who offers three sureties taxed in the same class
                    as himself, except any person found guilty of conspiring to betray the city or
                    to subvert popular government, or any tax-farmer or his surety or collector
                    being in default.&rdquo; Listen to my reply. <milestone n="145"
                        unit="section"/>I will say nothing about Androtion himself dragging people
                    to prison and putting them in irons after the enactment of this law, but I must
                    inform you to whom it really applies. This statute, gentlemen of the Jury, is
                    not intended for the protection of people who have stood their trial and argued
                    their case, but for those who are still untried and its purpose is that they
                    shall not plead at a disadvantage, or even without any preparation at all,
                    because they have been sent to jail. But Timocrates is going to speak to you of
                    regulations made for untried culprits, as though they had been framed to include
                    everybody. <milestone n="146" unit="section"/>Let me give you a proof that my
                    account of the matter is correct. It would not have been lawful<note resp="Loeb"
                        anchored="yes">i.e. if, as Timocrates contends, imprisonment was repugnant
                        to the spirit of Athenian law, the law would not have given you the option
                        of imposing corporal or pecuniary punishment.</note> for you, gentlemen of
                    the jury, to assess any penalty, corporal or pecuniary,for imprisonment is a
                    corporal punishment, and therefore you could not have inflicted it as a penalty,
                    nor could it have been provided by statute, in cases where information is laid
                    or summary arrest is allowed, that &ldquo;the Eleven shall put in the stocks
                    any man against whom information is laid, or who has been arrested,&rdquo;
                    if it had been unlawful to imprison any offenders other than those who conspire
                    to betray the commonwealth, or to overthrow popular government, or tax-farmers
                    who do not satisfy their contract. <milestone n="147" unit="section"/>But as
                    matters stand you must accept these facts as proving that imprisonment is
                    lawful, otherwise penal sentences would at once have been entirely inoperative.
                    In the second place, gentlemen of the jury, the formula, &ldquo;I will not
                    imprison any Athenian citizen,&rdquo; is not in itself a statute; it is
                    merely a phrase in the written oath taken by the Council, to prevent politicians
                    who are in the Council from caballing to commit any citizen to prison.
                        <milestone n="148" unit="section"/>Solon therefore, wishing to deprive the
                    Council of authority to imprison, included this formula in the Councillors'
                    oath; but he did not include it in the judicial oath. He thought it right that a
                    Court of Justice should have unlimited authority, and that the convicted
                    criminal should submit to any punishment ordered by the court. To make good this
                    view the clerk will read the judicial oath of the Court of Heliaea. Read.

                    Our commonwealth, gentlemen of the jury, is administered by laws and by votes of
                    the people; and if once decisions by vote are repealed by a new law, where will
                    be the end of it? Can we justly call this thing a law? Is it not rather the

                    introducing every sort of atrocity. If the author of this law goes on his way

                    that in time past popular government was overthrown in this way, when

                    stripped of authority. Someone may perhaps object that, when I talk of
                    subverting popular government, I am ignoring the difference of conditions
                    between that time and this. Yes, but no man ought even to drop the seed of such
                    a policy in our commonwealth, though for the moment it may not germinate; rather
                    should every man who by word or deed attempts anything of the kind be brought to

                        >Athens</placeName> to her laws, he began to consider how he could destroy

                    the thing he introduced, though widely different from other laws, certainly was
                    a law. He saw that the beneficent associations of that name were bound to win

                    his promises he had the upper hand, and enjoyed special powers to suit the
                    emergency, he did not think proper to observe the statutes made and provided for
                    such business, nor, if he considered them unsatisfactory, to propose new ones.
                    Instead of that, he moved at the Assembly some truculent and unconstitutional
                    decrees, and used those decrees for jobbery, with Timocrates as his jackal.
                        <milestone n="162" unit="section"/>With the help of this man he has stolen a
                    great deal of your property, for he had included in his decree an order that the
                    police-magistrates, the receivers, and their clerks, should all follow his
                    instructions. Taking these officers with him, he proceeded to invade your
                    dwelling-houses; and you, Timocrates, were the only one of his colleagues,
                    though there were ten of them, who went with him. And let no one suppose that I
                    am hinting that payment ought not to be exacted from defaulters. It ought; but
                    how? As the law directs, and disinterestedly; that is the democratic way. Men of
                        <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, you got far less benefit
                    from the five talents that this man collected, than injury from the practices
                    that he introduced into your government. <milestone n="163" unit="section"/>For
                    if you care to inquire why a man would rather live under democracy than under
                    oligarchy, you will find that the most obvious reason is that under democracy
                    things are done more considerately. I will not insist that the conduct of these
                    men was more outrageous and intolerable than under any oligarchy, no matter
                    where. But take our own city: at what time was the greatest severity practised
                    here? I am sure you will all reply, in the days of the Thirty Tyrants.
                        <milestone n="164" unit="section"/>And yet, even at that time, as we are
                    told, no man who had concealed himself in his own house was deprived of his
                    security; indeed, the particular charge brought against the Thirty is that they
                    wrongfully carried men to jail from the market-place. But these men carried
                    their atrocity to far greater lengths than that, insomuch that, under democratic
                    government, they made every man's house his prison, bringing the police into our
                    very homes. <milestone n="165" unit="section"/>What do you think of this, men of
                        <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>? A poor man, or, for the
                    matter of that, a rich man, who had spent a great deal and was, perhaps, in a
                    certain sense short of money, was not only afraid to show himself in the
                    market-place, but found it unsafe even to stay at home. And to think that
                    Androtion was responsible for those fears,&mdash;Androtion, whose past life
                    and conduct disqualify him for seeking satisfaction at law even for himself,
                    much more for imposing Property-taxes for the State. <milestone n="166"
                        unit="section"/>If anyone asked him,&mdash;or asked you, Timocrates, the
                    apologist and abettor of that gang,&mdash;whether our property or our
                    persons are amenable to taxation, you would reply, if you chose to tell the
                    truth, our property, because it is from our property that we pay. Then why, you
                    unparalleled scoundrels, instead of confiscating estates and houses, and putting
                    them on the schedule, did you imprison and maltreat men who were full citizens,
                    as well as those unhappy aliens, whom you treated more outrageously than your
                    own domestic slaves? <milestone n="167" unit="section"/>If, gentlemen of the
                    jury, you will turn over in your minds the question what is the difference
                    between being a slave and being a free man, you will find that the biggest
                    difference is that the body of a slave is made responsible for all his misdeeds,
                    whereas corporal punishment is the last penalty to inflict on a free man. These
                    men reversed that principle, and applied punishment to the bodies of their
                    victims, as though they were bondservants. <milestone n="168" unit="section"
                    />Androtion's behavior towards you was so unfair and so greedy that, whilst
                    approving the conduct of his own father, who had been confined in jail for a
                    debt to the State and made his escape without payment or trial, he thought it
                    quite proper that any other citizen, who was unable to pay out of his own
                    resources, should be dragged by him from his home to the jail and there
                    imprisoned. <milestone n="169" unit="section"/>And Timocrates, at the time when
                    he was levying double payment, would never have consented to accept bail, I do
                    not say till the ninth presidency, but even for a single day, from any of us
                    common people; we must either pay down the money or incontinently be lodged in
                    prison. He used to hand over to the police even a man who had never been
                    condemned in any court. Yet today he has dared, taking full responsibility, to
                    introduce a law to enable persons on whom you have passed sentence, to go where
                    they will in freedom. <milestone n="170" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P"
                        unit="para"/>Nevertheless they will allege that both then and now they were
                    acting in your interests. Will you then accept their exploits as due to zeal in
                    your interests? Or will you indulgently tolerate the handiwork of their audacity
                    and wickedness? No, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>;
                    you ought to abhor such men rather than liberate them. He who claims your
                    indulgence as having acted for the good of the commonwealth must be shown to
                    possess the spirit of the common wealth. <milestone n="171" unit="section"/>That
                    spirit is a spirit of compassion for the helpless, and of resistance to the
                    intimidation of the strong and powerful; it does not inspire brutal treatment of
                    the populace, and subservience to the potentates of the day.&mdash;And such
                    is your conduct, Timocrates; and therefore the jury will have better reason to
                    refuse you a hearing and condemn you to death than to acquit you for the sake of
                    Androtion. <milestone n="172" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"
                    />However, I will make it quite clear to you without more ado that they did not
                    carry out those exactions for your benefit. If they were asked whether, in their
                    opinion, the greater injury is done to the commonwealth by tillers of the soil,
                    who live frugally, but, because of the cost of maintaining their children, or of
                    household expenses, or of other public burdens, are behindhand with their taxes,
                    or by people who plunder and squander the money of willing taxpayers and the
                    revenue that comes from our allies, I am sure that, for all their hardihood,
                    they would never have the audacity to reply that those who fail to contribute
                    their own money are worse transgressors than those who embezzle public money.
                        <milestone n="173" unit="section"/>&mdash;What then is the reason,
                    Timocrates and Androtion, that, though one of you has taken part in public life
                    for more than thirty years, though during that time many commanders have
                    defrauded the commonwealth, and many politicians as well, who have been tried in
                    this court, and though some of them have suffered death for their crimes, and
                    others have condemned themselves by slipping away and disappearing altogether,
                    neither of you ever once appeared as prosecutor of those offenders, or expressed
                    any indignation at the wrongs of the city, but made your first exhibition of
                    anxiety for our welfare in an affair which involved harsh treatment of a great
                    many people? <milestone n="174" unit="section"/>&mdash;Do you wish me to
                    tell you the reason, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>?
                    These men share in the frauds that certain persons practise on you, and they
                    also get their pickings from the collection of revenue. In their insatiable
                    greed they reap a double harvest from the State. For it is not an easier matter
                    to make enemies of a multitude of petty offenders than of a few big offenders;
                    neither of course is it a more popular thing to have an eye for the sins of the
                    many than for the sins of the few. <milestone n="175" unit="section"/>However,
                    the reason is what I am telling you. You must, therefore, take these facts into
                    account, and, bearing in mind their several misdeeds, punish every one of them
                    as soon as you have caught him. Never mind how long ago the offence was
                    committed; consider only whether they committed it. If you are indulgent today
                    to crimes that aroused your indignation then, it will look as though you
                    sentenced them to repay the money because you were angry, not because you
                    suffered any wrong. For to do something spiteful on the spur of the moment to
                    the man who has hurt you is a symptom of anger; if you are really aggrieved, you
                    wait till you have the malefactor at your mercy, and then punish him. You must
                    not let it be inferred from your placability today that you disregarded your
                    oaths and gratified an unjust passion then. You ought to detest them; you ought
                    to be impatient of the sound of the voice of either of those two men, whose
                    public conduct has been what I describe. <milestone n="176" unit="section"
                        /><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Yes, but, in spite of those public
                    delinquencies, there was, it may be said, other business which they managed with
                    credit. On the contrary, in every respect their behavior towards their
                    fellow-citizens has been such that the story you have heard is the least of the
                    reasons you have for hating them. What do you wish me to mention? How they
                    repaired the processional ornaments? How they broke up the crowns? Their success
                    as manufacturers of saucers? <milestone n="177" unit="section"/>Why, for those
                    performances alone, though they had committed no other fraud on the City, it
                    seems to me that they deserve not one but three sentences of death; for they are
                    guilty of sacrilege, of impiety, of embezzlement, of every monstrous crime. The
                    greater part, then, of the speech by which Androtion threw dust in your eyes I
                    will leave unnoticed; but, by alleging that the leaves of the crowns were rotten
                    with age and falling off,&mdash;as though they were violet-leaves or
                    rose-leaves, not leaves made of gold&mdash;he persuaded you to melt them
                    down. Being appointed to perform that operation, he chose as his assistant
                    Timocrates, the constant partner of his misdeeds. <milestone n="178"
                        unit="section"/>And then, in providing for the collection of taxes, he had
                    put in a clause that the public accountant should attend. That was very honest
                    of him; only every taxpayer was certain to check the accounts. But in dealing
                    with the crowns that he was to break up, he left out that very proper
                    regulation; he was himself orator, goldsmith, business-manager, and auditor of
                    accounts. <milestone n="179" unit="section"/>&mdash;Now if you, sir, had
                    claimed our entire confidence in all your public business, your dishonesty would
                    not have been equally manifest; but, seeing that in the matter of the taxes you
                    laid down the just principle that the City must trust, not you, but her own
                    servants, and then, when you took up another job, and were tampering with the
                    consecrated plate, some of it dedicated before we were born, you forgot to
                    provide the precaution that was taken at your own instance in respect of the
                    tax-collection, is it not perfectly clear what you were aiming at? Of course it
                    is. <milestone n="180" unit="section"/>Again, men of <placeName
                        key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, consider those glorious and
                    much-admired inscriptions that he has obliterated for all time, and the strange
                    and blasphemous inscriptions that he has written in their stead. You all, I
                    suppose, used to see the words written under the circlets of the crowns:
                    &ldquo;The Allies crowned the People for valor and righteousness,&rdquo;
                    or &ldquo;The Allies dedicated to the Goddess of <placeName

                    from the several states of the Alliance, &ldquo;Such-and-such a city crowned
                    the People by whom they were delivered,&rdquo; or &ldquo;The liberated
                    Euboeans,&rdquo; for example, &ldquo;crowned the People,&rdquo; or

                        <milestone n="181" unit="section"/>Such, I say, were the inscriptions on the
                    crowns. They were tokens of emulation and honorable ambition; but now they have
                    vanished with the destruction of the crowns, and the saucers which that lewd
                    fellow has had made in their place bear the inscription &ldquo; Made by
                    direction of Androtion.&rdquo; And so our temples contain gold plate marked
                    with the name of a man whom the laws forbid to enter those temples in person
                    because of his filthy life. Just like the old inscriptions,&mdash;Is it
                    not?&mdash;and the same incentive to your ambitions! <milestone n="182"
                        unit="section"/>You may, then, mark three scandalous crimes committed by
                    these persons. They have robbed the Goddess of her crowns. They have
                    extinguished in the City that spirit of emulation that sprang from the
                    achievements which the crowns, while in being, commemorated. They have deprived
                    the donors of a great honor,&mdash;the credit of gratitude for benefits
                    received. And after this long series of evil deeds they have grown so callous
                    and so audacious that one of them expects you to acquit him for the sake of the
                    other, and the other sits by his side and does not sink into the ground for
                    shame at his conduct. <milestone n="183" unit="section"/>Not only is he lost to
                    shame when money is in question, but he is so dull-witted that he cannot see
                    that crowns are a symbol of merit, but saucers and the like only of wealth; that
                    every crown, however small, implies the same regard for honor as if it were
                    large; that drinking-cups and censers and such possessions, if very numerous,
                    attach to their owners a sort of reputation for wealth; but, if a man takes
                    pride in trifles, instead of winning some honor by them, he is disdained as a
                    man of vulgar tastes. This man, then, after destroying the possessions of honor,
                    has made the possessions of wealth mean and unworthy of your dignity. <milestone
                        n="184" unit="section"/>There is another thing that he did not understand,
                    that the Athenian democracy, never eager to acquire riches, coveted glory more
                    than any other possession in the world. Here is the proof: once they possessed
                    greater wealth than any other Hellenic people, but they spent it all for love of
                    honor; they laid their private fortunes under contribution, and recoiled from no
                    peril for glory's sake. Hence the People inherits possessions that will never
                    die; on the one hand the memory of their achievements, on the other, the beauty
                    of the memorials set up in their honor,&mdash;yonder Gate-houses, the
                    Parthenon, the porticoes, the docks&mdash;not a couple of jugs, or three or
                    four bits of gold plate, weighing a pound apiece, which you, Timocrates, will
                    propose to melt down again whenever the whim takes you. <milestone n="185"

                    nor fulfil the imprecations of their enemies by doubling the income-tax; nor was
                    their policy ever guided by such advisers as you. No, they conquered their
                    enemies, they fulfilled the prayers of every sound-hearted man by establishing
                    concord throughout the city, and so they have bequeathed to us their
                    imperishable glory,and excluded from the marketplace men whose habits of life
                    were what yours have always been. <milestone n="186" unit="section"/>But you,

                    processional plate. Androtion! Gracious Heavens! Do you think impiety could go
                    further than that? I hold that the man who is to enter the holy places, to lay
                    hands on the vessels of lustration and the sacrificial baskets, and to become
                    the director of divine worship, ought not to be pure for a prescribed number of
                    days only his whole life should have been kept pure of the habits that have

                    undesirable, that it was introduced unconstitutionally, and that it is
                    iniquitous in every respect; but I understand that he alleges that the money has
                    now been paid in full by Androtion, Glaucetes, and Melanopus, and that he would
                    be most infamously treated if, when the people on whose behalf he is accused of
                    proposing his law have made full restitution, he should nevertheless be
                    convicted. <milestone n="188" unit="section"/>In my judgement, it is not open to
                    him to make the slightest use of that plea.&mdash;If you, sir, admit that
                    you did bring in your law on behalf of the persons who, as you say, have now
                    done their duty, you must clearly be found guilty on this count,&mdash;that
                    statutes still valid distinctly forbid you to introduce a law that does not
                    apply equally to every citizen; and the jury have sworn to give judgement in
                    accordance with those statutes. <milestone n="189" unit="section"/>On the other
                    hand, if you say that you legislated for the general good, you must not plead
                    the payment made by these men,&mdash;it has nothing to do with your
                    law,&mdash;you must prove that the law itself is acceptable and well
                    conceived. That is the motive you allege; that is what I deny, and have
                    therefore indicted you; that is the issue which the jury is to
                    decide.&mdash;I should, indeed, have no difficulty in proving that respect
                    for law is by no means the reason why these persons have paid their debt; but as
                    that is not the question on which the jury have to vote, why trouble them by
                    discussing it now? <milestone n="190" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P"
                        unit="para"/>He will not, I suppose, spare you the argument that it would be
                    very hard on him to be punished for proposing that no Athenian citizen shall be
                    sent to jail; and that it is for the benefit more especially of people without
                    influence that laws should be as merciful and humane as possible. To avoid being
                    led astray, you will do well to listen to a brief rejoinder to that plea.
                        <milestone n="191" unit="section"/>For when he uses the phrase,
                    &ldquo;that no Athenian citizen shall be sent to jail,&rdquo; do not
                    forget that he is lying. That is not his proposal; it is that you jurors shall
                    lose your control over penalties. He is trying to establish the right of appeal
                    against a verdict returned on oath, after argument and trial. Do not let him
                    pick out of his law and read a few phrases that have a benevolent sound to the
                    ear let him produce the whole statute, clause by clause, and allow you to
                    consider its effects. You will find that it is what I describe, not what he
                    pretends. <milestone n="192" unit="section"/>Again, with regard to the plea that
                    merciful and humane laws are good for the common people, you must consider this.
                    There are two sorts of problems, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName>, with which the laws of all nations are concerned.
                    First, what are the principles under which we associate with one another, have
                    dealings with one another, define the obligations of private life, and, in
                    general, order our social relations? Secondly, what are the duties that every
                    man among us owes to the commonwealth, if he chooses to take part in public life
                    and professes any concern for the State? <milestone n="193" unit="section"/>Now
                    it is to the advantage of the common people that laws of the former category,
                    laws of private intercourse, shall be distinguished by clemency and humanity. On
                    the other hand it is to your common advantage that laws of the second class, the
                    laws that govern our relations to the State, shall be trenchant and peremptory,
                    because, if they are so, politicians will not do so much harm to the commonalty.
                    Therefore, when he makes use of this plea, refute it by telling him that he is
                    introducing clemency, not into the laws that benefit you, but into the laws that
                    intimidate politicians. <milestone n="194" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P"
                        unit="para"/>It would take a long speech to prove, point by point, that
                    everything he will say will be intended to hoodwink and mislead you. Most of his
                    topics I will pass over, but I will mention one leading point which you will
                    bear in mind. Watch all his pleas, however various, and see if he will be able
                    to advance one to prove his contention that a legislator may justly make the
                    same ordinance for bygone issues, already determined, as for cases yet to come.
                    Every clause of his law is infamous and outrageous; but that provision is the
                    most outrageous and unconstitutional of all. <milestone n="195" unit="section"
                    />But, if neither the defendant nor any other man can make good that contention,
                    you must clearly recognize that you are being deluded, and you must ask
                    yourselves how it ever occurred to his mind to legislate in this
                    fashion.&mdash;You did not bring in your law gratuitously, Timocrates. No,
                    indeed! far from it. You can offer no excuse for daring to introduce such a
                    measure, except that cursed greediness of yours. Not one of these men is your
                    kinsman, or a member of your household, or has any natural claim on you.
                        <milestone n="196" unit="section"/>Nor can you plead that you took
                    compassion on ill-used men, and therefore resolved to help them. That long after
                    date they should restore money belonging to the citizens, reluctantly,
                    unwillingly, and after conviction in three courts of justice,&mdash;you
                    certainly never thought that ill-usage. That means ill-conduct, and should
                    rather provoke our indignation than incline us to pity. Nor do you take pity on
                    them because a humane and considerate disposition is a peculiar trait of your
                    character. <milestone n="197" unit="section"/>Compassion for Androtion,
                    Glaucetes, and Melanopus, because they have to repay stolen money, shows a
                    temper quite different from your refusal of compassion to everyone of the many
                    persons here present, and of all the other citizens, whose houses you invaded
                    with police-magistrates, receivers, and clerks at your heels; with demolishing
                    their front-doors, dragging their bed-clothes from under them, and levying
                    distraint on a man's maidservant, if he was living with her; and that is how you
                    and Androtion were employed for a whole twelve-month. <milestone n="198"
                        unit="section"/>&mdash;Yes, it was you citizens who were the more
                    infamously ill-used;&mdash;and as for you, you reprobate, you had far more
                    reason to pity your fellow-citizens, who, thanks to you speech-makers, never get
                    a moment's respite from taxpaying. Even that is not enough they are compelled to
                    pay double, compelled by you and Androtion, who never paid income-tax in your
                    lives. <milestone n="199" unit="section"/>&mdash;And yet this fellow was so
                    self-confident,&mdash;as though he could never be brought to justice for his
                    doings,&mdash;that, with ten colleagues in office, he alone joined Androtion
                    in making his return. Yes indeed; gratuitously and from purely unselfish
                    motives, Timocrates provokes your hostility, introducing laws that contradict
                    every statute, and that even, to crown all, contradict a statute of his own
                    making! By our Lady, I think that even you must recognize his generosity!

                    tell you, without any hesitation, something that, in my opinion, deserves your

                    earnings on purposes that might claim the indulgence of anyone who heard of
                    them. What purposes do I mean? Well, gentlemen of the jury, the defendant's
                    father is in debt to the Treasury. I do not mention that by way of reproach, but
                    because I cannot help it. And this dutiful son allows him to remain in debt!

                    proper to pay the debt, but prefers to pocket the profit of his meanness so long
                    as his father lives. Is such a man likely to keep his hands off
                    anything?&mdash;For your own father you have no compassion; you do not think
                    him ill-used because, while you are getting your pickings and making your

                    of the laws you introduce, he is losing his citizen-rights for lack of a

                    to the common people. A thief, or a cutpurse, or any rogue of that sort, in the

                    disgrace upon everybody; for an infamous statute, when ratified, is a discredit
                    to the government that enacted it and an injury to everyone who lives under it.
                    Will you not, then, punish, when you have caught him, a man who is doing his

                    far-reaching designs he has framed his law, and how inimical those designs are

                    but rather of meeting his own doom in this court, if you do justice as you
                    ought, he nevertheless imitated that crime, and attempted to release men whom

                    men whose enactments are contrary to the spirit of those lawgivers with
                    indignation and chastisement. But as to Timocrates I know that he brought in
                    this law chiefly for his private advantage, because he felt that many of his

                    he observed that in all, or nearly all, states there is a law that the penalty
                    for any man who debases the currency is death. He proceeded to ask the jury
                    whether they thought that a just and good law; <milestone n="213" unit="section"
                    />and when the jury replied that they did, he said that in his opinion money had
                    been invented by private persons for private transactions, but laws were the

                    debased that currency, and introduced counterfeit, the jury had graver reason to
                    abhor and punish that man than one who debased the currency of private citizens.

                    crime to debase laws than silver coinage, he added that many states that use

                    suffer no harm thereby; but that no nation that uses bad laws or permits the
                    debasement of existing laws has ever escaped the consequence. Now that is the
                    accusation to which Timocrates stands open today, and he may justly receive from

                    men alike were zealous to serve the community, because they had become ambitious
                    of the honors and rewards of such service, and if all were to recoil from
                    noxious acts, through fear of the pains and penalties enacted for malefactors,
                    could anything prevent our commonwealth from becoming very great? Does not
                        <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> possess more war galleys
                    than any other Hellenic city? Is she not rich in infantry and cavalry, in
                    revenue, in military positions, in harbors? And how are those possessions
                    preserved and consolidated? By the laws; for they are profitable to the
                    community only so long as our public conduct conforms to the laws. <milestone
                        n="217" unit="section"/>If conditions were reversed, if there were no
                    recompense for the virtuous, if evil-doers were to enjoy all the immunity that
                    Timocrates has sought to enact, what utter confusion would be the natural
                    result! For you may be quite sure that from these possessions that I have
                    enumerated, even if they were twice as great as they now are, you would not then
                    get an atom of advantage. Therefore the defendant is proved to be striving to do
                    you wrong in respect of that law by which punishments are provided for would-be
                    criminals. <milestone n="218" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>For
                    all the reasons I have set before you, it is incumbent upon you to show your
                    resentment, to chastise these men, and to make them an example to others. To be
                    lenient to such offenders, or to convict them and then inflict a light penalty,
                    is to habituate and train the greatest possible number to do you wrong.</p>

                    jury, as I sat here for a long time and listened with you to the speech of
                    Lycurgus for the prosecution, I thought it in general an excellent speech; but
                    when I observed him unduly exerting himself, I was surprised that he should not
                    realize that the strength of our case does not really depend on the arguments
                    that he has used or that I am going to use, but on the disposition of each
                    juryman either to be indignant at wickedness or to condone it. <milestone n="2"
                        unit="section"/>For myself, I admit it was our duty to undertake the
                    prosecution and to deliver full speeches in accordance with custom and for your
                    information; but I feel that the case has been already decided by each one of
                    you in his inmost conscience, and that now, if the majority of you are men
                    disposed to admire and protect rascals, all our declamation will be wasted, but
                    if you are disposed to hate them, then this man, please God! shall pay the
                    penalty. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Though
                    much has been said, and all of it well said, I shall not scruple to put my own
                    views before you, because the present suit seems to me quite different from all
                    others. Just consider. To all our courts the juries come to learn from plaintiff
                    and defendant the facts upon which they are to give their votes, and each
                    litigant comes to prove that the legal right is strong on his side. <milestone
                        n="4" unit="section"/>But how stands it with the present trial? You who are
                    to give the verdict have come here knowing better than we, the accusers, that
                    this man, since he is a state-debtor and registered as such in the Acropolis,
                    has no right to speak at all; so that each of you is in the position of an
                    accuser, knowing the facts and not needing to be told them. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/>But the defendant is here with nothing whatever to support
                    his acquittal, with no sound plea based on the facts, with no past record of a
                    decent life, with not a single point in his favour. He imagines that he may be
                    saved by what would have frightened anyone else, though innocent; for he bases
                    the hope of his acquittal on the enormity of his wickedness. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>This being so, it seems to me
                    that one would not be wrong in saying that, while Aristogeiton is on his trial,
                    it is your character that is being tested, your reputation that is at stake. For
                    if you make it quite clear that you are angry at such patent and gross offences
                    and are determined to punish them, then it will be seen that you have come here
                    to play your true part as judges and guardians of the law. <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/>But if some other motive prevails, some motive which none
                    would care to confess, but which your votes will betray, then I am afraid that
                    to some you will appear to be playing the part of trainers of any citizen who
                    has a taste for wickedness. For every bad man is in himself weak; he only
                    becomes strong by your countenance and support. Whoever wins that support finds
                    in it his advantage and his strength; to you who give that support, it is a
                    source of shame. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"
                    />But before I speak of the private affairs of the defendant, men of <placeName
                        key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, I should like you seriously but
                    briefly to calculate how much shame and discredit is brought upon our city by
                    these monsters, of whom the defendant is at once the midmost, the first, and the
                    last. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>To mention only one matter; they mount
                    the platform in the Assembly, where you look to your orators to explain their
                    policy, not to flaunt their wickedness; they come equipped with a hardened
                    front, a raucous voice, false charges, intimidation, shamelessness, and all such
                    gifts as these, than which one could name no qualities more hostile to the
                    spirit of debate nor, I think&mdash;so Heaven help me!&mdash;more
                    discreditable. By these vile tricks they gain supremacy over all that is
                    respectable in the State, over the laws, the committees, the course of public
                    business, and the maintenance of order. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>Now if
                    that is what you want, if their practice accords with your ideas, we must just
                    let them go their own way; but if you think that even at the eleventh hour you
                    ought to put all this right, and reform what has been allowed to go too far, and
                    has been disgracefully misdirected by these men, you must today avert your eyes
                    from all such practices and give a righteous verdict. <milestone n="11"
                        unit="section"/>You must magnify the Goddess of Order who loves what is
                    right and preserves every city and every land; and before you cast your votes,
                    each juryman must reflect that he is being watched by hallowed and inexorable
                    Justice, who, as Orpheus, that prophet of our most sacred mysteries, tells us,
                    sits beside the throne of Zeus and oversees all the works of men. Each must keep
                    watch and ward lest he shame that goddess, from whom everyone that is chosen by
                    lot derives his name of juror, because he has this day received a sacred trust
                    from the laws, from the constitution, from the fatherland,&mdash;the duty of
                    guarding all that is fair and right and beneficial in our city. <milestone
                        n="12" unit="section"/>For if you do not cherish that temper, if you come
                    here and take seats with your usual easy good nature, I am afraid that the case
                    may be reversed, and that we who seem to accuse Aristogeiton may be found to be
                    accusing you; for the more convincingly we prove his guilt without arousing your
                    interest, the greater will be your shame. But enough of that subject! <milestone
                        n="13" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Men of <placeName
                        key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, I shall certainly tell you the
                    truth with the utmost frankness. When I saw you in the Assembly indicating and
                    proposing me as the accuser of Aristogeiton, I was troubled, and I call Heaven
                    to witness that I did not relish the task. For I was not unaware that he who
                    plays such a part in your courts suffers for it in the end, not perhaps so as to
                    feel it at once, but if he undertakes many such tasks and perseveres in them,
                    his character will soon be recognized. I thought it, however, my duty to accede
                    to your wishes. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"
                    />Now as regards the laying of the injunction and the legal points, I considered
                    that Lycurgus would deal adequately with them; and I also saw that he was
                    producing witnesses to the wickedness of the defendant. But I resolved to devote
                    my speech to those points which ought always to be considered and examined by
                    those who are deliberating in the interests of the State and of the laws; and I
                    will now proceed to deal with those points. But do you, men of <placeName
                        key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, in Heaven's name grant me the
                    privilege of addressing you on these topics in the way that suits my natural
                    bent and the scheme of my speech, for indeed I could not speak in any other way.
                        <milestone n="15" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>The whole
                    life of men, Athenians, whether they dwell in a large state or a small one, is
                    governed by nature and by the laws. Of these, nature is something irregular and
                    incalculable, and peculiar to each individual; but the laws are something
                    universal, definite, and the same for all. Now nature, if it be evil, often
                    chooses wrong, and that is why you will find men of an evil nature committing
                    errors. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/>But the laws desire what is just and
                    honorable and salutary; they seek for it, and when they find it, they set it
                    forth as a general commandment, equal and identical for all. The law is that
                    which all men ought to obey for many reasons, but above all because every law is
                    an invention and gift of the gods, a tenet of wise men, a corrective of errors
                    voluntary and involuntary, and a general covenant of the whole State, in
                    accordance with which all men in that State ought to regulate their lives.
                        <milestone n="17" unit="section"/>But that Aristogeiton has been convicted
                    on all the heads of the information, and that he has not a single
                    counter-argument worth considering, can be easily proved. For there are two
                    objects, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, for which
                    all laws are framed&mdash;to deter any man from doing what is wrong, and, by
                    punishing the transgressor, to make the rest better men; and it will be shown
                    that both these objects will be secured by the punishment of the defendant. For
                    by his original transgressions he has incurred the due penalties, and for his
                    refusal to acquiesce in them he is now brought into court to receive your
                    punishment; so that no one has any excuse left for acquitting him. <milestone
                        n="18" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Nor is it possible to
                    say, &ldquo;After all, these things do no harm to the State.&rdquo; I
                    will not dwell on the fact that all the fines due to the State are lost, if you
                    admit his sophistries, or that if we must forgive any of our debtors, it ought
                    to be the most decent and respectable and those who have been fined on the least
                    serious charges, not the greatest villain of all, who has committed most
                    offences and incurred the most deserved fines on the most serious charges.
                        <milestone n="19" unit="section"/>For what could be more serious than
                    chicanery and breach of the constitution, for both of which the defendant has
                    been condemned? Nor will I urge that even if you let off all other offenders, it
                    is surely wrong to give way to one who resorts to force, for that is surely an
                    outrage. I waive such considerations as these; but I do think that I can clearly
                    prove to you that the defendant's example confounds and destroys all order in
                    law and in government. <milestone n="20" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P"
                        unit="para"/>I shall say nothing novel or extravagant or peculiar, but only
                    what you all know to be true as well as I do. For if any of you cares to inquire
                    what is the motive-power that calls together the Council, draws the people into
                    the Assembly, fills the law-courts, makes the old officials resign readily to
                    the new, and enables the whole life of the State to be carried on and preserved,
                    he will find that it is the laws and the obedience that all men yield to the
                    laws; since, if once they were done away with and every man were given licence
                    to do as he liked, not only does the constitution vanish, but our life would not
                    differ from that of the beasts of the field. <milestone n="21" unit="section"

                    the Assembly into confusion, saying it was a case for the rack; and after
                    pocketing some trifle or other, though he was present at his acquittal, he kept
                    his mouth shut. He held the threat of impeachment over Democles' head, and what
                    did he make of it? There are thousands of other cases. I should find it a task

                    did not cease to bluster and blackmail and threaten; and because the generals,

                    extorting money from them and sparing them no insult. And now his latest exploit

                    thrown into the prison until he could find bail. Aristogeiton accosts him and,
                    while chatting on some topic or other, filches the pocket-book that he had on
                    him; and when the man charged him with the theft and made a to-do about it,
                    saying that no one else could have taken it, he so far forgot all decency that
                    he tried to strike him. <milestone n="61" unit="section"/>But the Tanagran, a
                    fresh-caught fish, was getting the better of the defendant, who was thoroughly
                    pickled, having been long in jail. So when it came to this, he swallows the
                    other man's nose. Then the unfortunate victim of this outrage abandoned the
                    search for his pocket-book, which was afterwards found in a chest of which the

                        unit="section"/>Because you condemned his father to death and sold his

                    that that makes him well-disposed to you? By Zeus and all the gods, that is
                    absurd. For if he is well-disposed towards father and mother, and so observes
                    the great law of nature, which is laid down alike for man and beast, that all
                    should love their parents, <milestone n="66" unit="section"/>then he must
                    clearly be ill-disposed to those who have destroyed them and to their laws and
                    their constitution. But if he has no regard for these things, I should like to
                    know who that sees how he has renounced all affection for his parents, can
                    believe in his pretended zeal for the people; for the man who neglects his
                    parents I regard as unworthy of trust and hateful alike to gods and men.
                        <milestone n="67" unit="section"/>But I shall be told it is because you
                    condemned him on information laid and twice put him and his brother into prison;
                    it is for this reason that he is your well-wisher. But that too is ridiculous.
                    Or because you disqualified him for the office to which he had been allotted? Or
                    because you found him guilty of a breach of the constitution? Or because you
                    fined him ten talents? Or because you habitually point the finger of scorn at

                    because, as long as the present laws and constitution stand, he cannot clear
                    himself of these reproaches? Then why is he well-disposed to you? It is because,
                    in his own words, he is impudent. Why is the impudent man so called save
                    because, being lost to a sense of shame, he dares to state what is not, and
                    never will be, true? And that is precisely what the defendant does. <milestone

                    facts about the information laid against him which Lycurgus seems to have passed
                    over, but which I had better lay before you; for I think you should examine the
                    defendant and the rights of the present case as carefully as you would
                    scrutinize a private debt. Suppose then that A accused B of owing him money, and
                    B denied it. If the registered terms of the loan were still to be read, or if
                    the pillars which marked the mortgaged property were still standing, you would
                    clearly regard as impudent the man who denied the transaction; but if it was
                    shown that these proofs no longer existed, then you would regard the accuser as
                    impudent. That is natural. <milestone n="70" unit="section"/>Well, of
                    Aristogeiton's debt to the State the terms still exist, namely the laws under
                    which all defaulters are registered; and the pillar is the wooden table of the
                    law deposited in the temple of the Goddess. Now if these have been destroyed and
                    the debt wiped out, we are talking nonsense, or rather telling lies; but if they
                    are still in existence and will remain valid until he pays his debt, then there
                    is no truth in his plea, but he is committing a serious crime in trying to
                    suppress the rights of the State. <milestone n="71" unit="section"/>For the
                    point to be argued and decided is not whether all his debts are unpaid, but
                    whether he is still in debt. Otherwise it would be hard on those who are
                    registered for a debt of one drachma, if their indebtedness is to tell against
                    them, because they have done some trifling wrong or even no wrong at all,
                    whereas if a man has committed serious wrongs, he is to regain his civic rights
                    by paying one or two instalments. Moreover, there are three distinct debts
                    registered and forming the ground of the information. Two Aristogeiton has
                    entered in the register;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">The defendant admitted
                        these two debts by mortgaging his land for them.</note> the third he has not
                    registered, but he is prosecuting Aristo of Alopece for malicious entry.

                    />&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;for he has registered my name
                    as a debtor unjustly.&rdquo; Of course it is evident that you have a right
                    to satisfaction for this; but then you ought first to give satisfaction and
                    abide by the penalty you have brought on yourself. Or again, for what do you
                    expect to obtain satisfaction? If you are at liberty to do everything that other
                    citizens do, how are you wronged? <milestone n="73" unit="section"/>I beg the
                    jury in Heaven's name to consider this point also. If he convicts Aristo of
                    malicious intent, what will it mean? His name, of course, will be erased and
                    Aristo's substituted, because that is the law. Good! Then henceforward will this
                    man, whose name has been erased, be a State-debtor, and will the other man,
                    registered as a debtor, retain his full citizenship? That is what follows from
                    the defendant's claim, for if he is not a debtor when his name has been
                    registered, then, when his name has been erased, he will obviously be a debtor.
                    But that is absolutely untrue. No; when his name is erased, then he will be no
                    longer a debtor. In that case the defendant is a debtor now.<note resp="Loeb"

                    imprisonment he tries to procure, as he bustles to and fro in the court? How
                    will they recover their lives or escape from the sufferings they have already
                    endured? For this man, to whom the laws refuse a share in our common everyday
                    privileges, is the cause of intolerable wrongs to others by methods that are

                    the stars down here? That is impossible, and let us hope it always will be. But
                    when those who have no rights enjoy rights at your pleasure, when villainy is
                    honored and virtue spurned, when justice and expediency are sacrificed to
                    personal spite, then we must suppose that the universe has indeed been turned

                    public services of their ancestors, or in similar pleas, by which they succeeded

                    of these topics offers an easy path for the defendant; there is nothing before
                    him but precipices, ravines, and gulfs. <milestone n="77" unit="section"/>What
                    true plea can he find? Something perhaps that his father did? But you yourselves

                    deserved his doom. Or perhaps, if there is a difficulty about his father, he
                    will appeal to the sobriety and respectability of his own life. What life? Where
                    has he lived it? For the life that you have all seen him leading is not of that
                    description. <milestone n="78" unit="section"/>&ldquo;But, my dear sir, he

                    numerous and highly respectable kinsmen will come forward and beg him off. But
                    there are none and never were. How could there be, when he is not even a

                    he is his twin. It was this brother&mdash;I pass over the other

                    professes to cure fits, being himself subject to fits of wickedness of every

                    whom any man would ban at sight as an evil omen rather than choose to accost
                    him, and who has pronounced himself worthy of death by bringing such an action.

                    religion and justice alike demand that this unclean wretch should receive no

                    not move him to pity? And do you, Aristogeiton, look for pardon? Whence? From
                    whom? Are your children to be pitied? Far from it. You have yourself thrown away

                    as he paraded the market-place, you would hate him even more than you do, and
                    with justice. For he says there are many men in debt to the treasury, and all of
                    them in the same case as himself. I admit that these unfortunate men are
                    &ldquo;many,&rdquo; though there are but a couple of them; for every

                    if any of you has a friend or acquaintance among the debtors, I propose to show

                    infamous category as himself, contrary to what is right and fitting. <milestone
                        n="87" unit="section"/>When you, Aristogeiton, were convicted of a breach of
                    the constitution for having moved that three citizens should be executed without
                    trial, and you escaped with a fine, though you ought to have suffered the
                    extreme penalty, there is no parallel, not the slightest, between your case and
                    that of a man who has gone bail for a friend and then finds himself unable to
                    pay an unexpected fine. My second reason is that the bond of mutual kindness,
                    which you yourselves naturally preserve towards one another, is broken and
                    destroyed by Aristogeiton, as far as in him lies. You will understand this from
                    what I am going to say. For you, Athenians, observing what I have called the
                    natural bond of mutual kindness, live as a corporate body in this city just as
                    families live in their private homes. <milestone n="88" unit="section"/>How then
                    do such families live? Where there is a father and grown-up sons and possibly
                    also grandchildren, there are bound to be many divergent wishes; for youth and
                    age do not talk or act in the same way. Nevertheless whatever the young men do,
                    if they are modest, they do in such a way as to avoid notice; or if this is
                    impossible, at any rate they make it that such was their intention. The elders
                    in their turn, if they see any lack of moderation in spending or drinking or
                    amusement, manage to see it without showing that they have seen it. The result
                    is that everything that their various natures suggest is done, and done
                    satisfactorily. <milestone n="89" unit="section"/>And that is just how you, men
                    of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, live in this community on
                    humane and brotherly principles, one class watching the proceedings of the
                    unfortunate in such a way that, as the saying runs, &ldquo;seeing, they see
                    not; hearing, do not hear&rdquo;; while the others by their behavior show
                    that they are both on their guard and alive to a sense of shame. Hence it is
                    that that general harmony, which is the source of all our blessings, is firmly
                    established in our city. <milestone n="90" unit="section"/>Those feelings, so
                    happily implanted in your nature and your habits, Aristogeiton would change and
                    remove and overturn. What every other citizen does with as little noise as
                    possible, he performs, one might almost say, with a peal of bells hung about his
                    neck. Neither the president nor the crier nor the chairman nor the tribe on duty
                    can control him. <milestone n="91" unit="section"/>So when any of you, annoyed
                    at his outrageous conduct, cries, &ldquo;To think that he should act like

                    Is not So-and-so a debtor too?&rdquo;&mdash;each man suggesting his
                    personal enemy. Thus his wickedness is the cause of the scandals which are

                    offence against the laws, is, if possible, to punish him with death, or, if not,
                    to impose such a money fine as he will not be able to pay. For depend upon it,
                    there is no other way to be rid of him. <milestone n="93" unit="section"/>Among
                    other men, Athenians, you may see the best and most respectable ready at the
                    prompting of nature to do what is right; those who are worse men, but are not
                    classed as the very bad, are careful of offending, because they are afraid of
                    you and are sensitive to disgrace and reproach; the utterly wicked, the moral
                    lepers, as we call them, are said to be taught wisdom only by suffering.
                        <milestone n="94" unit="section"/>Now here is Aristogeiton, who has so far
                    outstripped all men in wickedness that his punishments have not disciplined him
                    and he is once more detected in the same illegal and rapacious acts. Also he is
                    the more deserving of your anger now than before, inasmuch as previously it was
                    only by moving decrees that he ventured to transgress the laws, but now he
                    transgresses them in every possible way&mdash;by accusations, by public
                    speeches, by calumnies, by demanding the death penalty, by impeaching and
                    maligning the fully qualified citizens, when he himself is a state-debtor. For
                    nothing is more abominable than that. <milestone n="95" unit="section"/>Surely,
                    then, to admonish such a fellow is madness. A man who never yielded or shrank
                    before the storm of protest with which the whole Assembly admonishes those who
                    offend it, would readily heed the protest of an individual! His case is
                    incurable, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, quite
                    incurable. Just as physicians, when they detect a cancer or an ulcer or some

                    in exterminating this monster. Cast him out of your city; destroy him. Take your
                    precautions in time and do not wait for the evil consequences, which I pray may

                    assuming that from the former one can get satisfaction even after some delay,
                    but that one cannot wait for the latter, because there will be no prospect of
                    punishment if the constitution is destroyed. No one will be so impudent or so
                    pretentious that he will attempt to gainsay these principles, except
                    Aristogeiton here with his reckless wickedness. On the contrary we shall find
                    that, when once you have given an adverse verdict, all magistrates and all
                    statesmen accept them. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>For on the one hand,
                    whenever any officials have been rejected by vote, they instantly cease to hold
                    office and are stripped of their official crowns; and on the other hand, all the
                    judicial archons who are disqualified for promotion to the Areopagus forbear to
                    force their way in and submit humbly to your decision. And this is only
                    reasonable; for just as they believe that private citizens ought to obey them
                    when they are rulers, so when they in their turn descend to the rank of private
                    citizens, they ought to submit to the laws, which are the real rulers of the
                    State. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>Again, all the statesmen, if you will
                    pass them in review from the earliest times, can be proved to have submitted in
                    the same way to your constitutional decrees. It is said that Aristeides was
                    banished by your ancestors and lived in <placeName key="tgn,7011087"
                        >Aegina</placeName> till the people recalled him, and that Miltiades and
                    Pericles, being fined thirty and fifty talents respectively, did not try to
                    harangue the people until they had paid in full. <milestone n="7" unit="section"
                    />It would be a most scandalous state of things if, while these men, to whom you
                    were indebted for so many services, were not allowed to do anything contrary to
                    your established laws, this man, who has never done you a single good service,
                    but has committed a prodigious number of offences, should be found to have
                    received at your hands, so readily and so contrary to justice and expediency,
                    the right to transgress the laws. And why appeal to ancient history? Count up
                    the men of your own days and see if anyone has ever been found so shameless. A
                    careful scrutiny will not reveal a single instance. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/>Now apart from all this, whenever a man lodges with the
                    judicial Archons an objection against a decree or law, that law or decree is
                    invalid and the mover or proposer has not the impudence to employ violence, but
                    loyally accepts your decision, even if he is the foremost orator or
                    administrator in your city. Yet is it not absurd that, while decrees passed by
                    you in full assembly as in accordance with the laws should be invalid, you
                    should imagine that you ought to make the whim of Aristogeiton to flout the laws
                    more authoritative than the laws themselves? <milestone n="9" unit="section"
                        /><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Again, when a plaintiff fails to obtain a
                    fifth part of the votes, in cases where the laws forbid him henceforward to
                    indict anyone or arrest him or give him into custody, in the same way none of
                    those liable to these disqualifications ever dreams of defying them. But for
                    Aristogeiton, it seems, and for Aristogeiton alone, no court, no law has
                    authority higher than his own caprice. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>Neither
                    you nor your ancestors ever repented of observing these rules, for it is the
                    salvation of democracy that it overcomes its enemies either by good counsel or
                    by arms, but submits to its laws either by free choice or under constraint; and
                    that this principle is sound, is allowed even by the defendant himself.
                        <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>For after the disasters to the Greek
                    forces at Chaeroneia, when the very foundations of our State were threatened
                    with the utmost danger, when Hypereides proposed that the disfranchised citizens
                    should be reinstated in order that, if any such danger should menace our State,
                    all classes might unite wholeheartedly in the struggle for liberty, the
                    defendant indicted this decree as unconstitutional and conducted his case in
                    court. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>But is it not monstrous that, where the
                    safety of the State is involved, the defendant should allow none of his
                    fellow-citizens to obtain enfranchisement, but should claim that same favour
                    from you all, in order to cover his own lawlessness? Yet the former vote,
                    Aristogeiton, was far more lawful and equitable than the vote which you now
                    require the jurors to cast in your favour. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>For
                    the one was fair and equal for all citizens alike, but this is unfair and brings
                    profit to you alone of all the people of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"

                    man would have been put in control of the whole government; the effect of this
                    vote will be that you have received authority to transgress with impunity the
                    decisions of the jury and the laws handed down by our ancestors&mdash;to do,
                    in fact, whatever you please. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>I should like to
                    ask him whether his indictment of the decree was lawful and right or on the
                    other hand unjust and illegal. For if the indictment was inexpedient and against
                    the interests of the people, on that very ground he richly deserves death; but
                    if it was useful and advantageous to the majority, why, pray, do you now insist
                    on the jury giving a verdict which is contrary to your indictment? No; your
                    proceedings then were unjust and now are neither lawful nor beneficial to the
                    citizens. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/>I can see that you, men of

                    your own behalf, for you have ere now decided many such
                    &ldquo;informations&rdquo; laid against private men. Yet is it not all
                    wrong that in your own case you should so scrupulously examine the laws, but in
                    the case of these mischief-makers, who annoy everyone alike and pretend to be
                    superior to the rest, you should display such indifference? <milestone n="16"
                        unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>It is impossible that any of
                    you are of opinion that things ought to be as I say, but that, because of the
                    decorous behavior of Aristogeiton and his usefulness to you, you ought to wink
                    even at his violation of the laws. I think Lycurgus in his speech has
                    satisfactorily proved that the defendant is an unscrupulous man and has an
                    extraordinary faculty for injustice; and that he is not a useful citizen, anyone
                    can see from his public performances. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/>For whom
                    has he brought into court that he succeeded in convicting on the charges that he
                    laid against him? Or what source of revenue has he provided for you? Or what
                    decree has he ever drafted that you were not afterwards glad to disown? The
                    truth is, he is so tactless, so un-Greek in his temperament, that when he sees
                    you somewhat angry with anyone and rather more exasperated than the occasion
                    calls for, he at once anticipates your wishes in the moment of your wrath and so
                    opposes your interests. <milestone n="18" unit="section"/>But a statesman,
                    acting on your behalf, ought not to follow up the hasty sentiments that
                    accompany your anger, but should be guided by reasons, by events, by the
                    opportunities that present themselves. For sentiments are wont to change
                    quickly, but reasons to subsist for a longer period. Paying no regard to this
                    the defendant detects the secret weakness of community, so that the same policy
                    is bound to be ratified one day and repealed the next. <milestone n="19"
                        unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>But perhaps because the role
                    he adopts is to rail at everyone, to shout people down and find fault with their
                    speeches, therefore it is convenient in these times to protect him. Gentlemen of
                    the jury, I swear by the goddess of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName> that what takes place on the hustings is a disgrace to
                    our city, and it is through the recklessness of such speakers that political
                    life is now discredited with all decent citizens. But if any of you happen to
                    like that sort of thing, you will never want for such performers. Why, even now
                    the platform swarms with them. For to pick holes in the counsel offered is not
                    difficult, but it is difficult to advise you and persuade you to pass any
                    indispensable resolution. <milestone n="20" unit="section"/>Furthermore, if he
                    had not already deceived you by using these same arguments, when he was on trial
                    at the earlier information, even so it would not be just to make any concession
                    contrary to the existing laws; for you must not allow some persons to break the
                    law and insist on the rest obeying it. Yet just possibly it might then have been
                    more reasonable to trust him and grant him privileges and sacrifice some of
                    these principles. <milestone n="21" unit="section"/>But after you had let him
                    off, admittedly in hope of amendment, and then shortly after had to punish the
                    same man again for speaking and acting against the best interests of the city,
                    what reasonable excuse is left you if you are a second time hoodwinked? When you
                    have tried him by deeds, why need you trust his words? In cases where you have
                    not yet an accurate test ready to hand, it may perhaps be necessary to judge by
                    words. <milestone n="22" unit="section"/>But, for myself, I am amazed that there
                    are men so constituted that, though they deposit private property with those
                    only whose past record shows them to be honest, they entrust public affairs to
                    men who have been admittedly proved unscrupulous. No one would dream of setting
                    a sorry mongrel to guard a flock; yet some people say that, to keep watch on
                    those who administer the State, one need only employ the first comers, men who
                    pretend to detect delinquents, but need the most careful watching themselves.

                    devoted to you, and take your own precautions to ensure that you grant to no one
                    the power to make your laws null and void, especially to no one of those who
                    pretend to be able to speak and legislate in the interests of the masses. It is
                    preposterous that your ancestors faced death to save the laws from destruction,
                    but that you do not even punish those who have offended against the laws; that
                    you set up in the market-place a bronze statue of Solon, who framed the laws,
                    but show yourselves regardless of those very laws for the sake of which he has
                    received such exceptional honor. <milestone n="24" unit="section"/>Is it not an
                    absurd situation that you should by legislating express your anger against the

                    let them go unscathed? That the lawgiver, a single individual, should on your
                    behalf incur the hostility of all the worthless, but that you yourselves,
                    collected together to defend your own interests, should not even display your
                    hatred of the wicked, but should be overpowered by the wickedness of a single
                    individual? That you should have fixed death as the penalty if anyone cites a
                    law which does not exist, and yet should allow men to escape unpunished who
                    reduce the existing laws to the level of laws which do not exist? <milestone

                    the advantages that you derive from the laws and the results of lawlessness. For
                    you will find that the fruits of lawlessness are madness, intemperance and

                    of the body are arrested by the discoveries of physicians, so savagery is
                    expelled from the soul by the wise purposes of the legislator. To sum up we

                    this more clearly if you hear what the property was. My father, men of the jury,
                    left two factories, both doing a large business. One was a sword-manufactory,
                    employing thirty-two or thirty-three slaves, most of them worth five or six
                    minae each and none worth less than three minae. From these my father received a
                    clear income of thirty minae each year. The other was a sofa-manufactory,
                    employing twenty slaves, given to my father as security for a debt of forty
                    minae. These brought him in a clear income of twelve minae. In money he left as
                    much as a talent, loaned at the rate of a drachma a month,<note resp="Loeb"

                    submitted an account of eleven minae a year, four minae a year less than it
                    should have been; and the defendant who had charge of the business at the first
                    for two years shows no profit whatever, but says sometimes that the factory was
                    idle, and sometimes that he was not himself the manager, but that the foreman,
                    <persName><surname>Milyas</surname></persName>, a freedman of ours, had
                    charge of it, and that I should look for an accounting from him. If he persists
                    even now in making any of these statements he will easily be convicted of
                    falsehood. <milestone n="20" unit="section"/>If he declares that the factory was
                    idle, yet he has himself rendered an account of money expended, not on

                    swordhandles, and other supplies&mdash;indicating that the workmen were
                    busy. Furthermore, he charges me with money which he has paid to Therippides for
                    the hire of three slaves of his who were in my factory. Yet if no work was being
                    done, Therippides should have received no pay, nor should these expenditures

                    produce witnesses in whose presence he delivered them. Seeing that he has done
                    neither of these things, how can you doubt that he is keeping thirty minae, the

                    possession of them and enjoyed the profits from them for ten years, they have in

                    prevent anyone else from advancing money on the same security, he himself loaned
                    to Moeriades on the security of these same slaves the sum of five hundred
                    drachmae, which he admits he has duly recovered from him in full. <milestone

                    and whose loan was so long subsequent to ours, should from funds that were ours
                    have recovered both principal and interest, and have suffered no loss whatever?

                    also for sale to anyone else who wished to buy, is made clear by the fact that
                    he himself during his lifetime used to sell these materials, and that after his

                    and that of this amount Aphobus has separately taken three talents and one
                    thousand drachmae. I shall set down separately at a higher figure than they do
                    themselves the moneys they have expended, and shall deduct all the sums they

                        <milestone n="35" unit="section"/>They confess to have received from my

                    this sum there are nearly seventy-seven minae, the income from the slaves, which
                    were not received all at once, and a little less than four talents of which they
                    got possession immediately. Now, if you add to this last sum the interest for
                    ten years, reckoned at a drachma only<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">That is,
                        at 12 percent, as above. Demosthenes is liberal indeed in his allowances.
                        The entire sum of seventy-seven minae is crossed off as balanced by
                        expenditures; the interest on four talents for ten years is set down as four

                        talent&rpar;, is reckoned as seven talents.</note> you will find that
                    the whole, principal and interest, amounts to eight talents and four thousand
                    drachmae. <milestone n="36" unit="section"/>From the seventy-seven minae, the
                    profits of the factory, the cost of maintenance of the men must be deducted, for
                    Therippides expended for this seven minae a year, and I admit having received
                    thus much. Thus they expended on our behalf in the ten years seventy minae for
                    maintenance; to this I add the balance, seven hundred drachmae, and thus credit
                    them with a larger expenditure than they do themselves. There must also be
                    deducted from the eight talents and more the sum they handed over to me when I
                    came of age, and the taxes which they have paid to the state. <milestone n="37"
                        unit="section"/>The defendant and Therippides paid me thirty-one minae, and
                    they compute that they have paid eighteen minae in taxes. I will go beyond them
                    and will make this sum thirty minae, that they may have not a word to say in
                    protest. Well, then, if you take away one talent from the eight, seven are left,
                    which, according to their own admissions of receipts, they must necessarily have
                    in their possession. This sum, then, even if they rob me of everything else and
                    deny that they have it, they ought at least to have paid me, seeing that they

                    what is it that they do? They report no return in interest for this money, and

                    seventy-seven minae; and Demophon has, moreover, actually set me down as
                    indebted to him. Is not this absolute and barefaced effrontery? Is it not the

                    not assent to it, in order that he may not appear to have received it. But as to
                    the amount of the estate he, too, reveals absolutely nothing, nor as to letting
                    the property. For it was not to his interest either to make these further

                    gave to Therippides the interest on a sum so considerable, and to Demophon that
                    on the two talents&mdash;though he was not yet to marry my

                        &ldquo;dares&rdquo; his opponent to give an oath, or to offer a

                    If he fails to prove this, why should you pay any attention to his challenge? He
                    still does not prove that I have the money. <milestone n="53" unit="section"

                    he is now before you, he had the audacity to make an outrageously false
                    statement, to the effect that my father left me four talents buried in the
                    ground, and that he had put my mother in charge of them. He made this statement
                    in order that, if I should assume that he would repeat it here, I might waste my
                    time in refuting it, when I ought to be preferring the rest of my charges
                    against him; or if I should pass it over, not expecting him to repeat it, then
                    he himself might now bring it up, in the hope that I, by seeming to be rich,
                    might meet with less compassion from you. <milestone n="54" unit="section"/>Yet
                    he who dared to make such a statement put in no evidence to prove it, but relied
                    on his bare word, as though you would lightly give him credence. When one asks
                    him upon what he has spent so much of my money, he says he has paid debts for
                    me, and so represents me as poor; yet, when it pleases him, he makes me rich, as
                    it seems, seeing that my father left such a sum of money in the house. It is
                    easy to see, however, from many considerations that he is lying, and that there
                    is no basis of fact in this story. <milestone n="55" unit="section"/>For if my
                    father had no confidence in these men, it is plain that he would neither have
                    entrusted to them the rest of his property, nor, if he had left this money in
                    the way alleged, would he have told them of it. It would have been the height of
                    madness to tell them of hidden treasure, when he was not going to make them
                    trustees even of his visible property. But if he had confidence in them, he
                    would not, I take it, have given into their hands the bulk of his property, and
                    not have put them in control of this. Nor would he have entrusted this remainder
                    to my mother to keep, and then have given her herself in marriage to this man
                    who was one of the guardians. For it is not reasonable that he should seek to
                    secure the money through my mother, and yet to put one of the men whom he
                    distrusted in control both of her and of it. <milestone n="56" unit="section"
                    />Furthermore, if there were any truth in all this, do you suppose Aphobus would
                    not have taken my mother to wife, bequeathed to him as she was by my father? He
                    had already taken her marriage-portion&mdash;the eighty minae&mdash;as
                    though he were going to marry her; but he subsequently married the daughter of

                    in her custody, as he alleges, don't you imagine he would have raced to get

                    had the chance, from seizing a fund to the evidence of which you would not be
                    able to testify? Who can believe this? It is impossible, men of the jury; it is
                    impossible. No; my father entrusted to these men all the property which he left,

                    has been doubled or trebled, but that the mere principal has been paid back to
                    me in full. But if out of fourteen talents they have handed over to me not even
                    seventy minae, and one of them has actually recorded me as in his debt, how can

                    themselves, and have increased my estate from the income, besides keeping the
                    principal intact. Yet they did nothing of the sort. Instead, by selling to one
                    another the most valuable of the slaves and by absolutely doing away with the
                    rest, they destroyed the existing source of my income and secured a considerable

                    the estate were one of five talents only; they do not produce the principal,
                    though reporting no income from it, but have the impudence to tell me that the

                    men, and by the third am even set down as a debtor, have I not good ground for
                    indignation? Nay, it is wholly clear. If I had been left an orphan of a year
                    old, and had been six years longer under their guardianship, I should never have
                    recovered even the pitiful amounts I now have. For, if the expenditures they
                    have made were justifiable, the sums they have handed over to me would not have
                    lasted six years, but they would either have had to support me themselves or to

                    important a piece of evidence, they should expect you to believe them on their
                    mere word. It was their duty on the contrary, as soon as my father died, to call
                    in a number of witnesses and to bid them seal the will, so that, in case any
                    dispute should arise, it would have been possible to refer to the writing

                    memoranda; but the will itself, which gave them possession of the papers to
                    which they affixed their seals, and all the rest of the property, and which
                    acquitted them of all responsibility for not letting the estate, they did not

                    you have plainly disclosed it to the state, but have hidden it absolutely from

                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>If I were not
                    conscious, men of the jury, that in a former suit against Aphobus I had readily
                    &lpar;so absolutely manifest were his wrongdoings&rpar; convicted him of
                    lies greater and more outrageous than these which he now utters, I should have
                    grave doubts of my ability to show how he seeks to lead you astray in regard to
                    each one of them. As it is, however &lpar;be it said with the favor of
                    heaven&rpar;, if you prove fair and impartial hearers, I have strong hopes
                    that you will become as fully aware of the shamelessness of this man as were the
                    jurors in the former trial. If the case required eloquence or cleverness I
                    should shrink through distrust of my youth; but, as matters are, I need merely
                    point out and rehearse to you what the plaintiff's conduct toward us has been.
                    From this it will be easy, I think, for all of you to determine which of us is
                    the villain. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>I
                    know that the plaintiff has instituted this suit, not because he believes he can
                    convict anyone of having borne false witness against him, but because he thinks
                    that the large amount of damages which he was condemned to pay will give rise to
                    a feeling of prejudice against me, and of compassion toward himself. For this
                    reason he is now seeking to defend himself against charges made in a suit that
                    has already been decided, regarding which he had at the time no reasonable
                    defence to make. I, for my part, men of the jury, if I had proceeded to execute
                    the judgement against him and had been unwilling to make any reasonable
                    concession, should even so have done no wrong in exacting the damages awarded by
                    your decision; but for all that it might have been said that I had shown undue
                    ruthlessness and enmity toward a man who is a relative in depriving him of all
                    his property. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>But, as it is, the precise
                    contrary is the truth. This man with his co-trustees has robbed me of my entire
                    patrimony, and, even after being clearly convicted in your court, he does not
                    consider himself obliged to do anything reasonable. On the contrary he has
                    dispersed his property, giving his farm-buildings to Aesius and his farm to
                    Onetor, against whom he has forced me to engage in a troublesome lawsuit. He
                    himself stripped the house of its furniture, took away the slaves, destroyed the
                    wine-vat, tore off the doors, and all but set fire to the house itself; then he
                    made off to <placeName key="perseus,Megara">Megara</placeName>, where he has
                    settled and paid the alien's tax. You would, therefore, with better ground
                    loathe this man for deeds like these, than judge me guilty of undue severity.
                        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Regarding
                    the rapacity and vile character of the plaintiff I purpose to speak at length
                    before you later on, though what you have even now heard gives you a fair idea
                    of it. But I shall now undertake to show you, that the testimony which has been
                    given, about which you are going to cast your votes, is true. But one request I
                    make of you, men of the jury, and it is a reasonable one&mdash;that you will
                    give us both a fair hearing. This is as much in your interest as in mine, for
                    the more accurate your knowledge of the facts, the more just and in harmony with
                    your oaths will be the vote you will cast regarding them. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/>I shall show that Aphobus has not only acknowledged
                    <persName><surname>Milyas</surname></persName> to be a freeman, but has
                    even proved it by his actions; that, furthermore, about this matter he has
                    declined the absolutely sure test by torture,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">On

                    to have the truth brought to light that on the contrary he has recourse to
                    trickery, brings forward false witnesses, and by his own words distorts the
                    truth regarding what has taken place. So strong and so plain is the evidence by
                    which I shall prove these statements that you will all see clearly that it is I
                    who am speaking the truth, and that he has uttered not a word worthy of
                    credence. I shall begin at a point which will make it easiest for you to learn
                    the facts, and for me to instruct you regarding them in the briefest time.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>I instituted
                    suit, men of the jury, against Demophon, Therippides and the plaintiff for
                    breach of trust in their guardianship, for I had been defrauded by them of all
                    my inheritance. When my suit against Aphobus in the first instance came up for
                    trial, I proved clearly to the jury, as I shall prove to you, that he, in
                    conjunction with the others, had robbed me of all the property that had been
                    left me; and I relied upon no false testimony. <milestone n="7" unit="section"
                    />Here is a clear proof of this. A host of depositions was read at the trial,
                    some of the deponents declaring that they had given to the plaintiff property of
                    mine, others that he had received such property in their presence, still others
                    that they had purchased goods from him, and paid him the price; yet he has
                    charged not a single one of these with bearing false testimony. He has dared to
                    attack this one piece of testimony, and it alone, although in it he cannot show
                    that there was mention even of one single drachma. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/>And yet for the computation of the sums of which I had been
                    robbed, I relied not so much on this man's testimony, for there was no mention
                    of money in it, but on the several statements of the others, against whom the
                    plaintiff has made no charges. Therefore the jurymen who at that time heard my
                    plea, not only found him guilty, but fixed the damages at the full amount stated
                    in my complaint. Why was it, then, that he passed over the other witnesses and
                    sued the defendant alone? I will tell you. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>In
                    regard to all the witnesses who testified that he had received the money, he
                    knew that the more discussion there should be over each separate point, the more
                    convincingly would he be convicted of possessing it, and this was bound to be
                    the case in a trial for false witness; for the accusations which I then made
                    along with all the others in a small part of the time allotted me, I should now
                    discuss severally and in detail in the time of an entire speech; <milestone
                        n="10" unit="section"/>whereas, if he attacked an answer given, he thought
                    that as he had made an admission before, so now it would be in his power to make
                    a denial.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">That is, in attacking the testimony of
                        the deponent he would deny his own previous admissions.</note> That is the
                    reason why he attacks the testimony of this witness, the truth of whose
                    testimony I mean to prove conclusively to you all, not on the basis of
                    probabilities, or of arguments made up to fit the occasion, but by reasoning
                    which, I am sure, will approve itself to you all as just and fair. Listen, and
                    judge. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>I knew,
                    men of the jury, that I should find the whole contest centring about the
                    deposition inserted in the record, and that it would be regarding the truth or
                    falsehood of this that you would cast your votes, and I therefore determined
                    that the first step for me to take was to offer Aphobus a challenge. What, then,
                    did I do? I offered to surrender to him for examination by torture a slave who
                    knew how to read and write, and who had been present when Aphobus made the
                    admission in question, and who wrote down the statement of the witness. This man
                    had been ordered by me not to use any fraud or trickery, nor to write down some
                    and suppress others of the statements made by the plaintiff regarding the
                    matters at issue, but simply to write the absolute truth, and what Aphobus
                    actually said. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>What better opportunity could
                    he have had of convicting us of falsehood than by putting my slave to torture?
                    But Aphobus knew better than anyone else that the slave had borne true
                    testimony, and therefore he declined the test. And in truth it is not one or two
                    only who know these facts; the challenge was not made in secret, but in the
                    midst of the agora where many were present.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Call,

                    regarding this, and have sworn so to do, he refused the proffered examination by
                    torture in regard to the testimony &lpar;the point to which he should have
                    devoted his argument&rpar;, and declares that he requires the slave to be
                    given up for testing in regard to other matters. In this he is lying. <milestone
                        n="14" unit="section"/>Is it not indeed monstrous that he should claim that
                    he is being outrageously treated by my refusal of his demand to have delivered
                    to him for torture a freeman &lpar;for such I shall conclusively prove
                    <persName><surname>Milyas</surname></persName> to be&rpar;, and
                    should not consider that my witnesses are being outrageously treated, when I
                    offer him one who is admittedly a slave, to be tested by torture regarding their
                    testimony, and he refuses? For he surely cannot maintain this, that for some
                    matters, which he himself desires, torture is a certain test, and for others
                    not. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"
                    />Furthermore, men of the jury, the first witness to give this testimony was
                    Aesius, the brother of the plaintiff. He now denies it, because he has allied
                    himself in the suit with Aphobus; but at that time he gave this testimony along
                    with the other witnesses, for he had no desire to perjure himself, or to suffer
                    the penalty which would straightway follow. Surely now, if I had been getting up
                    false testimony, I should not have put this man in my list of witnesses, seeing
                    that he was more intimate with Aphobus than with anyone else in the world, and
                    knowing that he was going to plead for him in the suit, and that he was an
                    adversary of my own. It is not reasonable that one should call as witness to a
                    false statement one who is an opponent of his own, and a brother of his
                    adversary. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/>I have many witnesses to these
                    facts, and circumstantial proofs no fewer in number than the witnesses. In the
                    first place, if he did not in very truth give this testimony, he would not be
                    denying it now, but would have done so at once in the courtroom, when the
                    deposition was read, for it would have answered his purpose better then than
                    now. In the second place Aesius would not have kept quiet, but would have sued
                    me for damages, if without cause I had made him liable to a charge of bearing
                    false witness against his brother, a charge on which men run the risk both of
                    damages in money and the loss of citizenship. <milestone n="17" unit="section"
                    />Again, in seeking to bring the truth of the matter to light, he would have
                    demanded of me the slave who wrote the depositions, in order that, if I refused
                    to give him up, I might seem to have no just ground for my statements. But, as
                    it is, so far from doing anything of the sort, he refused to accept the slave
                    for torture, when I, on his denial that he had given the evidence, offered him.
                    So plain is it that regarding this matter too both he and Aphobus as well were
                    alike unwilling to have recourse to torture. <milestone n="18" unit="section"

                    Aesius had given his testimony with the other witnesses, he made no denial of

                    deposition read, and that, when I offered the slave to them to be questioned by
                    torture regarding all these matters, he refused to accept the

                    set forth to you, men of the jury, what I consider a stronger proof than all
                    those that have been mentioned, to show that the plaintiff did give this answer.
                    When, despite the admissions which he is proved to have made, he demanded of me
                    <persName><surname>Milyas</surname></persName> for torture, I was so
                    eager to show on the spot that this, too, was a subterfuge on his part, that
                    what do you think I did? <milestone n="20" unit="section"/>I summoned Aphobus to
                    give evidence against Demo, his uncle and a partner in his crimes. I wrote out
                    the testimony which he now attacks as false and ordered him to make a deposition
                    to it. At first he brazenly refused, but when the arbitrator bade him depose, or
                    deny the fact under oath, he deposed, sorely against his will. And yet if the
                    man was a slave, and had not been already admitted by Aphobus here to be free,
                    what in the world induced him to make this deposition? Why did he not deny it on
                    oath, and so get free of the affair? <milestone n="21" unit="section"/>Pray note
                    that in regard to this matter also I was ready to give over to him for torture
                    the slave who had written the deposition, who would know his own handwriting,
                    and who clearly remembered that Aphobus had made the deposition. I was ready to
                    do this, not for want of witnesses who were present, for there were some; but in
                    order that he might not accuse these men of giving false testimony, and that the
                    result of the torture might support them. Yet it is not fair to condemn the
                    witnesses on his account. They alone of men who have as yet stood trial before
                    you can show that the plaintiff himself has borne witness to their testimony as

                    credence in his own witnesses, and he slanders mine, and declares that their
                    testimony is false.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>I wish now to speak of the
                    matter on the basis of probabilities. I am certain that you would all agree that
                    those who give false testimony are led to do so by bribes through stress of
                    poverty, or by friendship, or else by enmity toward the opposite party in the
                    suit. <milestone n="23" unit="section"/>Now no one of these reasons would have
                    led the men to testify in my favor. Not friendship; how could that be, seeing
                    that they are not engaged in the same pursuits, nor are they of like age, I will
                    not say with me, but with one another? Not enmity against my adversary, that is
                    plain; for one of them is his brother and pleads on his side; Phanus is a close
                    friend and a member of the same tribe; and Philip is neither friend nor enemy,

                    &ldquo;Demosthenes makes the following charges against Aphobus. Aphobus has
                    in his possession moneys of mine, received by him in his capacity as guardian,
                    as follows: eighty minae, which he received as the marriage-portion of my mother
                    in accordance with the terms of my father's will.&rdquo; This is the first
                    of the sums of which I claim to have been defrauded. Now what was the
                    declaration of the witnesses? &ldquo;That they were present before the
                    arbitrator, Notharchus, when Aphobus admitted that <persName><surname>Milyas</surname></persName> was a freeman, having been
                    emancipated by the father of Demosthenes.&rdquo; <milestone n="32"
                        unit="section"/>Consider now for yourselves whether in your judgement there
                    could be an orator, or sophist or magician so wondrously clever in speaking as
                    by means of this testimony to convince any man on earth that Aphobus is in
                    possession of the marriage-portion of the speaker's mother. What in heaven's
                    name would he say? &ldquo;Aphobus has admitted that <persName><surname>Milyas</surname></persName> is a freeman.&rdquo; And why on
                    that account is he any the more in possession of the marriage-portion? The
                    statement would surely not seem to prove it. <milestone n="33" unit="section"
                    />But how was it proved? In the first place, Therippides, his co-trustee,
                    testified that he had given him the money. Secondly, Demo, his uncle, and the
                    rest of the witnesses who were present, testified that he agreed to supply my
                    mother with maintenance, as being in possession of her portion. Against these
                    men he has lodged no charges, plainly because he knew that their testimony was
                    true. Besides this, my mother was ready to call to her side my sister and
                    myself, and swear with imprecations on our heads, if she spoke falsely, that
                    Aphobus had received her marriage-portion according to the terms of my father's

                    that he has possession of these eighty minae? And was it on the evidence of
                    these witnesses here or of those that he was convicted? I think it was on the
                    evidence of truth. He has enjoyed the interest on this sum for ten years, and
                    even though judgement has been given against him, cannot bring himself to pay it
                    back. Despite this, he declares that he has been outrageously treated and that
                    he lost the suit by reason of these witnesses. Yet not one of them testified
                    that he had received the marriage-portion. <milestone n="35" unit="section"

                    a consideration of the matter itself. Let us suppose that <persName><surname>Milyas</surname></persName> is being racked upon the wheel, and
                    consider what Aphobus would most wish him to say. Would it not be that he was

                    suppose he says so. Does that prove that the plaintiff has none? Far from it;
                    for I produced men who knew, men who paid him the money, men who were present in

                    the property, concerning which you demanded <persName><surname>Milyas</surname></persName> for torture to prove that it was never left us. If you

                    how you acted regarding the will. For although my father, men of the jury, wrote
                    a will containing an inventory of all that he left, with instructions for
                    letting the property, this will Aphobus never gave up to me, lest I should learn
                    from it the value of the estate, and admitted possessing only those items which
                    were so well known that he could not deny that he had them. <milestone n="43"
                        unit="section"/>The will, according to his statement, contained these
                    provisions: that Demophon should at once receive two talents, and should marry
                    my sister when she should come of age &lpar;this would be in ten
                    years&rpar;; that Aphobus himself should have eighty minae with my mother,
                    and the house to live in; and that Therippides should enjoy the interest on
                    seventy minae until I should reach manhood. All the rest of the property left to
                    me apart from these items, and the clause regarding the letting of the estate,
                    he suppressed from the will, not thinking that it was to his interest that these
                    matters should be made known in your court. <milestone n="44" unit="section"
                    />However, since it was admitted by Aphobus himself that my father on his
                    death-bed gave to each of these men such large sums of money, the jurymen at the
                    former trial considered these admissions to be a proof of the size of the
                    estate. For when a man gave out of his estate four talents and three thousand
                    drachmae by way of marriage-portion and legacy, it was plain that he took these
                    sums, not from a small estate, but from one &lpar;bequeathed to me&rpar;
                    of more than double this amount. <milestone n="45" unit="section"/><note

                    that he gave to Therippides the interest on seventy minae, and to Demophon that
                    on the two talents&mdash;though he was not yet to marry my sister. These
                    moneys it has been proved that Aphobus never gave over to me, nor even an amount
                    slightly less. Part of it he said he had spent, part he had never received, part
                    he knew nothing about, part was in the hands of so-and-so, part was in the

                    if he had confidence in them, he would not, I take it, have given into their
                    hands the bulk of his property, and not have put them in charge of the rest. Nor
                    would he have entrusted this remainder to my mother to keep and then have
                    pledged her herself in marriage to this man, who was one of the guardians. For
                    it is not reasonable that he should seek to make the money secure through her,
                    and yet put one of the men whom he distrusted in control both of her and of it.

                    all this, do you suppose that Aphobus would not have taken my mother to wife,

                    marriage-portion&mdash;the eighty minae&mdash;as though he were going to
                    marry her; but he subsequently married the daughter of Philonides of Melite,

                    us, he might get from him other eighty minae. But, if there had been four
                    talents in the house, and in her custody, as he alleges, don't you imagine he
                    would have raced to get possession both of her and of them? <milestone n="49"

                    indeed buried on the day on which it came into the hands of these men; and the

                    with many others of the Athenians, men of the jury, this man was well aware that
                    my guardians were proving false to their trust. Indeed, it became clear very
                    early that I was being wronged, so many were the discussions and arguments
                    regarding my affairs held before the archon and before other officials. For the
                    value of the property left me was well known, and it was pretty clear that the
                    administrators were leaving it unlet in order that they might have the use of
                    the money themselves. There was not a single one, therefore, among those who
                    realized what was going on, who did not expect that I should obtain a judgement

                    were Timocrates and Onetor. Of this I can give you the strongest of proofs. For
                    the defendant wished to give his sister in marriage to Aphobus, seeing that he

                    inconsiderable&rpar; as well; but he had not confidence enough in him to
                    abandon her marriage-portion. It was as if he felt, forsooth, that the property

                        remark is sarcastic. Demosthenes represents Onetor as fearing lest the suit

                        would be in a position to repay the marriage-portion, if called upon to do
                        so.</note> He did, however, give him his sister, but the portion,
                    Timocrates, who had been her former husband, agreed to keep as a loan with
                    interest at the rate of five obols.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">That is, at

                    been divorced, and that he was unable to get back her marriage-portion, which he

                    to be so seriously endangered. For it is impossible for them to claim that
                    poverty prevented their paying it over at once, since Timocrates has an estate
                    of more than ten talents, and Onetor one of more than thirty; so this cannot
                    have been the reason why they have not made an immediate payment. <milestone
                        n="11" unit="section"/>Nor can they claim that they had property indeed, but
                    no ready money, or that the lady was a widow, and that they therefore hastened
                    to conclude matters without at once paying her portion. For these men are in the
                    habit of lending considerable sums to others, and moreover, the lady was not a
                    widow, but when they gave her in marriage, it was from the house of Timocrates,
                    where she was living with him as his wife; so that there is no reasonable ground
                    why one should accept this excuse either. <milestone n="12" unit="section"
                    />Further, men of the jury, I think you would all agree to this, that, in
                    arranging a matter of this sort, anyone would choose to borrow money of another,
                    rather than fail to pay the dowry to his sister's husband. For if a man does not
                    settle this matter he becomes a debtor, regarding whom it is uncertain whether
                    he will meet his just obligations or not; but if together with the lady he gives
                    also what is hers, he becomes a kinsman and a brother-in-law, <milestone n="13"
                        unit="section"/>for he is not under any suspicion, since he has done all
                    that justice demanded. Seeing that the matter stands thus, and that they were
                    not forced by a single one of the causes which I have mentioned to let this debt
                    stand, and could not have desired to do so, it is not possible to suggest any
                    other excuse for non-payment. It must be for the reason which I have
                    mentioned&mdash;that they did not trust Aphobus enough to pay him the
                        dowry.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">To understand the argument of the
                        speech the reader should bear in mind certain facts regarding the Athenian
                        laws concerning marriage and divorce. To make a marriage legal at <placeName
                            key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> it was necessary that both bride
                        and bridegroom be of pure Athenian stock, and that the bride be given away
                        by her father, or, if she had no father living, by her nearest male relative
                        &lpar;her guardian or <foreign lang="greek">ku/rios</foreign>&rpar;.
                        The marriage-contract was between the bridegroom and this guardian, and the
                        marriage-portion was paid by the guardian to the bridegroom. In the case of
                        Onetor's sister Demosthenes asserts that the portion was not paid outright
                        to Aphobus, but was retained by her former husband, Timocrates, who was to
                        pay interest on it at 10 percent. The husband might divorce his wife, but he
                        was required to send her back to her guardian with her personal effects and
                        her portion, or to pay interest on the portion, normally at 18 percent until
                        it was paid. His action in sending away his wife was technically called
                            <foreign lang="greek">a)po/pemyis</foreign>. On the other hand the wife
                        might leave her husband with his consent, or for cause. If the husband's
                        consent could not be obtained, the woman presented herself before the archon
                        and stated her case. The act, taken on her initiative, was termed <foreign
                            lang="greek">a)po/leiyis</foreign>, and in this case, too, her portion
                        went with her.</note>

                    withheld the money, not for the reasons I have mentioned, but with the intention

                    have done. For when in so short a time they allege that they owed the money;
                    that they paid it; that the woman was divorced and could not recover the dowry;
                    and that they took a mortgage on the land; how can it be other than clear that
                    they are acting in collusion in their attempt to defraud me of the damages
                    awarded me by you? <milestone n="19" unit="section"/>I shall now endeavor to
                    prove to you from the answers given by the defendant himself, and by Timocrates,
                    and Aphobus, that it is impossible that the dowry should have been paid. For,
                    men of the jury, I questioned each of these men in the presence of many
                    witnesses. I asked Onetor and Timocrates whether any witnesses were present when
                    they paid the dowry, and Aphobus himself whether any were present when he
                    received it; <milestone n="20" unit="section"/>and they all answered severally
                    that no witness was present, but that Aphobus got it from them by instalments,
                    in such sums as he needed from time to time. And yet can any one of you believe
                    this, that, when the dowry was a talent, Onetor and Timocrates put so large a
                    sum into the hands of Aphobus without witnesses? Why, in paying him money, I
                    will not say in this manner, but even in the presence of many witnesses, one
                    would have taken every possible precaution<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">More
                        literally, &ldquo;one would have been rash to have trusted
                        him.&rdquo;</note> in order, if a dispute should arise, to be able
                    readily to recover in your court what was due. <milestone n="21" unit="section"
                    />No man, in concluding a transaction of such importance, I will not say with
                    such a man as Aphobus, but with anybody whatever, would have acted without a
                    witness. This is the reason why we celebrate marriage-feasts and call together
                    our closest friends and relations, because we are dealing with no light affair,
                    but are entrusting to the care of others the lives of our sisters and daughters,
                    for whom we seek the greatest possible security. <milestone n="22"
                        unit="section"/>The presumption is, then, that the defendant made the
                    settlement in the presence of the same witnesses before whom he had admitted the
                    indebtedness and promised to pay the interest, if he really did pay the dowry to
                    Aphobus. For, if he had acted in this way, he would have cleared himself of the
                    whole matter; but by paying him when they were alone, he would have left those
                    in whose presence he had made the agreement as witnesses that he was still a
                    debtor. <milestone n="23" unit="section"/>As it was, they could not induce their
                    friends, who were more honest men than themselves, to bear witness to the
                    payment of the money, and they thought that, if they produced other witnesses,
                    not related to them, you would not believe them. Again, if they said the payment
                    had been made all at once, they knew that we should demand for examination by
                    torture the slaves who had brought the money. These, if the payment had not been
                    made, they would have refused to give up, and so they would have been convicted
                    of fraud. But if they maintained that they had paid the money without witnesses
                    in the manner alleged, they thought to escape detection. <milestone n="24"

                    marriage-portion, Aphobus continued to hold and till the land just as before,
                    and to dwell with his wife, I knew well that all this was fiction and a pretence
                    to cover up the facts. <milestone n="27" unit="section"/>And wishing to make
                    this clear to you all, I deemed it right to convict him in the presence of
                    witnesses, in case he should deny that matters are as I have stated; and I
                    offered to him for torture a slave who knew well all the facts&mdash;one
                    whom I had taken from among those of Aphobus, since he had not paid the damages
                    within the time fixed by law. When I made this demand, Onetor declined to put
                    the slave to torture as to the question of his sister's living with Aphobus;
                    and, as to Aphobus's tilling the land, the fact was too plain to be denied, so
                    he confessed it. <milestone n="28" unit="section"/>Nor are these the only proofs
                    which make it easy to see that Aphobus continued to live with his wife and to
                    possess the land up to the time when the suit was begun; it is plain also from
                    the way in which he dealt with the land after judgement was given against him.
                    For, as though the property had not been mortgaged, but was to belong to me
                    according to the court's decision, he made off with everything that could be
                    carried away&mdash;the produce, and all the farm implements, except the

                    the mortgagor is to be seen cultivating it; that he should claim that his sister
                    has left her husband, when he is shown to have refused to accept the test by
                    torture regarding this very point; and that the one who is not living with his

                    after paying the dowry, as he claims, he got back, not the money, but a farm
                    whose title was under dispute,&mdash;this very man, as though he had had no
                    quarrel, and were in no way being wronged, but as though he were on the most
                    intimate terms possible with Aphobus, pleaded for the latter in the suit which I
                    brought against him! As for myself, though I had done him no conceivable injury,
                    he leagued with Aphobus, and sought by every means in his power to join in
                    robbing me of my patrimony, while for Aphobus, whom he should have regarded as a
                    stranger, if there is any truth in their present story, he sought to acquire

                    for this amount. These facts are admitted on all hands. Those who were then
                    serving on the jury in the courtroom and many of the bystanders know them well.

                    <milestone n="33" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Besides all
                    this, men of the jury, there is strong evidence from which it is easy to see
                    that the woman in reality continued to live with Aphobus and even up to the
                    present day has not separated from him. In fact, this woman, before she came to
                    Aphobus, was not unwedded for one single day, but left her living husband,
                    Timocrates, to come and live with Aphobus; and now during the space of three
                    years she has manifestly married no one else. Can anyone believe that she then
                    went directly from husband to husband, in order to avoid living as a widow, but
                    that now, supposing she has really left her husband, she would have endured to
                    remain a widow for so long when she might have married someone else, seeing that
                    her brother possessed so large a fortune, and she herself was so young?
                        <milestone n="34" unit="section"/>There is no truth in it, men of the jury;
                    you cannot believe it. It is a pure fiction. No; the woman is living openly with
                    Aphobus, and makes no secret of the matter. I shall bring before you the
                    evidence of Pasiphon, who cared for her when she was ill, and who saw Aphobus
                    sitting by her side in this very year, when my suit against the defendant had
                    already been instituted.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Take Pasiphon's

                    <milestone n="35" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>I knew, men of
                    the jury, that the defendant, immediately on the conclusion of the suit, had
                    received the goods from the house of Aphobus, and had come into control of his
                    property and all my estate as well, and I knew, further, that beyond all doubt
                    the woman was living with Aphobus. I therefore demanded of Onetor three female
                    slaves, who knew that the woman was living with Aphobus and that the effects
                    were in the hands of these men, in order that we might not have mere statements
                    but that the matters might be established by proof from the torture. <milestone
                        n="36" unit="section"/>But Onetor, when I made this challenge to him, and
                    all those present declared that my proposal was just, refused to have recourse
                    to this certain test, but, as though there were other and surer proofs regarding
                    such matters than torture and testimony, he produced no witnesses to prove that
                    he had paid the dowry, nor would he give up for torture the female slaves who
                    knew the fact, to prove that his sister was not living with Aphobus; and,
                    because I made this demand of him, he in an outrageous and insulting manner
                    refused to let me talk to him. Could there be a man more impossible to deal with
                    than he, or more ready to pretend ignorance of what is right? Take the challenge
                    itself and read it.<quote type="Challenge">

                    part hold that in both private and public matters the torture is the most
                    certain of all methods of proof, and when slaves and freemen are both available,
                    and the truth of a matter is to be sought out, you make no use of the testimony
                    of the freemen, but seek to ascertain the truth by torturing the slaves; and
                    very properly, men of the jury. For of witnesses who have given testimony there
                    have been some ere now who have been thought not to tell the truth; but of
                    slaves put to the torture no one has ever been convicted of giving false
                    testimony. <milestone n="38" unit="section"/>Yet Onetor, after refusing a test
                    so fair, and rejecting proofs so clear and so convincing, will produce Aphobus
                    and Timocrates as witnesses, the one that he has paid the dowry, and the other
                    that he has received it, and will demand that you believe him, when he pretends
                    that his transactions with them were without witnesses. For such simpletons does
                    he take you. <milestone n="39" unit="section"/>But that their words are neither
                    true nor like the truth I think I have&mdash;by the fact that at the first
                    they confessed that they had not paid the dowry, that again they pretended to
                    have paid it without witnesses, that the dates do not admit of their having paid
                    the money, seeing that the property was already in litigation, and finally by
                    all the other evidences adduced I have, as I think, conclusively proved.</p>
