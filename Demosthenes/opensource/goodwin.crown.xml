<div1 type="secgroup" n="1-8">
<p>The solemn earnestness with which Demosthenes undertook this vindication of his whole political life is shown by the unusual and impressive prayer with which he begins, and still more by its repetition. He shows the same spirit in the appeal to the Gods in <bibl n="Dem. 18.141">&sect; 141</bibl>, with which he introduces his account of the fatal events which led to Chaeronea, and in his peroration (<bibl n="Dem. 18.324">&sect; 324</bibl>).
</p>
<div2 type="section" n="1">
<p>1. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">toi=s qeoi=s pa=si kai\ pa/sais</lemma>, <gloss>to all the Gods and Goddesses.</gloss> <foreign lang="greek">*qeo/s</foreign> is Goddess as well as God, <foreign lang="greek">qea/</foreign> being poetic; thus <foreign lang="greek">h( qeo/s</foreign> is the common title of Athena. A slight extension of the solemn formula <foreign lang="greek">pa=si kai\ pa/sais</foreign> becomes absurdly comic in <bibl n="Aristoph. Birds 866">Ar. Av. 866</bibl> <foreign lang="greek">eu)/xesqe o)/rnisin *)olumpi/ois kai\ *)olumpi/h|si pa=si kai\ pa/sh|sin</foreign>.
</p>
<p>2. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">eu)/noian</lemma>: <foreign lang="greek">eu)/noia</foreign> may mean <gloss>de- votion</gloss> based on any superiority or merit, including <gloss>loyalty</gloss> of a subject to a prince or of a servant to his master (even of a dog to his mistress), <gloss>devotion</gloss> to a benefactor, and even enthusiasm for the success of a contestant in the games (though felt by a stranger). Here it means a good citizen's loyal <gloss>devotion</gloss> to the state.
</p>
<p>See Jackson's note on <foreign lang="greek">eu)/noia</foreign> in Trans. of Cambr. Philol. Soc. II. p. 115, where he explains the word in Arist. Pol. I. 6 (1255.a, 17) as &ldquo;loyalty, i.e. the willing obedience which an inferior renders to a kind and considerate superior.&rdquo; He refers especially to Arist. Eth. IX. 5, &sect;&sect; 3, 4 (1167.a, 18), <foreign lang="greek">o(/lws d) eu)/noia di) a)reth\n kai\ e)piei/keia/n tina gi/netai, o(/tan tw| fanh=| kalo/s tis h)\ a)ndrei=os h)/ ti toiou=ton. &mdash;<lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)/xwn diatelw=</lemma></foreign>: <foreign lang="greek">a)nti\ tou= a)ei\ e)/xw, *)attikw=s</foreign>. Schol. (See <bibl n="Goodwin syntax 879">M.T. 879</bibl>.) The words <foreign lang="greek">e)/xwn diatelei=</foreign> with <foreign lang="greek">eu)/noia</foreign> probably occurred in Ctesiphon's decree. Aeschines (III. 49) quotes from the decree <foreign lang="greek">o(/ti diatelei= kai\ le/gwn kai\ pra/ttwn</foreign>: see the spurious indictment (below) <bibl n="Dem. 18.54">&sect; 54</bibl>.10, and <bibl n="Dem. 18.57">&sect; 57</bibl>.2-3.
</p>
<p>3. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">u(pa/rcai moi</lemma>, <gloss>be granted me</gloss> (<gloss>be made available to me</gloss>). The fundamental idea of <foreign lang="greek">u(pa/rxw</foreign> in this sense is best seen in <foreign lang="greek">ta\ u(pa/rxonta</foreign>, <gloss>the resources</gloss> or <gloss>the existing conditions</gloss>, i.e. <gloss>what is available</gloss>, <gloss>what one has to depend on</gloss>: see note on <foreign lang="greek">u(pa/rxein</foreign> <bibl n="Dem. 18.95">&sect; 95</bibl>.5, and <foreign lang="greek">be/ltiston u(pa/rxei</foreign>, IX. 5.
</p>
<p>4. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)gw=na</lemma>: see note on <foreign lang="greek">a)gwni/zomai, <bibl n="Dem. 18.3">&sect; 3</bibl>.3.&mdash;<lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)/peiq)</lemma></foreign>, <gloss>secondly</gloss>: simple <foreign lang="greek">e)/peita</foreign> (without <foreign lang="greek">de/</foreign>) is the regular rhetorical <pb n="2"/> formula after <foreign lang="greek">prw=ton me/n</foreign> (see &sect;<bibl n="Dem. 18.8">&sect; 8</bibl>, 18, 177, 235, 248: cf. 267). Thucydides generally has this, but often <foreign lang="greek">e)/peita de/</foreign>.
</p>
<p>5. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">o(/per e)sti\</lemma>: sc. <foreign lang="greek">eu)/xomai</foreign>, refer- ring to the whole sentence <foreign lang="greek">o(/per... a)kroa/sasqai</foreign>. The relation of <foreign lang="greek">o(/per</foreign> to <foreign lang="greek">tou=to</foreign> here is clearly that of <foreign lang="greek">o(/ ti</foreign> (<bibl n="Dem. 18.8">&sect; 8</bibl>.6) to the following <foreign lang="greek">tou=to.&mdash;<lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)sti\ ma/lisq) u(pe\r u(mw=n</lemma></foreign>, <gloss>concerns you especially</gloss> (more than myself).
</p>
<p>6. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">eu)sebei/as</lemma>: referring to the oath (<bibl n="Dem. 18.2">&sect; 2</bibl>). Greek <foreign lang="greek">eu)se/beia</foreign> reached a lower level than our <gloss>piety</gloss>, including negative abstinence from impiety, so that one who does not break his oath is so far <foreign lang="greek">eu)sebh/s.&mdash;<lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">tou=to parasth=sai u(mi=n</lemma></foreign>, <gloss>may put this into your hearts</gloss>: <foreign lang="greek">tou=to</foreign> refers back emphatically to the omitted antecedent of <foreign lang="greek">o(/per</foreign>, as <foreign lang="greek">ou(/tws</foreign> (<bibl n="Dem. 18.2">&sect; 2</bibl>.7) to that of <foreign lang="greek">w(s</foreign>, and is explained by <foreign lang="greek">mh\ to\n a)nti/dikon k.t.l.</foreign>
</p>
<p>8. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">tou= pw=s...dei=</lemma>: explained by <foreign lang="greek">to\ kai\...xrh/sasqai</foreign> (end of <bibl n="Dem. 18.2">&sect; 2</bibl>): cf. <foreign lang="greek">peri\ tou= o(/ntina tro/pon xrh\ zh=n</foreign>, Plat. Rep. 352 D.
</p></div2>
<div2 type="section" n="2">
<p>1. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">to\n o(/rkon</lemma>: the Heliastic oath, which each judge had sworn. The document in XXIV. 149&mdash;151 purporting to be this famous oath (hardly authentic) has this clause: <foreign lang="greek">kai\ a)kroa/somai tou= kathgo/rou kai\ tou= a)pologoume/nou o(moi/ws a)mfoi=n</foreign>. For the connection of the laws with the oath, see note on <bibl n="Dem. 18.6">&sect; 6</bibl>.5.

<p>2. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">dikai/ois</lemma>, <gloss>just provisions.</gloss>
</p>
<p>3. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)kroa/sasqai</lemma>: this (<foreign lang="greek">*s</foreign>) or <foreign lang="greek">a)kro- a=sqai</foreign> (L) is far preferable to the emendation <foreign lang="greek">a)kroa/sesqai</foreign>, the fut. infin. being exceptional with <foreign lang="greek">to/</foreign>. The infin. with <foreign lang="greek">to/</foreign> here denotes simply <gloss>the provision for hearing both sides impartially</gloss> and is not in oratio obliqua (<bibl n="Goodwin syntax 96">M.T. 96</bibl>, <bibl n="Goodwin syntax 111">111</bibl>).
</p>
<p>4. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">to\ mh\ prokategnwke/nai</lemma>: <gloss>not having decided against</gloss> (<foreign lang="greek">kata/</foreign>) <gloss>either party in advance</gloss>, the perf. expressing completion (<bibl n="Goodwin syntax 109">M.T. 109</bibl>): <foreign lang="greek">to\ mh\ prokatagnw=nai</foreign> would be timeless, like <foreign lang="greek">to\ a)kroa/sasqai</foreign> (above) and <foreign lang="greek">to\ a)podou=nai</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">to\ e)a=sai</foreign> (below).&mdash;<lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ou)de\</lemma> (sc. <foreign lang="greek">mo/non</foreign>), <gloss>nor only</gloss> (cf. <bibl n="Dem. 18.93">&sect; 93</bibl>.1, 2).

<p>5. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">i)/shn</lemma> (pred.), <gloss>in equal measure.</gloss> &mdash;<lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kai\ th=| ta/cei...xrh/sasqai</lemma>, i.e. <gloss>to allow everyone to adopt not only</gloss> (<foreign lang="greek">kai\</foreign>) <gloss>that order of argument but also</gloss> (<foreign lang="greek">kai\</foreign>) <gloss>that general plan of defence which</gloss> etc.
</p>
<p>6. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)pologi/a|</lemma> refers strictly to the defence, which alone remained.&mdash;<lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">w(s... e(/kastos</lemma>: <foreign lang="greek">e(/kastos</foreign> is made subject of the relative clause, as this precedes; we reverse the order, and translate it with <foreign lang="greek">xrh/sasqai.&mdash;<lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">tw=n a)gwnizome/nwn e(/kastos</lemma></foreign> (not <foreign lang="greek">e(ka/teros</foreign>), acc. to Weil, is &ldquo;tout homme qui plaide sa <pb n="3"/> cause,&rdquo; a general expression. He remarks that <foreign lang="greek">a)gwni/zomai</foreign> applies especially to the defendant.
</p>
<p>This is a dignified appeal against the offensive demand of Aeschines (III. 202), that the court should either refuse to hear Demosthenes or (at least) compel him to follow his adversary's order of argument. Both parties could not be heard impartially if one were compelled <gloss>by the court itself</gloss> to present his case in the most damaging order at his opponent's dictation.

</p>
<p>3. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)gwni/zomai</lemma>, like <foreign lang="greek">a)gw/n</foreign>, used of contests of all kinds, here of a lawsuit. See the pun on the two meanings of <foreign lang="greek">a)gwni/sasqai peri\ qana/tou</foreign> in IV. 47.

What is plainly meant would sound unpleasant (<foreign lang="greek">dusxere/s</foreign>) and suggest disaster in the opening of his speech. See Quint. IX. 2, 54, who quotes &ldquo;quos ego&mdash; sed motos praestat componere fluctus,&rdquo; Aen. I. 135.

<p>7. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)k periousi/as</lemma>, <gloss>at an advantage</gloss>, lit. <gloss>from an abundance</gloss>, like a rich man who stakes little compared with his wealth.

<p>6. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kai\ pepoi/hka kai\ pepoli/teu- mai</lemma>: a familiar form of rhetorical amplification (opposed to modern ideas of style), for which ordinary speech would use <foreign lang="greek">pepoli/teumai</foreign> alone. Other instances are <foreign lang="greek">bebou/lhtai kai\ proh/|rhtai</foreign> (<bibl n="Dem. 18.2">&sect; 2</bibl>.6), <foreign lang="greek">pepragme/nwn kai\ pepoliteume/nwn</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">kateyeu/dou kai\ die/balles</foreign> (<bibl n="Dem. 18.11">&sect; 11</bibl>.3-7), <foreign lang="greek">e)tragw/|dei kai\ diech/|ei</foreign> (<bibl n="Dem. 18.13">&sect; 13</bibl>.6), <foreign lang="greek">die/balle kai\ diech/|ei</foreign> (<bibl n="Dem. 18.14">&sect; 14</bibl>.2), <foreign lang="greek">e)di/dacas kai\ diech=lqes</foreign> (<bibl n="Dem. 18.22">&sect; 22</bibl>.10), <foreign lang="greek">polemei=n kai\ diafe/resqai</foreign> (<bibl n="Dem. 18.31">&sect; 31</bibl>.4). In these cases one verb is generic and the other specific; but sometimes two verbs of nearly or quite the same meaning are used together for a similar rhetorical effect, as <foreign lang="greek">pra/ttein kai\ poiei=n</foreign> (<bibl n="Dem. 18.62">&sect; 62</bibl>.4), <foreign lang="greek">zw/ntwn kai\ o)/ntwn</foreign> (<bibl n="Dem. 18.72">&sect; 72</bibl>.3).

</p>
<p>10. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">di/kaios e)/xein</lemma>: the common personal construction (<bibl n="Goodwin syntax 762">M.T. 762</bibl>). The apodosis is future in sense, after the future <foreign lang="greek">o(/ ti a)\n a)nagka/zh|</foreign>.

<p>3. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">dikai/ws</lemma> belongs to <foreign lang="greek">a)kou=sai</foreign>, from which it is separated partly for emphasis, and partly to bring it directly before <foreign lang="greek">w(/sper</foreign>.

This double sanction was secured by enacting that these provisions of law should be a part of the Heliastic oath. <foreign lang="greek">gra/fw</foreign>, besides meaning <gloss>to propose a law</gloss> or <gloss>decree</gloss>, often refers to <gloss>the enactment</gloss> as a whole, as here.

<p>3. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ou(/tw die/keisqe</lemma>: when we com- pare this judicious account of the feelings of the Athenians towards the Phocians and Thebans in 346 B.C. and earlier with the impassioned language of the speech on the Embassy and of the Second and Third Philippics, we see the sobering effect of time and of recent events. When the Thebans were exulting in the devastation of Phocis by Philip, and the political interests of Athens demanded that the Phocians should be protected as allies, Demosthenes seemed to overlook their sacrilegious plundering of Delphi, which he now acknowledges. Again, the intimate alliance of Thebes and Athens in 339 B.C., and still more the destruction of Thebes by Alexander in 335, had changed the Athenians' bitter hatred to the deepest sympathy. Still the orator cannot deny the old hostility against Thebes, nor the chief ground for it.

Boeotia as a whole was nominally allied with Sparta; but Thebes and other towns became disgusted with Sparta's tyrannical conduct soon after the end of the war, and though Thebes had been the greatest enemy of Athens when the peace was made, she harboured Thrasybulus and his fellow exiles before they attacked the Thirty in 403. This disaffection ended in the Boeotian war in 395, in which Athens aided Thebes; in the battle of Haliartus the allies gained a doubtful victory over Sparta, which was made decisive by the death of Lysander on the field.

<p>4. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">krath/santes e)n *leu/ktrois</lemma>: the &ldquo;Leuctric insolence&rdquo; of Thebes (Diod.

In 370 Epaminondas with a Theban army invaded Laconia and marched up to the city of Sparta itself; but he did not venture to enter the unwalled town and withdrew into Arcadia. At this time he established Messene and Megalopolis, to hold Sparta in check. In this trying emergency, Sparta humiliated herself so far as to ask help from her old enemy, Athens. Her request was granted, and Iphicrates was sent into Peloponnesus to the aid of Sparta with 12,000 Athenians in the spring of 369 B.C. This saved Sparta from another invasion at this time. The alliance then formed remained unbroken, though sometimes strained, until after the battle of Mantinea in 362 B.C., in which Athens fought on the side of Sparta.

But the richest of all, the leaders of the symmories (<bibl n="Dem. 18.103">&sect; 103</bibl>.4), sometimes ingeniously used their legal duty of advancing the money for the trierarchy in case of special necessity as a means of avoiding even their own legal share of the expense.

Under the system which prevailed from 357 to 340 B.C., the 1200 richest citizens, who alone were liable to the duty of the trierarchy, were divided into 20 symmories, regularly of 60 men each. But exemption or changes in property might reduce the whole number of 1200 and the number in each symmory in any year. To each of these symmories was assigned a number of triremes to be fitted out in each year, regulated by the needs of the state. The symmory divided itself into smaller bodies (<foreign lang="greek">sunte/leiai</foreign>), each of which equipped a single ship. The expense was borne equally by all the members, without regard to their wealth. Each symmory probably had a single leader, and the 20 leaders, with the two classes called <foreign lang="greek">deu/teroi</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">tri/toi</foreign> (who are not mentioned elsewhere), evidently belonged to the <foreign lang="greek">triako/sioi</foreign>, perhaps including all of that class in the symmories (15 in each). The new law of Demosthenes imposed the burden of the trierarchy on the members of each symmory according to their taxable property, thus greatly increasing the assessment of the richer and diminishing that of the poorer members. Of this a striking case is given in <bibl n="Dem. 18.104">&sect; 104</bibl>.6, 7.

<p>The sophistical character of the argument of &sect;<bibl n="Dem. 18.112">&sect; 112</bibl>&mdash;119 explains the anxiety of the orator to cover its weakness by its position in the oration. The reply of Aeschines (III. 17 ff.) to this <foreign lang="greek">a)/fukton lo/gon, o(/n fhsi *dhmosqe/nhs</foreign>, probably written or greatly modified after hearing this passage, is conclusive. The law quoted by Aesch. (11), <foreign lang="greek">tou\s u(peuqu/nous mh\ stefanou=n</foreign>, certainly made no exception for those who gave money to the state while in office. Indeed, this very claim is one which needed to be established by the <foreign lang="greek">eu)/qunai</foreign>, in which it might be disputed: see Aesch. 23, <foreign lang="greek">e)/ason a)mfisbhth=sai/ soi to\n boulo/menon tw=n politw=n w(s ou)k e)pe/dwkas</foreign>. The claim of Demosthenes at least amounts to this, that any officer who asserts that he has expended more in the service of the state than he received should be exempt from the law <foreign lang="greek">tou\s u(peuqu/nous mh\ stefanou=n</foreign>. The specious argument that a man cannot fairly be called to account for the expenditure of his own money on public <pb n="68"/> works could not release Demosthenes from <foreign lang="greek">eu)/qunai</foreign> when he had obviously had public money in his hands.

But this was not the case with the gifts of Demosthenes. These were both closely connected with the funds which he held as an officer of state, and the argument of Aeschines (23) applies to them in its full force. Demosthenes says nothing which shows that Ctesiphon did not violate the letter and even the spirit <pb n="69"/> of the law <foreign lang="greek">tou\s u(peuqu/nous mh\ stefanou=n</foreign>.

In 346&mdash;5 B.C. a general revision of the lists of citizens was ordered at Athens; and the members of each deme went through its own list (the <foreign lang="greek">grammatei=on lhciarxiko/n</foreign>), voting on each name which was questioned. This process was called <foreign lang="greek">diayh/fisis</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">diayhfi/zomai</foreign>), and the rejection of any person was called <foreign lang="greek">a)poyh/fisis</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">a)poyhfi/zomai</foreign>). Demosthenes wrote his oration against Eubulides (LVII.) for a client who had been thus rejected and had appealed (as every such person might) to a Heliastic court.

Except in the rare cases in which the Assembly itself undertook the trial (as in the <foreign lang="greek">mh/nusis</foreign> against Phidias, Plut. Pericl. 31), the people either sent the accused to a Heliastic court for trial or discharged him. The appeals of men like Aeschines moved the Assembly to discharge Antiphon: but the Areopagus interposed, and ordered (through the Assembly) that Antiphon be tried before a court, which condemned him to the rack and to death.

It is a mere challenge, made with no idea of its being accepted. For the genitive with <foreign lang="greek">e)pi\</foreign> see LVII. 61 (end). The time allotted to each speaker in most <pb n="88"/> cases was measured by the clepsydra or water-clock (Dict.

The term <foreign lang="greek">diamemetrhme/nh h(me/ra</foreign> is explained in Aesch. III. 197. In important public suits the day was divided into three parts, and the clepsydra was filled three times, the first measure of water being given to the accuser, the second (of equal amount) to the accused, and the third (in <foreign lang="greek">a)gw=nes timhtoi/</foreign>, if the accused was convicted), a smaller measure, to the <foreign lang="greek">ti/mhsis</foreign>, the decision <foreign lang="greek">o(/ ti xrh\ paqei=n h)\ a)poti/sai</foreign>.

And the further remark of Demosthenes, <foreign lang="greek">ou)d'  a(\ nu=n ou(=tos profasi/zetai</foreign> (5), seems to imply that Aeschines had told a different story about the intentions of the Amphissians when he made his report of the meeting at Delphi (III. 125) from that which he told in court.

<p>Demosthenes distinctly implies that Cottyphus was made general at the spring meeting, but that, after a mere pretence of war, intrigues at once began for superseding him by Philip at the autumnal meeting (<foreign lang="greek">ei)s th\n e)piou=san *pulai/an</foreign>). Aeschines, on the contrary, whose whole object is to show that a real Amphictyonic war was intended, with no help or thought of help from Philip, and to represent Philip's final appointment as commander as a remote afterthought, states that no action was taken against the Amphissians in the spring, but that a special meeting was called before the regular autumnal <foreign lang="greek">*pulai/a</foreign>, to take such action (124). At this special meeting, which Athens and Thebes refused to attend (Aesch. 126&mdash;128), Cottyphus was chosen general, (according to Aesch.) while Philip was &ldquo;away off in Scythia&rdquo;; and after a successful campaign the Amphissians were fined and their offending citizens were banished. But they refused to submit; and finally, &ldquo;a long time afterwards&rdquo; (<foreign lang="greek">pollw=| xro/nw| u(/steron</foreign>), a second expedition became necessary &ldquo;after Philip's return from his Scythian expedition&rdquo;; &mdash;he does not even then say that Philip was actually made general!

See introductory note on &sect;<bibl n="Dem. 18.126">&sect; 126</bibl>&mdash;226. After speaking of the enmity between Athens and Thebes, which men like Aeschines had encouraged (&sect;<bibl n="Dem. 18.160">&sect; 160</bibl>&mdash; 163), he gives a graphic account of the panic excited at Athens by Philip's seizure of Elatea, and of the manner in which he took advantage of this emergency to bring Athens and Thebes to a better understanding and even to an alliance against the common enemy (&sect;<bibl n="Dem. 18.168">&sect; 168</bibl>&mdash;226). Into this account he introduces (&sect;<bibl n="Dem. 18.189">&sect; 189</bibl>&mdash;210) a most eloquent and earnest defence of the whole line of policy in opposition to Philip which Athens had followed chiefly by his advice. He pleads that Athens, with her glorious traditions, could have taken no other course, even if she had seen the fatal defeat at Chaeronea in advance. This is the most eloquent and impassioned passage in the oration; and it is addressed not merely to the court, but to the whole people and to future ages.

<p>The orator introduces this continu- ation of his political history in an apologetic way, as in <bibl n="Dem. 18.110">&sect; 110</bibl>.5 he professed to leave it doubtful whether he should speak at all of these later acts, <foreign lang="greek">ta\ me/gista......pepragme/nwn</foreign> (see note). This is a part of the skilful device by which he divides the long account of his public life, while at the same time he reminds the court that the brilliant passage which follows is over and above what is needed to defend Ctesiphon (see <bibl n="Dem. 18.126">&sect; 126</bibl>.1), and asks their attention to it as a personal favour to himself.

Here follows the famous description of the panic in Athens when the news of the seizure of Elatea arrived, and of the meeting of the Assembly which was suddenly called to consider the alarming situation. This is a celebrated example of <foreign lang="greek">diatu/pwsis</foreign>, <gloss>vivid delineation.</gloss>
</p></div2>
<div2 type="section" n="169">
<p>1. The succession of tenses, <foreign lang="greek">h)=n, h(=ke</foreign> (<gloss>had come</gloss>), and <foreign lang="greek">katei/lhptai</foreign> (the direct form for the indirect), makes the narrative lively and picturesque at the outset. Much would have been lost if he had said <foreign lang="greek">h)=lqe d) a)gge/llwn tis w(s kateilhmme/nh ei)/h.&mdash;<lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">w(s tou\s pruta/neis</lemma></foreign>: the message came to the Prytanes, the fifty senators of one of the ten tribes, who for their term of one-tenth of the year represented the authority of the state. Their office was the <foreign lang="greek">qo/los</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">skia/s</foreign>, a round building with a cupola in the <foreign lang="greek">a)gora/</foreign>, adjoining the Senate-house and the <foreign lang="greek">mhtrw=|on</foreign> with its record-office. There the <foreign lang="greek">e)pista/ths</foreign> of the Prytanes was expected to spend his whole day and night of office, with a third of the Prytanes whom he had selected (Arist. Pol. Ath. 44.5), so as to be accessible in emergencies like the present; and there the state provided meals for all the Prytanes. The <foreign lang="greek">qo/los</foreign> is distinct from the ancient Prytaneum or City Hall, where certain privileged persons (<foreign lang="greek">a)ei/sitoi</foreign>) had their meals at a public table, to which ambassadors and other guests of the state were sometimes invited.
</p>
<p>4. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">tou\s...skhnw=n</lemma>: cf. <bibl n="Dem. 18.44">&sect; 44</bibl>.4.
</p>
<p>5. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ta\ ge/rra</lemma>, probably the wicker- work with which the booths (<foreign lang="greek">skh=nai</foreign>) in the market-place were covered. The word can mean also anything made of twigs, and is used of a wicker fence which enclosed the <foreign lang="greek">e)kklhsi/a</foreign> (see Harpocr. under <foreign lang="greek">ge/rra</foreign>, and LIX. 90). But the close connection of the two clauses, <gloss>drove out those in the booths</gloss> and <gloss>burnt the</gloss> <foreign lang="greek">ge/rra</foreign>, shows that the <foreign lang="greek">ge/rra</foreign> which were burnt were taken from the booths. Otherwise there is no reason for driving the poor hucksters out at all. If it is said that this was done to prepare for the &ldquo;monster meeting&rdquo; the next morning, we must remember, first, that the Assembly was held in the Pnyx, not in the <foreign lang="greek">a)gora/</foreign>; and, secondly, that there was to be a meeting of the Senate before that of the Assembly, which would give time enough to make all necessary preparations after daybreak. To suppose, further, that the booths were torn to pieces and burnt on the spot after dark, merely to clear the <foreign lang="greek">a)gora/</foreign>, when there was no pressure of time, even if the place needed clearing at all, is to impute to the Prytanes conduct well worthy of <pb n="107"/> madmen. Such a panic as this senseless proceeding would have caused was surely the last object which these guardians of the state could have had, when they left their supper unfinished and hastened into the market-place. Their first object certainly was to secure a full meeting of the Assembly the next morning. It will be noticed that while some (<foreign lang="greek">oi( me\n</foreign>) of the Prytanes were engaged in clearing the booths, others (<foreign lang="greek">oi( de\</foreign>) were summoning the ten Generals. The Generals and the Prytanes had the duty of calling special meetings of the Assembly (<foreign lang="greek">e)kklhsi/as sugklh/tous</foreign>): see Thuc. IV. 118.52, <foreign lang="greek">e)kklhsi/an de\ poih/santas tou\s strathgou\s kai\ tou\s pruta/neis</foreign>, and II. 59.11 (of Pericles), <foreign lang="greek">su/llogon poih/sas</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">e)/tid'  e)strath/gei</foreign>). There can, therefore, be hardly a doubt that the two acts were connected with summoning the Assembly. To do this effectually it was necessary to alarm the whole of Attica immediately; and the natural method for this was to light bonfires on some of the hills near Athens, which would be a signal to distant demes to light fires on their own hills. A fire on Lycabettus could thus give signals directly and indirectly to the whole of Attica, and probably this was understood as a call of the citizens to a special Assembly. As material for lighting signal fires might not always be on hand, it is likely that the dry covering of the booths struck the eyes of the Prytanes as they came out of their office, and that they took them in their haste for this purpose. Their high authority was needed to prevent resistance on the part of the owners of the booths.

<p>1. <foreign lang="greek"><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">skhpto\s</lemma> [h)\ xeimw\n</foreign>]: most recent editors omit <foreign lang="greek">h)\ xeimw\n</foreign> on the ground that the orator, after comparing the sudden raid of Philip to a thunderbolt, would not weaken his figure by adding a common storm.

We certainly should not notice the difference if the same form (either with or without <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign>) were used in both. And yet the distinction is one of principle, and is generally obvious and important. In the form without <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> the chief force falls on the infinitive, while in the form with <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> it falls on <foreign lang="greek">e)/dei, e)ch=n, xrh=n</foreign>, etc., to which the <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> belongs.

It is not hard to see why Demosthenes should be unwilling to repeat any part of this brilliant speech. The hope of successes of the allies against Philip, which he probably held out, had been disappointed by the crushing defeat at Chaeronea; and the destruction of Thebes three years later must have made the whole tone of this speech now sadly untimely. Plutarch (Dem. 18) gives a graphic account of the Theban assembly and of the address, which was probably one of the orator's greatest efforts.

<div2 type="section" n="215">
<p>1. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)ka/loun u(ma=s</lemma>, i.e. <gloss>called your army</gloss> to Thebes. This is what Demosthenes provided for in <bibl n="Dem. 18.178">&sect; 178</bibl>.2-4 (see notes), when he proposed to give the embassy concurrent power with the generals over the movements of the army. This march to Thebes, after the answer of the Thebans had been sent to Athens (<foreign lang="greek">meta\ tau=ta</foreign>), is commonly thought to be directly opposed to the account of Aeschines in III. 140: Dissen exclaims indignantly, &ldquo;Haeccine manifesta mendacia <pb n="134"/> potuisse coram judicibus dici!&rdquo; But Aeschines says only that the march to Thebes took place <foreign lang="greek">pri\n peri\ summaxi/as mi/an mo/nhn sullabh\n gra/yai *dhmosqe/nhn</foreign>. Now that the &ldquo;decree of Demosthenes&rdquo; (181&mdash;187) is known to be a forgery, we have no reason for thinking that any formal treaty of alliance preceded the invitation of the Athenian army to Thebes. Demosthenes could have proposed such a treaty only after his return to Athens. It appears from the criticisms of Aeschines on the treaty (141&mdash;144) that it was an elaborate document; and it is probable that it was not made and ratified until some time after the march to Thebes, which required no further legislation than the decree appointing the ambassadors. It must be remembered that Demosthenes (<bibl n="Dem. 18.178">&sect; 178</bibl>) proposed that the embassy should simply offer the Athenian army to Thebes without insisting on any formal terms, <foreign lang="greek">e)pagge/llesqai bohqh/sein a)\n keleu/wsin</foreign>.
</p>
<p>3. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)/cw...o)/ntwn</lemma>: this is commonly referred to the Athenian army, who are supposed to have first encamped outside the city and afterwards to have been invited to enter Thebes and occupy the houses. It is surely far more natural and agrees better with the context to understand that, while the Theban infantry and cavalry (i.e. the whole army) were encamped outside the walls, the Athenian army was quartered in the town. The lack of a pronoun to designate which army is meant is felt in both interpretations; but as the subject is the Thebans, it is more natural to refer the absolute clause to them. Again, the emphasis <gloss>given twice</gloss> to <foreign lang="greek">pai=das kai\ gunai=kas</foreign> (5 and 13) implies that the men were absent; and <foreign lang="greek">e)f'  u(mi=n poih/santes</foreign> (13), as a testimony to the <foreign lang="greek">swfrosu/nh</foreign> of the Athenians, implies this still more strongly.

Aeschines refers here only to the facts concerning the peace of Philocrates; but Demosthenes chooses to apply the remarks to his whole political life. While Aeschines referred only to the debit side of the account, Demosthenes speaks of both sides, and especially of what stands on the credit side of his own account with the state, including credit for preventing calamities by his judicious policy. He ends (<bibl n="Dem. 18.251">&sect; 251</bibl>) by turning against Aeschines the case of Cephalus, which had been brought up against himself.

<p>In this section and <bibl n="Dem. 18.260">&sect; 260</bibl> we have a lively comic description, highly caricatured, of some Asiatic ceremonies of initiation, in which the mother of Aeschines is said to have taken part. This was some form of Bacchic worship, with perhaps a mixture of Orphic mysteries. It seems there was a written service (<foreign lang="greek">ta\s bi/blous</foreign>), which Aeschines read like a clerk while his mother officiated as priestess. The initiation of Strepsiades into the Socratic mysteries (<bibl n="Aristoph. Cl. 255">Ar. Nub. 255</bibl>&mdash;262) probably caricatures some similar worship.

<p>Westermann thinks the argument of this section not quite fair, as it is not to be assumed that Aeschines assented to all which he did not oppose. But, apart from the obvious irony of parts of the argument (as in <foreign lang="greek">ou) ga\r e)p'  eu)noi/a| k.t.l.</foreign>), it was surely not too much to expect of the acknowledged &ldquo;leader of the opposition&rdquo; in such a desperate crisis, that he should at least protest strongly against measures of such vital importance as those which he censures afterwards, even if he could not propose any positive measures himself. Now it is an important part of the argument of Demosthenes, that Aeschines <gloss>said nothing whatever</gloss> on such occasions as the sudden seizure of Elatea by Philip. See <bibl n="Dem. 18.191">&sect; 191</bibl>.5, <foreign lang="greek">sou= d'  a)fw/nou...kaqhme/nou</foreign>: see the whole passage, &sect;<bibl n="Dem. 18.188">&sect; 188</bibl>&mdash;191. The only ground on which such neglect can be excused is the one here assumed, that the opposition had no better plan to propose. The plain truth is, of course, that Aeschines really wished to let Philip have his own way at this time.

He retorts by showing that his own oratorical power has always been exerted in behalf of Athens, while that of Aeschines has been used to help her enemies or to gratify personal malice. He refers to the testimony of the citizens in choosing him to deliver the eulogy on those who fell at Chaeronea, as a proof of his patriotism. Finally, he declares that the present calamities of Greece have been caused by men of the stamp of Aeschines in various Greek states; and he gives a black list of these traitors who have betrayed their countries to the common enemy.

We can be sure of one genuine verse (9), which is quoted by Demosthenes in <bibl n="Dem. 18.290">&sect; 290</bibl>.1 (see note on this verse). A small fragment of an inscription has been found at Athens, cut (acc. to K&ouml;hler) between 350 and 300 B.C., <pb n="178"/> which contains parts of six words of an epigram in the Anthol. Pal. VII. 245: this epigram was evidently inscribed to the heroes of Chaeronea. The full epigram is as follows, the letters found in the inscription being printed in heavy type:&mdash;

</p>
<p>This, though genuine, cannot be the inscription quoted by Demosthenes, as it does not have the verse <foreign lang="greek">mhde\n... katorqou=n</foreign>; but there were undoubtedly many epigrams commemorating the men of Chaeronea.

</p>
<p><gloss>v.</gloss> 2. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)peske/dasan</lemma>, <gloss>scattered</gloss>, <gloss>brought to nought</gloss>: a patriotic exaggeration as applied to Chaeronea, perhaps referring to some special exploits of the Athenians.

The meaning evidently is, <gloss>in the battle</gloss>, <gloss>while they sacrificed their lives</gloss>, <gloss>they left to the God of Death to judge whether they showed courage or fear.</gloss> There is a similar <gloss>hyperbaton</gloss> in <bibl n="Xen.

The two verses contain the <foreign lang="greek">e)k *dio\s kri/sis</foreign>; but the change of construction in <foreign lang="greek">moi=ran...e)/poren</foreign> is awkward, and <foreign lang="greek">e)n bioth=|</foreign> is an unnatural addition to <gloss>v.</gloss> 9.

<p>Kirchhoff (Hermes VI. pp. 487&mdash; 489) quotes from a MS. scholium: <foreign lang="greek">le/gei de\ *simwni/dhs e)n e)pigra/mmati r(hqe/nti au)tw=| e)pi\ toi=s *maraqw=ni pesou=sin *)aqhnai/wn to\n sti/xon tou=ton, *mhde\n a(martei=n e)sti qeou= kai\ pa/nta katorqou=n</foreign>.

These two quotations refer to a verse in which &ldquo;never to fail and always to succeed&rdquo; is called a divine prerogative; while in the same words in the inscription quoted by Demosthenes these are called a privilege sometimes granted by the Gods to favoured mortals (see <bibl n="Dem. 18.290">&sect; 290</bibl>). The original verse of Simonides, <foreign lang="greek">mhde\n... katorqou=n</foreign> (without <foreign lang="greek">e)n bioth=|</foreign>), was probably used, as a well-known verse, in the genuine epigram on those who fell at Chaeronea (still without <foreign lang="greek">e)n bioth=|</foreign>), but with a different meaning; and in this new sense it was quoted by Demosthenes in <bibl n="Dem. 18.290">&sect; 290</bibl>. The writer of our epigram probably borrowed the genuine line (perhaps from the text of Demosthenes), and added the whole of <gloss>v.</gloss> 10. See notes of West. and Bl.

He recapitulates some of his chief services in providing Athens with means of defence, and asks what similar claims Aeschines has to the public gratitude (&sect;<bibl n="Dem. 18.301">&sect; 301</bibl>&mdash;313). He objects to being compared with the great men of former times, though he declares that he can bear such a comparison far better than his opponent (&sect;<bibl n="Dem. 18.314">&sect; 314</bibl>&mdash;323).

<p>3, 4. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">eu)aggelizo/menos</lemma>, properly <gloss>an- nouncing good tidings</gloss> (cf. <foreign lang="greek">eu)agge/lion</foreign>, <gloss>Gospel</gloss>), but here <gloss>congratulating on good news</gloss>, e.g. saying &ldquo;<gloss>This is a great victory.</gloss>&rdquo;&mdash;<lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">tou/tois ou(\s a)\n... oi)/wmai</lemma>: the apparently definite antecedent is peculiar before the conditional relative clause. He means <gloss>any of those</gloss> (a well-known class) <gloss>who I ever think are likely to report thither</gloss> (to Macedonia) such an event as my congratulating them on a victory of Alexander. It has, I believe, never been asked who these men may have been. There were, of course, many Macedonians in Athens at this time, and there were many Athenians who would welcome news of Macedonian victories. But the greatest Macedonian who ever lived, the philosopher Aristotle, was then a resident in Athens at the head of the Lyceum. His relations with the Court of Pella and with Alexander were most intimate. Who would be more likely <pb n="198"/> to report to Pella, or even to Alexander himself, that Demosthenes had congratulated him on the victory at Arbela, if he had any such pleasant fact to report? It would be interesting, though not quite pleasant, to find an allusion to the great philosopher in this striking passage.

<p>4. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">tw=n...a)gaqw=n</lemma>: these <gloss>advantages</gloss> may be the early successes of the Spartan king Agis in his revolt against Macedonia in the spring of 330 B.C. (Diod. XVII. 63). Aeschines (167) quotes Demosthenes as saying of this, <foreign lang="greek">w(s a)ntipra/ttwn'  *aleca/ndrw|, &ldquo;o(mologw= ta\ *lakwnika\ susth=sai: o(mologw= *qettalou\s kai\ *perraibou\s a)fista/nai</foreign>.&rdquo; See Grote XII., ch. 95. The words <foreign lang="greek">tw=n ...a)gaqw=n</foreign> more probably refer to the interest of Athens in the reverses of Alexander, which were occasionally reported from Asia. Aeschines (164) describes Demosthenes as once reporting that Alexander was shut up in Cilicia, and <foreign lang="greek">au)ti/ka ma/la e)/melle sumpathqh/sesqai u(po\ th=s *persikh=s i(/ppou</foreign>. This shows that the mere report of a disaster to Alexander roused the spirit of liberty at Athens, even in her deep humiliation.
