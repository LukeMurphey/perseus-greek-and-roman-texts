                <head>On The Trierarchic Crown</head>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>If the decree,
                    men of the senate, ordered that the crown should be given to the man having the
                    largest number of advocates, it would have been senseless for me to claim it,
                    for Cephisodotus alone has spoken on my behalf, while a host of pleaders has
                    spoken for my opponents. But the fact is, the people appointed that the
                    treasurer should give the crown to the one who first got his trireme ready for
                    sea; and this I have done; so I declare that it is I who should be crowned.
                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Also I am surprised that my opponents
                    neglected their ships, but took care to get their orators ready; and they seem
                    to me to be mistaken in regard to the whole affair, and to imagine that you are
                    grateful, not to those who do their duty, but to those who say they do it; and
                    they have formed a totally different estimate regarding you from that which I
                    hold. For this very reason it is right that you should feel more kindly disposed
                    toward me; for it is plain that I entertain a higher opinion of you than they
                    do. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Surely it would have been right and proper,
                    men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, that those who claim
                    to receive a crown from you, should show that they are worthy of it, and not
                    speak ill of me. But since they leave out the former of these two things and do
                    the latter, I shall show that they are speaking falsely both in their praise of
                    themselves and in their slander of me; and I shall prove this by their own deeds
                    and by mine. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"
                    />When you had passed a decree and confirmed it, to the effect that whoever did
                    not bring his ship around to the pier before the last day of the month should be
                    placed under arrest and handed over to the court, I brought my ship up to the
                    pier, and for this I received a crown from you, while the others had not even
                    launched their ships; they therefore have made themselves liable to
                    imprisonment. Would it not, then, be the strangest possible act on your part, if
                    you should be seen to confer a crown on people who had suffered themselves to
                    become liable to so grievous a penalty? <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>As to
                    the ship's equipment, moreover, all, that is, which the state is bound to supply
                    to the trierarchs, I purchased it with my own resources and took nothing from
                    the public stores, while these men used equipment of yours and spent none of
                    their own money for this purpose. And surely they cannot say either that they
                    got their ship ready for trial before I did mine; for mine was manned before
                    they had so much as touched theirs, and you all saw the ship being tested.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>More than this, I secured the very best
                    rowers, giving by far the highest wages. If my opponents had had rowers inferior
                    to mine, it would have been nothing disgraceful, but in fact they have hired
                    rowers of no sort whatever, though they lay claim to larger numbers. And yet,
                    how can it be fair, when they manned their ship later than I did mine, for them
                    now to receive the crown as having been the first to get ready? <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I think therefore that even
                    without my saying anything you recognize that you would most justly grant me the
                    crown, but I wish to show you that of all people in the world these men have the
                    least claim to it. How can I prove this most clearly? By what they have
                    themselves done. For they sought out the man who would take their trierarchy on
                    the lowest terms, and have let the service to him. Yet is it not unjust to
                    shrink from making the outlay, and still to demand a share in the honors
                    accruing from it, and while they lay the blame for not bringing their ship up to
                    the pier at that time on the man they hired, to bid you now reward them for good
                    service rendered? <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>You ought, men of <placeName
                        key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, to seek a just course, not only in
                    the light of these considerations, but also in the light of your own previous
                    actions in the case of others who have acted as these men have done. For, when
                    you were worsted in the sea-fight against Alexander,<note resp="Loeb"
                        anchored="yes">Alexander of Pherae had defeated the Athenian fleet at
                        Peparethus in <date value="-361">361</date> B.C.</note> you thought that the
                    trierarchs who had let out their trierarchies were chiefly responsible for what
                    had happened, and you gave them over for imprisonment, having decided by show of
                    hands that they had betrayed their ships and deserted their post. <milestone
                        n="9" unit="section"/>The accusation was made by Aristophon, and you were
                    the judges; and, if the anger you felt had been equal to their crime, nothing
                    could have prevented their being put to death. My opponents, although they are
                    aware that they have done just what those others did, instead of shuddering
                    before you at the thought of what they ought to suffer, make speeches attacking
                    others, and demand that they themselves be crowned. And yet, consider what would
                    be thought of your way of reaching decisions, if you are seen to have condemned
                    some persons to death and to have crowned others for the same cause! <milestone
                        n="10" unit="section"/>And you would be thought to be making a mistake, not
                    only if you should do this, but also if you should fail to punish those who do
                    things of this sort, when you have them in your power. For the time to feel
                    indignation is not when you have suffered some of your possessions to be lost,
                    but while they are safe, but you see those placed in charge of them failing
                    through a shameful love of gain to make adequate provision for their safety. Let
                    no one of you condemn my speech because he regards it as bitter; condemn rather
                    those who have committed the crime; for it is because of them that my speech is
                    such as it is. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>I for my part wonder why in the
                    world these men should imprison and punish those of the sailors who desert their
                    ships&mdash;men who receive only thirty drachmae apiece,&mdash;while you
                    do not deal in the same manner with those of the trierarchs who do not sail with
                    their ships yet receive thirty minae apiece for so doing; if a poor man through
                    stress of need commits a fault, is he to be liable to the severest penalties,
                    while, if a rich man does the same thing through shameful love of gain, is he to
                    win pardon? Where, then, is equality for all and popular government, if you
                    decide matters in this way? <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>More than this, it
                    seems to me to be absurd that, when a man says anything contrary to law, he
                    should, if he is convicted, be deprived of one third of his personal
                        rights,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Precisely what this partial <foreign
                            lang="greek">a)timi/a</foreign> &lpar;disfranchisement&rpar;
                        was, it is impossible to state definitely.</note> while those guilty not of
                    words but of acts that are illegal should pay no penalty. Surely, men of
                        <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, you would all say that
                    leniency in regard to such offences merely trains up others to commit them.
                        <milestone n="13" unit="section"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I wish, now
                    that I have entered upon this subject, to set forth to you also the consequences
                    which result from such actions. When a man who has taken the trierarchy for hire
                    sets sail, he plunders and pillages everybody; the profits he reaps for himself,
                    but whoever it may chance to be of you citizens pays the damages; and you alone
                    of all people are unable to travel anywhere without a herald's staff of truce
                    because of the acts of these men in seizing hostages and in provoking reprisals;
                        <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>so that, if one looks at the matter
                    frankly, he will find that triremes such as these have sailed forth, not for
                    you, but against you. For a man who serves as trierarch in the interest of
                        <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> ought not to expect to
                    grow rich at the public expense, but ought by means of his own resources to
                    repair the losses of the state, if you are to have the service which you need.
                    But each commander goes out determined to pursue the opposite course, and the
                    losses resulting from their own evil ways are repaired by the damages which fall
                    on you. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/>And this is but natural. For you have
                    suffered those who choose to act dishonestly, if they escape discovery, to keep
                    what they have stolen, and, even if they are caught, to win pardon; those
                    therefore who have no regard for their reputation have acquired licence to do as
                    they please. Men in private life who learn only through suffering we call
                    lacking in foresight; what, then, should we call you, who are not on your guard
                    even after repeated suffering? <milestone n="16" unit="section"/><milestone
                        unit="para" ed="P"/>It is right that I should say something about those who
                    have spoken as their advocates. Certain people are so convinced that they have
                    the right to do or say whatever they please before you, that some of those who
                    joined with Aristophon<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">This was the celebrated
                        Aristophon of Azenia, who is stated in <bibl n="Aeschin. 3.194">Aeschin.

                        times on the charge of introducing bills that were illegal.</note> in
                    preferring his charges, and were bitter against those who let out their
                    trierarchies, now bid you to crown these people here; and they prove one or the
                    other of two things against themselves. Either in the former instance they
                    brought forward charges that were baseless, or they have now been bribed to
                    plead the cause of my opponents; <milestone n="17" unit="section"/>and they bid
                    you grant them a favor, as if the argument were about a gift instead of a prize,
                    or as if you, at the instance of men like them, were seeking to win the favor of
                    those who neglect your interests, and as if it were not rather your duty, at the
                    instance of better men, to show favor to those who serve you as they should.
                    Then again, they care so little for a good reputation, and are so thoroughly of
                    the opinion that everything is of secondary importance compared with gain, that
                    they not only have the audacity to contradict in their public speeches what they
                    said before, but even now their statements do not agree; for they assert that
                    the trireme which is to win the crown should have its proper crew on board, yet
                    they bid you crown the trierarchs who have let their service devolve upon
                    others. <milestone n="18" unit="section"/>And they state that no one got his
                    ship in readiness before my opponents did, yet they bid you crown us jointly,
                    which is not what the decree orders. I am as far from granting this as I am from
                    having let out my trierarchy; I would not submit to the one, nor have I done the
                    other. They pretend to be pleading in the interests of justice, but they show
                    more zeal than any one of you would do without reward, as though their duty was
                    to earn their pay, not to give an opinion. <milestone n="19" unit="section"/>And
                    then, as if they were not members of a free state, in which because of this fact
                    anyone who chooses has the right to speak, but as if they possessed this right
                    as a sort of sacred prerogative of their own, if any man speaks in your midst in
                    defence of what is right, they feel themselves grossly wronged, and say that he
                    is an impudent fellow. And they have gone so far in their senseless folly, that
                    they think that, if they call a man impudent who has spoken but once, they will
                    themselves be thought good and worthy men all their lives. <milestone n="20"
                        unit="section"/>Yet it is because of the public speeches of these men that
                    many matters are going from bad to worse, while it is owing to those who
                    honestly oppose them that not everything is lost. Such are the pleaders, then,
                    that my opponents have engaged to speak on their behalf, and so readily open to
                    attack are they themselves for any who wish to speak any ill of them
                    &lpar;as they well know&rpar;; yet they have seen fit to contest this
                    matter, and they have had the audacity to speak ill of another, when they should
                    have been well content to keep out of trouble themselves. <milestone n="21"
                        unit="section"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>For the wrongdoing and
                    insolence of these men nobody is more to blame than yourselves; for you inquire
                    what the character of every man is from the speakers who you know are doing what
                    they do for pay; you do not investigate for yourselves. Yet is it not absurd for
                    you to consider these orators themselves the basest of your citizens, but to
                    regard those whom they praise as worthy men? <milestone n="22" unit="section"
                    />For they are their own masters in all that they do, and they all but sell the
                    public weal by the voice of the common crier; and they order you to crown, or
                    not to crown, whomsoever they will, setting themselves up as superior to your
                    decrees. I advise you, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                    >Athens</placeName>, not to allow the ambitions of those who are ready to lavish
                    their money to be dependent upon the greed of those who serve as pleaders.
                    Otherwise you will teach all to perform the duties imposed by you with the least
                    possible outlay, but to hire the largest number of people possible to utter
                    impudent falsehoods before you in support of their claims.</p>

                    is a man of no account. Matters have turned out like this. Lycon was without
                    children, and has left, as I am informed, no heir in his house. <milestone

                    then, when he learned that my father was in poor health, and had difficulty in

                    the public arbitrator, and challenged my father to refer the case to
                    Lysitheides, a friend of Callippus himself and of Isocrates and Aphareus,<note

                    to take an oath, and that my father refused to swear before Lysitheides; and
                    they imagine that they can convince you that in that case Lysitheides, a friend
                    of Callippus and the one acting as arbitrator in the case, would have refrained
                    from making an immediate award against my father, especially since my father

                    left the money outright in the custody of Callippus, in which case, if he
                    returned safe, he would have recovered it duly and justly from one who was his
                    friend and his proxenos, and, if anything had happened to him, he would have
                    given the money outright as he purposed? Would this, I ask, not have been better
                    than leaving it in the bank? For my part, I think the former course would have
                    been fairer and more highminded. However, he is seen to have done nothing of the
                    kind, so you must regard this as presumptive evidence; no; he gave written and
                    oral instructions that it was to Cephisiades that the money was to be paid.
                        <milestone n="25" unit="section"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I would
                    have you regard the following point also, men of the jury. Callippus was one of
                    your citizens, a man able both to render a service and to do an injury, while
                    Cephisiades was a resident alien and a person without influence; so one cannot
                    suppose that my father would have taken the side of Cephisiades in defiance of
                    justice rather than do what was right for the plaintiff. <milestone n="26"
                        unit="section"/>Ah, but he will say perhaps, that my father got some private
                    profit out of the money, and therefore took sides with Cephisiades rather than
                    with the plaintiff. Then we are to believe, in the first place, that he wronged
                    a man who would be able to do him injury to twice the amount of his gains, and
                    secondly that my father in this instance was a base lover of gain, whereas in
                    regard to special taxes and public services and gifts to the state he was not.
                        <milestone n="27" unit="section"/>And did he, who never wronged a stranger,
                    wrong Callippus? And did the plaintiff, as he alleges, tender an oath to my
                    father as to one who was a worthy man and would tell no falsehood, and yet does
                    he now speak of him as a base fellow, who erases records of deposits? And, if my
                    father refused to take the oath, as the plaintiff claims, or to make payment,
                    how could he have escaped immediate condemnation? Who can believe this, men of
                    the jury? I certainly think no one can. <milestone n="28" unit="section"/>And
                    has Archebiades forsooth sunk to such an extreme of baseness as to testify
                    against Callippus, a fellow-demesman of his own, one in public life, and an
                    official, and to say that I am telling the truth while Callippus is lying, and
                    all this, when he knows that, if Callippus chooses to proceed against him for
                    false testimony, or to do no more than put him on oath, he will be compelled to
                    take whatever oath Callippus may require? <milestone n="29" unit="section"/>And
                    again, can anyone persuade you that Archebiades would perjure himself in order
                    that Cephisiades, a resident alien, might get the money, or Phormion either, a
                    man whom Callippus charges with having expunged some records of deposit? It is
                    not a probable thing, men of the jury. Nor is it right to judge either
                    Archebiades or my father guilty of any act of baseness; you know that my father
                    was too emulous of honor to indulge in any base or shameful practices, and that
                    his relations with Callippus were not such as to lead him through contempt to do
                    him an injury. <milestone n="30" unit="section"/>Callippus indeed does not
                    appear to me to be a man of such slight importance as to be treated with
                    contempt&mdash;a man of such influence that last year, after he had
                    instituted this action against me, and had challenged me to refer the matter to
                    Lysitheides for arbitration &lpar;and I, although scorned by him, yet took
                    wise counsel in this at any rate&mdash;I made the reference in due legal
                    form, and carried the matter before the magistrate&rpar;, Callippus, I say,
                    induced the arbitrator, who had been designated according to the laws, to
                    pronounce his award without taking oath, although I protested that he should
                    give it on oath as the laws ordain, his purpose being that he might be able to
                    say before you, that Lysitheides, a good and worthy man, had already given a
                    decision regarding the matters at issue. <milestone n="31" unit="section"
                    />Lysitheides, men of the jury, so long as my father lived, would probably not
                    have wronged him either with or without an oath, for he had a regard for him;
                    but for me he had no regard, while not upon his oath, although perhaps, if put
                    upon his oath, he would have abstained from wronging me in his own interest.
                    This is why he made the award without taking an oath.<milestone unit="para"

                    to bring a baseless and malicious charge; but I have filed this inventory of
                    property because I have suffered wrong and indignity from these men and
                    therefore thought it my duty to avenge myself upon them. Of this you will find
                    convincing proof, men of the jury, in the amount of the valuation, and in my
                    having filed the information in my own name. For, I take it, if I had wished to
                    bring a malicious suit, I should not have listed slaves worth two minae and a
                    half, the sum at which the claimant himself has fixed their value, and myself
                    have run the risk of losing a thousand drachmae, and forfeiting the right ever
                    again to indict anyone on my own behalf. Nor, again, was I so lacking in
                    resources or in friends as to be unable to find some one to file the

                    outrageous thing ever seen among men, that I should myself suffer the wrong, but
                    that another should lend his name on behalf of me, the one wronged; and that
                    this would then serve as presumptive proof to my adversaries that I am lying
                    whenever I speak to you of our enmity; for they would say that no other man
                    would have filed the information, if I were myself the one wronged. It was for
                    this reason that I filed the information. And now that I have done so, if I can
                    prove that the slaves belong to Arethusius, to whom they are stated in the
                    information to belong, I relinquish to the state the three fourths which under
                    the law are given to the private citizen filing the information; for myself it

                    men of the jury, was a neighbor of mine in the country, and a man of my own age.
                    We had long known each other, but after my father's death, when I went to live
                    in the country, where I still live, we had much more to do with one another,
                    since we were neighbors and men of the same age. As time went on we became very
                    intimate; indeed I came to feel on such intimate terms with him that he never
                    failed to win any favor he asked of me; and he, on his part, was useful to me in
                    looking after my affairs and managing them, and whenever I was abroad on public
                    service as trierarch, or on any private business of my own, I used to leave him
                    in charge of everything on the farm. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>It
                    happened that I was sent as trierarch round the <placeName key="tgn,7017076"

                    him that I had to put to sea, and that I should not be able to come home for
                    fear of delaying the ambassadors; and I charged him to look after the
                    administration of matters at home, as he had done before. <milestone n="6"

                    to me and told me of his misfortunes, stating that, although Nicostratus had
                    sent him letters, he had not gone in quest of him for want of funds for the
                    journey, and he told me also that he heard that his brother was in a dreadful
                    condition. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>When I heard this I was touched with
                    compassion for Nicostratus on account of his ill-fortune, and at once sent his
                    brother Deinon to fetch him, giving him three hundred drachmae for his journey.
                    When Nicostratus got home, he came at once to me, embraced me, thanked me for
                    giving his brother money for his journey, bewailed his own unhappy lot, and,
                    while complaining of his own relatives, begged me to succor him, just as in time
                    past I had been a true friend to him. Then he wept, and told me that he had been
                    ransomed for twenty-six minae, and urged me to contribute something toward the
                    cost of his redemption. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/><milestone unit="para"

                    brother for the expenses of his journey to fetch him, and that I would make a

                    father left me, I took to Theocles, who at that time was carrying on a banking
                    business, some cups and a chaplet of gold, which I happened to have in my house
                    as a part of my ancestral inheritance, and bade him give Nicostratus a thousand
                    drachmae; and that sum I gave him outright as a gift, and I acknowledge that it
                    was a gift. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>A few days afterwards he came up

                    agreement that he should pay it within thirty days or be indebted for double the
                    amount; that, moreover, no one would either buy or take a mortgage on the farm
                    adjoining mine, because his brother Arethusius, who is the owner of the slaves
                    mentioned in the information, would not suffer anyone to buy it or take it on

                    &ldquo;Nicostratus, in time past I was a true friend to you, and now in your

                    whatever part of my property you choose, for you to mortgage for the balance of
                    your debt, and to use the money without interest for a year, and to pay off the
                    strangers. When you have made the collection from your friends, pay off my
                    mortgage, as you yourself propose.&rdquo; <milestone n="13" unit="section"

                    with all speed before the expiration of the days in the course of which he said
                    he must pay the ransom. Accordingly I mortgaged my lodging-house for sixteen

                    be at a loss how to deal with the matter, since I was young and without
                    experience in affairs, and might not exact from him the sum for which the

                    conspired against me with some persons with whom I was at law, and bound himself

                    as well, and broke down the nursery-beds of olive trees set in rows round about,

                    caught him and in a fit of anger put him in bonds or struck him, assuming him to

                    it was not proper for me as a private individual to put public slaves to the

                    I should decide on the meaning of the answers given by the men. I thought that
                    the Eleven, or persons chosen by the senate, should have everything written

                    as they saw fit. When I made this offer, they declared that they would not

                    to your laws. For these men, when the jurors wished to impose a sentence of
                    death upon Arethusius, begged the jurors to impose a fine in money, and begged
                    me to give my assent to this; and they agreed to be jointly responsible for the

                    guaranteeing any sum due to the state, does not make good his guarantee; so
                    that, even if the slaves belonged to them, they ought to be state-property, if
                    the laws are of any use. <milestone n="28" unit="section"/>And before Arethusius
                    became a debtor to the state, he was admitted to be the richest of the brothers,
                    but since the laws declare his property to be yours, Arethusius is made out to
                    be a poor man, and his mother lays claim to one part of his property, and his
                    brothers to another. If they had wished to act fairly toward you, they should
                    have disclosed the entire estate of Arethusius, and then have filed a claim, if

                    embarrassments and a mother's maintenance, and by dwelling tearfully upon these
                    matters by which they think they can most easily deceive you, they will try to

                    and battery, to escape punishment. The laws take a far different view, and have
                    provided that even pleas of necessity shall not be pressed too far. For example
                    &lpar;you see I have had to inquire into these matters and inform myself

                    back and forth, to deal blows to one another. Again, there are actions for
                    battery; and these, I hear, exist for this reason&mdash;that a man, finding
                    himself the weaker party, may not defend himself with a stone or anything of
                    that sort, but may await legal redress. Again, there are public prosecutions for
                    wounding, to the end that wounds may not lead to murder. <milestone n="19"
                        unit="section"/>The least of these evils, namely abusive language, has, I
                    think, been provided for to prevent the last and most grievous, that murder may

                    from blows to wounds, and from wounds to murder, but that in the laws its own
                    penalty should be provided for each of these acts, and that the decision should
                    not be left to the passion or the will of the person concerned. <milestone

                    such indulgence should be reserved, and even in their case it should not extend

                    vilest of all, what punishment could he suffer that would be commensurate with
                    his deeds? For my part, I think that even death would be too mild. Why, if
                    <persName><surname>Conon</surname></persName> had committed none of the

                        <milestone n="23" unit="section"/>For if he has trained up his sons in such
                    fashion that they feel no fear or shame while committing in his presence crimes
                    for some of which the punishment of death is ordained, what punishment do you
                    think too severe for him? I think these actions are a proof that he has no

                    of action, men of the jury, which I assure you by the gods roused resentment and
                    disgust in the mind of every one present; and finally they were disgusted at
                    themselves. <milestone n="27" unit="section"/>Be that as it may, when they had
                    had their fill and were tired of acting thus, they put in a challenge with a
                    view to gaining time and preventing the boxes from being sealed, offering to
                    deliver up certain slaves, whose names they wrote down, to be examined as to the
                    assault. And I fancy that their defence will hinge chiefly upon this point. I
                    think, however, that you should all note one thing&mdash;that if these men
                    tendered the challenge in order that the inquiry by the torture should take
                    place, and had confidence in this method of proof, they would not have tendered
                    it when the award was now just being announced, when night had fallen and no
                    further pretext was left them; no, <milestone n="28" unit="section"/>before the
                    action had been brought, while I was lying ill and not knowing whether I should
                    recover, and was denouncing the defendant to all who came to see me as the one
                    who dealt the first blow and was the perpetrator of most of the maltreatment I
                    received,&mdash;it was then, I say, that he would have come to my house
                    without delay, bringing with him a number of witnesses; it was then that he
                    would have offered to deliver up his slaves for the torture, and would have
                    invited some members of the Areopagus to attend; for if I had died, the case
                    would have come before them. <milestone n="29" unit="section"/>But if he was
                    unaware of this situation, and having this proof, as he will now say, made no
                    preparation against so serious a danger, surely when I had left my sick bed and
                    summoned him, he would at our first meeting before the arbitrator have shown
                    himself ready to deliver up the slaves. But he did nothing of the

                    and that the challenge was tendered merely for the sake of gaining time, read

                    swear truly, may many blessings be mine, and may I never again suffer such an
                    outrage; but, if I am forsworn, may I perish utterly, I and all I possess or
                    ever may possess. But I am not forsworn; no, not though <persName><surname>Conon</surname></persName> should say so till he bursts. <milestone

                    all the just arguments which I have to present, and have furthermore added an
                    oath, it is but right that you should feel toward <persName><surname>Conon</surname></persName> on my behalf the same resentment which each one of you,
                    had he been the victim, would have felt toward the one who did the wrong, and
                    not to regard an act of this sort as a private matter which might fall to the
                    lot of any man. No; whoever may be the victim, bear him aid and give him the
                    redress that is his due, and loathe those who in the face of their crimes are
                    bold and reckless, but when they are brought to trial are impudent villains,
                    caring nothing for reputation or character or anything else, provided only they
                    can escape punishment. <milestone n="43" unit="section"/>Of course <persName><surname>Conon</surname></persName> will entreat you and wail aloud. But
                    consider, which of us is more deserving of pity, a man who has suffered such
                    treatment as I have at the hands of the defendant, if I am to go forth having
                    met with the further disgrace of losing my suit, or <persName><surname>Conon</surname></persName>, if he is to be punished? Is it to the advantage of each
                    one of you that a man be permitted to indulge in battery and outrage, or that he
                    be not permitted? I certainly think he should not be. Well then, if you let him
                    off, there will be many such; if you punish him, fewer. <milestone n="44"

                    all, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, nothing more
                    vexatious than to have a neighbor who is base and covetous; the very thing which
                    has fallen to my lot. For Callicles, having set his heart on my land, has
                    pestered me with malicious and baseless litigation: in the first place he
                    suborned his cousin to claim my property, <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>but
                    the claim was proved manifestly false, and I got the better of that intrigue;
                    then, again, he secured two awards against me for default, one in an action
                    brought in his own name for one thousand drachmae, and another in an action
                    which he persuaded his brother Callicrates, who is here in court, to bring. I
                    beg you all to listen to me, and to give me your attention, not because I am
                    going to show myself an able speaker, but in order that you may learn from the
                    facts themselves, that I am manifestly the victim of a malicious and baseless
                    suit. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>A single
                    plea, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, I bring before
                    you to answer all the arguments of these men, a just one. My father built the
                    wall around this land almost before I was born, while Callippides, the father of
                    these men was still living, and was my father's neighbor &lpar;and of course
                    he knew the facts better than these men do&rpar;, and when, moreover,
                    Callicles was already a grown man, and was living at <placeName
                        key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>; <milestone n="4" unit="section"
                    />and my father lived on more than fifteen years longer, and their father as
                    many. In all these years no one ever came to object or make complaint
                    &lpar;and yet of course it often rained then, just as it does now&rpar;;
                    no one made any opposition at the start, as he would have done, if my father by
                    walling in his land had caused injury to anyone; nor did anyone forbid him, or
                    protest against his action. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>And yet, Callicles,
                    when you saw that the watercourse was being dammed, you people might, I suppose,
                    have gone at once to my father and complained angrily, and said to him,
                    &ldquo;Teisias, what is this that you are doing? Are you damming the
                    watercourse? Why, then the water will burst through on to our land.&rdquo;
                    In that case, if he had seen fit to desist, you and I would be having no quarrel
                    with one another; or, if he paid no heed, and any such mischief resulted, you
                    would have been able to avail yourself of those who were present as witnesses.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>And, by heaven, you ought to have satisfied
                    all men that there was a watercourse, that you might have shown, not by your
                    mere statement, as is the case now, but on a basis of fact, that my father was
                    guilty of wrongdoing. Yet no one of these men ever thought of doing any such
                    thing. For, had you done this, you would not have got an award for default
                    against me, as you now have, nor would you have gained anything by your
                    malicious charges; <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>for if you had at that time
                    brought a witness and appealed to his testimony, he would now have proved from
                    his own knowledge precisely how the several matters stood, and would have
                    refuted these men who are so glib with their testimony. But, I fancy, you have
                    all come to despise one so young as I am, and so inexperienced in affairs. But,
                    men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, I adduce their own
                    acts as the strongest evidence against them all; for how is it that not one of
                    them ever protested, or lodged a complaint, or even uttered a word of censure,
                    but they were content to submit to this injury? <milestone n="8" unit="section"
                        /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Well, I think that what I have said is by
                    itself a sufficient answer to their shameless claims; but that you may be
                    assured, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, on other
                    grounds as well that my father committed no wrong in walling in the land, and
                    that these men have uttered nothing but falsehoods, I shall try to explain to
                    you even more clearly. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>That the land is our
                    private property is admitted by these men themselves, and this being the case,
                    men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, if you could see the
                    place, you would know at once that their suit is groundless. For this reason I
                    wanted to refer the case to impartial persons who know the locality, but these
                    men refused, although they now try to maintain that they wished it. This, too,
                    will be made clear to you all in a moment; but give close heed, men of
                        <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, I beg you in the name of
                    Zeus and the gods! <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>For the space between my
                    property and theirs is a road, and as a hilly country encircles them, unluckily
                    for the farms, the water that flows down runs, as it happens, partly into the
                    road, and partly on to the farms. And in particular, that which pours into the
                    road, whenever it has free course, flows down along the road, but when there is
                    any stoppage, then it of necessity overflows upon the farms. <milestone n="11"
                        unit="section"/>Now this particular piece of land, as it happened, was
                    inundated after a heavy downpour had occurred. As a result of neglect, when my
                    father was not yet in possession of the land, but a man held it who utterly
                    disliked the neighborhood, and preferred to live in the city, the water
                    overflowed two or three times, wrought damage to the land, and was more and more
                    making itself a path. For this reason my father, when he saw it &lpar;so I
                    am informed by those acquainted with the circumstances&rpar;, inasmuch as
                    the neighbors also began to encroach upon the property and walk across it, built
                    around it this enclosing wall. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>To prove that I
                    am speaking the truth in this, I shall bring before you as witnesses those who
                    know the facts, and circumstantial evidence, men of <placeName
                        key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, far stronger than any testimony.
                    Callicles says that I am doing him an injury by having walled off the
                    watercourse; but I shall show that this is private land and no watercourse.
                        <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>If it were not admitted to be our private
                    property, we should perhaps be guilty of this wrongdoing, if we had fenced off a
                    piece of public land; but as it is, they do not dispute this, and on the land
                    there are trees planted, vines and figs. Yet who would think of planting these
                    in a watercourse? Nobody, surely. Again, who would think of burying his own
                    ancestors there? No one, I think, would do this either. <milestone n="14"
                        unit="section"/>Well, both these things have been done. For not only were
                    the trees planted before my father built the wall, but the tombs are old, and
                    were built before we acquired the property. Yet, since this is the case, what
                    stronger argument could there be, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName>? The facts afford manifest proof.<milestone unit="para"

                    full of trees, and that it contains some tombs and other things which are to be
                    found in most private pieces of land? Do they not prove also that the land was
                    walled in during the lifetime of their father without opposition being made by
                    these men or any other of the neighbors? <milestone n="16" unit="section"
                        /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>It is worth your while, men of the jury, to
                    hear some remarks also about the other statements made by Callicles. And first,
                    consider whether any one of you has ever seen or heard of a watercourse existing
                    by the side of a road. I think that in the whole country there is not a single
                    one. For what could induce any man to make a channel through his private lands
                    for water which would otherwise have gone rushing down a public road? <milestone
                        n="17" unit="section"/>And what one of you, whether in the country or the
                    city would allow water passing along the highway to flow into his farm or his
                    house? On the contrary, when it forces its way in, is it not our habit to dam or
                    wall it off? But the plaintiff demands of me that I let the water from the road
                    flow into my land, and, when it has passed beyond his, turn it back again into
                    the road. Well then, the neighbor who farms the land next to his will make
                    complaint; for it is plain that they too will have the same right to protest
                    that the plaintiff has. <milestone n="18" unit="section"/>But surely, if I am
                    afraid to divert the water into the road, I should be a rash man indeed, if I
                    were to turn it into land. For when I am being sued for penalty because the
                    water flowing from the road spread over the plaintiff's land, what treatment in
                    heaven's name must I expect to meet at the hands of those who suffer damage from
                    the water overflowing from my own land? But if, once I have got the water on my
                    property, I am not to be allowed to drain it off either into the road or onto
                    private land, men of the jury, what course in the name of the gods remains for
                    me? I take it, Callicles will not force me to drink it all up! <milestone n="19"
                        unit="section"/>Well then, after suffering these annoyances at their hands
                    and many other grievous ones as well, I must be content, not indeed to win my
                    suit, but to escape paying a further penalty! If, men of the jury, there had
                    been a watercourse below me to receive the water, I should perhaps have been
                    wrong in not letting it in on my land, just as on certain other farms there are
                    recognized watercourses in which the first landowners let the water flow
                    &lpar;as they do the gutter-drains from the houses&rpar;, and others
                    again receive it from them in like manner. But on the land in question no one
                    gives the water over to me or receives it from me. How, then, can it be a
                    watercourse? <milestone n="20" unit="section"/>An overflow of water has ere now,
                    I imagine, often done damage to many who have not guarded against it, just as it
                    has in this case to the plaintiff. But this is the thing that is most outrageous
                    of all, that Callicles, when the water overflows on his land, brings up huge
                    stones and walls it off, but has brought suit for damages against me on the
                    ground that my father was guilty of wrongdoing, because when the same thing
                    happened to his land, he built an enclosing wall. And yet, if all those who have
                    suffered loss because water has flooded their lands in this region are to bring
                    suit against me, my fortune, even if multiplied many times, would not meet the
                    costs. <milestone n="21" unit="section"/>But these men are so different from the
                    others, that, although they have suffered no damage, as I shall presently make
                    clear to you, while many others have suffered damage in many grievous ways, they
                    alone have had the effrontery to sue me. Yet anyone else would have had better
                    reason to do this than they have; for even if they have suffered damage, it has
                    been through their own fault, though they bring a malicious suit against me;
                    whereas the others, not to speak of anything else, are open to no such
                        imputation.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But that I may not speak
                    confusedly of all matters at once, take, please, the depositions of the

                    then, an outrageous thing, men of the jury, that, while these people have made

                    anyone else of those who suffered misfortune, but they have accepted their lot,
                    this man should bring a malicious suit? But that he is himself at fault, first
                    in that he made the road narrower by extending his wall beyond the property
                    line, in order to enclose the trees of the road, and, secondly, in that he threw
                    the rubbish into it, from which actions it resulted that he made the road higher
                    as well as narrower&mdash;of this you will presently gain clearer knowledge

                    malicious action against me, my mother and theirs were intimate friends and used
                    to visit one another, as was natural, since both lived in the country and were
                    neighbors, and since, furthermore, their husbands had been friends while they
                    lived. <milestone n="24" unit="section"/>Well, my mother went to see theirs, and
                    the latter told her with weeping what had happened, and showed her the effects;
                    this, men of the jury, is the way in which I learned all the facts. And I am
                    telling you just what I heard from my mother;&mdash;as I speak the truth, so
                    may many blessings be mine; if I am lying, may the opposite befall me. She
                    averred that she saw, and heard from their mother, that some of the barley got
                    wet &lpar;she saw them drying it&rpar;, but not so much as three
                        medimni,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">The medimnus was a standard measure
                        of grain, containing approximately a bushel and a half.</note> and about
                    half a medimnus of wheat flour; also, she said, a jar of olive oil had tilted
                    over, but had not been damaged. <milestone n="25" unit="section"/>So trivial,
                    men of the jury, was the loss that befell them, yet for this I am made defendant
                    in a suit with damages fixed at a thousand drachmae! If he repaired an old wall,
                    this surely ought not to be charged against me&mdash;a wall moreover which
                    neither fell down nor suffered any damage. So, if I were to concede that I was
                    to blame for everything that occurred, the things that got wet were these.
                        <milestone n="26" unit="section"/>But since in the beginning my father was
                    within his rights in enclosing the land and these people never made any
                    complaint during the lapse of so long a time, and the others who were severely
                    damaged make no complaint any more than they; and since it is the custom of all
                    of you to drain the water from your houses and lands into the road, and not,
                    heaven knows, to let it flow in from the road, what need is there to say more?
                    These facts of themselves make it clear that the suit against me is a baseless
                    and malicious one, since I am guilty of no wrong, and they have not suffered the

                    of these is not going to claim the right to recover damages from his neighbors.
                        <milestone n="29" unit="section"/>And I, who might well be angry at their
                    having made the road narrower and raised its level, keep quiet, while these men
                    have such superabundance of audacity, it seems, that they even bring malicious
                    suits against those whom they have injured! But surely, Callicles, if you have
                    the right to enclose your land, we too had the right to enclose ours. And if my
                    father wronged you by enclosing his, you are now wronging me by thus enclosing
                    yours. <milestone n="30" unit="section"/>For it is evident that, since you have
                    built your obstructing wall with large stones, the water will flow back upon my
                    land, and when it so chances, may with an unlooked-for rush throw down my wall.
                    However, I do not on this account claim damages from these men, but I shall
                    submit to the misfortune, and shall try to protect my own property. For I think
                    the plaintiff is acting wisely in walling in his land, but when he brings suit
                    against me, I hold that he is the basest of men and that some ailment has
                    impaired his wits. <milestone n="31" unit="section"/><milestone unit="para"

                    For in a previous instance also, when he induced his cousin to lay claim to my
                    land, he produced an agreement which had never been made. And now he has
                    obtained an award against me for default in a similar suit, entering in the
                    indictment the name of Callarus, one of my slaves. For in addition to their
                    other pieces of rascality they have devised this scheme as well&mdash;they
                    bring this same suit against Callarus. <milestone n="32" unit="section"/>And yet
                    what slave would wall in his master's land without orders from his master? But
                    having no other charge to bring against Callarus, they lodge suit against him
                    regarding the wall which my father built more than fifteen years before his
                    death. And if I give up my property, either by selling it to these men or by
                    exchanging it for other land, Callarus is guilty of no wrong, but if I do not
                    choose to give it up to them, then they are being wronged by Callarus in all
                    manner of grievous ways, and they look out for an arbitrator who will adjudge
                    the property to them, or for some sort of compromise by which they will get

                    prove of no avail; but if you abominate people of that sort, and vote as justice
                    demands, then, as Callicles has suffered no loss and has in no way been wronged
                    either by Callarus or by my father, I do not see what need there is of my saying

                    arrived, and the prices of grain here were falling, and their ship had reached
                        <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, the defendant straightway
                    sent a man to <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName> to inform his

                        <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>The outcome was that Parmeniscus, the

                    greatly dismayed at his action, and went to this man, who was the prime mover in
                    the whole plot, complaining angrily, as was natural, that although we had
                    expressedly stipulated in the agreement that the ship should sail to no other
                    port than to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, and had lent
                    our money on this condition, he had left us open to suspicion with people who
                    might wish to accuse and say that we also had been partners to the conveyance of
                    the grain to <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName>; and complaining
                    also that he and his partner, despite their agreement to do so, had not brought

                    he at any rate pay us back the amount loaned with the interest as originally
                    agreed upon. But the fellow treated us with such insolence as to declare that he
                    would not pay the interest stipulated in the agreement. &ldquo;If,
                    however,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are willing to accept the interest
                    calculated in proportion to the voyage completed, I will give you,&rdquo;
                    said he, &ldquo;the interest as far as <placeName key="tgn,7011266"
                        >Rhodes</placeName>; but more I will not give.&rdquo; Thus he made a law
                    for himself and refused to comply with the just terms of the agreement.

                    said that we could not acquiesce in anything like this, considering that, were
                    we to do so, it would be an admission that we too had been engaged in conveying
                    grain to <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName>, he became even more
                    insistent, and came up to us, bringing a host of witnesses, asserting that he

                    made this clear. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>For when some of your

                    of our rights under the agreement, but we thought it better to suffer some loss
                    and to make a concession, so as not to appear litigious. But when the fellow saw
                    that we were on the point of accepting his offer, he said, &ldquo;Well,

                        unit="section"/>Such was our answer to him, men of the jury, and we demanded
                    of this fellow Dionysodorus that he should not disturb or annul the agreement
                    which these men themselves admitted to be binding, but that in regard to the

                    then, we tendered to this Dionysodorus again and again, and we exposed the
                    challenge to public view over a period of many days. He, however, declared that
                    we must be absolute simpletons, if we supposed him to be senseless enough to go
                    before an arbitrator&mdash;who would most certainly condemn him to pay the
                    debt&mdash;when he might come into court bringing the money with him, and
                    then, if he could hoodwink you he would go back keeping possession of what was
                    another's, and if he could not, he would then pay the money. Thus he showed that
                    he had no confidence in the justice of his case, but that he wished to make

                    have heard I fancy you have long been amazed at his audacity, and have wondered
                    upon what in the world he relies in coming into court. For is it not the height
                    of audacity, when a man who has borrowed money from the port of <placeName

                    />and has expressly agreed in writing that his ship shall return to your port,
                    or that, if she does not, he shall pay double the amount, has not brought the
                    ship to the Peiraeus and does not pay his debt to the lenders; and as for the
                    grain, has unladed that and sold it at <placeName key="tgn,7011266"
                        >Rhodes</placeName>, and then despite all this dares to look into your
                    faces? <milestone n="21" unit="section"/>But hear what he says in reply to this.
                    He alleges that the ship was disabled on the voyage from <placeName
                        key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, and that for this reason he was obliged
                    to touch at <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName> and unlade the grain
                    there. And as a proof of this he states that he chartered ships from <placeName
                        key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName> and shipped some of his goods to
                        <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>. This is one part of his
                    defence, and here is another. <milestone n="22" unit="section"/>He claims that
                    some other creditors of his have agreed to accept from him interest as far as
                        <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName>, and that it would be hard
                    indeed if we should not make the same concession that they have made. And
                    thirdly, besides all this, he declares that the agreement requires him to pay
                    the money if the ship arrives safely, but that the ship has not arrived safely
                    in the Peiraeus. To each of these arguments, men of the jury, hear the just
                    answer that we make. <milestone n="23" unit="section"/><milestone unit="para"
                        ed="P"/>In the first place, when he says that the ship was disabled, I think
                    it is plain to you all that he is lying. For if his ship had met with this
                    mishap, she would neither have got safely to <placeName key="tgn,7011266"
                        >Rhodes</placeName> nor have been fit for sailing afterwards. But in fact it
                    is plain that she did get safe to <placeName key="tgn,7011266"
                        >Rhodes</placeName> and was sent back from thence to <placeName
                        key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, and that at the present time she is
                    still sailing everywhere except to <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName>. And yet is it not outrageous that, when he has to bring
                    his ship back to the port of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>,
                    he says she was disabled, but when he wants to unlade his grain at <placeName
                        key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName>, then that same ship is seen to be
                    seaworthy? <milestone n="24" unit="section"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Why,
                    then, he says, did I charter other ships and tranship my cargo and despatch it
                    here to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>? Because, men of
                        <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, neither the defendant
                    nor his partner was owner of the entire cargo, but, I fancy, the supercargoes
                    who were on board despatched their own goods hither, in other bottoms
                    necessarily, seeing that these men had cut short the voyage before the ship
                    reached her destination. As for the goods, however, which were their own, they
                    did not ship these in their entirety to <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName>, but sought out what ones had advanced in price.
                        <milestone n="25" unit="section"/>For why, pray, was it that, when you had
                    hired other bottoms, as you say, you did not tranship the entire cargo of your
                    vessel, but left the grain there in <placeName key="tgn,7011266"
                        >Rhodes</placeName>? Because, men of the jury, it was to their interest to
                    sell the grain in <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName>; for they
                    heard that the price had fallen here in <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName>, but they shipped to you the other goods, from which
                    they hoped to make a profit. When, then, Dionysodorus, you talk about the
                    chartering of the vessels, you give proof, not that your ship was disabled, but
                    that it was to your advantage to do so. <milestone n="26" unit="section"

                        >Rhodes</placeName>, this has nothing to do with us. If any man has remitted
                    to you any part of what was due him, no wrong is suffered by either party to the
                    arrangement. But we have not remitted anything to you, nor have we consented to
                    your voyage to <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName>, nor in our
                    judgement is anything more binding than the agreement. <milestone n="27"
                        unit="section"/>Now what does the agreement say, and to what port does it
                    require you to sail? From Athens to <placeName key="tgn,7016833"

                    doing, it requires you to pay double the amount. If you have done this, you have
                    committed no wrong; but if you have not done it, and have not brought your ship
                    back to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, it is proper that
                    you should suffer the penalty provided by the agreement; for this requirement
                    was imposed upon you, not by some other person, but by yourself. Show, then, to
                    the jury one or the other of two things&mdash;that our agreement is not
                    valid, or that you are not required to do everything in accordance with it.

                    not think so. For this jury is not now deciding upon concessions made to you by
                    others, but upon an agreement entered into by you yourself with us. For that the
                    remission of the interest, supposing that it actually took place, as these men

                    interpret this matter for you, and the defendant insists upon this very thing,
                    stating that the agreement requires him to repay the loan only if the ship

                    whether you are speaking of the ship as having been lost, or as having arrived
                    safe. For if the ship has been wrecked and is lost, why do you keep on disputing
                    about the interest and demanding that we accept interest as far as <placeName

                    to recover either interest or principal. But if the ship is safe and has not
                    been wrecked, why do you not pay us the money which you agreed to pay?

                    fact that she is now at sea, and less clearly by the statements made by these
                    men themselves. For they ask us to accept payment of the principal and a certain
                    portion of the interest, thus implying that the ship has reached port safe, but
                    has not completed her entire voyage. <milestone n="34" unit="section"/>Now

                    been lost, claim to be entitled to an abatement of the interest, although they
                    have broken the agreement, and have themselves made a large profit by the
                    carrying of grain to <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName>, and by

                    reached port safe, but they claim the right to rob us of our interest on the
                    ground that she has been wrecked. The agreement, however, does not say one thing
                    about the interest and another about the principal of the loan, but our rights

                    words. That the ship has reached port safe, and is safe, is admitted by these
                    men themselves; for otherwise they would not be offering to pay the principal of
                    the loan and a portion of the interest. She has not, however, been brought back
                    to the Peiraeus. It is for this reason that we, the creditors, claim that we
                    have been wronged, and regarding this we are bringing suit, that, namely she did
                    not make the return voyage to the port agreed upon. <milestone n="38"

                    does the agreement say? By Zeus it is not at all what you say, Dionysodorus. No;
                    it declares that if you do not pay both the principal and interest, or if you

                    so bold or rather so impudent, that, while under the agreement you owe us double

                    but bid us accept interest as far as <placeName key="tgn,7011266"
                        >Rhodes</placeName>, as if your command ought to prove of more force than
                    the agreement; and you have the insolence to declare that the vessel did not
                    arrive safe at the Peiraeus; for which you might with justice be condemned to
                    death by the jurors. <milestone n="42" unit="section"/>For who other than this
                    fellow is to blame, men of the jury, if the ship did not arrive safe at the

                        <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> and to <placeName

                    and his partner, who after borrowing money on these terms, that the vessel
                    should return to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, then took
                    her to <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName>? And that they did this

                    and the ship was really disabled, afterwards, when they had repaired the ship,
                    they would surely not have let her for a voyage to other ports, but would have
                    despatched her to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> to make
                    amends for the involuntary accident. As it is, however, they have not only made
                    no amends, but to their original wrongdoings they have added others greater far,
                    and have come here to contest the suit as it were in a spirit of mockery,
                    assuming that it will rest with them, if you give judgement against them, merely
                    to pay the principal and interest. <milestone n="44" unit="section"/>Do not you,

                    the hope that, if they are successful, they will retain what belongs to others,
                    and if they are not able to hoodwink you, they will merely pay the bare amount
                    which they owe; but inflict upon them the penalties provided in the agreement.
                    For it would be an outrageous thing, when these men have themselves in writing
                    imposed upon themselves a penalty of double the amount, if they commit any
                    breach of the agreement, that you should be more lenient toward them; especially

                    either principal or interest, but they have kept our money and had the use of it
                    for two years; they have not even to this day brought the ship back to your
                    port, nor produced it plain to see. The agreement, however, declares, that if
                    they fail to deliver up the ship plain to see they shall pay double the amount,
                    and that the money may be recovered from either one or both of them. <milestone

                    in their ship into that port; as it is, however, since we have come before
                    Athenians and our contract called for a voyage to your port, we hold it right
                    that you should give no advantage to men who have wronged you as well as

                    standing here and watching you to see how you decide this question. For if you
                    hold that contracts and agreements made between man and man are to be binding,
                    and show no leniency towards those who transgress them, lenders will be more
                    ready to risk their money, and the business of your port will be increased.

                    Dionysodorus has availed himself, and to reduce the interest in proportion to
                    the length of the voyage which they say they have made instead of paying it
                    according to the agreement, there will be nothing to prevent the voiding of all

                    have accurate knowledge and to bring forward no hearsay evidence in a trial of
                    this sort. Such a procedure has from time immemorial been recognized as so
                    clearly unjust that the laws do not admit the production of hearsay testimony
                    even in the case of the most trifling charges; and with good reason; for when
                    persons who claim to have sure knowledge have ere now been convicted of
                    falsehood, how can it be right to give credence in matters regarding which even

                    to give credence to one who speaks without responsibility? Since,then, this
                    fellow, who knows the laws, and knows them all too well, has made his charges
                    with injustice and with a view to selfish advantage, I must first tell you of

                    take place as late in the day as possible; and he accomplished this end. Those
                    of us members of the deme who took the oath numbered seventy-three, and we began

                    produced no witnesses in support of his charges, either a member of the deme or
                    one of the citizens at large, but urged the demesmen to pass a vote of

                    until the following day on account of the lateness of the hour and because I had
                    no one present to speak in my behalf, and because the thing had come upon me so
                    suddenly, and also that Eubulides might have the opportunity of making any
                    charges that he pleased, and of producing any witnesses he might have, while I
                    on my part might be able to defend myself before all my fellow-demesmen and to
                    produce my relatives as witnesses; and I agreed to abide by whatever decision

                    they received from him two or three ballots apiece, and put them in the box.
                    Here is a proof of this. Those who voted were not more than thirty in number,

                    But consider. It seems to me certainly that our carrying on a trade in the

                    only. If she was an alien, they ought to have examined the market-tolls, and
                    have shown whether she paid the alien's tax, and from what country she came; and
                    if she were a slave, then the one who had bought her should by all means have

                    them, someone else to prove that she had lived as a slave or had been set free.
                    But as it is, Eubulides has proved not one of these things; he has merely, in my
                    opinion, indulged in every form of abuse. For this is what a blackmailer is; he

                    requires them to bear witness, not to what I say today, but to what they have

                    with our fortune or our money, but with our descent. Many are the servile acts
                    which free men are compelled by poverty to perform, and for these they should be

                    draw lots with himself as a nominee for the priesthood; for he too was one of
                    the nominees who drew lots. Nor, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName>, seeing that he is an old enemy of mine, would he have
                    waited for the present opportunity, which no one could foresee, if he had known

                    act as a member of the deme and to draw lots for offices together with me
                    without seeing any of these objections, yet, when the whole city was roused to
                    sharp indignation against those who had recklessly forced their way into the
                    demes, then, and not till then, he laid his plots. The earlier time would have
                    suited one who was convinced of the truth of his charges; but the present suits
                    an enemy and one who will stoop to malicious pettifoggery. <milestone n="50"
                        unit="section"/>For my own part, men of the jury &lpar;and I beg you by

                    one of you holds himself to be one, having from the first regarded as my mother
                    her whom I represent as such to you, and not pretending to be hers while really
                    belonging to another; and in regard to my father the case is the same.
                        <milestone n="51" unit="section"/>Yet, if in the case of those who are
                    proved to have hidden their real parentage and laid claim to a false one, you
                    rightly hold this to be a proof that they are aliens, surely in my case the
                    opposite should prove that I am a citizen. For in claiming the rights of
                    citizenship I should never have inscribed myself as the son of parents who were
                    both foreigners, but, if I had known any such thing, I should have sought out
                    persons to claim as my parents. But I knew nothing of the sort, and so, holding
                    fast to those who are my real parents, I claim Athenian citizenship. <milestone

                    orphan; and yet they say that I am rich and that some of the witnesses testify
                    that they are my relatives because they receive help from me. They taunt me with
                    my poverty and make my birth a reproach, but at the same time they assert that I
                    am rich enough to buy anything. <milestone n="53" unit="section"/>In which
                    statement, then, is one to believe them? It surely would have been their right,
                    if I had been illegitimate or an alien, to inherit all my property. Do they
                    prefer, then, to take a little and jeopardize themselves by giving false
                    testimony and to commit perjury, rather than to take everything, and that with
                    safety, without having invoked a curse upon their own heads? This is not the
                    case. No; in my opinion, seeing that they are my relatives, they are but doing
                    what is right in aiding one of themselves. <milestone n="54" unit="section"/>And
                    they are not doing this at this time because I have induced them to do so; on

                    me to the temple of Apollo our ancestral god, and to the other sacred places.
                    And yet I presume that as a child I did not induce these men to do this by
                    giving them money. No; my father himself, while he still lived, swore the
                    customary oath and introduced me to the clansmen, knowing that I was an
                    Athenian, born of an Athenian mother, lawfully betrothed to himself; and these

                    than those of the Halimusians who have expelled me, but more valid even than
                    those of the senate and the popular assembly; and justly so; for in all respects
                    the verdicts of your courts are most just. <milestone n="57" unit="section"
                        /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Reflect upon this also, all you who belong
                    to the large demes, that you are not wont to deprive any man of his right of

                    who have dealt fairly with this matter, because you did not deprive of the
                    opportunity to prepare their case those who asked for a delay. By taking this
                    course you exposed the pettifoggers and those who were maliciously scheming

                    In no other of the demes will you find that more outrageous things have been
                    done than in ours. Of brothers born of the same mother and the same father they
                    have expelled some and retained others, and they have expelled elderly men of
                    slender means, while they have left their sons on the list of demesmen; and to
                    prove these things I will call witnesses, if you wish. <milestone n="59"
                        unit="section"/>But you must hear the most outrageous thing which these
                    conspirators have done &lpar;and I beg you in the name of Zeus and the gods,
                    let no one of you be offended if I show the rascality of these men who have
                    wronged me. For I hold that in showing what scoundrels they are I am speaking
                    with precise reference to the experience which has befallen me&rpar;. For,
                    you must know, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, that
                    when certain aliens, Anaximenes and Nicostratus, wished to become citizens,
                    these scoundrels admitted them for a sum of money, which they divided among
                    themselves, receiving five drachmae apiece. Eubulides and his clique will not
                    deny on oath that they have knowledge of this; and now in this last revision
                    they did not expel these men. Do you think, then, that there is anything that
                    they would not do in private, seeing that in a public matter they dared this?
                        <milestone n="60" unit="section"/>There are many people indeed, men of the
                    jury, whom Eubulides and his clique have destroyed or have saved for money. For
                    even at an earlier time &lpar;and my words shall bear upon the matter in
                    hand, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>&rpar;
                    Antiphilus, the father of Eubulides, when he was prefect of the deme, as I have
                    told you, made use of trickery in his desire to get money from certain persons,
                    and asserted that he had lost the public register; and he thereby induced the
                    Halimusians to revise their list of members, denounced ten of their number, and
                    had them expelled; all of whom with one exception the court of justice restored.
                    These facts all the older ones know. <milestone n="61" unit="section"/>It is
                    unlikely indeed that they left on the list any who were not Athenians, when they
                    conspired to expel even men who were citizens, whom the court restored. And
                    although he was a personal enemy of my father at the time, Eubulides not only
                    did not denounce him, but did not even cast his vote that he was not an
                    Athenian. How is this proved? Because my father was declared by all the votes to
                    be a member of the deme. But what need is there to speak of our fathers?
                    Eubulides himself, when I was entered on the register and all the demesmen after
                    taking the oath cast their votes regarding me as the law prescribes, neither
                    denounced me nor cast his vote against me; for in this case again they all voted
                    that I was a member of the deme. And, if they say that I am lying about this,
                    let anyone who wishes give evidence to the contrary in the time allotted to me.
                        <milestone n="62" unit="section"/>If, then, men of <placeName
                        key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, my opponents seem to have a very
                    strong argument in the fact that in the present instance the demesmen have
                    rejected me, I point out to you that on four previous occasions, when they gave
                    their votes in accordance with their oaths without entering into a conspiracy,
                    they voted that both I and my father were their fellow-demesmen&mdash;first,
                    when my father passed the scrutiny; secondly, when I did so; then, in the former
                    revision, after these men had made away with the register; and, finally, when
                    they nominated me among the noblest-born and voted that I should draw lots for
                    the priesthood of Heracles. All these facts have been established by testimony.

                    right for me to speak of my administration as prefect, because of which I
                    incurred the anger of many, and in the course of which I became involved in
                    quarrels because I required some of the demesmen to pay the rents which they
                    owed for sacred lands and to refund other sums which they had embezzled from the
                    public moneys, I should be very glad to have you listen to me; but perhaps you
                    will hold that these matters are foreign to the subject before us. However, I am
                    able to point to this as a positive proof of their conspiracy. For they struck
                    out of the oath the clause that they would vote according to their unbiassed
                    judgement and without favor or malice. <milestone n="64" unit="section"/>This
                    became a matter of general knowledge, as did also the fact that the demesmen
                    from whom I had exacted repayment of the public moneys swore a conspiracy
                    against me, and by a sacrilegious theft stole from the temple the shields which
                    I had dedicated to Athena &lpar;for the truth shall be told&rpar;, and
                    chiseled out the decree which the demesmen had passed in my honor. And they have
                    come to such a pitch of shamelessness that they went about saying that I had
                    done this for the sake of my defence.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">That is,

                    they would hardly say that I myself contrived. For hardly had my misfortune come

                    these people went by night to my cottage in the country and attempted to carry
                    off what was there; so utter was their contempt for you and for your laws. If

                        services rendered to the state by his father. Charidemus had, however, been
                        adopted by Aeschylus, and, if he accepted the honor, would have had to
                        return to his father's family, and in that case he would forfeit all claim
                        to the estate of his adoptive father, which was a large one; though the

                    was false, for no such thing, men of the jury, has ever happened to any adopted

                        approving this act. This decree was indicted as illegal, first by Charinus
                        and then by Theocrines. The result was that the Aenians revolted and went
                        over to the side of Philip.</note>; and learning furthermore that no

                    fellow had taken upon himself to carry on the same practices as the traitor
                    Charinus&mdash;learning all this, I say, they took the course which
                    necessity forced upon them, and chose the least of the evils before them. Yet
                    what must we assume their sufferings at the hands of those who were preferring
                    indictments here to have been, when it seemed to the Aenians preferable to
                    revolt from us, to receive a garrison, and to be subject to barbarians? But you
                    alone, I think, are able to endure the wickedness of these men, you alone, and

                    acquit Theocrines in defiance of all the laws concerning criminal informations,
                    is reasonably clear from what has been said. I think, however, men of the jury,
                    that you are not aware of the excuses of these men, of their accusations, and
                    their pretended enmities. <milestone n="40" unit="section"/>For you have not

                    they are personal foes to one another, but in private following the same
                    pursuits and sharing the profits; at one time reviling and abusing one another
                    in foulest terms, and a little later associating in family festivals with these
                    same people, and taking part in the same sacrifices. And not one of these things
                    is perhaps to be wondered at. For the men are by nature base, and they see that
                    you accept such excuses; so what is to prevent their using them and trying to
                    deceive you? <milestone n="41" unit="section"/>For my part I hold that it is
                    absolutely your duty, men of the jury, to fix your attention on the matter at
                    issue and on nothing else, and then, if my plea seems to you just and in
                    accordance with law, to give me your support, caring nothing for the fact that
                    it is not Demosthenes who prefers the charges, but a mere stripling. You are
                    bound also to hold that the laws are not more binding when one presents them to
                    you carefully in rhetorical language than when they are recited in the speech of
                    every day. No; they are the same laws; and you should all the more readily give
                    aid to the young and inexperienced, since they are less likely to lead you
                    astray. <milestone n="42" unit="section"/>For that the case is the exact
                    opposite of what my opponent asserts,&mdash;that it is not he, but I, who am

                    would aid me in my suit, I have been betrayed because of the cliques formed by
                    these men,&mdash;all this will be made clear to you in the following way.
                    Let the crier here call Demosthenes. He will not come forward. The reason is,
                    not that I have been induced by certain persons to lodge criminal information
                    against this man, but that he and the one just now mentioned have come to terms
                    with one another. To prove that this is true, I will compel to testify both
                    Cleinomachus, who brought them together, and Eubulides, who was with them in
                        Cynosarges<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">A gymnasium in <placeName

                    produce what you will all acknowledge when you have heard it, to be, not a
                    weaker, but a stronger proof that my statement is true. For Theocrines here,
                    when prosecuting for illegal action this abominable person, as he will presently
                    call him, and the one who is the cause of his present troubles, openly
                    discharged him from the indictment, in which he had fixed the penalty at ten
                    talents. How? By doing nothing startling, but the very thing that others of his
                    stamp have done. When the indictment was called, someone filed an affidavit for
                    postponement, declaring that Demosthenes was ill&mdash;Demosthenes, who was
                    going about and abusing Aeschines. This enemy of his, then, this fellow has let
                    off, and he neither at the time filed a counter-affidavit, nor did he
                    subsequently call the case for trial. Are not these men manifestly hoodwinking
                    you, when you entertain the idea that they are personal foes?<milestone

                    duty to come to my father's aid, and I thought that this course was just; so I
                    lodged this criminal information, as I told you at the outset, <milestone n="58"

                    enemy of my father. However, I knew that, while the effect on my hearers would
                    be as fortune might determine, I was none the less in duty bound to carry out
                    the command laid upon me by my father, especially as it was a just one.
                        <milestone n="59" unit="section"/>For when, pray, should I come to his aid?
                    Should it not be now, when the opportunity of avenging him in accordance with
                    the laws is open to me, when I myself share in my father's misfortune, and he
                    has been left desolate? This is precisely what has now come about. For, in
                    addition to our other misfortunes, men of the jury, this too has befallen us:
                    everybody urges us on, expresses sympathy for what has happened, says that we
                    have been outrageously treated, and that the defendant is liable to the criminal
                    information; yet no one of those who say these things is willing to cooperate
                    with us or declares his readiness openly to incur the enmity of Theocrines. So
                    true is it that with some people the love of right is not strong enough to lead
                    them to speak out frankly. <milestone n="60" unit="section"/>And, men of the
                    jury, while many misfortunes have befallen us in a short period of time because
                    of this fellow Theocrines, no one of them is more grievous than the present one,
                    that, namely, my father, to whom the wrong was done and who could set forth to
                    you the cruel and illegal acts of Theocrines, must keep silent &lpar;for the

                    with the laws, he will obtain complete justice. The honorable course for you,
                    men of the jury, is, not to put the laws or your own selves in the power of
                    those who speak, but to keep the speakers in your power, and to make a
                    distinction between those who speak well and lucidly, and those who speak what
                    is just; for it is concerning justice that you have sworn to cast your votes.
                        <milestone n="62" unit="section"/>For no man surely will persuade you that
                    there will be any lack of politicians like the defendant, or that the state will
                    be less well administered because of that. Indeed the opposite is the case, as I
                    hear from men older than myself. For they tell us that the state fared best when
                    men of moderation and restraint were in public life. Would one find Theocrines
                    and his fellows to be good counsellors? No; they say not a word in the assembly,
                    but get money by indicting those who do speak there. <milestone n="63"
                        unit="section"/>And this is an extraordinary thing: they make their living
                    by pettifoggery, yet they say they get nothing from the state, and, while they
                    possessed nothing before coming to you, now that they are well-to-do they do not
                    even feel grateful to you, but go about saying that the people are fickle and
                    surly and thankless, as if you prospered because of these men, and not they
                    because of the people! But after all it is natural for them to say this, when
                    they see how easy-going you are. For you have never punished any one of them in
                    the way his wickedness deserves, but you put up with their saying that the
                    safety of the democracy comes from those who bring indictments and baseless
                    actions; than whom no more pernicious class exists. <milestone n="64"
                        unit="section"/>For in what could anyone find these people useful to the
                    state? They punish wrongdoers, it will be said, and through them the number of
                    wrongdoers is lessened. Not so, men of the jury; it is even increased; for those
                    who are minded to do evil, knowing that a portion of their gains must be given
                    to these men, of necessity determine to exact more from the rest, that they may

                    whether the funds remaining over from the state's expenditure should be used for

                    there was war, the funds remaining over from state expenditures should be
                    devoted to military purposes, and Apollodorus believed that the people ought to
                    have power to do what they pleased with their own; and he had sworn that, as
                    member of the senate, he would act for the best interests of the Athenian
                    people, as you all bore witness at that crisis. <milestone n="5" unit="section"

                    anywhere spoken of, it is acknowledged by all that Apollodorus gave the best
                    advice, and was unjustly treated. It is, therefore, upon the one who by his
                    arguments deceived the jurors that your wrath should fall, not upon those who

                    Apollodorus had been a debtor to the treasury for twenty-five years, and by
                    making all sorts of accusations that were foreign to the indictment won a

                    to make concessions, he would not listen to us, but fixed the fine at fifteen
                    talents in order to deprive Apollodorus and his children of their civic rights,

                    scheduled as belonging to the state, and upon its being sold Apollodorus himself
                    and his children and his wife and all of us would have been reduced to extremest

                    without resources? Of such magnitude, you see, were the calamities which
                    Stephanus was bringing upon us all without ever having been wronged by us in any
                    respect. To the jurors, therefore, who at that time decided the matter I am
                    deeply grateful for this at least, that they did not suffer Apollodorus to be
                    utterly ruined, but fixed the amount of the fine at one talent, so that he was
                    able to discharge the debt, although with difficulty. With good reason, then,
                    have we undertaken to pay Stephanus back in the same coin. <milestone n="9"

                    I should have been involved. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>People came to me
                    privately from all sides exhorting me to exact punishment from my opponent for
                    the wrongs he had done us. They flung in my teeth the charge that I was the most
                    cowardly of humankind, if, being so closely related to them, I did not take
                    vengeance for the injuries done my sister, my father-in-law, my sister's
                    children, and my own wife, and if I did not bring before you this woman who is
                    guilty of such flagrant impiety toward the gods, of such outrage toward the
                    commonwealth, and of such contempt for your laws, and by prosecuting her and by

                    might see fit. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>And as Stephanus here sought to
                    deprive me of my relatives contrary to your laws and your decrees, so I too have

                    to the law; that he has introduced children not his own to his fellow-clansmen
                    and demesmen; that he has given in marriage the daughters of courtesans as
                    though they were his own; that he is guilty of impiety toward the gods; and that
                    he nullifies the right of your people to bestow its own favors, if it chooses to
                    admit anyone to citizenship; for who will any longer seek to win this reward
                    from you and to undergo heavy expense and much trouble in order to become a
                    citizen, when he can get what he wants from Stephanus at less expense, assuming

                    is living with this man Stephanus as his wife, and that she has violated the
                    laws of the state in many ways. I make of you, therefore, men of the jury, a
                    request which seems to me a proper one for a young man and one without

                    Stephanus so that no one can object to his seeking vengeance upon the one who
                    injured him without provocation. It is your duty, in the light of truth itself,
                    when you have heard the exact nature both of the accusation and the defense,

                    Phrastor had sent away the daughter of Neaera, he fell sick. He got into a
                    dreadful condition and became utterly helpless. There was an old quarrel between
                    him and his own relatives, toward whom he cherished anger and hatred; and
                    besides he was childless. Being cajoled, therefore, in his illness by the

                    upon a man who is ill&mdash;well, he was induced to take back and adopt as
                    his son the child whom the daughter of this woman Neaera had borne after she was
                    sent away from his house in a state of pregnancy, after he had learned that she
                    was the daughter, not of Stephanus, but of Neaera, and was angered at their
                    deceit. <milestone n="57" unit="section"/>His reasoning in the matter was both
                    natural and to be expected. He was in a precarious condition and there was not
                    much hope that he would recover. He did not wish his relatives to get his
                    property nor himself to die childless, so he adopted this boy and received him
                    back into his house. That he would never have done this, if he had been in good
                    health, I will show you by a strong and convincing proof. <milestone n="58"
                        unit="section"/>For no sooner had Phrastor got up from that sickness and
                    recovered his health and was fairly well, than he took to wife according to the
                    laws an Athenian woman, the legitimate daughter of Satyrus, of Melit&ecirc;,
                    and the sister of Diphilus. Let this, therefore, be a proof to you that he took
                    back the child, not willingly, but forced by his sickness, by his childless
                    condition, by the care shown by these women in nursing him, and by the enmity
                    which he felt toward his own relatives, and his wish that they should not
                    inherit his property, if anything should happen to him. This will be proved to

                    and knowing, too, of his sending the woman away, and that it was because of his

                    Stephanus, in order that from this again you may be convinced that this Neaera
                    is not an Athenian woman. Epaenetus, of Andros,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes"
                        >The large island off the south-eastern end of Euboea.</note> an old lover
                    of Neaera, who had spent large sums of money upon her, used to lodge with these
                    people whenever he came to Athens on account of his affection for Neaera.
                    Against him this man Stephanus laid a plot. <milestone n="65" unit="section"/>He
                    sent for him to come to the country under pretence of a sacrifice and then,
                    having surprised him in adultery with the daughter of this Neaera, intimidated
                    him and extorted from him thirty minae. As sureties for this sum he accepted
                    Aristomachus, who had served as Thesmothete, and Nausiphilus, the son of
                    Nausinicus, who had served as archon,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Nausinicus

                        <milestone n="66" unit="section"/>Epaenetus, however, when he got out and
                    was again his own master preferred before the Thesmothetae an indictment for
                    unlawful imprisonment against this Stephanus in accordance with the law which
                    enacts that, if a man unlawfully imprisons another on a charge of adultery, the
                    person in question may indict him before the Thesmothetae on a charge of illegal
                    imprisonment; and if he shall convict the one who imprisoned him and prove that
                    he was the victim of an unlawful plot, he shall be let off scot-free, and his
                    sureties shall be released from their engagement; but if it shall appear that he
                    was an adulterer, the law bids his sureties give him over to the one who caught
                    him in the act, and he in the court-room may inflict upon him, as upon one
                    guilty of adultery, whatever treatment he pleases, provided he use no knife.
                        <milestone n="67" unit="section"/>It was in accordance with this law that
                    Epaenetus indicted Stephanus. He admitted having intercourse with the woman, but
                    denied that he was an adulterer; for, he said, she was not the daughter of
                    Stephanus, but of Neaera, and the mother knew that the girl was having
                    intercourse with him, and he had spent large sums of money upon them, and
                    whenever he came to Athens he supported the entire household. In addition to
                    this he brought forward the law which does not permit one to be taken as an
                    adulterer who has to do with women who sit professionally in a brothel or who
                    openly offer themselves for hire; for this, he said, is what the house of
                    Stephanus is, a house of prostitution; this is their trade, and they get their
                    living chiefly by this means. <milestone n="68" unit="section"/>When Epaenetus
                    had made these statements and had preferred the indictment, this Stephanus,
                    knowing that he would be convicted of keeping a brothel and extorting blackmail,
                    submitted his dispute with Epaenetus for arbitration to the very men who were
                    the latter's sureties on the terms that they should be released from their
                    engagement and that Epaenetus should withdraw the indictment. <milestone n="69"
                        unit="section"/>Epaenetus acceded to these terms and withdrew the indictment
                    which he had preferred against Stephanus, and a meeting took place between them
                    at which the sureties sat as arbitrators. Stephanus could say nothing in defense
                    of his action, but he requested Epaenetus to make a contribution toward a dowry
                    for Neaera's daughter, making mention of his own poverty and the misfortune
                    which the girl had formerly met with in her relations with Phrastor, and
                    asserting that he had lost her marriage portion and could not provide another

                    compassion, such as anyone might use in entreaty to get out of a nasty mess. The
                    arbitrators, after hearing both parties, brought about a reconciliation between
                    them, and induced Epaenetus to contribute one thousand drachmae toward the

                    matters, and read it; for I would have you know that a woman of her character,
                    who has done what she has done, ought not only to have kept aloof from these
                    sacred rites, to have abstained from beholding them, from offering sacrifices,
                    and from performing on the city's behalf any of the ancestral rites which usage
                    demands, but that she should have been excluded also from all other religious
                    ceremonials in Athens. For a woman who has been taken in adultery is not
                    permitted to attend any of the public sacrifices, although the laws have given
                    both to the alien woman and the slave the right to attend these, whether to view
                    the spectacle or to offer prayer. <milestone n="86" unit="section"/>No; it is to
                    these women alone that the law denies entrance to our public sacrifices, to
                    these, I mean, who have been taken in adultery; and if they do attend them and
                    defy the law, any person whatsoever may at will inflict upon them any sort of
                    punishment, save only death, and that with impunity; and the law has given the
                    right of punishing these women to any person who happens to meet with them. It
                    is for this reason that the law has declared that such a woman may suffer any
                    outrage short of death without the right of seeking redress before any tribunal
                    whatsoever, that our sanctuaries may be kept free from all pollution and
                    profanation, and that our women may be inspired with a fear sufficient to make
                    them live soberly, and avoid all vice, and, as their duty is, to keep to their
                    household tasks. For it teaches them that, if a woman is guilty of any such sin,
                    she will be an outcast from her husband's home and from the sanctuaries of the

                    Athenian citizenship upon any man who does not deserve it because of
                    distinguished services to the Athenian people. In the next place, when the civic
                    body has been thus convinced and bestows the gift, it does not permit the
                    adoption to become valid, unless in the next ensuing assembly more than six
                    thousand Athenians confirm it by a secret ballot. <milestone n="90"

                    about to be so adopted is worthy of the gift. Furthermore, after this the law
                    permits to any Athenian who wishes to prefer it an indictment for illegality
                    against the candidate, and he may come into court and prove that the person in
                    question is not worthy of the gift, but has been made a citizen contrary to the

                    into court, the result was that the person who had received the gift was proved
                    to be unworthy of it, and the court took it back. To review the many cases in
                    ancient times would be a long task; I will mention only those which you all
                    remember: Peitholas the Thessalian, and Apollonides the Olynthian, after having
                    been made citizens by the people, were deprived of the gift by the court.

                    may be offered in conformity with religious usage. For in the case of all those
                    whom the Athenian people may make citizens, the law expressly forbids that they
                    should be eligible to the office of the nine archons or to hold any priesthood;
                    but their descendants are allowed by the people to share in all civic rights,

                    sent word to all the rest of the Boeotians and the Locrians and Phocians and

                    a large force, and made overtures to the Plataeans on terms that, if they would
                    surrender their city to the Lacedaemonians, they should retain their land and
                    enjoy their property, but that they should break off their alliance with the
                    Athenians. The Plataeans refused this offer and made answer that they would do
                    nothing without the Athenians, whereupon the Lacedaemonians besieged them for
                    two years, built a double wall about their city, and made repeated assaults of

                    were quite worn out and were in want of everything, and despaired of safety,
                    they divided themselves by lot into two groups; some of them remained and
                    endured the siege, but the others, waiting for a night when there was rain and a
                    heavy wind, climbed over the wall of circumvallation, unseen of the enemy, cut
                    down the sentinels, and got safely to Athens, but in a desperate plight and
                    beyond all expectation. As for those who remained behind, when the city was
                    taken by storm, all who had reached manhood were killed and the women and
                    children were made slaves&mdash;all, that is, save those who, when they saw

                    children were borne to him, not by Neaera, but by another woman who was an
                    Athenian, I offered to withdraw from the case and to prevent this indictment
                    from coming into court. <milestone n="122" unit="section"/>For this is what
                    living with a woman as one's wife means&mdash;to have children by her and to
                    introduce the sons to the members of the clan and of the deme, and to betroth
                    the daughters to husbands as one's own. Mistresses we keep for the sake of
                    pleasure, concubines for the daily care of our persons, but wives to bear us
                    legitimate children and to be faithful guardians of our households. If,
                    therefore, Stephanus had previously married an Athenian woman, and these
                    children are hers and not Neaera's, he could have shown it by the most certain
                    evidence, by delivering up these women-servants for the torture. <milestone

                    those things that cannot be done. For, since they scorned the love of life that
                    is inborn in all men and chose rather to die nobly than to live and look upon
                    Greece in misfortune, how can they have failed to leave behind them a record of

                    your virtuous qualities it will perhaps be fitting to describe summarily later

                    Wondering what fitting comparison for this I may offer, I find none, but it is
                    my privilege to request those who read this essay to see you and contemplate
                    you, so that I may be pardoned for declaring that I have no suitable simile.

                    mortal which arouses immortal longing in the beholder, the sight of which does
                    not satiate, and when removed from sight lingers in the memory, which in human
                    form possesses a natural beauty worthy of the gods, like a flower in its
                    comeliness, beyond suspicion of imperfections? Furthermore, it is impossible to
                    impute to your person even those blemishes which in the past have marred many

                    the same disfavor. By none of these could we find your person afflicted, for
                    whichever of the gods it was that took forethought for your person has so
                    diligently guarded you against all such mishaps as to leave nothing calling for

                    parts that are seen, and of the face itself the eyes, even more in these did the
                    god reveal the goodwill that he had toward you. For he not only furnished you
                    with eyes adequate to perform the necessary functions but, although the virtue
                    of some men is not recognized even from their actions, of your character he has
                    placed in a clear light the fine qualities through the evidence of your glance,
                    displaying it as gentle and kind toward those who look at you, dignified and
                    serious toward those who converse with you, manly and proper to all men.

                    a matter that may be particularly surprising. For while other men are assumed to
                    be mean-spirited because they are gentle and to be arrogant because they are
                    dignified, and are thought overbearing because they are manly, and stupid
                    because they keep quiet, Fortune in your case has taken qualities so mutually
                    contradictory and caused them all to be properly harmonized, as if fulfilling a
                    prayer or wishing to set an example for others, but not framing a mere mortal
                    nature, as was her usual way. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/><milestone

                    things are, I am afraid that we may find our bearers refusing to hear praise of

                    astonishing; for works of art have a motionless aspect, so that it is uncertain
                    what they would look like if they possessed life, but your personality enhances
                    in your every action the superb comeliness of your body. Only this much,
                    therefore, I have to say in praise of your beauty, omitting a great deal.

                    splendid to combine all the qualities of which a man of sense might justly feel
                    proud. From the following examples this will be clear: we shall find that Aeacus

                    in one or another of the qualities I have mentioned, have been deemed worthy of
                    the company of the gods, surely to a mere mortal it is the heights of desire to

                    once. This one point, therefore, you must grasp clearly at the outset, that all

                    this study, through which we shall become masters of both alike? Because life
                    may then too be expected to make a great advance for us when we reach out for
                    the things of supreme importance and find ourselves able to secure by rule and

                    blended in all these needs. There is no denying, of course, that in the past

                    admiration, but for you the proper thing is to disregard these men and to take
                    yourself seriously in hand. For in matters of the utmost importance you should
                    not be extemporizing instead of really knowing what to do or in emergencies be

                    that deals with practical affairs and political discussions. No doubt it is

                    philosophy was no reproach but that it brought honor to those who pursued it,

                    putting a low value on it, or, through pride in your present advantages, of
                    under-valuing the advantages yet to be gained. <milestone n="52" unit="section"

                    to be superior in no respect to the talented remainder, but deem it the highest
                    purpose to be first among all, and that it is more to your advantage to be seen
                    striving for this than merely being foremost among the rank and file. And do not
                    bring shame upon your natural gifts or cause to be cheated of their hopes those
                    who are proud of you, but endeavor by your own ability to surpass the desires of
                    those who have your interests most at heart. <milestone n="53" unit="section"

                    benefit and honor to those who hearken to them; and that the decisions we make
                    about all other matters make plain the power of perception we possess, but that
                    the choices we make of careers put our whole character to the test. And as you
                    pass judgement in these matters, count upon being judged at the same time
                    yourself by all men, and do not forget that I, who have been so ready to praise
