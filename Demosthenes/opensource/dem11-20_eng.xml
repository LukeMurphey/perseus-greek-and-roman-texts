                <head>Answer to Philip's Letter</head>
                <p>
                    <milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>It must now be
                    clear to all of you, Athenians, that Philip never concluded a peace with you,
                    but only postponed the war; for ever since he handed Halus<note anchored="yes"
                        resp="Loeb">A town in the south of <placeName key="tgn,7001399"
                            >Thessaly</placeName> on the Pagasaean Gulf; not to be confused with
                        Halonnesus.</note> over to the Pharsalians, settled the Phocian question,
                    and subdued the whole of <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>,
                    coining false excuses and inventing hollow pretexts, he has been all the time
                    practically at war with <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>,
                    though it is only now that he confesses it openly in the letter which he has
                    sent. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>I shall, however, try to prove to you
                    that you must not quail before his power nor offer a half-hearted resistance,
                    but must enter the war with an unsparing provision of men, money, and
                    ships&mdash;in a word, with all your resources. For first, men of <placeName
                        key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, you may reasonably expect that your
                    mightiest allies and supporters will be those gods whose sanction he has flouted
                    and whose name he has taken in vain through his unjust violation of the peace.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Then again, he has at last come to the end
                    of his policy of deception and his lavish promises of future benefit, which
                    before helped him to power. The Perinthians and Byzantines with their allies
                    realize that his aim is to deal with them even as he dealt with the Olynthians
                    before. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The Thessalians recognize that he is
                    determined to be their despot and not the president of a confederacy. The
                    Thebans suspect him, because he keeps a garrison at <placeName
                        key="perseus,Nicaea">Nicaea</placeName> and has stolen into the Amphictyonic
                    Council, and because he attracts to his court the embassies of the Peloponnesian
                    powers and secures their allies for himself. Thus of his old friends some are
                    even now his irreconcilable foes, others are no longer his hearty supporters,
                    while all regard him with suspicion and dislike. <milestone unit="section" n="5"
                    />Then too&mdash;nor is this a matter of small importance&mdash;quite
                    recently the satraps of <placeName key="tgn,7002294">Asia Minor</placeName> sent
                    a force of mercenaries and compelled Philip to raise the siege of Perinthus; but
                    today their hostility is confirmed, the danger, if he reduces <placeName
                        key="perseus,Byzantium">Byzantium</placeName>, is at their very doors, and
                    not only will they eagerly join the war against him, <milestone unit="section"
                        n="6"/>but they will prompt the king of <placeName key="tgn,7000231"
                        >Persia</placeName> to become our paymaster and he is richer than all the
                    rest together, and his power to interfere in <placeName key="tgn,1000074"
                        >Greece</placeName> is such that in our former wars with <placeName
                        key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, whichever side he joined, he
                    ensured their victory, and so, if he sides with us now, he will easily crush the
                    power of Philip. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"
                    />Now, admitting these great advantages, I cannot deny that Philip has used the
                    peace to forestall us in occupying many fortresses, harbors, and other points of
                    vantage; only I observe that when a league is knit together by goodwill, and
                    when all the allied states have the same interests, then the coalition stands
                    firm; but when, like Philip's, it is based on treachery and greed and maintained
                    by fraud and violence, then on some slight pretext or by some trifling slip it
                    is instantly shattered and dissolved. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Moreover,
                    men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, frequent reflection
                    has taught me that not only do Philip's alliances end in suspicion and
                    hostility, but also the various parts of his own kingdom are not united by such
                    satisfactory and intimate ties as people imagine. For although in a general way
                    the Macedonian power carries some weight and value as an auxiliary, yet by
                    itself it is weak and, in face of such a stupendous task, even negligible;
                        <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>and Philip, by his wars and his campaigns
                    and by all those activities to which his greatness might be attributed, has
                    really made it a less trusty weapon to his own hand. For you must not imagine,
                    men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, that his subjects
                    share his tastes; you must rather reflect that he wants glory, but they
                    security. He cannot gain his end without danger; they, thinking of children,
                    parents, and wives left at home, are not so eager to court ruin and danger every
                    day to oblige him. <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>From this you can gauge the
                    feelings of the great body of the Macedonians towards Philip; while as regards
                    his courtiers and captains of his mercenaries you will find that, though they
                    have some repute for valor, they live in greater fear than those who have none;
                    for these have only the enemy to fear, but those dread the sycophants and
                    slanderers of the court more than a pitched battle. <milestone unit="section"
                        n="11"/>These, again, have the whole army to support them when they face the
                    hostile ranks, but those both have to bear the chief burden of the war, and,
                    apart from that, it is their peculiar misfortune to fear the temper of their
                    king. Moreover, if a common soldier is at fault, his punishment is proportioned
                    to his deserts, but it is just when the officers are most successful that they
                    are most exposed to unmerited curses and gibes. <milestone unit="section" n="12"
                    />And all this no one in his senses would refuse to believe; for those who have
                    resided at his court agree that Philip is so jealous that he wants to take to
                    himself all the credit of the chief successes, and is more annoyed with a
                    general or an officer who achieves something praiseworthy than with those who
                    fail ignominiously. <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>This being so, how is it
                    that they have so long remained loyal to him? Because, men of <placeName
                        key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, at present his prosperity
                    overshadows all such shortcomings, for success has a strange power of obscuring
                    and covering men's failings; but if he trips, all his weakness will be clearly
                    revealed. For it is with the political as with the bodily constitution.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>As long as a man is in good health, he is
                    conscious of no unsoundness here or here, but when his health breaks down, every
                    part is set a-working, be it a rupture or a sprain or any organ that is not
                    perfectly healthy. So with all monarchies and oligarchies; as long as their arms
                    prosper, few detect their weaknesses, but when they stumble, even as Philip must
                    stumble beneath a burden that is greater than he can bear, then all their
                    disadvantages are plain for all men to see. <milestone unit="section" n="15"
                        /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now if any of you, Athenians, seeing
                    Philip's good fortune, considers him a formidable and dangerous opponent, he is
                    exercising a prudent forethought. For fortune is indeed a great weight in the
                    scale; I might almost say it is everything in human affairs. And yet in many
                    respects our good fortune is to be preferred to Philip's. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="16"/>For our prosperity is inherited from our ancestors,
                    and is of an earlier date than the prosperity not only of Philip, but, roughly
                    speaking, of all the kings that have ever reigned in <placeName
                        key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>. Those kings actually paid tribute
                    to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, but <placeName
                        key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> never paid tribute to any power in
                    the world. Moreover, we have a more secure claim than Philip upon the favour of
                    heaven, in so far as our conduct has always been guided by greater regard for
                    religion and for justice. <milestone unit="section" n="17"/>Why, then, was he
                    more successful than we in the late war? I will be frank with you, men of
                        <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>. It is because he always
                    takes a personal share in the hardships and dangers of the campaign, never
                    neglects a chance, never wastes any season of the year; while we&mdash;for
                    the truth must out&mdash;sit here idle; we are always hanging back and
                    passing resolutions and haunting the market-place to learn the latest news. Yet
                    what more startling news could there be than that a Macedonian should insult
                    Athenians, daring to send us such a letter as you have heard read a moment ago?
                        <milestone unit="section" n="18"/>Philip's resources include mercenary
                    soldiers, and also, observe! certain mercenary orators here among us, men who
                    are not ashamed to devote their lives to his service, thinking that they are
                    carrying home his bribes, but blind to the fact that they are bartering all the
                    interests of the State, and their own as well, for a paltry profit. We, on the
                    other hand, make no attempt to foment a revolution in his kingdom, we decline to
                    hire mercenaries, we shrink from taking the field. <milestone unit="section"
                        n="19"/>It is not a strange thing, then, that he has gained ground at our
                    expense in the late war, but rather that we, performing no single duty of a
                    nation at war, think that we are going to defeat one who does everything that a
                    grasping ambition demands. <milestone unit="section" n="20"/><milestone
                        unit="para" ed="P"/>Bearing this in mind, Athenians, and reflecting that it
                    is not even in our power to pretend that we are at peace, for Philip has already
                    issued a declaration of war and followed it up by active hostilities, it is
                    necessary to spare no expense, public or private, to take the field eagerly and
                    in full force, wherever the opportunity occurs, and to employ abler generals
                    than before. <milestone unit="section" n="21"/>For none of you must assume that
                    the same policy that weakened the power of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName> will suffice to restore and advance it, nor suppose
                    that, if you are as half-hearted as before, others will be zealous in defence of
                    your interests. Reflect, rather, what a disgrace it would be if your fathers
                    faced many hardships and great dangers in fighting the Lacedaemonians,
                        <milestone unit="section" n="22"/>but you should refuse to defend with vigor
                    those advantages which they justly won and bequeathed to you; what a disgrace if
                    one, with only the tradition of <placeName key="tgn,7006667"
                        >Macedonia</placeName> behind him, so cheerfully courts danger that, in the
                    task of extending his sway, he has been wounded in every limb on the
                    battle-field, but Athenians, whose ancestral boast it is in war to yield to none
                    and conquer all, should renounce, through indolence or cowardice, alike the
                    deeds of their ancestors and the interests of their fatherland. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="23"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Not to detain you
                    longer, I say that we must be prepared for war, and must urge the Greek states,
                    by our action rather than by our appeals, to join our alliance; for all words
                    divorced from action are futile, especially words from Athenian lips, in
                    proportion as we are reputed to be more ready of speech than all other
                    Greeks.</p>

                    not only failed to bring the law-breakers to justice, but you kept the victim a
                    prisoner for ten months, and the letters from me, of which he was the bearer,
                    you read before your Assembly. Next, when the Thasians opened their harbor to
                    the Byzantine war-galleys and to any pirates that chose to touch there, you
                    ignored the incident, in spite of the clauses expressly denouncing such acts as
                    hostile. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Furthermore, about the same date,

                    the sum of money under discussion and the other matters referred to this

                        >Athens</placeName>, in either of two methods: I may attack the officials
                    who assign and distribute the public funds and may thus gain credit with those
                    who regard this system as detrimental to the State, or I may approve and commend
                    the right to receive these doles and so gratify those who are especially in need
                    of them. For neither class has the interest of the State in view, when they
                    approve or complain of the system, but they are prompted respectively by their
                    poverty or their affluence. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>I myself would
                    neither propose such a distribution of the doles, nor oppose the right to
                    receive them; but I do urge you to reflect seriously in your own minds that
                    while the sum of money you are discussing is a trifle, the habit of mind that it
                    fosters is a serious matter. Now if you so organize the receipt of money that it
                    is associated with the performance of duties, so far from injuring, you will
                    actually confer on the State and on yourselves the greatest benefit; but if a
                    festival or any other pretext is good enough to justify a dole, and yet you
                    refuse even to listen to the suggestion that there is any obligation attached to
                    it, beware lest you end by acknowledging that what you now consider a proper
                    practice was a grievous error. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>My idea of our

                    before you judge&mdash;my idea is that, as we have devoted a meeting of the
                    Assembly to the question of receiving the dole, so we ought also to devote a
                    meeting to organization and to equipment for war; and everyone must show himself
                    not merely ready to hear what is said, but also willing to act, so that you may
                    depend on yourselves, Athenians, for your hopes of success, and not be always
                    asking what service this individual or that is rendering. <milestone

                    and as overseers' fees, or whatever you like to call it, by those beyond the
                    age-limit; and you must serve in person and not resign that duty to others,
                        <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>but our army must be a national force,
                    equipped from the resources I have named, so that you may be well provided for

                    happens now, when you are always bringing your generals to trial and the net
                    result of your exertions is the announcement that &ldquo;So-and-so, the son
                    of So-and-so, has impeached So-and-so.&rdquo; <milestone unit="section"
                        n="6"/>But what is to be the result for you? In the first place, that your
                    allies may be kept loyal, not by maintaining garrisons among them, but by making
                    their interests identical with yours; next, that our generals may not lead
                    mercenaries to the plunder of our allies without even coming in sight of the
                    enemy, so that the profit is all their own, while the State at large incurs the
                    hatred and the abuse, but that they may have their own citizens at their back,
                    and may so deal with our enemies as they now deal with our friends. <milestone

                    actual presence, and beside the advantage of using a national force in a
                    national quarrel, this is necessary on every other ground. For if you were
                    content to let things slide and not worry about the state of <placeName

                    determine the rights of other states; yet neither in the past nor today have you
                    furnished a sufficient force to superintend and secure this claim. On the
                    contrary, it was when you stood utterly aloof and indifferent that the
                    democracies of <placeName key="perseus,Mytilene">Mytilene</placeName> and of
                        <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName> were destroyed.
                    &ldquo;Yes, but <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName> was our
                    enemy,&rdquo; you may say. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>But you should
                    consider, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, that our
                    hostility towards oligarchies, purely on the ground of principle, is stronger
                    than our hostility towards democracies on any grounds whatever. But to return to
                    my point. My view is that you must be brought under a system, and there must be
                    a uniform scheme for receiving public money and for performing necessary
                    services. I have addressed you before on this subject and have described the
                    method of organizing you, whether you serve in the infantry or the cavalry or in
                    other ways, and also how ample provision may be ensured for all alike.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>I will tell you without any concealment
                    what has caused me most disappointment. It is that though the many reforms
                    proposed were all of them important and honorable, no one remembers any of them,
                    but everyone remembers the two obols.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">The charge
                        for admission to the theater defrayed by the State.</note> Yet these can
                    never be worth more than two obols, but the other reforms, together with those
                    that I proposed, are worth all the wealth of the Great King&mdash;that a
                    city, so well provided with infantry, triremes, cavalry, and revenues, should be
                    duly organized and equipped. <milestone unit="section" n="11"/><milestone
                        unit="para" ed="P"/>Why then, you may ask, do I choose the present time for
                    these remarks? Because I think that, as the principle that all citizens should
                    serve for pay is displeasing to some people, and yet the advantage of
                    organization and equipment is approved by all, you ought to begin the business
                    at this point, giving everyone a chance of stating his views on the subject. For
                    the case stands thus: if you are convinced that now is the opportunity for these
                    reforms, all things will be ready when the need of them arrives, but if you pass
                    over the opportunity as unsuitable, then, just when you want to use them, you
                    will be compelled to begin your preparations. <milestone unit="section" n="12"
                        /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>It has been before now remarked, men of

                    are likely to have a fit if these reforms are carried
                    out&mdash;&ldquo;What good have we ever got from the speeches of
                    Demosthenes? He comes forward, whenever he thinks well, fills our ears with
                    phrases, denounces our present state, extols our ancestors, and then descends
                    from the platform after raising our hopes and inflating our pride.&rdquo;
                        <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>But if I could only induce you to accept
                    any of my proposals, I think that I should confer such benefits on the State
                    that if I tried to describe them now, many of you would disbelieve them, as
                    being too good to be true. And yet even this too I consider no mean benefit, if
                    I accustom you to listen to the best advice. For he who would benefit the State,
                    Athenians, must first purge your ears, for they have been poisoned; so many lies
                    have you been accustomed to hear&mdash;anything, in fact, rather than the

                    let no one interrupt me till I have finished my story. You know that a day or

                    all, cried that the democracy was overthrown, that the laws were null and void,
                    and so on. And yet, Athenians, though the culprits&mdash;mark whether my
                    words are true&mdash;deserved death, it is not through them that the
                    democracy is endangered. Again, a few oars were stolen. &ldquo;Scourge the
                    thieves torture them,&rdquo; cried the orators; &ldquo;the democracy is
                    in danger.&rdquo; But what is my opinion I say, like the others, that the
                    thief deserves death, but not that the democracy is endangered by such means.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>The real danger to democracy no one is
                    bold enough to name; but I will name it. It is in danger when you, men of

                    cares to tell you the truth or set you right, when no one makes an effort to

                    country as great, glorious, and venerable, and as something greater than any
                    service rendered. But now, Athenians, you make citizens of the scum of mankind,
                    menial sons of menial fathers, charging a price for it as for any other
                    commodity. <milestone unit="section" n="25"/>You have got into the habit of
                    acting thus, not because in ability you are inferior to your ancestors, but
                    because it was second nature with them to have a high opinion of themselves,
                    while you, Athenians, have lost that virtue. You cannot, I suppose, have a proud
                    and chivalrous spirit, if your conduct is mean and paltry, any more than your
                    spirit can be mean and humble, if your conduct is honorable and glorious; for

                    might be named as the outstanding achievements of your ancestors and of
                    yourselves, if haply the comparison may yet enable you to become your own
                    masters. For five and forty years<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Between the

                    of the Greeks; more than ten thousand talents did they accumulate in our
                    Acropolis; many honorable trophies for victories on sea and on land did they
                    erect, in which even yet we take a pride. Yet remember that they erected them,
                    not that we might wonder as we gaze at them, but that we might also imitate the
                    virtues of the dedicators. <milestone unit="section" n="27"/>Thus did our

                    consider whether we can match them. Have we not wasted more than fifteen hundred

                    The buildings which they left behind them to adorn our city&mdash;temples,
                    harbors, and their accessories&mdash;were so great and so fair that we who
                    come after must despair of ever surpassing them; the Propylaea yonder, the
                    docks, the porticoes and the rest, with which they beautified the city that they
                    have bequeathed to us. <milestone unit="section" n="29"/>But the private houses
                    of those who rose to power were so modest and so in accordance with the style of
                    our constitution that the homes of their famous men, of Themistocles and Cimon
                    and Aristides, as any of you can see that knows them, are not a whit more
                    splendid than those of their neighbors. <milestone unit="section" n="30"/>But
                    today, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, while our

                    purchased and cultivated estates more vast than they ever dreamed of before.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="31"/>The cause of all this change is that then
                    the people controlled and dispensed everything, and the rest were well content

                    the people are in the position of lackeys and hangers-on, and you are content to

                    counsel you to be less proud, but since you are Athenians, I urge you to get

                    aloof from Greek affairs. For you have many exploits to your credit from the

                    while it is impossible to trust your enemies and allow them to grow powerful. In
                    short, you stand in the same position as your statesmen stand to

                    those whom they eulogize; for when they attempt to speak about achievements to
                    which no words could possibly do justice, they earn for themselves the
                    reputation of clever speakers, but leave their hearers with a lower estimate of
                    the merits of those famous men. Indeed, I think the best testimony to their
                    merits is the length of time that has elapsed, during which no other men have
                    been able to surpass their achievements. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>For my
                    own part, however, I shall confine myself to pointing out how you can best
                    prepare for war. For this is how things stand. Even if all of us who are to
                    address you should prove capable speakers, you would, I am sure, be no better
                    off; but if someone, whoever he may be, could come forward and point out
                    convincingly the nature and size of the force that will be serviceable to the
                    city, and show how it is to be provided, all our present fears will be relieved.
                    This is what I will try to do, if only I am able, first giving you briefly my
                    views about our relations with the Great King. <milestone unit="section" n="3"
                        /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I admit that he is the common enemy of all
                    the Greeks; yet I would not on that account advise you to undertake a war
                    against him by yourselves apart from the rest, for I observe that the Greeks
                    themselves are by no means common friends of one another, but that certain of
                    them repose more confidence in the King than in some of their neighbors. From
                    this state of things I conclude that it is to your interest to be careful that
                    your grounds for entering on war shall be equitable and just, but to proceed
                    with all the necessary preparations, making that the foundation of your policy.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>For I believe, Athenians, that if there
                    were clear and unmistakable signs of the King's hostile intentions, the other
                    Greeks would join with us, and would be deeply grateful to those who would stand
                    up for them and with them against his attacks; but if we force on a war, while
                    his aims are still obscure, I am afraid, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName>, that we shall be obliged to encounter, not only the
                    King, but also those whom we are minded to protect. <milestone unit="section"
                        n="5"/>For the King, suspending his designs&mdash;if he really intends
                    to invade Greece&mdash;will distribute money among them and tempt them with
                    offers of friendship, while they, anxious to bring their private quarrels to a
                    successful issue and keeping that object in view, will overlook the common
                    safety of all. Into such a welter of confusion and folly I beseech you not to
                    plunge our country. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>For indeed, as regards your
                    policy towards the King, I see that you are by no means on the same footing as
                    the other Greeks; for many of them it is, I suppose, possible to pursue their
                    private interests and abandon the cause of their countrymen, but for you, even
                    when wronged by them, it would not be honorable to exact such a penalty from the
                    wrong-doers as to leave any of them under the heel of the barbarian. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="7"/>But as long as this is so, we must take care that we
                    are not involved in war at a disadvantage, and that the King, whom we believe to
                    have designs against the Greeks, does not win the credit of appearing as their
                    friend. How then can this be ensured? If we make it plain to all that our forces
                    are already marshalled and equipped, but equally plain that our policy is
                    founded on sentiments of justice. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>To your rash
                    advisers, who are so eager to hurry you into war, I have this to say, that it is
                    not difficult, when deliberation is needed, to gain a reputation for courage,
                    nor when danger is at hand, to display skill in oratory; but there is something
                    that is both difficult and essential&mdash;to display courage in the face of
                    danger, and in deliberation to offer sounder advice than one's fellows.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>I believe, men of <placeName
                        key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, that the war with the King is a
                    difficult undertaking for our city, though any conflict which the war involved
                    might prove easy enough.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">In <bibl n="Dem. 9.52"

                        contest with Philip.</note> Why so? Because the first requisites for every
                    war are necessarily, I suppose, fleets and money and strong positions, and I
                    find that the King is more fully supplied with these than we are; but for the
                    actual conflict I observe that nothing is needed so much as brave soldiers, and
                    of these we and those who share the danger with us have the better supply.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>That is why I advise that we should not on
                    any grounds be the first to plunge into war, but for the conflict we must be
                    properly equipped from the start. If indeed there were one kind of force
                    suitable for defence against Persians and another for defence against Greeks,
                    then we might reasonably be suspected of marshalling ourselves against the King;
                        <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>but when all preparation for war is on the
                    same lines and the main objects of an armed force are the same&mdash;to be
                    strong enough to repel the enemy, to assist one's allies, and to preserve one's
                    own possessions-why, having open enemies enough, must we be looking out for
                    another? Let us rather make our preparations against them, and then we shall
                    defend ourselves against him too, if he ventures to molest us. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="12"/>Moreover you are now calling on the Greeks to join
                    you; but if you refuse to do their bidding&mdash;and your relations with
                    some of them are not cordial&mdash;how can you expect any of them to answer
                    your call? &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; you say, &ldquo;we shall warn them
                    that the King has designs on them.&rdquo; But seriously, do you imagine that
                    they cannot detect that for themselves? I am sure they can. But as yet their
                    fear of <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName> is subordinate to their
                    feuds with you and, in some cases, with one another. Therefore your ambassadors

                    desire and three hundred ships, they will not come as our suitors, feeling that
                    with such support their safety is assured. Therefore to invite them at once
                    means that you are the suppliants and, if unsuccessful, have failed utterly, but
                    to wait and at the same time complete your own preparations means saving them at

                    similar considerations, I was unwilling to compose a confident oration or one of
                    futile length, but I have been at very great pains to consider the best and
                    speediest method of completing our equipment. I venture to think that you ought
                    to hear my plan and vote for it, if it satisfies you. Now the first and most
                    important step in our equipment, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName>, is that you should be filled with such resolution that
                    everyone shall be willing and eager to do his part. <milestone unit="section"
                        n="15"/>For you will notice, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName>, that whenever you have collectively formed some
                    project, and thereafter each individual has realized that it was his personal
                    duty to carry it out, nothing has ever escaped your grasp; but whenever you have
                    formed your project and thereafter have looked to one another to carry it out,
                    each expecting to do nothing while his neighbor worked, then nothing has
                    succeeded with you. <milestone unit="section" n="16"/>But seeing you thus
                    resolved and enthusiastic, I propose that the register of the twelve
                        hundred<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">The wealthiest citizens
                            &lpar;<foreign lang="greek">suntelei=s</foreign>&rpar;.</note>
                    should be filled up and enlarged to two thousand by the addition of eight
                    hundred names; for if you fix on that number, I believe that you will get your
                    twelve hundred persons, after striking out wards, orphans, settlers in colonies,
                    joint holders of estates, and anyone otherwise ineligible. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="17"/>Then I propose to divide these into twenty boards, as
                    at present, each containing sixty persons. Each of these boards I would
                    subdivide into five groups of twelve men, always attaching to the wealthiest man
                    those who are poorest, to keep the balance. That is how I propose to arrange
                    these persons; you will understand why, when you have heard the whole of the
                    arrangement. <milestone unit="section" n="18"/>Now what about the war-galleys? I
                    propose to fix the total number at three hundred, divided into twenty squadrons
                    of fifteen ships each, assigning to each squadron five of the first
                        hundred,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Ships of the first rate,
                        apparently.</note> five of the second, and five of the third; and next to
                    allot a squadron of fifteen to each board, and the board must assign three
                    vessels to each of its own groups. <milestone unit="section" n="19"/>When these
                    preliminaries are settled, I propose that your wealth also should be organized,
                    and that as the ratable value of the country is six thousand talents, this sum
                    should be divided into a hundred parts of sixty talents each, and that then five
                    of these parts should be allotted to each of the twenty full boards, and that
                    the board itself should assign one part, consisting of sixty talents,<note

                    each will be covered by the sixty talents and there will be twelve trierarchs
                    for each; if you want two hundred, there will be thirty talents to cover the
                    cost and six persons to serve as trierarchs; if you want three hundred, there
                    will be twenty talents for the cost and four persons to serve. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="21"/>In the same way I propose, men of <placeName

                    should be valued and divided according to the inventory into twenty parts, and
                    then that one part of the debtors liable for it should be allotted to each of
                    the full boards, and that each board should assign an equal share to each of its
                    own groups; and that the twelve members of the group should exact the same from
                    the debtors, and so provide, fully equipped, as many galleys as they are
                    severally responsible for. <milestone unit="section" n="22"/>That, I think,
                    would be the best way of providing and organizing the money, the hulls, the

                    clear and easy way of manning the ships. I suggest that the generals should

                    in each for thirty ships, as close together as possible, and that when they have
                    done this, they should apportion two boards and thirty galleys to each area, and
                    then assign the tribes by lot to the areas. <milestone unit="section" n="23"

                    into three parts whatever area his tribe has taken over, and the ships in the
                    same way, and then he must allot the thirds of his tribe in such a way that of
                    the whole space of the dockyards each tribe may have one area and each third of
                    a tribe a third of an area; so that you can know at once, if necessary, where
                    each tribe and each third of a tribe is stationed, who are the trierarchs and
                    what ships they have, and that so each tribe may have thirty ships and each
                    third of a tribe ten. For if we can only get this started, any detail at present
                    omitted &lpar;for it is perhaps difficult to provide for
                    everything&rpar; will be discovered by the actual working of the plan, and
                    we shall have a uniform system both for the whole navy and for every part of it.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="24"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But as
                    regards money and a ready supply of it at once, I am aware that I am going to
                    make a startling proposal. The proposal shall, however, be made, because I am
                    confident that if you take the right point of view, it will be clear that I
                    alone have told you the truth, as it is and as it will be. My view is that we
                    ought not to talk about money now; for if we need it, we have a source of
                    supply, abundant, honorable and fair; if we look for it at once, we shall fail
                    so utterly to supply it now that we shall conclude that it is not even in
                    reserve for our future use, but if we leave it alone, it will be there. What,
                    then, is this supply, which is not now, but will be hereafter? <milestone
                        unit="section" n="25"/>That sounds like a riddle, but I will explain. Look
                    at the great city that lies around you, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName>. In that city there is wealth, I might almost say, equal
                    to that of all the other Greek cities together. But that wealth is in the hands
                    of men whose temper is such that if all our orators started a scare that the
                    King is coming, that he is close at hand, that the report must be true, and if
                    the orators were backed by an equal number of oracle-mongers, not only would
                    they fail to contribute, but they would refuse to declare or acknowledge their
                    wealth. <milestone unit="section" n="26"/>But if once they saw that what alarms
                    them now as a mere rumor was actually taking place, none of them is so foolish
                    that he would not be the first to pay his contribution; for who will choose to
                    sacrifice life and property sooner than contribute a fraction to ensure his
                    person and the remainder of his wealth? The money, I say, we have when it is
                    really needed, but not before. Therefore I advise you not to seek it out, for
                    the whole sum that you could raise, if you insisted on raising it, would be more
                    ridiculous than nothing at all. <milestone unit="section" n="27"/>For consider;
                    will anyone propose a tax of one per cent now? Then we get sixty talents. Or
                    double it and make it two per cent? Still only a hundred and twenty talents. And
                    what is that to the twelve hundred camels laden, as our friends here tell us,
                    with the King's treasure? Then would you have me assume that we shall contribute
                    a twelfth of your wealth, or five hundred talents? But you would not submit to
                    such a tax, nor if you paid up, would the money be sufficient for the war.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="28"/>You must therefore make all your other
                    preparations, but let the money remain for the present in the hands of its
                    owners, for it could not be in better keeping, for the benefit of the State; but
                    if ever the threatened crisis comes, then accept it as a voluntary
                        contribution.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>These proposals, men of
                        <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, are both practicable and
                    honorable and advantageous, fit to be reported of you to the King and calculated
                    to inspire him with no little alarm. <milestone unit="section" n="29"/>He knows
                    that with two hundred galleys, of which we provided one hundred, our ancestors

                    of our own ready for sea, so that even if he were raving mad, he would scarcely
                    think it a light thing to incur the hostility of our city. But indeed, if he
                    bases his confidence on his wealth, he will find this too a less sure foundation
                    than yours. <milestone unit="section" n="30"/>He is bringing, they say, gold in
                    plenty. But if he disburses it, he will look in vain for more; for even springs
                    and wells have a way of failing, if one draws from them constantly and lavishly.
                    But he will hear that our resources consist of the ratable value of our country,
                    and how we can fight in defence of it against invaders from his land, those
                    ancestors of his who fought at Marathon best know; but as long as we are
                    victorious, there is surely no prospect of money failing us. <milestone

                        Agesilaus, Iphicrates and Chabrias were among the Greek generals who took

                    enable him to subdue any of those enemies as to win for themselves wealth and

                    attack <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>. For where would he
                    retire afterwards? Will he go to <placeName key="tgn,7002613"

                    is so desperate that he will sacrifice himself, his ancestors, his sepulchres,
                    and his native land, all for the sake of a paltry profit? I cannot think that
                    there is such a man. Moreover, it is not even to the King's advantage that

                    care to hear any good of them, even if it were true; but yet, when dealing with
                    grave matters, one must not on any pretext pass over an important consideration.
                    For my part, I believe that the Thebans are so little likely to join the King in
                    an attack on <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> that they would pay
                    a large sum, <milestone unit="section" n="34"/>if they had it, to get a chance
                    of expiating their former sins against the Greeks.<note anchored="yes"
                        resp="Loeb">Their &ldquo;Medism&rdquo; during the Persian
                        wars.</note> If, however, some think that the Thebans are fated always to be
                    on the wrong side, at any rate you all know this, that if the Thebans stand by
                    the King, their enemies are bound to stand by the Greeks. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="35"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I believe, then, that
                    the cause of justice and those who defend it will prove stronger than the
                    traitors and the barbarian against all opposition. Therefore I say that we must
                    not be unduly alarmed, nor must we be tempted to commence hostilities. And
                    indeed I cannot see that any of the other Greeks have reason to dread this war.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="36"/>For who of them does not know that as long
                    as they were of one mind and regarded the Persian as their common enemy, they
                    could count on many advantages, but ever since they thought of him as a friend
                    to fall back on and were torn asunder by their own private quarrels, they have
                    suffered such disasters as no one would have devised for them even in an
                    imprecation. If that is so, are we to fear this man, whom fortune and the voice
                    of Heaven proclaim to be an unprofitable friend and an auspicious foe? Never!
                    Yet let us do him no wrong either, both in our own interests and in view of the
                    unrest and disloyalty of the other Greeks. <milestone unit="section" n="37"/>If
                    indeed we could attack him with unanimity, all banded against one, I should not
                    count it wrong in us to do him wrong.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">A curious
                        piece of casuistry.</note> But since this is impossible, I suggest that we
                    ought to be careful not to give the King an opportunity to pose as the champion
                    of the other Greeks; for as long as you remain quiet, any such action on his
                    part would excite suspicion, but if you are the aggressors, he will seem
                    naturally anxious to befriend the rest, because they are hostile to you.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="38"/>Do not, then, expose the weakness of the
                    Greeks by issuing a summons which they will not obey and declaring a war which
                    you cannot wage; but in quietness and confidence go on with your preparations,
                    and be content that this report of you be brought to the King's ears, not
                    &lpar;Heaven forbid!&rpar; that all the Greeks, including the Athenians,
                    are helpless, <milestone unit="section" n="39"/>terrified and
                    distracted&mdash;that is far from being the case&mdash;but that if
                    falsehood and perjury were not as disgraceful in the eyes of the Greeks as they
                    are respectable in his, you would long ago have marched against him; that as it
                    is, you will not for your own sakes do this, but you pray to all the gods that
                    he may be smitten with the same infatuation as were his ancestors of old. And if
                    it comes into his mind to reflect on this; he will find that your resolutions
                    are not carelessly taken. <milestone unit="section" n="40"/>He knows that the
                    wars we fought against his ancestors have made our city prosperous and powerful,
                    but that the policy of inaction that she once pursued gave her no such supremacy
                    over any of the other Greek states as she enjoys today. And indeed he sees that
                    the Greeks stand in need of a peacemaker, whether voluntary or involuntary, and
                    he knows that in that character he would himself appear to them, if he tried to
                    stir up war. Therefore he will find the reports that reach him easy to
                    understand and easy to believe. <milestone unit="section" n="41"/><milestone

                    of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, when debating such
                    important matters, is, I think, to allow freedom of speech to every one of your
                    counsellors. Personally, I never thought it a difficult task to point out to you
                    the best policy&mdash;for, to speak plainly, you all seem to me to have
                    discerned it already&mdash;but rather to induce you to put it into
                    operation; for when a resolution has been approved and passed, it is no nearer
                    accomplishment than before it was approved. <milestone unit="section" n="2"

                    gratitude, that the same men who not long ago attacked you in the wantonness of
                    their pride, now find in you alone the hope of their salvation. You ought to be
                    delighted at your present opportunity, because, if you decide aright, you will
                    in fact succeed, with honor to yourselves, in silencing the evil tongues that
                    traduce our city. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>For we were charged by the
                    Chians, Byzantines and Rhodians with plotting against them, and that was why
                    they concerted the last war against us; but we shall be able to prove that
                    whereas Mausolus, the prime mover and instigator in the business, while calling
                    himself the friend of the Rhodians, has robbed them of their liberty, and
                    whereas the Chians and Byzantines, who posed as their allies, never helped them
                    in distress, <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>it is to you, whom they dreaded,
                    to you alone of all the states that they owe their deliverance. By making this
                    clear to all, you will teach the democrats in every state to consider friendship
                    with you as the pledge of their safety, and no greater advantage could you have
                    than to win from all men their voluntary and unsuspecting goodwill. <milestone

                    the Rhodian democracy is concerned. Yet everyone knows that the Rhodians are
                    Greeks, while <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> is a division of
                    the Persian Empire. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Some of you, I suppose,
                    remember that when you were discussing Persian affairs, I was the first to come
                    forward with advice,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">In the speech <title>On the

                    believe I was the only speaker, or perhaps one out of two, to say that I should
                    think it prudent in you not to make your hostility to the King the pretext for
                    your preparations, but while equipping yourselves against your existing enemies,
                    to defend yourselves against him too, if he attempted to do you wrong. Nor did I
                    fail to convince you that I was right, but you, too, approved of my suggestion.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>My present speech, then, is the sequel of
                    my former one. For indeed, if the King admitted me to his presence and asked me
                    for my advice, I should give him the same that I gave you&mdash;to defend
                    his own subjects, if any of the Greeks attacked them, but to claim no
                    sovereignty over those who owed him no allegiance. <milestone unit="section"
                        n="8"/>Now if you make it a general principle, men of <placeName

                    that he has got into his power, whether by surprise or by deceiving some of the
                    inhabitants, then your principle is, I think, a wrong one; but if you feel that
                    in the cause of justice you are bound to go to war and face the consequences,
                    then, in the first place, the more you are determined on such action, the less
                    frequently will it be necessary, and secondly, you will be showing the proper
                    spirit. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>To prove
                    that there is precedent both for my proposal to free the Rhodians and for your
                    action, if you adopt it, I will remind you of some things that you have done,
                    and that successfully. You are the men, Athenians, who once sent Timotheus to
                    the help of Ariobarzanes,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">The satrap of Phrygia,
                        who joined the revolt of the satraps in 362. He was soon afterwards betrayed
                        and crucified.</note> adding this clause to your instructions,
                    &ldquo;provided that he does not violate our treaty with the
                    King.&rdquo; Timotheus, seeing that Ariobarzanes was in open revolt from the
                    King and that <placeName key="tgn,7002673">Samos</placeName> was garrisoned by
                    Cyprothemis, who had been stationed there by Tigranes, the King's viceroy,
                    abandoned his intention of helping the satrap, but invested the island and used
                    his force to liberate it; <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>and to this very day
                    you have not been involved in war on those grounds. For no one would go to war
                    as readily for aggrandizement as for the defence of his own possessions; but
                    while all men fight desperately to keep what they are in danger of losing, it is
                    not so with aggrandizement men make it, indeed, their aim, but if prevented,
                    they do not feel that they have suffered any injustice from their opponents.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="11"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But since I
                    believe that neither would Artemisia now oppose this action on our part, if our
                    State were once committed to it, give me your attention for a little and
                    consider whether my reasoning is sound or not. I think that if the King's
                    designs in <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> were meeting with any
                    success, Artemisia would make a big effort to secure <placeName
                        key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName> for him, not from any goodwill towards
                    him, but because, while he is in her neighborhood, she would like to put him
                    under a great obligation, so that he may give her as cordial a recognition<note
                        anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Acknowledging her as the successor of
                        Mausolus.</note> as possible. <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>But if the
                    reports are true and he has failed in all his attempts, she must argue that this
                    island would be of no use to him at present-which is true enough&mdash;but
                    might serve as a fortress to overawe <placeName key="tgn,7002358"
                        >Caria</placeName> and check any move on her part. Therefore I think she
                    would rather that you had the island, if not too obviously surrendered by her,
                    than that he should get it. I do not, indeed, expect that she will send any help
                    to the Rhodian government, or if she does, it will be feeble and half-hearted;
                        <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>while as to the King, I should not like to
                    say that I know what he is actually going to do, but that it is to our advantage
                    that he should at once make it clear whether he is going to claim <placeName
                        key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName> or not&mdash;that I should maintain
                    positively. For when he does claim it, you will have to take counsel, not for
                    the Rhodians only, but for yourselves and all the Greeks. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="14"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And yet, even if the
                    party at present in possession held <placeName key="tgn,7011266"
                        >Rhodes</placeName> by their own strength, I should not have advised you to
                    take their side, even if they promised to do everything you wished. For I notice
                    that at the start, in order to overthrow the democracy, they enlisted some of
                    the citizens on their side, and when they had succeeded, sent them into
                    banishment again. Now men who have been faithful to neither side could never, I
                    am sure, become steadfast allies to you. <milestone unit="section" n="15"
                    />Moreover I should never have made this proposal, had I thought that it would
                    benefit the Rhodian democrats alone, for I am not the official patron of that
                    party, nor do I count any of them among my private friends. Yet even if both
                    these motives had been present, I should not have proposed it, if I had not
                    thought that it would benefit you, since I share in your satisfaction at the
                    fate of the Rhodians&mdash;if one who is pleading for their deliverance may
                    be permitted to say so. For they grudged you the recovery of your rights, and
                    now they have lost their own liberty; they spurned an alliance with you who are
                    Greeks and their betters, and now they are slaves of barbarians, slaves of
                    slaves, whom they admitted into their citadels. <milestone unit="section" n="16"
                    />I am almost inclined to say, if you choose to help them, that this has been a
                    salutary lesson for them; for in prosperity I doubt whether they would ever have
                    chosen to show their good sense, being Rhodians, but when tested by experience
                    and taught that folly is in most cases a fruitful source of evil, they may
                    perhaps with luck grow more sensible for the future; and that I regard as no
                    small advantage for them. Accordingly, I say that it is your duty to try to save
                    them and to let bygones be bygones, remembering that you too have in many cases
                    been led by schemers into errors, for none of which you would yourselves admit
                    that you ought to pay the penalty. <milestone unit="section" n="17"/><milestone
                        unit="para" ed="P"/>You may also observe, Athenians, that you have been
                    engaged in many wars both with democracies and with oligarchies. You do not need
                    to be told that; but perhaps none of you considers what are your motives for war
                    with either. What, then, are those motives? With democracies, either private
                    quarrels, when they could not be adjusted by the State, or a question of
                    territory or boundaries, or else rivalry or the claim to leadership; with
                    oligarchies you fight for none of these things, but for your constitution and
                    your liberty. <milestone unit="section" n="18"/>Therefore I should not hesitate
                    to say that I think it a greater advantage that all the Greeks should be your
                    enemies under democracy than your friends under oligarchy. For with free men I
                    do not think that you would have any difficulty in making peace whenever you
                    wished, but with an oligarchical state I do not believe that even friendly
                    relations could be permanent, for the few can never be well disposed to the
                    many, nor those who covet power to those who have chosen a life of equal
                    privileges. <milestone unit="section" n="19"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"
                    />Seeing that <placeName key="tgn,7002670">Chios</placeName> and <placeName

                    the world are now being seduced into this form of slavery, I am surprised that
                    none of you conceives that our constitution too is in danger, nor draws the
                    conclusion that if all other states are organized on oligarchical principles, it
                    is impossible that they should leave your democracy alone. For they know that
                    none but you will bring freedom back again, and of course they want to destroy
                    the source from which they are expecting ruin to themselves. <milestone

                    enemies of those only whom they have wronged, but when men overthrow free
                    constitutions and change them to oligarchies, I urge you to regard them as the
                    common enemies of all who love freedom. <milestone unit="section" n="21"/>Then
                    again, Athenians, it is right that you, living under a democracy, should show
                    the same sympathy for democracies in distress as you would expect others to show
                    for you, if ever&mdash;which God forbid!-you were in the same plight. Even
                    if anyone is prepared to say that the Rhodians are served right, this is not the
                    time to exult over them, for prosperous communities ought always to show
                    themselves ready to consult the best interests of the unfortunate, remembering
                    that the future is hidden from all men's eyes. <milestone unit="section" n="22"

                    seeing them masters of land and sea, did not hesitate or fear to show their
                    goodwill to you, but actually carried a decree that the envoys, who, we are

                    pleaded that they had often been defeated by the Lacedaemonians, but you have
                    beaten the King again and again, and have never been beaten either by his slaves
                    or by their master himself; for if ever the King has gained some slight
                    advantage over our city, he has done it by bribing the most worthless of the
                    Greeks, the traitors to their cause, and never in any other way. <milestone

                    will find him at one and the same time using the Lacedaemonians to cripple our

                    Greeks of those days faced many dangers and won much honor in the field. At any
                    rate, if there is anyone to give advice to either of these powers, there are
                    none, it seems, to profit by his advice. <milestone unit="section" n="28"/>In my
                    opinion it is right to restore the Rhodian democracy; yet even if it were not
                    right, I should feel justified in urging you to restore it, when I observe what
                    these people are doing. Why so? Because, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName>, if every state were bent on doing right, it would be
                    disgraceful if we alone refused; but when the others, without exception, are
                    preparing the means to do wrong, for us alone to make profession of right,
                    without engaging in any enterprise, seems to me not love of right but want of
                    courage. For I notice that all men have their rights conceded to them in
                    proportion to the power at their disposal. <milestone unit="section" n="29"/>I
                    can cite an instance that is familiar to you all. The Greeks have two
                        treaties<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">The first is probably the so-called
                        peace of Callias about 448; the second is certainly that of Antalcidas in
                        387.</note> with the King, one made by our city and commended by all; and
                    the later one made by the Lacedaemonians, which is of course condemned by all;
                    and in these two treaties rights are diversely defined. Of private rights within
                    a state, the laws of that state grant an equal and impartial share to all, weak
                    and strong alike; but the international rights of Greek states are defined by
                    the strong for the weak. <milestone unit="section" n="30"/><milestone
                        unit="para" ed="P"/>Now, as you have already made up your minds to do right,
                    you must take care that it is in your power to carry out your purpose; and it
                    will be in your power, if you are accepted as the common champions of Greek
                    liberty. But, inevitably, I think, it is very difficult for you to do all that
                    is required. All other states have only their open enemies to contend with, and
                    if they can beat them, there is nothing to hinder them from enjoying their
                    advantage; <milestone unit="section" n="31"/>but you, Athenians, have two
                    struggles before you; one is the same that awaits the rest, but there is another
                    and more serious struggle that comes before it, for you have got to defeat in
                    your debates the faction that deliberately opposes the interests of your city.
                    When, therefore, owing to this opposition, you can get nothing done without a
                    struggle, the natural consequence is that you miss many advantages. <milestone

                    recklessly take up this position, perhaps the pay they receive from their
                    employers is chiefly responsible, but nevertheless you too must bear some of the
                    blame. For you ought to have the same feeling about the post a man occupies in
                    politics as about the post he occupies in war. What feeling do I refer to? You
                    consider that the man who deserts the post where his general has stationed him
                    deserves to be disfranchised and deprived of his share in our common privileges.

                    principles, abandon the post taken over by us from our ancestors, ought to be
                    disqualified from ever giving you advice. As it is, you consider that those
                    allies are most devoted to you who have sworn to regard your friends and your
                    enemies as their own, but where politicians are concerned, you take as your most
                    trusted advisers the men who, to your certain knowledge, have thrown in their

                    accusation against these politicians or of reproach against the rest of you, but
                    our real task is to find by what arguments and by what course of action our
                    present faults may be amended. Perhaps it does not suit the present occasion to
                    deal with every side of the question, but if you can by some fitting action give
                    effect to the policy you have adopted, then there might possibly be, step by

                    that you ought to grapple with these problems vigorously and act as becomes

                    describing their exploits and enumerating their trophies. Reflect, then, that
                    your ancestors set up those trophies, not that you may gaze at them in wonder,
                    but that you may also imitate the virtues of the men who set them up.</p>

                    all things to find out what is right and then do it, though at the same time we

                    recovery of Oropus is something that we ought to attempt, but that if we make
                    enemies of those who would have helped us to recover it, we shall have no
                    allies. I too think that we ought to recover Oropus, but to say that the
                    Lacedaemonians will be our enemies as soon as we make allies of those Arcadians
                    who are willing to be our friends&mdash;I think the only men who have no
                    right even to suggest that are the men who persuaded you to help the
                    Lacedaemonians in their hour of danger. <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>For
                    when all the Peloponnesians came to you and called on you to lead them against
                    the Lacedaemonians, it was not by such arguments that these men persuaded you
                    not to receive them&mdash;&lpar;and that was why they took the only
                    remaining course of applying to the Thebans&rpar;&mdash;but to
                    contribute funds and risk your lives for the safety of the Lacedaemonians. Yet
                    you would surely never have consented to save them, if they had announced to you
                    that when saved they would owe you no thanks for your help, unless you allowed
                    them as before to commit whatever act of injustice they chose. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="13"/>Moreover, even if our alliance with the Arcadians is
                    a serious impediment to the designs of the Lacedaemonians, yet surely they ought
                    to be more grateful for the safety that we won for them, when they were in the
                    gravest peril, than angry because of the wrongs that they are now prevented from
                    committing. How, then, can they refuse to help us at Oropus without proving
                    themselves the basest of mankind? By heavens! I see no escape for them.

                    is another argument that astonishes me; that if we make an alliance with the
                    Arcadians and act upon it, our city will seem to be changing its policy and
                    breaking faith. For to me, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"

                    Because I do not think any one man would deny that <placeName

                    what is that? To save the victims of injustice. If, then, this is so, it is not
                    we who are inconsistent, but those who refuse to abide by the principles of
                    justice; and it will be manifest that the circumstances are always changing,
                    through the policy of ambitious men, but our city changes not. <milestone

                    Lacedaemonians seems to me to be very sharp practice. For they now say that

                    Triphylia, and Phlius the district of Tricaranum, and certain Arcadian tribes

                    want to see each of us enjoying our own, far from it&mdash;&lpar;that
                    would be a tardy exhibition of philanthropy&rpar;&mdash; <milestone
                        unit="section" n="17"/>but they want it to be generally supposed that they
                    are co-operating with each state to recover the territory that it claims, so
                    that when they march against <placeName key="perseus,Messene"
                        >Messene</placeName> on their own account, all the others will join heartily
                    in the expedition, or else will put themselves in the wrong by making no
                    adequate return for the support they have enjoyed in regaining what each state
                    claimed as its own. <milestone unit="section" n="18"/>But my own impression is
                    that, in the first place, without subjecting any of the Arcadians to <placeName
                        key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, our city may recover Oropus with
                    the help both of the Lacedaemonians, if they choose to act justly, and of all
                    who think they ought not to let the Thebans keep other people's property. But
                    supposing, on the other hand, it should become clear to us that unless we let
                    the Lacedaemonians subdue the whole of the <placeName key="tgn,7017076"
                        >Peloponnese</placeName>, we shall not be able to take Oropus, then I think
                    it the better policy, if I may say so, to let Oropus go, rather than sacrifice
                        <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName> and the rest of the

                    these now the count of an indictment, but when they want to become friends and
                    make you some reparation, to look askance at them and devise means of preventing

                    think that most of you will agree with me, that if the Lacedaemonians take

                    abandon them now, only to rescue the Thebans in the end, and to be kept moreover

                    once more, seeing as I do that even now they have not taken up arms to avenge an

                    was in the day of their power, you know perhaps better than I, and will distrust

                    these speakers, my own view is this. I say that we must at the same time call
                    upon them to destroy the pillars and upon the Lacedaemonians to keep the peace.
                    If they refuse&mdash;whichever of the two it may be&mdash;then at once

                <head>On the Treaty with Alexander</head>
                <p>
                    <milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Our hearty
                    assent, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, is due to
                    those who insist that we should abide by our oaths and covenants, provided that
                    they do so from conviction; for I believe that nothing becomes a democratic
                    people more than zeal for equity and justice. Those, therefore, who are so
                    emphatic in urging you to this course should not keep wearying you with speeches
                    which are belied by their practice, but after submitting now to full inquiry,
                    should either for the future be sure of your assent in these matters, or else
                    make way for the counsels of those who show a truer conception of what is just,
                        <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>so that you may either voluntarily submit
                    to wrong, making the wrongdoer a free gift of your submission, or having
                    definitely resolved to put justice before all other claims, may pursue your own
                    interests, clear from all reproach, without further hesitation. But from the
                    very terms of the compact and from the oaths which ratified the general peace,
                    you may at once see who are its transgressors; and that those transgressions are
                    serious, I will prove to you concisely. <milestone unit="section" n="3"
                        /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now if you were asked, men of <placeName
                        key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, what form of compulsion would most
                    rouse your indignation, I think that if the sons of Pisistratus<note
                        anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Hippias and his family were driven from
                            <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> by the help of the
                        Spartans in 510.</note> had been alive at the present time and someone tried
                    to compel you to restore them, you would snatch up your weapons and brave any
                    danger rather than receive them back, or if you did consent, you would be
                    slaves, as surely as if you had been bought for money; nay, more so, inasmuch as
                    no one would intentionally kill his own servant, but the victims of tyranny may
                    be seen executed without trial, as well as outraged in the persons of their
                    wives and children. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Therefore when Alexander,
                    contrary to the oaths and the compacts as set forth in the general peace,
                    restored those tyrants, the sons of Philiades,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb"
                        >Tyrant of <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName> in the time
                        of Philip. His sons, Neon and Thrasymachus, were expelled but restored by
                        Alexander. Polybius, himself an Arcadian, born a century and a half later,
                        enters a vigorous protest against Demosthenes' condemnation of these and
                        other &ldquo;traitors&rdquo; in <bibl n="Dem. 18.295">Dem.
                            18.295</bibl>, and claims that they had rendered valuable service in
                        freeing the Peloponnesian states from the yoke of <placeName
                            key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> and ensuring their prosperity
                        under the aegis of <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>
                            &lpar;<bibl n="Plb. 17.14">Polybius 17.14</bibl>.&rpar;.</note>
                    to <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName>, had he any regard for
                    justice? Did he not rather give play to his own tyrannical disposition, showing
                    little regard for you and the joint agreement? <milestone unit="section" n="5"
                    />It is surely wrong that you should be highly indignant when you are the
                    victims of such coercion, but should neglect all safeguards if it is employed
                    somewhere else, contrary to the sworn agreement with you, and that we here at
                        <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> should be urged by
                    certain speakers to abide by the oaths, while they grant this liberty of action
                    to the men who have so notoriously made those oaths of no effect. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="6"/>But this can never happen, if you are willing to see
                    justice done; for it is further stipulated in the compact that anyone who acts
                    as Alexander has acted shall be the enemy of all the other parties to the
                    compact, and his country shall be hostile territory, and all the parties shall
                    unite in a campaign against him. So if we carry out the agreement, we shall
                    treat the restorer of the tyrants as an enemy. <milestone unit="section" n="7"
                        /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But these champions of tyranny might urge
                    that the sons of Philiades were tyrants of <placeName key="perseus,Messene"
                        >Messene</placeName> before the compact was made, and that that was why
                    Alexander restored them. But it is a ridiculous principle to expel the Lesbian
                    tyrants on the ground that their rule is an outrage&mdash;I mean the tyrants
                    of <placeName key="perseus,Antissa">Antissa</placeName> and Eresus, who
                    established themselves before the agreement&mdash;and yet to imagine that it
                    is a matter of indifference at <placeName key="perseus,Messene"
                        >Messene</placeName>, where the same harsh system prevails. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="8"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Again, the compact at
                    the very beginning enjoins that the Greeks shall be free and independent. Is it
                    not, then, the height of absurdity that the clause about freedom should stand
                    first in the compact, and that one who has enslaved others should be supposed
                    not to have acted contrary to the joint agreement? Therefore, men of <placeName
                        key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, if we are going to abide by our
                    oaths and covenants and do what is just &lpar;for it is to this that these
                    speakers, as I have said, are urging you&rpar;, it is our bounden duty to
                    seize our arms and take the field against the transgressors with all who will
                    join us. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Or do you think that opportunity
                    sometimes so prevails that men pursue expediency even apart from
                    justice&mdash;and yet now, when justice and opportunity and expediency all
                    concur, will you actually wait for some other season to claim your liberties and
                    the liberties of all the Greeks? <milestone unit="section" n="10"/><milestone
                        unit="para" ed="P"/>I come to another claim sanctioned by the compact. For
                    the actual words are, &ldquo;If any of the parties shall overthrow the
                    constitution established in the several states at the date when they took the
                    oaths to observe the peace, they shall be treated as enemies by all the parties
                    to the peace.&rdquo; But just reflect, men of <placeName
                        key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, that the Achaeans in the <placeName
                        key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName> enjoyed democratic government, and
                    one of their democracies, that of <placeName key="perseus,Pellene"
                        >Pellene</placeName>, has now been overthrown by the Macedonian king, who
                    has expelled the majority of the citizens, given their property to their slaves,
                    and set up Chaeron, the wrestler, as their tyrant. <milestone unit="section"
                        n="11"/>But we ourselves are parties to the peace, which instructs us to
                    treat as enemies those who are guilty of such acts. Now in view of this, are we
                    to obey these joint instructions and treat them as enemies, or will anyone be
                        blackguard<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">This is one of the words which
                        Libanius thought more the style of Hyperides than of Demosthenes.</note>
                    enough to say no&mdash;one of the hirelings in the pay of the Macedonian
                    king, one of those who have grown rich at your expense? <milestone
                        unit="section" n="12"/>For you may be sure they are not ignorant of these
                    facts; but they have grown so insolent, with the tyrant's troops for their
                    bodyguard, that they insist on your observing the already violated oaths, as if
                    Alexander's absolute sovereignty extended over perjury also; and they compel you
                    to rescind your own laws, releasing men who have been condemned in your courts
                    and forcing you to sanction numberless other illegalities. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="13"/>And their conduct is natural; for men who have sold
                    themselves to a policy antagonistic to the interests of their country cannot
                    trouble themselves about laws and oaths; they are to them mere terms which they
                    employ to lead astray the citizens who come to the Assembly for diversion and
                    not for careful inquiry, and who forget that present inaction will some day
                    result in wild confusion. <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>My own advice, as I
                    said at the start, is to believe them when they say that we ought to abide by
                    the joint agreement, unless, when they insist on our abiding by the oaths, they
                    interpret them as not forbidding any act of injustice, or imagine that no one
                    will be sensible of the change from democracy to tyranny or of the overthrow of
                    a free constitution. <milestone unit="section" n="15"/><milestone unit="para"
                        ed="P"/>Now for a still greater absurdity. For it is provided in the compact
                    that it shall be the business of the delegates at the Congress and those
                    responsible for public safety to see that in the states that are parties to the
                    peace there shall be no executions and banishments contrary to the laws
                    established in those states, no confiscation of property, no partition of lands,
                    no cancelling of debts, and no emancipation of slaves for purposes of
                    revolution. But these speakers are so far from seeking to prevent any of these
                    evils, that they join in promoting them. And do they not then deserve
                    death&mdash;the men who promote in the various states those terrible
                    calamities which, because they are so serious, this important body has been
                    commissioned to prevent<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">&ldquo;It appears
                        that a standing military force, under Macedonian orders, was provided to
                        enforce observance of the convention; and that the Synod of Deputies was
                        contemplated as likely to meet periodically.&rdquo;&mdash;Grote
                        &lpar;c. 91&rpar;. The subject of<foreign lang="greek"

                    <milestone unit="section" n="16"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I will point
                    out a further breach of the compact. For it is laid down that it shall not be
                    lawful for exiles to set out, bearing arms, from the states which are parties to
                    the peace, with hostile intent against any of the states included in the peace;
                    but if they do, then that city from which they set out shall be excluded from
                    the terms of the treaty. Now the Macedonian king has been so unscrupulous about
                    bearing arms that he has never yet laid them down, but even now goes about
                    bearing arms, as far as is in his power, and more so indeed now than ever,
                    inasmuch as he has reinstated the professional trainer at <placeName
                        key="tgn,7011104">Sicyon</placeName> by an edict, and other exiles
                    elsewhere. <milestone unit="section" n="17"/>Therefore if we are to keep this
                    joint agreement, as these speakers say, the states that are guilty of these
                    offences are excluded from our treaty. If, indeed, we ought to hush the matter
                    up, we must never say that they are the Macedonian states<note anchored="yes"
                        resp="Loeb">i.e. the states under the immediate control of
                    Alexander.</note>; but if the men who are subservient to the Macedonian king
                    against your interests never cease urging us to carry out the joint agreement,
                    let us take them at their word, since their contention is just, and let us, as
                    our oath demands, exclude the guilty parties from the treaty, and form a plan
                    for dealing with men whose temper is so brutally dictatorial, and who are
                    constantly either plotting or acting against us and mocking at the general
                    peace. <milestone unit="section" n="18"/>What, I ask you, can they urge against
                    the correctness of this view? Will they claim that the agreement stands good as
                    against our city, but demur to it where it protects our interests? Does it
                    really seem fair that this should be so? And if there is anything in the treaty
                    that favors our enemies against our city, will they always make the most of it,
                    but if there is anything that tells the other way and is at once just and
                    advantageous to us, will they think that unremitting opposition is their
                    peculiar duty? <milestone unit="section" n="19"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"
                    />But to prove to you still more clearly that no Greeks will accuse you of
                    transgressing any of the terms of the joint agreement, but will even be grateful
                    to you for exposing the real transgressors, I will just touch upon a few of the
                    many points that might be mentioned. For the compact, of course, provides that
                    all the parties to the peace may sail the seas, and that none may hinder them or
                    force a ship of any of them to come to harbor,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb"
                        >See <bibl n="Dem. 5.25">Dem. 5.25</bibl>.</note> and that anyone who
                    violates this shall be treated as an enemy by all the parties to the peace.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="20"/>Now, men of <placeName
                        key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, you have most distinctly seen this
                    done by the Macedonians; for they have grown so arrogant that they forced all
                    our ships coming from the <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Black Sea</placeName> to
                    put in at <placeName key="perseus,Tenedos">Tenedos</placeName>, and under one
                    pretence or another refused to release them until you passed a decree to man and
                    launch a hundred war-galleys instantly, and you put Menestheus in command.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="21"/>Is it not, then, absurd that others should
                    be guilty of so many serious transgressions, but that their friends in
                        <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, instead of restraining
                    the transgressors, should urge us to abide by the terms thus lightly regarded?
                    As if there were a clause added, permitting some to violate them, but forbidding
                    others even to defend their rights! <milestone unit="section" n="22"/>But was
                    not the conduct of the Macedonians as stupid as it was lawless, when they
                    committed such a gross violation of their oaths as deservedly went near to cost
                    them their right to command at sea?<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">The Congress
                        gave Alexander the command of the Greek forces on sea as well as on land. If
                        the Macedonians provoked the Athenians, who provided the greater part of a
                        united Greek fleet, he might lose this command.</note> Even as it is, they
                    have supplied us with this unquestionable claim against them, whenever we choose
                    to press it. For surely their violation of the joint agreement is not lessened
                    because they have now ceased to offend. <milestone unit="section" n="23"/>But
                    they are in luck, because they can make the most of your supineness, which
                    prefers to take no advantage even of your due rights.<milestone unit="para"
                        ed="P"/>The greatest humiliation, however, that we have suffered is that all
                    the other Greeks and barbarians dread your enmity, but these upstarts<note

                    sometimes by persuasion, sometimes by force, as if <placeName

                    activities. <milestone unit="section" n="24"/>Moreover, while they weaken your
                    cause and strengthen that of your enemies, they at the same time admit

                    to refute the charges alleged against me, or to establish my claim to any public

                    disaster, and much distressed by the prolongation of the war, would be compelled
                    to seek the protection of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>,
                    Philip, to forestall such an appeal and coalition, offered peace to you and
                    succor to them. <milestone unit="section" n="20"/>Now what contributed to his
                    success, when he found you ready to fall into his trap almost eagerly, was the
                    baseness, or, if you prefer the term, the stupidity, or both, of the other Greek
                    states. You were fighting a long and incessant war for purposes in which, as the
                    event has proved, they were all concerned, and yet they helped you neither with
                    money, nor with men, nor with anything else; and so, in your just and natural
                    indignation, you readily accepted Philip's suggestion. The peace conceded to him
                    at that time was due to the causes I have named, and not, as Aeschines
                    maliciously insists, to me; and the misdeeds and the corruption of Aeschines and
                    his party during that peace will be found, on any honest inquiry, to be the true
                    cause of our present troubles. <milestone unit="section" n="21"/>These
                    distinctions and explanations I offer merely for the sake of accuracy; for if
                    you should suppose that there was any guilt, or ever so much guilt, in that
                    peace-making business, the suspicion does not concern me. The first man to raise
                    the question of peace in a speech was Aristodemus, the actor, and the man who
                    took up the cue, moved the resolution, and, with Aeschines, became Philip's
                    hired agent, was Philocrates of Hagnus&mdash;your confederate, Aeschines,
                    not mine, though you lie till you are black in the face. Their supporters in the
                    debate were Eubulus and Cephisophon&mdash;on whose motives I have at present
                    nothing to say. I never spoke in favor of the peace. <milestone unit="section"
                        n="22"/>And yet, though the facts are such and demonstrated to be such, he
                    has the amazing impudence to tell you that I am to blame for the terms of peace,
                    and that I stopped the city from arranging the terms in conjunction with a
                    congress of the Greek states. Why, you, you&mdash;but I can find no epithet
                    bad enough for you&mdash;was there any single occasion when you, having
                    observed me in your presence trying to rob the state of a negotiation and of an
                    alliance which you have just described as of the greatest importance, either
                    made any protest, or rose to give the people any information whatsoever about
                    the proceeding which you now denounce? <milestone unit="section" n="23"/>Yet if
                    I had really intrigued with Philip to stop a Panhellenic coalition, it was your
                    business not to hold your peace, but to cry aloud, to protest, to inform the
                    people. You did nothing of the sort. No one ever heard that fine voice of yours.
                    Of course not; for at that time there was no embassy visiting any of the Greek
                    states, but all the states had long ago been sounded, and there is not an honest
                    word in his whole story. <milestone unit="section" n="24"/>Moreover, his
                    falsehoods are the worst of slanders upon <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName>. If at one and the same time you were inviting the
                    Greeks to make war and sending envoys to Philip to negotiate peace, you were
                    playing a part worthy of Eurybatus<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Eurybatus, of
                            <placeName key="tgn,7002499">Ephesus</placeName>, a proverbial knave,

                    impostor, not of a great city or of honest men. But it is false; it is false!
                    For what purpose could you have summoned them at that crisis? For peace? They
                    were all enjoying peace. For war? You were already discussing terms of peace.
                    Therefore it is clear that I did not promote, and was in no way responsible for,
                    the original peace, and that all his other calumnies are equally false.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="25"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now observe
                    what policy we severally adopted after the conclusion of peace. You will thereby
                    ascertain who acted throughout as Philip's agent, and who served your interests
                    and sought the good of the city. I proposed in the Council that the ambassadors
                    should sail without delay to any place where they might learn that Philip was to
                    be found, and there receive from him the oath of ratification; but in spite of
                    my resolution they refused to go. What was the reason of that refusal?
                        <milestone unit="section" n="26"/>I will tell you. It suited Philip's
                    purposes that the interval should be as long, and ours that it should be as
                    short as possible; for you had suspended all your preparations for war, not
                    merely from the day of ratification, but from that on which you first began to
                    expect peace. That was just what Philip was contriving all the time, expecting
                    with good reason that he would hold safely any Athenian possessions which he
                    might seize before the ratification, as no one would break the peace to recover
                    them. <milestone unit="section" n="27"/>Foreseeing that result, and appreciating
                    its importance, I moved that the embassy should repair to the place where they
                    would find Philip and swear him in without delay, in order that the oath might
                    be taken while your allies the Thracians were still holding the places about
                    which Aeschines was so sarcastic&mdash;Serrium, Myrtenum, and
                    Ergisce&mdash;and that Philip might not get control of <placeName
                        key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName> by seizing the positions of advantage
                    and so providing himself amply with men and money for the furtherance of his
                    ulterior designs. <milestone unit="section" n="28"/>That decree Aeschines
                    neither cites nor reads; though he mentions to my discredit that I suggested in
                    Council that the Macedonian ambassadors should be introduced. What ought I to
                    have done? Objected to the introduction of men who had come expressly to confer
                    with you? Ordered the lessee not to give them reserved seats in the theatre? But
                    they could have sat in the threepenny seats, if I had not moved my resolution.
                    Or was it my business to take care of the public pence, and put up the state for
                    sale, like Aeschines and his friends? Surely not. Please take and read this
                    decree, which the prosecutor omitted, though he knows it well. <milestone

                    of those to whom he came as friend. The bonds of amity, he declared, with his
                    most impressive eloquence, are fortified not by words but by community of

                    blind to the future or ensnared by the listlessness and indolence of their daily
                    life; in all the malady had gone so far that they expected the danger to descend
                    anywhere but upon themselves, and even hoped to derive their security at will

                    they were selling everything except themselves, discover too late that their own
                    liberty was the first thing they sold. Instead of the name of trusty friend, in

                    all places in the world, when I was conscious that, from the dawn of her history
                    to the day when I first ascended the tribune, our country had ever striven for
                    primacy, and honor, and renown, and that to serve an honor able ambition and the

                    and supremacy, had endured the loss of his eye, the fracture of his collar-bone,
                    the mutilation of his hand and his leg, and was ready to sacrifice to the
                    fortune of war any and every part of his body, if only the life of the shattered
                    remnant should be a life of honor and renown? <milestone unit="section" n="68"

                    well became you, and forwarded by me in all my proposals, according to the
                    opportunities of my public life. I admit the charge. Tell me; what ought I to
                    have done? I put the question to you, Aeschines, dismissing for the moment

                    Was it, or was it not, right that some man of Grecian race should stand forward
                    to stop those aggressions? <milestone unit="section" n="72"/>If it was not

                    if not on the Athenian democracy? That then was my policy. I saw a man enslaving

                    needy to well-to-do people, and so the duty was always discharged. I also claim
                    credit for the very fact that all the measures I adopted brought renown and
                    distinction and strength to the city, and that no measure of mine was invidious,

                    that, Aeschines&mdash;nor is any other man, though he be one of the nine
                    archons. Is there any law so compact of iniquity and illiberality that, when a
                    man out of sheer generosity has given away his own money, it defrauds him of the
                    gratitude he has earned, drags him before a set of prying informers, and gives
                    them authority to hold an audit of his free donations? There is no such law. If
                    he contradicts me, let him produce the law, and I will be satisfied and hold my
                    peace. <milestone unit="section" n="113"/>But no, the law does not exist, men of

                    pettifogging spite, because, when I was in charge of the theatric fund, I added
                    gifts of my own to that fund, says, &ldquo;<persName><surname>Ctesiphon</surname></persName> gave him a vote of thanks before he had rendered his
                    accounts.&rdquo; Yes, but the vote of thanks did not concern the accounts
                    which I had to render; it was for my own donations, you pettifogger!
                    &ldquo;But you were also a Commissioner of Fortifications.&rdquo; Why,
                    that is how I earned my vote of thanks: I made a present of the money I had
                    spent, and did not charge it to the public account. The account requires an
                    audit and checkers; the benefaction deserves gratitude and formal thanks, and
                    that is the very reason for <persName><surname>Ctesiphon</surname></persName>'s
                    proposition. <milestone unit="section" n="114"/>That this distinction is
                    recognized both in the statutes and in your moral feelings I can prove by many
                    instances. Nausicles, for example, has been repeatedly decorated by you for the
                    money he spent out of his own pocket when serving as military commander. When
                    Diotimus, and on another occasion Charidemus, had made a present of shields,
                    they were crowned. Then there is our friend Neoptolemus, who has received
                    distinctions for donations given by him as Commissioner for sundry public works.
                    It would be quite intolerable that it should either be illegal for a man holding
                    any office to make presents to the government, or that, when he has made them,
                    instead of receiving thanks, he should be subjected to an audit. <milestone

                    without ability and without success, he was vastly distressed both by the
                    campaign and by the privateers; for he could neither export the products of his
                    own country, nor import what he needed for himself. <milestone unit="section"
                        n="146"/>At that time he had no supremacy at sea, nor could he reach

                    in trouble by reason of conditions of locality and of the comparative resources
                    of the two combatants. <milestone unit="section" n="147"/>Now, if he should
                    invite the Thebans or the Thessalians to take up his private quarrel and march
                    against you, he could expect no attention; but if he should espouse their joint
                    grievances and be chosen as their leader, he might hope to succeed by a mixture
                    of deception and persuasion. Very well; he sets to work&mdash;and observe
                    how cleverly he managed it&mdash;to throw the Pylaean Congress into
                    confusion and to implicate the Amphictyonic Council in warfare, feeling certain
                    that they would immediately beg him to deal with the situation. <milestone

                    guard; but, if the operator should be an Athenian, representing his opponents,
                    he conceived that he would easily escape detection. And such was the actual

                    did he manage it? By hiring Aeschines. Nobody, of course, had any inkling;
                    nobody was watching&mdash; according to your usual custom! Aeschines was
                    nominated for the deputation to <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae"
                        >Thermopylae</placeName>; three or four hands were held up, and he was

                    aside and disregarding everything else, addressed himself to the business for
                    which he had taken pay. He concocted a plausible speech about the legendary
                    origin of the consecration of the Cirrhaean territory, and by this narration
                    induced the commissioners, men unversed in oratory and unsuspicious of

                    the land which the Amphissians said they were cultivating because it belonged to
                    them, while Aeschines accused them of intruding on consecrated ground. It is not
                    true that these Locrians w ere meditating any suit against <placeName

                    falsely alleges in excuse. You will find a proof of his falsehood in this
                    argument:&mdash;Of course it was not competent for the Locrians to take
                    proceedings against <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> without
                    serving a summons. Well, who served it? From what office was it issued? Name

                    Aeschines as their trusty guide, the Amphictyons began their tour of the
                    territory; but the Locrians fell upon them, were within an ace of spearing the
                    whole crowd, and did actually seize and carry off the sacred persons of several
                    commissioners. Complaints were promptly laid, and so war against the Amphissians
                    was provoked. At the outset Cottyphus was commander of an army composed of
                    Amphictyons; but some divisions never joined, and those who joined did nothing
                    at all. The persons engaged in the plot, mostly scoundrels of old standing from
                        <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName> and other states, prepared

                    cut a long story short, elected he was on this plea. He lost no time, collected
                    his army, pretended to march to <placeName key="tgn,6001466">Cirrha</placeName>,
                    and then bade the Cirrhaeans and the Locrians alike good-bye and good luck, and
                    seized Elatea. <milestone unit="section" n="153"/>When the Thebans saw the

                        >Athens</placeName> like a torrent from the hills. In fact, the Thebans

                        and Thebans, and the Boeotians as well. They, however, are wiser, and will
                        not submit their policy to your dictation, but take their stand upon
                        self-interest. And now you change your tactics, and send ambassadors with a
                        herald to me, reminding me of our compact and asking for an armistice,
                        though we have done you no wrong. However, after hearing your ambassadors, I
                        accede to your request, and am ready to conclude an armistice, if you will
                        dismiss your evil counsellors, and punish them with suitable degradation.

                    the commanders and ordered the attendance of the trumpeter. The commotion spread
                    through the whole city. At daybreak on the morrow the presidents summoned the
                    Council to the Council House, and the citizens flocked to the place of assembly.
                    Before the Council could introduce the business and prepare the agenda, the
                    whole body of citizens had taken their places on the hill. <milestone

                    formally reported the intelligence they had received, and the courier was
                    introduced. As soon as he had told his tale, the marshal put the question, Who
                    wishes to speak? No one came forward. The marshal repeated his question again
                    and again, but still no one rose to speak, although all the commanders were
                    there, and all the orators, and although the country with her civic voice was
                    calling for the man who should speak for her salvation; for we may justly regard
                    the voice, which the crier raises as the laws direct, as the civic voice of our
                    country. <milestone unit="section" n="171"/>Now had it been the duty of every

                    citizen, would have risen in your places and made your way to the tribune, for
                    that salvation, I am well assured, was the desire of every heart. If that duty
                    had fallen upon the wealthy, the Three Hundred would have risen; if upon those
                    who were alike wealthy and patriotic, the men who thereafter gave those generous
                    donations which signalized at once their wealth and their patriotism. <milestone

                    momentous day was not only for the wealthy patriot but for the man who from
                    first to last had closely watched the sequence of events, and had rightly
                    fathomed the purposes and the desires of Philip; for anyone who had not grasped
                    those purposes, or had not studied them long beforehand, however patriotic and
                    however wealthy he might be, was not the man to appreciate the needs of the

                        n="173"/>On that day, then, the call was manifestly for me. I came forward
                    and addressed you; and I will now ask your careful attention to the speech I
                    then made, for two reasons: first, that you may understand that I, alone among
                    your orators and politicians, did not desert the post of patriotism in the hour
                    of peril, but approved myself as one who in the midst of panic could, both in
                    speech and in suggestion, do what duty bade on your behalf; and secondly,
                    because at the cost of a few minutes of study you may gain experience which will
                    stand you in good stead for your policy in times to come. <milestone

                    &ldquo;In my judgement the present position of affairs is misunderstood by
                    those who are so much alarmed by the apprehension that all <placeName
                        key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> is at the disposal of Philip. If
                    that were true, I am quite certain that we should have heard of him not at
                    Elatea but on our own frontiers. But I know with certainty that he has come to
                    complete his preparations at <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>.
                    Let me tell you how he is situated. <milestone unit="section" n="175"/>He has at
                    his command all those Thebans whom he was able to win by fraud or corruption;
                    but he cannot by any means prevail upon those who have resisted him from the
                    first and who are still his opponents. His present object, and the purpose for
                    which he has occupied Elatea, is that, by an exhibit ion of his power in the
                    neighborhood of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, and by
                    bringing up armed forces, he may encourage and embolden his friends, and overawe
                    his adversaries, hoping that the latter will yield to intimidation or to
                    compulsion and will so concede what at present they refuse. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="176"/>If,&rdquo; I added, &ldquo;at this crisis we
                    are determined to remember all the provocative dealings of the Thebans with us
                    in past time, and to distrust them still on the score of enmity, in the first
                    place, we shall be acting exactly as Philip would beg us to act; and secondly, I
                    am afraid that, if his present opponents give him a favorable reception, and
                    unanimously become Philip's men, both parties will join in an invasion of
                        <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>. If, however, you will
                    listen to my advice, and apply your minds to consideration, but not to captious
                    criticism, of what I lay before you, I believe that you will find my proposals
                    acceptable, and that I shall disperse the perils that overhang our city.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="177"/>Let me then tell you what to do. In the
                    first place, get rid of your present terror; or rather direct it elsewhere, and
                    be as frightened as you will for the Thebans. They lie nearer to peril; the
                    danger threatens them first. Next, let all men of military age, and all the
                    cavalry, march out to <placeName key="perseus,Eleusis">Eleusis</placeName>, and
                    show the world that you are under arms. Then your partisans at <placeName
                        key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> will have equal freedom to speak
                    their minds for righteousness' sake, knowing that, just as the men who have sold
                    their country to Philip are supported by a force at Elatea ready to come to
                    their aid, so also you are in readiness to help men who are willing to fight for
                    independence, and will come to their aid, if they are attacked. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="178"/>In the next place, I would have you appoint ten
                    ambassadors, and give them authority, in consultation with the military
                    commanders, to determine the time of the march to <placeName
                        key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> and the conduct of the campaign. Now
                    for my advice on the treatment of the difficulty after the arrival of the
                    ambassadors at <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>. I beg your
                    careful attention to this. Do not ask any favor of the Thebans: for that the
                    occasion is not creditable. Pledge yourselves to come to their aid at their
                    call, on the ground that they are in extremities, and that we have a clearer
                    foresight of the future than they. And so, if they accept our overtures and take
                    our advice, we shall have accomplished our desires and have acted on a principle
                    worthy of our traditions; while, if success does not fall to our lot, they will
                    have themselves to blame for their immediate blunder, and we shall have done
                    nothing mean or discreditable.&rdquo; <milestone unit="section" n="179"

                    two cities had been dragged by these men into mutual enmity, hatred, and
                    distrust. The decree was made, and the danger that environed the city passed
                    away like a summer cloud. Then was the time therefore for an honest man to

                    and the charlatan, who are indeed in all respects unlike one another. The

                    his followers, to fortune, to the chances of the hour, to every critic of his
                    policy. The charlatan holds his peace when he ought to speak, and then croaks
                    over any untoward result. <milestone unit="section" n="190"/>That then, as I

                    make a large concession. If even now any man can point to a better way, nay, if
                    any policy whatever, save mine, was even praticable, I plead guilty. If anyone
                    has now discerned any course which might have been taken profitably then, I
                    admit that I ought not to have missed it. But if there is none, if there never
                    was any, if to this very day no one is able to name any, what was a statesman to
                    do? Surely to choose the best policy among those that were visible and feasible.

                    but at questions of public policy with due regard to the proud traditions of our

                    their speech, full of eulogy of Philip, and of incrimination of <placeName

                    The gist of the speech was that they were to show gratitude to Philip for every

                    suffered, in whichever of two ways they chose&mdash; either by giving him a

                    as by a flood, you would regard any discussion of them as useless and vexatious.
                    I will only ask you to hear how far we prevailed upon them, and what answer they

                    that, while their own infantry and cavalry lay outside the walls, they gave you
                    access to their homes, to their citadel, to their wives and children and most
                    precious possessions. On that day the Thebans publicly paid three fine
                    compliments&mdash;to your valor, to your righteousness, and to your
                    sobriety. When they decided to fight on your side rather than against you, they
                    adjudged you to be braver men than Philip, and your claim to be more righteous
                    than his; and when they put into your power what they, like all other men, were
                    most anxious to safeguard, namely their wives and their children, they exhibited

                    ever laid even a groundless complaint against them, so soberly did you conduct

                    the praises of other nations, and was acknowledged by yourselves in services of

                    ask Aeschines a question: when all that was going on, when the whole city was a

                    worship and festivity of the populace, or did he sit still at home, grieving and
                    groaning and sulking over public successes? If he was present as one of the
                    throng, surely his behavior is scandalous and even sacrilegious, for after
                    calling the gods to witness that certain measures were very good, he now asks a
                    jury to vote that they were very bad&mdash;a jury that has sworn by the
                    gods! If he was not present, he deserves many deaths for shrinking from a sight
                    in which every one else rejoiced. Please read these decrees.<quote

                    Aeschines and his party, seemed on the verge of suing for aid, was now giving
                    aid in pursuance of the advice which you accepted from me. But indeed, what sort
                    of language Philip gave vent to at that time, and how seriously he was

                    no one of them ever devoted himself to any public business without intermission;
                    the man who moved a resolution would not go on embassy, and the man who went on
                    embassy would not move a resolution. Each of them used to leave himself some
                    leisure, and at the same time some loop-hole, in case anything happened.

                    it did not seem to me to leave me any room for taking my personal safety into

                    prosecution in such cases, and so forth; whereas at that time the issue would

                    All speeches must have been made on a basis of truth, within a short time of the

                    That is why, after shirking inquiry at the time when the events were recent, he
                    has returned to the issue today, expecting, I suppose, that you will conduct a
                    forensic competition rather than an inquiry into political conduct, and that the

                    and his party had made all our neighbors, Megarians, Thebans, and Euboeans, more
                    disposed to enmity than to friendship. <milestone unit="section" n="235"/>Such
                    were the means of the city: and I defy anyone to name anything else. Now
                    consider those of our antagonist Philip. In the first place, he was the despotic
                    commander of his adherents: and in war that is the most important of all
                    advantages. Secondly, they had their weapons constantly in their hands. Then he
                    was well provided with money: he did whatever he chose, without giving notice by
                    publishing decrees, or deliberating in public, without fear of prosecution by
                    informers or indictment for illegal measures. He was responsible to nobody: he
                    was the absolute autocrat, commander, and master of everybody and everything.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="236"/>And I, his chosen adversary&mdash;it
                    is a fair inquiry&mdash;of what was I master? Of nothing at all! Public
                    speaking was my only privilege: and that you permitted to Philip's hired
                    servants on the same terms as to me. Whenever they had the advantage of
                    me&mdash;and for one reason or another that often happened&mdash;you
                    laid your plans for the enemy's benefit, and went your ways. <milestone

                    Corcyraeans: and from those states there was assembled a foreign division of
                    fifteen thousand infantry and two thousand cavalry, not counting their
                    citizen-soldiery. I also obtained from them in money the largest subsidy I

                    dissatisfaction. That would have been discreditable indeed! No, she gave thanks
                    to the gods that, when all the Greeks alike were encompassed by a great peril,

                    authority over your forces, and therefore no question of their performances can
                    touch me. Moreover, in the matter of corruption or purity I have beaten Philip.
                    In bribery, just as the purchaser has vanquished the seller, whenever the

                    Immediately after the battle, in the very midst of danger and alarm, at a time
                    when it would not have been surprising if most of you had treated me unkindly,
                    the people, with a full knowledge of all my doings, in the first place, adopted
                    by vote my proposals for the safety of the city. All those measures of
                    defence&mdash;the disposition of outposts, the entrenchments, the
                    expenditure on the fortifications&mdash;were taken on resolutions moved by
                    me. In the second place, they appointed me Food Controller, selecting me from
                    the whole body of citizens. <milestone unit="section" n="249"/>Then the men who
                    made it their business to injure me formed a cabal, and set in motion all the
                    machinery of indictments, audits, impeachments, and the like&mdash;not at
                    first by their own agency, but employing persons by whom they imagined they
                    would be screened. You will remember how, during that early period, I was put on
                    my trial every day; and how the recklessness of Sosicles, and the spite of
                    Philocrates, and the frenzy of Diondas and Melantus, and everything else, were
                    turned to account by them for my detriment. Nevertheless, by the favor, first of
                    the gods, and secondly of you and the rest of the Athenians, I came through
                    unscathed. And so I deserved. Yes; that is true, and to the credit of juries
                    that had taken the oath and gave judgement according to their oath. <milestone

                    and my speeches had been constitutional. When you put the seal on my accounts,
                    you further admitted that I had done my business honestly and without

                    for any human being to reproach his brother man on the score of fortune. Seeing
                    that a man who thinks he is doing very well and regards himself as highly
                    fortunate, is never certain that his good fortune will last till the evening,
                    how can it be right to boast about it, or use it to insult other people? But,
                    since Aeschines has treated this topic, like many others, so vaingloriously, I
                    beg you to observe, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>,
                    that my discourse on fortune will be more veracious, and more suitable to a mere

                    everything has not fallen out as we desired, I regard that as our appointed

                    compelled by this troublesome man's scurrility and backbiting to deal with these
                    topics; and I will treat them with as much modesty as the state of the case

                    disreputable occupations. When I had come of age, my circumstances were in
                    accordance with my upbringing. I was in a position to provide a chorus, to pay
                    for a war-galley, and to be assessed to property-tax. I renounced no honor able
                    ambition either in public or in private life: and rendered good service both to
                    the commonwealth and to my own friends. When I decided to take part in public
                    affairs, the political services I chose were such that I was repeatedly

                    first blow with epithets that are really applicable to himself, they must be
                    true, and the audience will make no reflections on the character of the speaker.

                    an audience controls the ability of a speaker, and that his reputation for

                    detriment of anyone who has annoyed or quarrelled with him. He never uses it

                    exclude them from his heart: if he cannot escape them, he will at least cherish

                    that they do not remember the harangues you made while the war was still going

                    confessed, or rather claimed, that you were Philip's friend and Philip's
                    guest&mdash;a euphemism for Philip's hired servant; for with what show of
                    equality or honesty could Philip possibly be the host or the friend or even the

                    And yet you were certainly not without means, for you had inherited more than
                    five talents from the estate of your father-in-law Philo, and you had a present

                    comparison with my predecessors? Heaven forbid! No, Aeschines; that is unfair

                    services that are now being rendered to the present age should be treated with
                    ingratitude and vituperation, or that every man who achieves anything in a

                    spirit of justice and to the oath which you severally swore when you entered
                    that box. You will reflect that justice and the oath concern yourselves and the
                    commonwealth, whereas the importunity and party spirit of advocates serve the
                    end of those private ambitions which you are convened by the laws to thwart, not

                    life with honest intentions, even after they have submitted to scrutiny, do
                    still acknowledge a perpetual responsibility. But Aeschines, the defendant,
                    reverses this practice. Before coming into court to justify his proceedings, he
                    has put out of the way one of the men who called him to account, and the others
                    he is constantly threatening. So he is trying to introduce into politics a most
                    dangerous and deplorable practice; for if a man who has undertaken and
                    administered any public function can get rid of accusers not by his honesty but
                    by the fear he inspires, the people will soon lose all control of public
                    affairs. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>While I
                    have entire confidence that I shall prove that this man is guilty of serious
                    delinquencies, and that he deserves the most severe punishment, yet, in spite of
                    that assurance, I have a misgiving, which I will explain to you quite frankly.
                    It appears to me, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>,
                    that the trials which come before you are affected quite as much by the
                    conditions of the hour as by the facts; and I am afraid that the long lapse of
                    time since the embassy has inclined you to forget or to acquiesce in these
                    iniquities. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>I will, then, suggest a method by
                    which you may nevertheless reach a just conclusion and give a righteous verdict
                    today. By consideration among yourselves, gentlemen, you should form a true
                    conception of what should be included in the vindication which the state
                    requires of any ambassador. He is responsible then, in the first place, for the
                    reports he has made; secondly, for the advice he has offered; thirdly, for his
                    observance of your instructions; then there is the question of times and
                    opportunities; and, to crown all, whether he has done his business corruptly or
                    with integrity. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Why are these the topics of
                    inquiry? Your conclusions are derived from the ambassador's reports: you reach a
                    right decision if they are true, a wrong decision if they are false. The advice
                    of ambassadors you regard as the more trustworthy because it is given by men who
                    presumably understand their own mission. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>No
                    ambassador, then, ought ever to be convicted of defective or mischievous
                    counsels. Thirdly, when he has been expressly instructed what to say and what to
                    do by resolution of the Assembly, it is his duty to conduct his business
                    according to such instructions. Very well; but how does the question of time
                    arise? Because, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, in
                    important transactions opportunities are often short-lived: once willfully
                    surrendered and betrayed to the enemy, they cannot be recovered, do what you
                    will. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Next, as for the question of bribery or
                    no bribery, of course you are agreed that it is a scandalous and abominable
                    offence to accept money for acts injurious to the commonwealth. The author of
                    the statute, however, made no such distinction; he forbade the acceptance of
                    rewards absolutely, holding, as I suppose, that the man who takes them and is
                    thereby corrupted can no longer be trusted by the state as a judge of sound
                    policy. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>If, then, I can establish by clear
                    proofs that the reports of the defendant, Aeschines, were entirely untruthful,
                    and that he prevented the Assembly from hearing the truth from me; that his
                    counsels were totally opposed to your true interests; that he disobeyed all your
                    instructions when on embassy; that by his waste of time many important
                    opportunities were lost to the city; and finally that for all these
                    delinquencies he, as well as Philocrates, accepted presents and rewards;
                    pronounce him guilty and exact a penalty adequate to his crimes. But if I fail
                    to prove all these five charges, or any one of them, then call me an impostor,
                    and acquit him. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"

                    remember,&mdash;of the party with which Aeschines at first ranged himself in
                    politics, and of the speeches which he thought fit to make in opposition to
                    Philip. In this way I hope to satisfy you that his early acts and speeches

                    peace with Philip. He was chosen, not as one who would make traffic of your
                    interests, not as one who had any confidence in Philip, but as one of the party
                    that was to keep an eye on the rest, for in view of his early speeches, and of
                    his known hostility to Philip, it was natural that you should all have such an
                    opinion of the man. <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>Then he came to me and
                    proposed that we should act together on the embassy, being especially urgent
                    that we should jointly keep watch upon that infamous scoundrel Philocrates. And
                    until after our return from the first embassy I at least, men of <placeName
                        key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, had no suspicion that he was
                    corrupt and had already sold himself. For apart from the speeches which, as I
                    said, he had made on former occasions, he rose at the first of the two
                    assemblies at which you discussed terms of peace, and began with an exordium
                    which I believe I can repeat to you in the very words he used: <milestone
                        unit="section" n="14"/>&ldquo;If Philocrates, men of <placeName
                        key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, had given many days to studying how
                    best he could thwart the peace, I do not think he could have found a better way
                    than the present proposal. Such a peace as this I for one will never advise the
                    city to make, so long as a single Athenian remains alive; yet I do say that we
                    ought to make peace.&rdquo; In such terms he spoke, concisely and with
                    moderation. <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>And then on the next day, when the
                    peace was to be ratified, when I supported the resolutions of our allies, and
                    did what I could to secure fair and equitable terms, and when the people
                    sympathized with my purpose and refused to hear a word from the contemptible
                    Philocrates, up jumped the very man who had made the speech I have quoted in the
                    head of all of you only the day before, and addressed you in support of
                    Philocrates, <milestone unit="section" n="16"/>using language for which, as
                    Heaven is my witness, he deserves to die many times over. He told you that you
                    ought to forget the achievements of your forefathers; that you should not
                    tolerate all that talk about old trophies and sea-fights; and that he would
                    draft and enact a law forbidding aid to any Greeks who had not previously
                    brought aid to you. This speech the shameless reprobate found courage to make
                    while the ambassadors, whom you summoned from the Greek cities at his own
                    suggestion, before he had sold himself, were standing at his elbow and listening
                    to what he said. <milestone unit="part" n="Narr"/><milestone unit="section"
                        n="17"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Well, you appointed him a second
                    time, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, as an envoy to
                    receive the oath of ratification; and I shall shortly have to tell you how he
                    again wasted time, mishandled all the affairs of the commonwealth, and
                    repeatedly fell out with me in regard to them when I tried to stand in his way.
                    However, by reason of the persistent misconduct of these men, and their
                    disobedience to instructions, we came back from the embassy for the
                    oaths&mdash;that is the embassy which is the subject of the present
                    scrutiny&mdash;without having realized any single one, great or small, of
                    the advantages which were promised or expected when you approved the
                    peace,&mdash;with nothing but deception and disappointment. Then we repaired
                    to the Council. There are many eye-witnesses of what I am about to relate, for
                    the Council-house was thronged with spectators. <milestone unit="section" n="18"
                    />I came forward and reported the whole truth to the Council. I denounced these
                    men, and told the whole story, point by point, beginning with those earlier
                    hopes created by the reports of <placeName key="tgn,6001610"
                        >Ctesiphon</placeName> and Aristodemus, going on to the more recent orations
                    of Aeschines at the approval of the peace, and showing to what straits they had
                    reduced the city. There remained the question of the Phocians and <placeName
                        key="perseus,Thermopylae">Thermopylae</placeName>, and we must
                    not&mdash;such was my advice&mdash;we must not repeat our experience,
                    and throw them overboard, and so, in reliance upon a succession of idle hopes
                    and assurances, allow ourselves to fall into the last extremity of disaster. I
                    convinced the Council; <milestone unit="section" n="19"/>but when the Assembly
                    met, and we had to address the whole body of citizens, Aeschines took the first
                    turn of all of us. And here I most earnestly entreat you to verify my account by
                    your own recollections; for I am now relating transactions which ultimately
                    brought your affairs to complete and final ruin. He utterly ignored the duty of
                    giving a report of the doings of the embassy. He never mentioned the speeches
                    made to the Council, or told you whether he disputed the truth of my statement.
                    But he made such a fine speech, so full of big promises, that he carried you all
                    away with him. <milestone unit="section" n="20"/>For he declared that he had
                    completely converted Philip to the interests of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName> in respect of the Amphictyonic question and of
                    everything else. He went through a long diatribe against the Thebans, which he
                    said he had addressed to Philip himself, recapitulating the main points. He
                    offered you a calculation that, thanks to his diplomacy, without leaving your
                    homes, without any campaigning or worry, within two or three days you would hear
                    the news of the beleaguerment of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes"
                        >Thebes</placeName>, independently of the rest of <placeName
                        key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName>, <milestone unit="section" n="21"/>of
                    the repopulation of <placeName key="tgn,5004258">Thespiae</placeName> and
                        <placeName key="perseus,Plataea">Plataea</placeName>, and of the recovery of
                    Apollo's treasure, not from the Phocians, but from the Thebans, who had planned
                    the seizure of the temple. It was himself, he added, who had instructed Philip
                    that those who contrived the project were quite as sacrilegious as the men by
                    whose hands it was executed; and therefore the Thebans had set a price on his
                    head! <milestone unit="section" n="22"/>He had even heard some Euboeans, who
                    were thoroughly frightened by the friendship that had been cemented between
                    Philip and <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, utter these very
                    words: &ldquo;Gentlemen of the Embassy, we know all about the terms on which
                    you have concluded peace with Philip, and we are aware that you have given up
                        <placeName key="perseus,Amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName> to him, and that
                    he has agreed to hand over <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName> to
                    you.&rdquo; He had also, he said, settled another matter, but he thought it
                    better not to mention it just yet&mdash;some of his colleagues were already
                    so jealous of him. This was a veiled allusion to Oropus. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="23"/>And so, in all the glory of these disclosures, with
                    everybody regarding him as a grand speaker and a marvellous man, he descended
                    from the tribune in his most majestic manner. Then I rose, and said that the
                    whole story was news to me. I attempted to repeat the statement I had made to
                    the Council; but Aeschines and Philocrates posted themselves one on either side
                    of me&mdash;shouting, interrupting, and finally jeering. You were all
                    laughing; you would not listen to me, and you did not want to believe anything
                    except what Aeschines had reported. <milestone unit="section" n="24"/>And I must
                    say that your feeling was quite natural. For how could anyone, filled with
                    anticipation of those wonderful benefits, be patient of a speaker who told you
                    that you would never get them, and even denounced the conduct of the
                    benefactors? At the moment, I imagine, everything else was thrown into the shade
                    by the hopes and expectations that were suggested to you; contradiction seemed
                    to be mere annoyance and malice; and these great achievements were thought
                    amazingly fine and most beneficial to the commonwealth. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="25"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Why have I begun by
                    reviving these memories and quoting those old speeches? My first and chief
                    object, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, is that, when
                    you hear me relate some performance that seems to you atrocious and incredible,
                    no one may ask in surprise: &ldquo;Then why did you not speak out and give
                    us this information instantly?&rdquo; <milestone unit="section" n="26"/>but
                    that, by recalling the assurances by which on every occasion these men stopped
                    others from getting your attention, and that magnificent promise of Aeschines,
                    you may realize that you have to thank him for this crowning
                    injury,&mdash;that you were precluded from learning the truth promptly and
                    at the proper time, being cheated by hopes and impostures and vain assurances.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="27"/>That, I say, is my first and main purpose
                    in this narration. What is my second purpose? It is one of no less importance. I
                    want you to remind yourselves of that policy of precaution and distrust of
                    Philip which this man deliberately chose when he was still unbribed, and to
                    compare the confidence and friendship that afterwards sprang up so suddenly;
                        <milestone unit="section" n="28"/>and then, if the fair reports he laid
                    before you have really proved true, and if all the results have been fortunate,
                    to admit the view that that friendship was formed for truth's sake and in the
                    best interests of the city; but, if the sequel has given the lie to all his
                    predictions, if it has involved the city in much dishonor and in grievous
                    perils, then be assured that his own sordid greed has prompted this change of
                    front, because he has sold the truth for a bribe. <milestone unit="section"
                        n="29"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Having allowed myself to refer to
                    those old speeches, I wish to relate first of all how these men took the
                    business of the Phocians out of your hands. Gentlemen of the jury, I hope that
                    none of you will regard my charges and accusations as too big for the calibre of
                    the defendant, measuring him against the magnitude of the transactions. Reflect
                    rather that, if any man soever, placed by you in the position he filled, and
                    trusted to deal with the occasions that arose, had taken hire, and had sought to
                    deceive and mislead you as Aeschines did, he would have brought about exactly
                    the same disaster as Aeschines. <milestone unit="section" n="30"/>For though you
                    often employ insignificant men for public business, it does not follow that
                    those affairs are insignificant for which the rest of the world acknowledges our
                    competence. Assuredly not. Again, it was Philip, of course, who really destroyed
                    the Phocians; but these men co-operated. The question on which you are to fix
                    your minds is whether they purposely wasted and threw away any chances that came
                    to the embassy of saving the Phocians. I do not suggest that Aeschines destroyed
                    the Phocians all by himself. How could he? <milestone unit="section" n="31"
                        /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Give me the resolution which the Council
                    adopted on my report, and the evidence of the member who moved it on that
                    occasion. These documents will satisfy you that I did not hold my peace then, to
                    run away from my actions now,&mdash;for I was laying my complaint, and
                    trying to forecast results, at the first opportunity; and also that the Council,
                    not being debarred from hearing the truth from me, did not give these men either
                    a vote of thanks, or an invitation to the public dinner in the Town Hall. We are
                    told that these compliments had never before been withheld from any ambassadors
                    since the foundation of Athens&mdash;not even from Timagoras,<note
                        anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">See Introduction, pp. 241-2.</note> whom the
                    Assembly condemned to death. These men, however, had to go without them.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="32"/>Read first the deposition, and then the
                    resolution, to the jury.<quote type="Deposition">

                    from the Council to the ambassadors to dine in the Town Hall. If Aeschines says
                    that such a thing exists, let him produce and exhibit it, and I will sit down.
                    But no; there is none. Now, if all the envoys acted alike, the Council was right
                    in thanking nobody,&mdash;for we had all in very truth behaved scandalously
                    indeed. But if some acted rightly and others wrongly, the well-conducted, it
                    would seem, must submit to a discourtesy provoked by those who had played the
                    rogue. <milestone unit="section" n="33"/>How then can you find an easy answer to
                    the question, Who was the rogue? Consult your own recollections, and mark who
                    denounced the transactions at the outset. For it is clear that, if the evil-doer
                    could hold his peace, escape immediate detection, and never afterwards allow
                    himself to be called to account, that was good enough for him; whereas the man
                    with a good conscience bethought himself that it would be very hard if by
                    keeping silence he should become a reputed accomplice in scandalous and wicked
                    actions. Well then, it was I who denounced these men from the outset, and none
                    of them denounced me. <milestone unit="section" n="34"/><milestone unit="para"
                        ed="P"/>Well, the Council adopted this resolution. When the Assembly met,
                    Philip was already at <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae"
                        >Thermopylae</placeName>. For that is the beginning of their misdeeds; they
                    had surrendered control to Philip and then,&mdash;although the right course
                    for you was, first to hear the facts, next to decide, and finally to carry out
                    your decision,&mdash;you heard nothing until he was already on the spot, and
                    it was no easy matter to advise you what to do. <milestone unit="section" n="35"
                    />Further, no one read the resolution to the Assembly, and the people never
                    heard it. However, Aeschines rose and delivered that oration which I have
                    already described, about the wonderful advantages he had induced Philip to grant
                    to you, and the price set on his head by the Thebans in consequence; and so,
                    although you were at first alarmed at Philip's approach, and indignant that the
                    ambassadors had given you no warning, you became as mild as lambs, expecting to
                    get all that you desired, and refused to hear a word from me or anyone else.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="36"/>Then the letter from Philip was read. It
                    had been composed by Aeschines without our knowledge, and was in fact a
                    downright, explicit written defence of the errors these men had committed. For
                    it alleges that Philip stopped them when they wanted to visit the towns and
                    receive the oaths, and that he detained them in order that they might help him
                    to reconcile the Halians with the Pharsalians; Philip takes on his own shoulders
                    the burden of all their delinquencies: <milestone unit="section" n="37"/>but of
                    the Phocians and the Thespians, and of all the promises reported to you by
                    Aeschines,&mdash;not a word! The job was not managed in this fashion by mere
                    accident. For derelictions of duty, for which they ought to have been brought to
                    justice, and for their failure to do their work according to your instructions,
                    Philip takes all the blame. He tells you it was his fault,&mdash;and of
                    course you were never likely to have any opportunity of punishing him!
                        <milestone unit="section" n="38"/>On the other hand, all the matters in
                    which he was trying to cheat you and overreach you were left for Aeschines to
                    report by word of mouth, so that you might never have it in your power to

                    Phocians, about the Thebans, about everything that Aeschines
                    reported&mdash;not a scrape of the pen! There is nothing in it that is
                    honest, as you shall see at once. For he tells you that he detained them that
                    they might help him to reconcile the Halians. Well, the reconciliation of the
                    Halians consisted in their being cast out of their homes, and their country
                    devastated. As for the prisoners, this man, who wanted to know what he could do
                    to oblige you, declares that the idea of getting them liberated never entered
                    his head. <milestone unit="section" n="40"/>You know that evidence has already

                    ransom; and therefore, to rob me of a patriotic act, Aeschines persuaded Philip
                    to write these words. Now for the most important point. The man who, in the
                    first letter, which we brought home, wrote these words: &ldquo;I would write
                    more explicitly of the benefits I intend to confer on you, if I were certain

                    know the very thing he promised! Why, he must have known it, unless he was
                    hoodwinking us throughout. To prove, however, that he did so write at that time,

                    have been instantly detected, and you might have been informed and spared the

                    Thebans. Yet if Philip's promises were merely for show, and if the city was to
                    be deluded, it was right to mention them; if, on the other hand, they were
                    really to be fulfilled, it was best to say nothing about them. For if the
                    project was so far matured that the Thebans could gain nothing by hearing of it,
                    why has it not been executed? But if it has been thwarted because they had news
                    of it in time, who let the secret out? <milestone unit="section" n="43"
                    />Aeschines? Oh no; it was never meant to come off, and he neither wanted it nor
                    expected it; let him be quit of the imputation of blabbing! The truth is that
                    his purpose required that you should be hoodwinked by that talk; that you should
                    refuse to hear the truth from me and should stay at home; and that they should
                    triumphantly carry a decree ensuring the destruction of the Phocians. That is
                    why this tissue of lies was woven; that is why it was made the theme of a
                    popular harangue. <milestone unit="section" n="44"/><milestone unit="para"
                        ed="P"/>Now when I heard him making all these fine promises, and knew to a
                    certainty that he was lying,&mdash;but let me tell you why I knew. First,
                    because, when Philip was on the point of swearing the oath of ratification, the
                    Phocians were expressly excluded from the treaty by these men and that exclusion
                    should have been passed over in silence, if the Phocians were to be
                        delivered;<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">The clause excluding the Phocians
                        from the benefit of the peace had been rescinded by the Assembly
                        &lpar;See <bibl n="Dem. 19.159">Dem. 19.159</bibl>&rpar;. Aeschines
                        and his friends were therefore acting ultra vires in restoring the clause,
                        when they administered the oath. Had they been really convinced that Philip
                        intended to spare the Phocians, they would have retained the more general
                        phrase,&ldquo;the Athenians and their allies.&rdquo; It is more
                        probable that Philip himself insisted on excluding the Phocians, and the
                        ambassadors were as powerless as the Roman senators before Alaric.</note>
                    and secondly because none of the ambassadors from Philip, nor Philip's own
                    letter, but only Aeschines, mentioned the promises. <milestone unit="section"
                        n="45"/>So drawing my conclusions, I rose and presented myself, and made an
                    attempt to reply. When you refused me a hearing, I held my peace, except that I
                    protested&mdash;and I entreat that you will recall this&mdash;that I had
                    no knowledge of the promises, nothing to do with them, and, I added, no faith in
                    them. At the words &ldquo;no faith in them,&rdquo; you became
                    exasperated; and I proceeded: &ldquo;If any of these promises come true, men
                    of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, be sure you give thanks
                    and honors and decorations to these gentlemen; but not to me. If, however,
                    things turn out otherwise, see that it is on them that you vent your wrath. I
                    stand aside.&rdquo; <milestone unit="section" n="46"/>&ldquo;Not
                    now,&rdquo; said Aeschines, interrupting me, &ldquo;do not stand aside
                    now; only do not put in your claim then.&rdquo;
                    &ldquo;Agreed;&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if I do, I shall be in the
                    wrong.&rdquo; Then Philocrates rose, and said, in a very supercilious
                    manner: &ldquo;No wonder Demosthenes and I disagree, men of <placeName
                        key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>. He drinks water; I drink
                    wine.&rdquo; And then you all laughed. <milestone unit="section" n="47"
                        /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now look at the decree, which Philocrates
                    afterwards drafted and handed to the clerk. It sounds well enough to the ear;
                    but if you will take into account the occasion on which it was proposed, and the
                    promises which Aeschines was making at the time, it will be clear that they were
                    simply handing over the Phocians to Philip and the Thebans&mdash;I might
                    almost say, with shackles on their wrists. Read the decree.<quote type="Decree">
                        <title>Decree</title>

                    <milestone unit="section" n="48"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>You observe,
                    men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, how full the decree
                    is of compliments and fine phrases; that it provides that the peace, and also
                    the alliance, made with Philip shall be extended to his posterity; and that
                    thanks are given to Philip for his promise of just dealings. But it was not
                    Philip who had made any promises; so far from promising he says that he does not
                    know what to do to oblige you. <milestone unit="section" n="49"/>It was
                    Aeschines who was Philip's spokesman and gave undertakings. Then Philocrates,
                    taking advantage of your ready acceptance of Aeschines' words, inserts in the
                    decree a clause providing that, if the Phocians should not do what was right and
                    give up the temple to the Amphictyonic Council, the Athenian people should send
                    a force to coerce the recalcitrants. <milestone unit="section" n="50"/>And so,
                    men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, as you stayed at home
                    instead of taking the field, as the Lacedaemonians had discerned Philip's
                    treachery and withdrawn, and as no members of the Council were on the spot
                    except the Thessalians and the Thebans, he really has proposed, with the utmost
                    civility, to hand the temple over to them. The wording is, &ldquo;to the
                    Amphictyons;&rdquo; but what Amphictyons? There were none there except
                    Thessalians and Thebans. He makes no such proposal as that the Amphictyonic
                    Council should be convened, or that operations should be suspended until it
                    meets, or that Proxenus should march against the Phocians, or that the Athenians
                    should take the field. <milestone unit="section" n="51"/>Philip, however, did
                    send you two letters of summons. Yes, but not with the intention that you should
                    take the field. That is certain; otherwise he would not have destroyed your
                    opportunity of going out before he summoned you, nor would he have detained me
                    when I wanted to sail home, nor ordered Aeschines to make statements calculated
                    to deter you from going out. No, his object was that you, in the belief that he
                    would do all that you wanted, should make no decree prejudicial to him, and the
                    Phocians might not stand their ground and hold out in reliance upon hopes
                    afforded by you, but might make unconditional surrender to him in sheer
                    desperation. Read Philip's actual letters.<quote type="Letters">

                        late for them to put a force in the field, whether to support Philip or the

                    clearly the duty of these men to exhort you to take the field, and to propose
                    that Proxenus, whom they knew to be in those parts, should at once march to the
                    aid of Philip. Their actual policy was very different. Naturally; for they did
                    not apply their minds to the phrasing of the letter; they were in the secret of
                    the intention with which it was written, and with that intention they concurred
                    and cooperated. <milestone unit="section" n="53"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"
                    />When therefore the Phocians learned your policy from the proceedings of the
                    Assembly, received the decree of Philocrates, and were informed of the report
                    and promises of Aeschines, their ruin was complete. Just consider. There were
                    some men in <placeName key="tgn,4003963">Phocis</placeName>, sensible men, who
                    had no confidence in Philip. They were induced to trust him. Why? Because they
                    conceived that, though Philip had deceived them ten times over, he would never
                    have dared to deceive Athenians and envoys of the Athenian people, that the
                    report of Aeschines was true, and that destruction had overtaken not themselves
                    but the Thebans. <milestone unit="section" n="54"/>There were others who were
                    ready at all hazards to hold out to the end; but even they were mollified by the
                    persuasion that Philip was their friend, and that, if they refused compliance,
                    you, from whom they were expecting succor, would turn against them. A third
                    party supposed that you regretted your treaty of peace with Philip; but they
                    were now informed that you had actually decreed an extension of the treaty to
                    Philip's descendants, and so they abandoned all hope of your assistance. And
                    that is why these men packed all those provisions into one decree. <milestone

                    clearest proof that that destruction was effected in this way by the contrivance
                    of these men, I will submit a reckoning of the dates of the several
                    transactions. If any of the defendants challenges my calculation, let him stand
                    up and speak in the time<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">in the time, etc.: see
                            <bibl n="Dem. 18.139">Dem. 18.139</bibl>.</note> allotted to me. Now the
                    treaty was made on the nineteenth of Elaphebolion, and we were abroad receiving
                    the oaths for three entire months. During the whole of that time the Phocians
                    were safe. <milestone unit="section" n="58"/>We returned from the oath-taking
                    embassy on the thirteenth of Scirophorion, when Philip was already at <placeName
                        key="perseus,Thermopylae">Thermopylae</placeName> and making promises to the
                    Phocians which they were not disposed to believe. The proof of that is that
                    otherwise they would not have resorted to you. Then the Assembly, at which these
                    men brought the whole business to ruin with their lies and cajolery, was held on
                    the sixteenth of Scirophorion. <milestone unit="section" n="59"/>Now I calculate
                    that the news from <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> reached
                    the Phocians on the fourth day after that date, for there were Phocian envoys in
                    the city, and they were interested in knowing what report these men would submit
                    and what decree you would adopt. Therefore the twentieth was the day on which we
                    reckon that the Phocians received the news, that is, the fourth day after the
                    sixteenth. Then followed the twenty-first, twenty-second, twenty-third; and on
                    the twenty-third the convention was made, and the fortunes of <placeName

                        unit="section" n="60"/>How, then, is this date proved? On the
                    twenty-seventh, when you were holding an assembly at Peiraeus to discuss
                    dockyard business, Dercylus arrived from <placeName key="perseus,Chalcis"
                        >Chalcis</placeName> with the intelligence that Philip had put the whole
                    affair into the hands of the Thebans, and he computed that it was then the
                    fourth day after the convention. Twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five,
                    twenty-six, twenty-seven: that makes it the fourth day. Therefore these dates,

                    then, listen to anything that had been done by Lacedaemonians or Phocians before

                    is clearly evident that the ruin of the Phocians was nothing but a concoction of
                    deceit and artifice. For during the time when Philip was unable to march by
                    reason of the peace, but was already laying his plans, he sent for the
                    Lacedaemonians, promising to do everything for them, so that the Phocians might
                    not, through your agency, secure their help. <milestone unit="section" n="77"

                    had withdrawn, he sent Aeschines as his agent in advance for your deception,
                    lest, when you discovered that he was acting in the interest of the Thebans, he
                    should be involved once more in delays and fighting and waste of time with the
                    Phocians resisting him, and you helping them. In this way he hoped to obtain
                    complete mastery without a struggle. And so it fell out. Aeschines, then, must
                    not escape punishment for deceiving you, merely because Philip deceived the

                    unbroken front, by strongholds of our allies and a broad territory; and you have
                    acquiesced in its devastation. Your former expedition to <placeName

                    insolent disdain of the city and of you all. Philip was resolved from the first
                    to do for the Thebans all that he has done, but Aeschines by the perversions of
                    his report revealed your repugnance, and so intensified both your hostility and
                    Philip's friendliness towards the Thebans. How could the man have treated you

                    subsequently consented to add the words, and to his posterity, but in the hope
                    of marvellous benefits through their agency. Yes, and since then you all

                    Aeschines will eschew a direct reply to the charges alleged, and in his desire
                    to lead you as far as possible away from the facts, he will dilate on the great
                    blessings that peace brings to the world and set against them the evils of war.
                    He will eulogize peace in general terms, and that will be his defence. But all
                    those considerations tell against him. For, if peace, which brings blessings to
                    others, has brought so much vexation and bewilderment to you, what are we to say
                    except that these men with their bribe-taking have perverted to evil a thing in
                    itself excellent? What next? <milestone unit="section" n="89"/>Perhaps he will
                    ask: &ldquo;Do you not retain, and shall you not retain through the peace,
                    three hundred war-galleys with stores and money for them?&rdquo; <milestone
                        unit="para" ed="P"/>In reply to that, you have to reflect that Philip also
                    has greatly strengthened his position owing to the peace, as regards his
                    material resources in arms, in territory, in revenues, which last have increased
                    largely. <milestone unit="section" n="90"/>And so indeed have ours, to some
                    extent. But as to those other resources, of policy and of
                    alliance,&mdash;and it is by them that all nations hold advantages for
                    themselves or for stronger states&mdash;in our case, bartered away by these
                    men, they have perished, or at least deteriorated: his are now formidable and
                    far greater. It is surely unfair that, while Philip, thanks to these men, enjoys
                    extended alliances and increased revenues, the advantages that we should in any
                    case have gained from the peace should be reckoned by them as a set-off against
                    those that they have sold. For our gains are not a compensation for our losses;
                    far from it! No; what we now have would equally have been ours, and what we have
                    not would have been added to us, but for these men. <milestone unit="section"

                    them, they ought not to be visited upon him. On the other hand, if the right
                    policy has been taken by others, it is not fair that their success should save
                    him. Take into account everything to which he contributed; requite him with
                    gratitude, if he deserves it, with resentment, if his conduct provokes
                    resentment. <milestone unit="section" n="92"/>How then will you reach a right
                    conclusion? Do not allow him to make a hotch-potch of the faults of the
                    generals, the war with Philip, the blessings of peace; but consider one thing at
                    a time. For example, we were at war with Philip. True. Does anyone blame
                    Aeschines for that? Does anyone wish to arraign him for the events of the war?
                    Not a single man. Then so far he is acquitted; he need not say a word. A
                    defendant should adduce witnesses and submit proofs on the issues in dispute,
                    not mislead the jury by addressing his defence to points of agreement. You are
                    not to say anything about the war, Aeschines. No one blames you for that.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="93"/>Afterwards certain persons advised us to
                    make peace; we took their advice; we sent ambassadors; and they brought back to

                    conclude peace. Here again no one blames Aeschines. Does anyone allege that he
                    broached the question of peace? Or that he acted wrongly when he brought the
                    delegates here? Not a single man. Then about the mere fact that the city made
                    peace he need not say a word; for that he is not chargeable. <milestone

                    peace should or should not be made&mdash;that question was already
                    decided&mdash;but what sort of peace. Then he contradicted men who spoke
                    honestly, and he supported the mover of a venal resolution, being himself
                    bribed. Afterwards, when appointed to receive the oaths of ratification, he
                    disobeyed every one of your instructions; he brought to ruin allies of ours

                    both in quantity and quality exceed all records of human mendacity before or
                    since. At the outset, until Philip got a hearing on the question of peace,
                    <persName><surname>Ctesiphon</surname></persName> and Aristodemus undertook
                    the first initiation of the imposture, but, when the business was ripe for

                    the peace, if it has no other merit, will enable him to pose as a Friend of

                    true. If any man is really pleased with the peace, let him be grateful to those
                    generals whom everyone denounces. For, had they fought to your satisfaction, you

                    peace to these men and their venality. Put a stop, then, to his eloquence about
                    the peace. Make him address himself to his own performances. Aeschines is not on
                    trial for the peace; the peace is discredited through Aeschines. That is easily
                    proved. Suppose that the peace had been concluded, and that you had not

                    being would the peace have aggrieved? I mean, apart from the consideration that
                    it was not a glorious peace. For that fault Aeschines is indeed partly to blame,
                    as he supported Philocrates. However, in the case supposed, no incurable
                    mischief would have been done. As the case stands, he is answerable for a great

                    ignorant. But if he maliciously accepted money and rewards, and if that is
                    clearly proved from the facts of the case, put him to death if possible, or,
                    failing that, make him a living example to other malefactors. Now consider the

                    spellbound and deluded by Philip's habitual courtesy, he honestly expected him

                        unit="section" n="112"/>For he had told you that Philip would fortify
                        <placeName key="tgn,5004258">Thespiae</placeName> and <placeName
                        key="perseus,Plataea">Plataea</placeName>, would not destroy the Phocians,
                    and would put a stop to the aggressions of the Thebans; but Philip has made the
                    Thebans dangerously strong, he has exterminated the Phocians, and, instead of
                    fortifying <placeName key="tgn,5004258">Thespiae</placeName> and <placeName
                        key="perseus,Plataea">Plataea</placeName>, he has enslaved <placeName

                        >Coronea</placeName> as well. Could contradiction go further? Yet Aeschines
                    offered no opposition; he never opened his lips or made a single objection. That
                    was bad&mdash;but not bad enough for him. He did what no other man in all
                        <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> did&mdash;he spoke in
                    support of the envoys. Even that miscreant Philocrates durst not go so far as
                    that&mdash;only this man Aeschines. When you raised a clamor, and refused to
                    hear him, <milestone unit="section" n="113"/>he came down from the tribune,
                    exclaiming, in order to cut a figure before Philip's ambassadors&mdash;you
                    cannot have forgotten it:&mdash;&ldquo;Plenty of shouters, but very few
                    fighters, when it comes to fighting!&rdquo;&mdash;being himself, I
                    suppose, such a marvellous fighter. O heavens! <milestone unit="section" n="114"
                        /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Here is another point: if we were unable to
                    prove that any one man among the ambassadors received anything, or if that were
                    not as clear as daylight, we might have had recourse to torture<note
                        anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">torture: to get evidence from slaves.</note> or
                    the like. But when Philocrates not only confessed his gains repeatedly in the
                    Assembly, but paraded them before your eyes, dealing in wheat, building houses,
                    boasting that he would go abroad even if you did not appoint him, importing
                    timber, changing his gold openly at the bankers,&mdash;he assuredly cannot
                    deny that he has taken money, after that admission and that display. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="115"/>Think then of a man, who had it in his power to be
                    counted among the innocent, choosing to fall out with them and to be accused as
                    an adherent of Philocrates, merely to let Philocrates make money, while he
                    accepts only the discredit and the peril! Could any human being be so senseless,
                    or so unlucky? No, indeed. You will find here, men of <placeName
                        key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, if you will only look at it in the
                    right way, a strong and sufficient proof that Aeschines did take bribes.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="116"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now look
                    at a recent, but most convincing, proof that he sold himself to Philip. You
                    know, I am sure, that, not long ago, when Hypereides impeached Philocrates, I
                    rose and said that I was dissatisfied with the impeachment in one respect: it
                    implied that all these grave misdemeanors had been committed by Philocrates
                    alone, and not by any of the other nine ambassadors. That, I remarked, was
                    impossible; for by himself Philocrates would have counted for nothing, if he had
                    none of his colleagues to act with him. <milestone unit="section" n="117"
                    />&ldquo;I do not wish,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;either to acquit or to
                    accuse any man; I want the guilt to be detected and the innocent cleared by
                    plain fact. Therefore let any man who chooses stand up and come forward, and
                    declare that he had no part in Philocrates' doings, and does not approve them.
                    Every man who does this,&rdquo; I added, &ldquo;I acquit.&rdquo; No
                    doubt you remember the incident. Well, no one came forward or presented himself.
                    The rest had various excuses: <milestone unit="section" n="118"/>one was not
                    legally accountable; another was not present; a third had a brother-in-law in
                        <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>. Aeschines had no such
                    excuse. The truth is, he has sold himself once for all. Not only has he taken
                    hire for past actions, but it is evident that, if he escapes now, he will
                    henceforward, as against you, be Philip's man; and so, for fear of uttering a
                    single word injurious to Philip, even when you acquit him he does not accept
                    acquittal. He prefers disrepute, prosecution, any punishment this court may
                    inflict rather than to do anything disagreeable to Philip. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="119"/>But why this fellow-feeling? Why this concern for
                    Philocrates? Though all his acts on embassy had been consistent with honor and
                    sound policy, if Philocrates admitted, as he did admit, that he had taken
                    bribes, an incorruptible ambassador would have taken infinite pains to avoid and
                    disavow all association with him. Aeschines has not done so. Is not that a plain
                    argument, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>? Does it not
                    proclaim aloud that he has taken bribes, and that from first to last he went
                    wrong for money's sake,&mdash;not through stupidity, or ignorance, or
                    blundering? <milestone unit="section" n="120"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"
                    />&ldquo;What witness,&rdquo; he will ask, &ldquo;testifies that I
                    have taken bribes?&rdquo; A brilliant argument! Facts, Aeschines, the most
                    credible of all witnesses. You cannot find fault with facts, and say that they
                    are what they are in deference to somebody, or to oblige somebody. They are what
                    your treachery and perversion have made them, and such they appear on
                    examination. But I have another witness besides the facts. You shall this very
                    moment give evidence against yourself. Come here: stand up and answer
                    me!&mdash;Nothing to say? You cannot plead inexperience. You, who take up a
                    new prosecution as easily as you study a new play, and convict your man without
                    witnesses and under a time-limit, you must be an uncommonly clever speaker!<note

                    action I am about to relate, none that will more palpably prove him to have
                    taken bribes and sold everything. When for the third time you sent your
                    ambassadors to Philip, for the fulfilment of those magnificent expectations
                    which Aeschines had guaranteed, you reappointed most of the former envoys,
                    including Aeschines and me. <milestone unit="section" n="122"/>I immediately

                    the dispersal of the Assembly, the envoys met and discussed which of them should

                    extraordinary meeting of the Assembly might suddenly be convened, and that then,
                    on hearing the truth from me, you might adopt some acceptable resolution in
                    favor of the Phocians, and that so Philip might lose control. One friendly
                    resolution, one gleam of hope, and the Phocians might have been saved. If you
                    had not fallen into the trap, it was impossible&mdash;yes,
                    impossible&mdash;for Philip to remain at <placeName

                    country, as the war had prevented sowing; and the conveyance of corn was
                    impossible so long as your fleet was there and commanded the sea. The Phocian
                    cities were numerous, and not easy of capture, unless by protracted siege. Even
                    if Philip had taken a city a day, there were twenty-two of them. <milestone

                    fearing that you might be undeceived and change your policy. Now to decline an
                    appointment on affidavit with no reason alleged was a strange move and very

                    delegation, Aeschines attended the service of thanksgiving which the Thebans and
                    Philip held to celebrate their victory and their political success, was a guest
                    at the banquet, and took part in the libations and doxologies with which Philip
                    thanked Heaven for the destruction of the fortresses, the territory, and the

                    authors of his aggrandizement? <milestone unit="section" n="135"/>However, I
                    think I can satisfy you that their punishment will more probably sow the seed of
                    a profitable friendship. Let me tell you, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName>, that Philip does not undervalue your city; it was not
                    because he thought you less serviceable that he preferred the Thebans to you.
                    But he was schooled by these men and was informed by them&mdash;I once told
                    you this in Assembly, and none of them contradicted me&mdash; <milestone
                        unit="section" n="136"/>that a democracy is the most unstable and capricious
                    thing in the world, like a restless wave of the sea ruffled by the breeze as
                    chance will have it. One man comes, another goes; no one attends to, or even
                    remembers, the common weal. Philip, they said, ought to have friends at
                        <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, who would manage his
                    business for him as it arose, and carry it through&mdash;the person
                    speaking, for example; if that provision were made, he would easily accomplish
                    here whatever he desired. <milestone unit="section" n="137"/>Now if he had heard
                    that the persons who talked like that to him had been cudgelled to death
                    immediately after their return home, I fancy he would have done what the King of
                        <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName> did. You remember what that
                    was: the King had been inveigled by Timagoras, and had made him a present, as
                    the story goes, of forty talents; but when he heard that the man had been put to
                    death at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, and had not been
                    competent to warrant his own life, much less to fulfil his undertaking, he
                    realized that he had not paid the price to the man who could deliver the goods.
                    The first result was that he again placed in subjection to you the city of
                        <placeName key="perseus,Amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName>, which he had put
                    on his own list of friends and allies; and the second, that he nevermore gave
                    money to anybody. <milestone unit="section" n="138"/>Philip would have done the
                    same if he had seen any of these men brought to justice; and he will do the
                    same, if he sees that sight now. But when he sees these men holding up their
                    heads here, making speeches, bringing other people to trial&mdash;what is he
                    to do? Is he to make a point of spending a great deal of money, when a little
                    will do? Is he to try to humor all of us, instead of two or three? No; that
                    would be folly. For even his policy of public benevolence to the Thebans was by
                    no means of his own choosing; <milestone unit="section" n="139"/>he was
                    persuaded by their ambassadors, and I will tell you how. Ambassadors came to him
                    from <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> at the same time that we
                    were there from you. He offered them money&mdash;a very large sum, by their
                    own account. The Theban ambassadors declined the overture, and would not take
                    the bribe. Afterwards, at a sacrificial banquet, when Philip was drinking with
                    them, and showing them much civility, he kept offering them presents, beginning
                    with captives and the like, and ending with gold and silver goblets. All these
                    gifts they rejected, and would on no account give themselves away. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="140"/>At last Philo, one of the ambassadors, made a speech
                    that deserved to have been spoken by your representatives, men of <placeName
                        key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, instead of by the spokesman of
                        <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>. He said that he was
                    delighted and gratified to find Philip so courteously and generously inclined
                    towards them; that they were already his friends and guests, without those
                    gifts; would he be good enough to direct his benevolence to the public business
                    on which he was engaged, and do something creditable both to himself and to the
                    Thebans? If so, they could promise him the friendship of all <placeName
                        key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> as well as their own. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="141"/>Now consider what the Thebans have gained in the end
                    by this policy, and, in the light of actual truth, see what a fine thing it is
                    to refuse to sell your country! The Thebans have gained, in the first place,
                    peace, when they were in trouble, hard pressed by the war, and in danger of
                    defeat; and secondly, the complete overthrow of their enemies, the Phocians, and
                    the utter destruction of their strongholds and cities. Is that all? No, indeed;
                    they have also gained <placeName key="tgn,7011034">Orchomenus</placeName>,
                        <placeName key="tgn,7011235">Coronea</placeName>, Corsia, Tilphosaeum, and
                    as much of the Phocian territory as they want. <milestone unit="section" n="142"
                    />Such is the outcome of the peace for the Theban people; and more they could
                    not desire. And what have the ambassadors gained? Nothing at
                    all&mdash;except the satisfaction of having achieved these results for their
                    country. Ah, but that is worth having, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName>; a glorious reward, if you set any store by that honor
                    and good repute which Aeschines and his friends bartered for a bribe. <milestone
                        unit="para" ed="P"/>Let us now set side by side the results of the peace to
                    the commonwealth of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> and to
                    the ambassadors of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>
                    respectively, and you shall see whether there is any equivalence. <milestone

                    all those possessions and all those allies, and a sworn promise to Philip that
                    if any man shall at any time attempt to recover them, you will thwart him, and
                    treat the man who would restore to you your own as an enemy and an adversary,
                    and the man who robbed you as an ally and a friend. <milestone unit="section"
                        n="144"/>Such are the terms that Aeschines supported and his accomplice
                    Philocrates proposed. On the first day I had the upper hand and persuaded you to
                    confirm the decision of your allies and to summon Philip's ambassadors, but
                    Aeschines forced an adjournment to the following day, and then persuaded you to
                    adopt Philocrates' resolution, which included all these proposals and others
                    still more objectionable. <milestone unit="section" n="145"/>That is what the
                    peace has brought to the city: you could not easily invent anything more
                    dishonorable. What has it brought to the ambassadors who contrived that
                    dishonor? I say nothing of the wealth that lies before your
                    eyes&mdash;houses, timber, grain; but in the country of our ruined allies
                    there are estates and extensive farms bringing in a rental of a talent to
                    Philocrates and half a talent to Aeschines. <milestone unit="section" n="146"
                    />Surely, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, it is
                    strange and intolerable that the disasters of your allies have become the
                    emolument of your envoys, and that one and the same peace should have brought,
                    to the city sending ambassadors, the destruction of allies, dispossession of
                    property, ignominy in exchange for honor, and to the ambassadors themselves who
                    intrigued against the city, revenues, property, estates, and opulence in
                    exchange for penury. To prove the truth of my statement, call the witnesses from

                    consideration, gentlemen of the jury. Who gained the greater advantage in the
                    operations, the Phocians over the Thebans, or Philip over you? I reply, the
                    Phocians over the Thebans. They held <placeName key="tgn,7011034"
                        >Orchomenus</placeName>, and <placeName key="tgn,7011235"
                        >Coronea</placeName>, and Tilphosaeum; they had kept within the walls the
                    Theban garrison at Neon; they had slain two hundred and seventy Thebans at
                    Hedyleum, and a trophy had been set up; they were superior in cavalry, and so an
                    Iliad of woes encompassed the Thebans. <milestone unit="section" n="149"/>No
                    such disaster ever befell, nor, I hope, ever will befall, you. The worst
                    misfortune of your war with Philip was that you could not do him as much harm as
                    you wished; against defeat you were absolutely secure. Then why did the same
                    peace mean, for the Thebans, who were so badly worsted in the war, the recovery
                    of their own possessions and the acquisition of possessions of their
                    adversaries, and, for the Athenians, the loss in time of peace of advantages
                    which were maintained in the war? The reason is that their ambassadors did not
                    sell them, but these men have sold you. That my account is true, you will find
                    further proof as we proceed. <milestone unit="part" n="Narr"/><milestone
                        unit="section" n="150"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When the peace of
                    Philocrates, which Aeschines supported in a speech, had been concluded, Philip's
                    ambassadors accepted the oaths, and departed. So far no fatal mischief had been
                    done. The peace was, indeed, discreditable and unworthy of Athens&mdash;but
                    then we were going to get those wonderful advantages in exchange. I at once
                    called upon you, and told the envoys, to sail for the <placeName
                        key="tgn,7002638">Hellespont</placeName> as speedily as possible, and not to
                    abandon, or allow Philip to seize and hold, any of the positions there in the
                    meantime; <milestone unit="section" n="151"/>for well I knew that indolent
                    people lose for ever anything that they let slip in the transition from war to
                    peace. No one, who has been induced by general considerations to sheathe the
                    sword, is ever inclined to begin war over again for the recovery of his losses;
                    and so the appropriator retains possession. Apart from these considerations, I
                    conceived that, if we sailed at once, the city would gain one of two advantages.
                    For when we were on the spot and had accepted his oath according to the decree,
                    either he would restore the places he had taken from <placeName
                        key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> and keep his hands off the rest,
                        <milestone unit="section" n="152"/>or, if he refused, we could promptly
                    report his refusal. In that case you, observing his grasping spirit and perfidy
                    in those distant and comparatively unimportant places, would no longer be
                    negligent of the more important concerns that lay nearer home&mdash;I mean
                    the Phocians and <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae">Thermopylae</placeName>.
                    If he had not seized the positions, and if there had been no deception of you,
                    all your interests were safe enough, and you would get fair treatment from him
                    without compulsion. <milestone unit="section" n="153"/>This was a reasonable
                    expectation; for so long as the Phocians were safe, as they were at the time,
                    and in possession of <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae"
                        >Thermopylae</placeName>, there was no menace which Philip could have
                    brandished in your face to make you disregard any of your just claims. He could
                    not reach <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName> either by a march
                    across country or by getting command of the seas. If he refused justice, you
                    could forthwith close his ports, stop his supply of money, and otherwise reduce
                    him to a state of blockade; and so he, and not you, would be wholly dependent on
                    the contingent benefits of the peace. <milestone unit="section" n="154"/>I will
                    now prove to you that I am not making up a story or claiming merit after the
                    event, but that I formed my judgement, kept my eye on your interests, and told
                    the envoys, without any delay. Finding that you had got to the end of the
                    regular Assemblies, and that there was no meeting left, and observing that the
                    envoys were still wasting time at <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName> instead of starting at once, I proposed a decree as a
                    member of the Council, to which the Assembly had given authority, directing the
                    envoys to sail immediately, and the general Proxenus to convey them to any place
                    in which he should ascertain that Philip was to be found. I drafted it, as I now

                    this time swearing in the allies, or discharging some other part of their duty.
                    Not at all; though they were on their travels for three whole months, and
                    received from you a thousand drachmas for journey-money, they did not get the
                    oaths from any single city either on their outward journey or on their way home.
                    The oaths were administered at the hostelry in front of the Temple of the
                    Twins,&mdash;any of you who have been to Pherae will know the place I
                    mean,&mdash;at the time when Philip was already on his march towards
                        <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> with his army, and in a
                    manner, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, that was
                    thoroughly discreditable to the city. <milestone unit="section" n="159"/>Yet
                    Philip would have paid any sum to have matters managed in this way. For when
                    these men had failed to draw the treaty, as they first tried to do, with a
                    clause excepting the Halians and the Phocians, and Philocrates had been
                    compelled by you to erase those words and write expressly, &ldquo;the
                    Athenians and the Allies of the Athenians,&rdquo; to the treaty so drawn
                    Philip did not wish any of his allies to have sworn; for then they would have
                    refused to join in his forcible occupation of those possessions of yours which
                    he now holds, and the oath would have been their excuse. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="160"/>Nor did he desire witnesses of the promises on the
                    strength of which he was obtaining the peace, nor any public disclosure of the
                    fact that after all <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> had not
                    been beaten in the war, and that it was Philip who was really eager for the
                    peace, and was ready to make large promises to the Athenians if he could get it.
                    Therefore he disapproved of these men going anywhere, lest the facts that I am
                    stating should become generally known; and they were ready to gratify him with
                    ostentatious deference and extravagant adulation. <milestone unit="section"
                        n="161"/>Yet, when they are convicted of all these delinquencies, of having

                    you that there is no way of denying that they were acting in the interest of
                    Philip. When we were setting out on the former embassy for peace, you sent
                    forward a herald to arrange our safe-conduct. On that occasion, as soon as they
                    reached Oreus, they wasted no time there waiting for the herald. Although Halus
                    was beleaguered, they crossed the sea thither; then left the town and went to
                    Parmenio, who was conducting the siege; set off through the enemies' positions
                    for <placeName key="tgn,7012084">Pagasae</placeName>, and continued their
                    journey till they met the herald at <placeName key="perseus,Larissa"
                        >Larissa</placeName>. Such was the energy and goodwill with which they
                    travelled then; <milestone unit="section" n="164"/>but now, in time of peace,
                    with complete security for travelling, and with your injunctions of haste, it
                    never occurred to them to hasten their journey by land or to travel by sea. Why
                    so? Because then it was to Philip's advantage that peace should be concluded
                    with all speed, but now that as much time as possible should be wasted before
                    the administration of the oaths. <milestone unit="section" n="165"/>To prove

                    of acting throughout in the interest of Philip? It was the same journey: they

                    hurried when they ought not to have moved a step until the arrival of the
                    herald. <milestone unit="section" n="166"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Take

                    ourselves. Mine was to seek out and rescue the captives, spending money of my
                    own, and asking Philip to apply to their ransom the money he was spending on
                    hospitable gifts for us. But what Aeschines constantly tried to effect, you
                    shall hear in a moment. What then was it? It was that Philip should give us a
                    lump sum as a collective present. <milestone unit="section" n="167"/>You must
                    know that Philip was already sounding us all in this way: he sent private
                    messages to each of us in turn, with the offer, men of <placeName
                        key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, of a really large sum in gold.
                    Having failed in some case or other,&mdash;in what case let the result
                    disclose; it is not for me to name myself,&mdash;he conceived that a
                    collective present might be accepted by all of us without misgiving; and that
                    there would be security for those who had individually sold themselves, if we
                    all shared even to a trifling extent in the general acceptance. Accordingly it
                    was offered,&mdash;nominally, as a form of hospitality. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="168"/>I stopped that manoeuvre; and then these men divided
                    that money also among themselves. When I asked Philip to spend it on the
                    captives, he could not with decency either inform against them by replying,
                    &ldquo;It is in so-and-so's pockets,&rdquo; or escape the outlay; so he
                    made me the promise, but evaded performance by saying that he would send the men
                    home in time for the Panathenaic Festival. Read the deposition of Apollophanes,

                    tell you how many of the captives I ransomed myself. For while we were staying

                    some of the prisoners,&mdash;all in fact who were out on
                    bail,&mdash;having, I suppose, no confidence that they would afterwards be
                    able to induce Philip to move, told me that they were willing to provide for
                    their own ransom without putting themselves under obligation to Philip, and
                    offered to borrow their ransom-money, three minas, five minas, or as the case
                    might be. <milestone unit="section" n="170"/>So when Philip agreed to get the
                    release of the rest, I called together these men, to whom I had lent the money
                    as a friendly loan, reminded them of the transaction, and made them a free gift
                    of their ransom-money, lest they should seem to have been put into a worse
                    position by their impetuosity, or to have been ransomed, though poor men, at
                    their own expense, while the rest were expecting deliverance from Philip. To

                    really inferred from my speech in support of Philocrates that our conduct was
                    thoroughly corrupt, why did you join us on the subsequent embassy to receive the
                    oaths, instead of excusing yourself?&rdquo; you must remember that I had
                    promised the prisoners whom I delivered that I would bring the ransom-money and
                    do my utmost for their rescue. <milestone unit="section" n="172"/>It would
                    therefore have been too bad to break my word and abandon fellow-creatures and

                    out in this fashion to your advantage, although, where the majority prevailed,
                    everything went to ruin. Indeed, if my advice had been taken, all our
                    transactions might have had an equally fortunate issue; for I was not so foolish
                    and stupid as to lose money, while others were making money, out of sheer public
                    spirit, and then object to a course of action that would have cost no expense,
                    and that offered far greater advantages to the whole commonwealth. Yes, men of

                    acts of Aeschines and those of Philocrates, in comparison with mine; for the
                    contrast will help to expose them. First, in violation both of the decree and of
                    assurances given to you, they excluded the Halians, the Phocians, and
                    Cersobleptes, from the benefits of the treaty. Then they attempted to tamper
                    with and repeal the decree from which our own authority was derived. Next they
                    entered the Cardians as allies of Philip, and refused by a definite vote to send
                    a dispatch written by me, but themselves composed and sent one that did not
                    contain an honest word. <milestone unit="section" n="175"/>Then, because I
                    objected to their acts, not only thinking them dishonorable but fearing that I
                    might share the ruin they were bringing on themselves, our chivalrous friend
                    accused me of promising to Philip that I would overthrow the Athenian democracy,
                    while all the time he was himself constantly holding private communications with
                    Philip. I need only mention that not I but Dercylus, with the help of this
                    servant of mine, watched him by night at Pherae, caught him emerging from
                    Philip's tent, and told the servant to let me know, and not to forget it
                    himself; and that in the end this impudent blackguard stayed with Philip for a
                    day and a night on our departure. <milestone unit="section" n="176"/>To prove
                    the truth of these statements, in the first place I will give evidence myself,
                    having duly written down my deposition and incurred legal responsibility<note
                        anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">It should be remembered that all evidence in the

                    the undertaking I gave at the outset of my speech. I have proved, not by words
                    but by the testimony of facts, that there was no word of truth in the report of

                    his counsels were exactly opposed to right policy; that he spoke against the
                    terms of peace proposed by our allies, and in favor of the proposals of
                    Philocrates; that he purposely wasted your time to debar you from going to the
                    aid of the Phocians if you should so desire; that throughout his journey abroad
                    his sins were many and grievous; that he has betrayed everything, sold
                    everything, taken bribes, and stopped short of no iniquity. That, then, is what
                    I undertook to prove; and that is what I have proved. <milestone unit="section"

                    plain and straightforward. You have sworn to give a verdict according to the

                    conduct of the defendant when holding the office of ambassador has manifestly
                    violated those laws, those decrees, and the principles of justice; therefore he
                    must be convicted by an intelligent jury. If he had committed no other crime,
                    two only of his transgressions are sufficient to put him to death, for he has
                    betrayed <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName> as well as the Phocians
                    to Philip. <milestone unit="section" n="180"/>Yet no man could point out two

                    court,&mdash;Ergophilus, Cephisodotus, Timomachus, and, in old times,
                    Ergocles, Dionysius, and others, of whom I may say that all of them together had
                    inflicted fewer injuries upon the commonwealth than the defendant. <milestone

                    that he, and he alone of all our debaters, is to be called to account for his
                    speeches. I will spare him the retort that any man who takes money for his
                    speeches might reasonably be brought to justice; but there is one point on which
                    I do insist. If Aeschines talked like an idiot and made blunders as an
                    unofficial person, do not be hypercritical, leave him alone, make allowances.
                    But if he has purposely deceived you for money while holding office as
                    ambassador, do not let him off, do not listen to the suggestion that he is not

                    what are we to bring any ambassador to justice, if not for his words?
                    Ambassadors have control, not over war-ships, and military positions, and
                    troops, and citadels,&mdash;these are never entrusted to them,&mdash;but
                    over words and opportunities. If an ambassador has not wasted the opportunities
                    of the state, he is no wrongdoer; if he has wasted them, he has done wrong. If
                    the words of his reports are true and profitable words, let him be acquitted; if
                    they are false, venal, and noxious, let him be convicted. <milestone

                    takes bribes and speaks in the interest of our enemies, will not you be
                    imperilled? Again, to filch your opportunities is not an offence equivalent to
                    filching those of an oligarchy or a monarchy, but far greater. <milestone

                    at any time, but only after written notice given to marshals and embassies; then
                    the Council must convene an Assembly, but only on a statutory date. Then the

                    any favor; had he observed in him any illiberality or discourtesy towards
                    himself? Satyrus, as the story goes, replied that he did not want any such gift
                    as the others were asking; what he would like to ask was a favor which Philip
                    could grant quite easily, and yet he feared that his request would be
                    unsuccessful. <milestone unit="section" n="194"/>Philip bade him speak out,
                    declaring with the easy generosity of youth that there was nothing he would not
                    do for him. Thereupon Satyrus told him that Apollophanes of <placeName

                    there was such an outburst of applause and approval that Philip was strongly
                    moved, and granted the boon. And yet Apollophanes was one of the men who had
                    slain Philip's own brother Alexander. <milestone unit="section" n="196"

                    declined to go. When the drinking began, Xenophron introduced an Olynthian
                    woman,&mdash;a handsome, but a freeborn and, as the event proved, a modest
                    girl. <milestone unit="section" n="197"/>At first, I believe, they only tried to
                    make her drink quietly and eat dessert; so Iatrocles told me the following day.
                    But as the carouse went on, and they became heated, they ordered her to sit down
                    and give them a song. The poor girl was bewildered, for she did not wish, and
                    she did not know how, to sing. Then Aeschines and Phryno declared that it was
                    intolerable impertinence for a captive,&mdash;and one of those ungodly,
                    pernicious Olynthians too,&mdash;to give herself such airs. &ldquo;Call
                    a servant,&rdquo; they cried; &ldquo;bring a whip, somebody.&rdquo;
                    In came a flunkey with a horsewhip, and&mdash;I suppose they were tipsy, and
                    it did not take much to irritate them,when she said something and began to cry,
                    he tore off her dress and gave her a number of lashes on the back. <milestone

                    feet, upset the table, and fell at the knees of Iatrocles. If he had not rescued
                    her, she would have perished, the victim of a drunken orgy, for the drunkenness
                    of this blackguard is something terrible. The story of this girl was told even

                    weak. Conscience paralyses their audacity; conscience cripples their tongues,
                    closes their lips, stifles them, puts them to silence. <milestone unit="section"

                    day, when you refused to appoint Aeschines to an embassy, how he bellowed at me:
                    &ldquo;I will impeach you,&mdash;I will indict you,&mdash;aha!
                        aha!&rdquo;<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb"> In this exclamation
                        Demosthenes perhaps imitates the melodramatic style and intonation of his
                        adversary. Aeschines is like our stage villain, crying, &ldquo;Aha! A
                        time will come.&rdquo;</note> And yet a threat of impeachment involves
                    endless speeches and litigation; but here are just two or three simple words
                    that a slave bought yesterday could deliver: &ldquo;Men of <placeName

                    accuses me of offences in which he himself took part. He says that I have taken

                    speech; none of you heard it; he only vented idle menaces. The reason is that he
                    was conscious of guilt; he cowered like a slave before those words; his thoughts
                    did not approach them but recoiled from them, arrested by his evil conscience.
                    Mere vague invective and abuse there was no one to stop. <milestone

                    strongest possible point&mdash;not a matter of assertion but of fact. I
                    wished to do the honest thing, and to give an account of myself twice, because I
                    had been appointed ambassador twice; but Aeschines approached the Court of
                    Scrutiny, taking with him a crowd of witnesses, and forbade them to summon me,
                    on the ground that I had already submitted to scrutiny, and was no longer
                    liable. What was the real meaning of this ludicrous proceeding? Having himself
                    rendered his account of the earlier embassy, with which nobody found fault, he
                    did not wish to come into court in respect of the embassy for which he is now
                    under examination; and that is the embassy that includes all his misdeeds.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="212"/>But, if I came into court twice, he could
                    not avoid a second appearance, and therefore he would not let me be summoned.
                    Yet that act, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, proves
                    two propositions: first, that Aeschines has pronounced his own condemnation, and
                    therefore you cannot conscientiously acquit him today; and secondly, that he
                    will not have a truthful word to say about me, otherwise he would have spoken
                    out and denounced me then, instead of trying to block my summons. <milestone

                    less rigorous than Philip, but compel him to address his defence to the real

                    that they were very sensible men, and that the city was going on nicely; but
                    they thought that the man who accused them had gone out of his mind, and that he

                    about my entertainment and my decree. I had nearly forgotten those all-important
                    topics! When I was drafting the provisional resolution of the Council respecting
                    the earlier embassy, and again in addressing the people at the Assemblies that
                    were held to discuss the terms of peace, I followed the usual custom, and
                    included a vote of thanks and an invitation to the public mess-table; for at
                    that time no wrongful word or act of theirs had been disclosed. <milestone

                    ambassadors, and did the thing very handsomely; for, having observed in their
                    own country that they take pride in such hospitality as evidence of wealth and
                    splendor, I thought it my duty to outdo them with a more striking display of
                    munificence. On the strength of these incidents, Aeschines will tell you:
                    &ldquo;Demosthenes thanked us, and entertained the ambassadors
                    himself&rdquo;&mdash;without marking the distinction of time. <milestone

                    immediately after the first return of the envoys, when the people had still to
                    hear their report, and when it was not yet known that Aeschines would support
                    Philocrates, or that Philocrates would move such a resolution. If he mentions
                    the incidents, bear in mind that the dates were earlier than their offences, and
                    that I have never since had any intimacy or any association with them. Read the

                    perjure yourselves. For though the vote is secret, it will not escape the eye of
                    Heaven. The legislator wisely discerned herein the essence of secret voting,

                    unacknowledged favor, and acquit a man convicted by his own testimony. For what
                    more powerful evidence, Aeschines, can I adduce for the many crimes of your

                    come from the Phoenix of Euripides. That play was never acted by Theodorus or
                    Aristodemus, for whom Aeschines commonly took the inferior parts; Molon however
                    produced it, and perhaps some other players of the old school. But Sophocles'
                    Antigone was frequently acted by Theodorus, and also by Aristodemus; and in that
                    play there are some iambic lines, admirably and most instructively composed.
                    That passage Aeschines omitted to quote, though he has often spoken the lines,
                    and knows them by heart; <milestone unit="section" n="247"/>for of course you
                    are aware that, in all tragic dramas, it is the enviable privilege of third-rate
                    actors to come on as tyrants, carrying their royal scepters. Now you shall weigh
                    the merits of the verses which were specially written by the poet for the
                    character of Creon-Aeschines, though he forgot to repeat them to himself in
                    connection with his embassy, and did not quote them to the jury. Read.<cit>

                    day about two hundred and forty years have elapsed, so that the sculptor who
                    designed that disposition of drapery had not lived in Solon's
                    time,&mdash;nor even his grand-father. <milestone unit="section" n="252"/>He
                    illustrated his remarks by representing to the jury the attitude of the statue;
                    but his mimicry did not include what, politically, would have been much more
                    profitable than an attitude,&mdash;a view of Solon's spirit and purpose, so
                    widely different from his own. When <placeName key="tgn,7002340"
                        >Salamis</placeName> had revolted, and the Athenian people had forbidden
                    under penalty of death any proposal for its recovery, Solon, accepting the risk
                    of death, composed and recited an elegiac poem, and so retrieved that country
                    for <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> and removed a standing
                    dishonor. <milestone unit="section" n="253"/>Aeschines, on the other hand, gave
                    away and sold <placeName key="perseus,Amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName>, a city
                    which the King of <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName> and all

                    speaking in support of the resolution moved by Philocrates. It was highly
                    becoming in him, was it not to remind us of Solon? Not content with this
                    performance at home, he went to <placeName key="tgn,7006667"
                        >Macedonia</placeName>, and never mentioned the place with which his mission
                    was concerned. So he stated in his own report, for no doubt you remember how he
                    said &ldquo;I, too, had something to say about <placeName
                        key="perseus,Amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName>, but I left it out to give
                    Demosthenes a chance of dealing with that subject.&rdquo; <milestone

                    me anything that he wanted to say to Philip: he would sooner give a man a share
                    of his life-blood than a share of his speech. The truth is that, having accepted
                    money, he could hardly confront Philip, who gave him the money on purpose that
                    he might not restore <placeName key="perseus,Amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName>.
                    Now, please, take and read these elegiac verses of Solon, to show the jury how

                    reprobates. Therefore, inasmuch as bribe-taking is the forerunner of such

                    bribes, you may be sure that he is also a traitor. If one man betrays
                    opportunities, another negotiations, another soldiery, each one is making havoc
                    of the business he controls, and all alike deserve your reprobation. <milestone

                    from barbarians to Greeks. Hence, apparently, we may conclude that your

                    been set up just anywhere? No; although the whole of our citadel is a holy
                    place, and although its area is so large, the inscription stands at the right
                    hand beside the great brazen Athene which was dedicated by the state as a
                    memorial of victory in the Persian war, at the expense of the Greeks. In those
                    days, therefore, justice was so venerable, and the punishment of these crimes so
                    meritorious, that the retribution of such offenders was honored with the same

                    you will do well, not to emulate your forefathers in some one respect alone, but
                    to follow their conduct step by step. I am sure you have all heard the story of
                    their treatment of Callias, son of Hipponicus, who negotiated the celebrated
                        peace<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb"><date value="-470">470</date> B.C.,

                    of the coast, nor sail with a ship of war between the Chelidonian islands and
                    the Blue Rocks. At the inquiry into his conduct they came near to putting him to
                    death, and mulcted him in fifty talents, because he was said to have taken
                    bribes on embassy. <milestone unit="section" n="274"/>Yet no one can cite a more
                    honorable peace made by the city before or since; but that is not what they
                    regarded. They attributed the honorable peace to their own valor and to the high
                    repute of their city, the refusal or acceptance of money to the character of the
                    ambassador; and they expected an honest and incorruptible character in any man
                    who entered the service of the state. <milestone unit="section" n="275"/>They
                    held the taking of bribes to be too inimical and unprofitable to the state to be
                    tolerated in any transaction or in any person; but you, men of <placeName

                    your ambassadors, which robbed the city of her possessions and earned for them
                    wealth beyond the dreams of avarice, instead of putting them to death of your
                    own accord, wait for the appearance of a prosecutor. You are giving them a trial

                    misdeeds for which those persons were sentenced to death, execute me on the
                    spot. Look at the decree: &ldquo;Whereas the said ambassadors have disobeyed
                    their instructions.&rdquo; That is the first charge alleged. And did not
                    these men disobey their instructions? Did not the decree say, &ldquo;for the
                    Athenians and the Allies of the Athenians,&rdquo; and did not they declare
                    the Phocians to be excluded? Did it not instruct them to swear in the
                    magistrates in the several cities, and did they not swear in only such persons
                    as Philip sent to them? Did not the decree say that they were not to meet Philip
                    alone in any place whatsoever, and did they not continually have private
                    dealings with Philip? <milestone unit="section" n="279"
                    />&ldquo;Whereas,&rdquo; says the old decree, &ldquo;certain of them
                    are convicted of making untruthful reports to the Council.&rdquo; Why, these
                    men are convicted of making untruthful reports even to the Assembly. On what
                    evidence?&mdash;you remember that brilliant quibble. On the evidence of
                    facts: the report was exactly contradicted by the event. It goes on:
                    &ldquo;and of sending untruthful dispatches.&rdquo; So did they.
                    &ldquo;And of bearing false witness against allies, and of taking

                    &ldquo;utterly destroying&rdquo;&mdash;a vastly greater injury. But
                    as to their having taken bribes, we should still, if they denied it, have to
                    make the charge good; but since they admit it, surely there should have been a

                    not add that he has been an honest and disinterested ambassador, he ought

                    indulgence and importunity are stronger than the laws. You must not, he said,
                    have any pity for Timarchus's mother, an aged woman, or his children, or anyone
                    else: you must fix your mind on the thought that, if you desert the laws and the

                    scot-free? If he demanded such severity of retribution from men who had
                    transgressed only against himself and his friends, what retribution are you, a
                    legal jury bound by oath, to exact from men who have grievously transgressed

                    who hunger after Philip's pay, and if men who have won your confidence, men who
                    have hitherto scorned the imputation of intriguing for Philip, are to appear as

                    not mount the tribune for your own kinsmen and for men who have a claim on your

                    your children that you desired his utter destruction, and will you now be the

                    sacred funds, because he was three days late in paying seven minas into the

                    formidable offences, calling for the utmost vigilance and precaution; while the
                    charges you brought against those two men were comparatively ludicrous, as these
                    considerations will show. Were there any persons in <placeName

                    probability, yes. Did any one of them take part in the recent overthrow of free

                    one of them been shown to be responsible for the present political troubles
                    there? Not one. Then who are the people who commit these monstrous crimes?
                    Persons who fancy themselves important enough to be called friends of Philip,
                    men itching for military commands and eager for political distinction, men who
                    claim superiority over the common herd. At <placeName key="perseus,Megara"
                        >Megara</placeName> the other day was not Perillus tried before the Three

                    reputation, come forward and beg him off, and then send him back to Philip? The
                    sequel was that one of the pair returned with an alien army at his back, while
                    the other was hatching the plot at home. Take that as a specimen. <milestone

                    that requires more anxious vigilance than allowing any man to become stronger
                    than the people. Let no man be delivered, and let no man be destroyed, merely
                    because this man or that so desires; let hem who is delivered or destroyed by
                    the evidence of facts be entitled to receive from this court the verdict that is
                    his due. That is the democratic principle. <milestone unit="section" n="297"

                    instance, Aristophon, Diophantus, and others of earlier date. But what was the
                    field of their supremacy? The popular assembly. In courts of justice no man to
                    this day has ever been superior to the people, or to the laws, or to the
                    judicial oath. Then permit no such superiority to Aeschines today. To enforce
                    the warning that it is better to take those precautions than to be credulous, I
                    will read to you an oracle of the gods,&mdash;to whom <placeName

                    of the gods. If they are addressed to you in time of war, they bid you beware of
                    your commanders, for commanders are the leaders of warfare; if after conclusion
                    of peace, of your statesmen, for they are your leaders, they have your
                    obedience, by them you may haply be deceived. The oracle also bids you keep the
                    commonwealth together, that all may be of one mind, and may not gratify the
                    enemy. <milestone unit="section" n="299"/>What do you think, men of <placeName

                    deliverance or by the punishment of the man who has done all this mischief? By
                    his deliverance surely; but the oracle bids you strive that the enemy shall not
                    rejoice. Therefore, you are all exhorted by Zeus, by Dione, by all the gods, to
                    punish with one mind those who have made themselves the servants of your
                    enemies. There are foes without; there are traitors within. It is the business
                    of foes to give bribes, of traitors to take bribes, and to rescue those who have
                    taken them. <milestone unit="section" n="300"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"
                    />Moreover, it can be shown by mere human reasoning that it is extremely
                    injurious and dangerous to permit the intimacy of a prominent statesman with men
                    whose purposes are at variance with those of the people. If you will consider by
                    what means Philip acquired his political supremacy and performed his most signal
                    achievements, you will find that it was by buying treachery from willing
                    sellers, and by corrupting leading politicians and stimulating their ambition.

                    authority over you of which they boast, and then punish before the eyes of the

                    ambassador to the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>? What he
                    said there after his arrival, either in conversation or in public speeches, is

                    repeatedly called Philip a barbarian and a man of blood. He told you that the

                        >Athens</placeName> was really waking up and attending to business. He
                    related an incident which, he said, had filled him with deep indignation. On his
                    journey home he had met Atrestidas travelling from Philip's court with some
                    thirty women and children in his train. He was astonished, and inquired of one

                    captives whom Atrestidas was bringing away with him as a present from Philip, he
                    thought it a terrible business, and burst into tears. <placeName

                    plight indeed, if she permits such cruelties to pass unchecked. He counselled

                    denounce the persons who were intriguing for Philip; for, he said, he had been

                    give attention to the matter and send ambassadors, the intriguers would promptly
                    be brought to justice. <milestone unit="section" n="307"/>Such was his speech on
                    that occasion; a noble speech, worthy of our Athenian traditions. But after he

                    did his language bear the slightest resemblance to those utterances? Not in the

                    not to carry succor to anybody. As for the people who recommended you to consult
                    the Greeks on the terms of peace with Philip, he was amazed at the suggestion
                    that it was necessary that any foreigner should be convinced when the questions
                    were purely domestic. <milestone unit="section" n="308"/>And as for

                    corrupted? Is it possible that the same man who was then inflamed with
                    abhorrence of Atrestidas on account of those Olynthian women and children,
                    should now be content to cooperate with Philocrates, who brought free-born
                    Olynthian ladies to this city for their dishonor? Philocrates is now so
                    notorious for the infamous life he has lived that I need not apply to him any

                    compassion for those miserable and unfortunate beings. Yet Aeschines had no
                    compassion for them. He did not shed tears over <placeName key="tgn,1000074"
                        >Greece</placeName> on their account, indignant that they should suffer

                    ambassador will keep all his tears for himself. Very likely he will bring his
                    children into court and put them in a conspicuous position. But do you,
                    gentlemen of the jury, as you look at those children of his, reflect how many
                    children of your own friends and allies are wanderers, roaming the world in
                    beggary, suffering hardships which they owe to this man; and that they deserve
                    your compassion infinitely more than the offspring of a malefactor and a
                    traitor, while, by adding to the treaty of peace the words and to their
                    posterity, he and his friends robbed your own children even of hope. When you
                    witness his tears, remember that you hold in your power a man who bade you send

                    inhabit today, is there an acre that would still bear that name, or remain the
                    home of the Greeks who now possess it, if the heroes of Marathon and <placeName

                    defence performed those glorious deeds of valor,&rdquo; is there one man who
                    would not make reply: &ldquo;No; the whole country would have become the
                    prey of the barbarian invaders&rdquo;? <milestone unit="section" n="313"
                    />Even among your foes there is not a man who would despoil those heroes of
                    their meed of praise and gratitude; and does an Aeschines forbid you, their own
                    descendants, to commemorate their names&mdash;all for the sake of his
                    miserable bribes? There are indeed rewards in which the dead have no part or
                    lot; but the praise that waits on glorious achievements is the peculiar guerdon
                    of those who have gloriously died&mdash;for then jealousy is no longer their
                    adversary. Let the man who would rob the dead of their reward be stripped of his
                    own honors: that retribution you will levy on him for your forefathers' sake. By
                    those speeches of yours, you reprobate, you made havoc of our policy, traducing
                    and disparaging with your tongue the achievements of our forefathers. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="314"/>And from these performances you emerge a land-owner,
                    a person of high consideration! Take another point. Before he did all that
                    mischief to the commonwealth, he used to admit that he had been a clerk; he was
                    grateful to you for his appointments; his demeanor was quite modest. But since
                    he has perpetrated wrongs without number, he has become mightily supercilious.
                    If a man speaks of &ldquo;Aeschines, the man who was once a
                    clerk,&rdquo; he makes a private quarrel of it, and talks of defamation of
                    character. Behold him pacing the market-place with the stately stride of
                    Pythocles, his long robe reaching to his ankles, his cheeks puffed out, as who
                    should say, &ldquo;One of Philip's most intimate friends, at your
                    service!&rdquo; He has joined the clique that wants to get rid of
                    democracy,&mdash;that regards the established political order as an

                    a brief recapitulation to remind you of the manner in which Philip discomfited
                    your policy with these scoundrels as his confederates. It is well worth while to
                    examine and contemplate the whole imposition. At the outset he was really
                    desirous of peace, for his whole country was overrun by banditti, and his ports
                    were blockaded, so that he got no advantage from all his wealth. Accordingly he
                    sent those envoys who addressed you in his name with so much
                    courtesy&mdash;Neoptolemus, Aristodemus, and <placeName key="tgn,6001610"
                        >Ctesiphon</placeName>. <milestone unit="section" n="316"/>But as soon as he
                    was visited by us ambassadors, he promptly took Aeschines into his pay, that he
                    might support and co-operate with the infamous Philocrates, and overpower those
                    of us whose intentions were honest. He then composed a letter to you, as the
                    best means of obtaining the peace he desired. <milestone unit="section" n="317"
                    />Even then it was still out of his power to achieve any important result to
                    your disadvantage, unless he should destroy the Phocians. That was no easy task,
                    for, as luck would have it, his affairs had reached a crisis of such a nature
                    that either he could not realize any of his purposes, or else he was obliged to
                    commit falsehood and perjury, with the whole world, both Greek and barbarian, to
                    witness his wickedness. <milestone unit="section" n="318"/>For if he should
                    accept the Phocians as allies, and with your help take the oath of friendship to
                    them, he must at once violate the oaths he had already sworn to the Thessalians
                    and the Thebans, with the latter of whom he had covenanted to help them in the
                    subjugation of <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName>, and with the
                    former to restore their rights at the Amphictyonic Council. If, on the other
                    hand, he was loth to accept them&mdash;and in fact the prospect did not
                    please him&mdash;he expected that you would send troops to <placeName
                        key="perseus,Thermopylae">Thermopylae</placeName> to stop his passage, as
                    indeed you would have done if you had not been outwitted. In that event, he
                    calculated that he would be unable to get through. <milestone unit="section"
                        n="319"/>He did not need any information from others to reach that
                    conclusion. He was himself a sufficient witness, for, after his first defeat of
                    the Phocians and the overthrow of their leader and commander Onomarchus,
                    although no one in the whole world, Greek or barbarian, sent aid to them save
                    you alone, so far from getting through <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae"
                        >Thermopylae</placeName>, or accomplishing any of the purposes of the
                    passage, he had been unable even to approach the pass. <milestone unit="section"
                        n="320"/>I take it he was perfectly well aware that now, with <placeName
                        key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName> at variance with him&mdash;the
                    Pheraeans, for example, refusing to join his following&mdash;with the
                    Thebans getting the worst of the war, defeated in an engagement, and a trophy
                    erected at their expense, he would be unable to force the passage if you sent
                    troops to <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae">Thermopylae</placeName>, and that
                    he could not even make the attempt without serious loss unless he should also
                    resort to some trickery. &ldquo;How, then,&rdquo; he thought,
                    &ldquo;shall I escape open falsehood, and attain all my objects without
                    incurring the charge of perjury? Only if I can find Athenians to hood-wink the
                    Athenian people, for then I shall have no share in the ensuing
                    dishonor.&rdquo; <milestone unit="section" n="321"/>Accordingly his envoys
                    warned you that he would not accept the Phocian alliance, but then Aeschines and
                    his friends, taking up the tale, assured the people that, although for the sake
                    of the Thebans and the Thessalians Philip could not with decency accept the
                    alliance, yet if he should become master of the situation, and get his peace, he
                    would thereafter do exactly what we should now ask him to agree to. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="322"/>So on the strength of these expectations and
                    inducements he obtained his peace, with the Phocians excluded; but it was still
                    necessary to stop the reinforcement of <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae"
                        >Thermopylae</placeName>, for which fifty war-galleys were lying at anchor
                    to enable you to check Philip's advance. <milestone unit="section" n="323"/>How
                    could it be done? What new artifice could he invent for that purpose? Someone
                    must filch your opportunities of action, and surprise you with an unexpected
                    crisis, so that you might lose the power, if not the will, of sending the
                    expedition. That, then, was clearly what these men undertook. As you have often
                    heard, I was unable to get away in time; I had chartered a ship, but was
                    prevented from sailing. <milestone unit="section" n="324"/>But it was further
                    necessary that the Phocians should acquire confidence in Philip and make a
                    voluntary surrender, so that no delay should intervene, and no unfriendly
                    resolution come to hand from you. &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; thought
                    Philip, &ldquo;a report shall be made by the Athenian ambassadors that the
                    Phocians are to be protected; and so, though they persist in mistrusting me,
                    they will deliver themselves into my hands through confidence in the Athenians.
                    We will enlist the sympathy of the Athenian people in the hope that, supposing
                    themselves to have got everything they want, they will pass no obstructive
                    resolution. These men shall carry from us such flattering reports and assurances
                    that, whatsoever may befall, they will make no movement.&rdquo; <milestone
                        unit="section" n="325"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In this manner and by
                    the aid of this artifice our ruin was accomplished by men themselves doomed to
                    perdition. For at once, instead of witnessing the restoration of <placeName

                        >Plataea</placeName>, you heard of the enslavement of <placeName
                        key="tgn,7011034">Orchomenus</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7011235"
                        >Coronea</placeName>. Instead of the humiliation of <placeName

                    insolence, the walls of your own allies the Phocians were demolished, and
                    demolished by those very Thebans whom Aeschines in his speech had sent to live
                    in scattered villages. <milestone unit="section" n="326"/>Instead of the
                    surrender to you of <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName> in exchange
                    for <placeName key="perseus,Amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName>, Philip is

                    forcing their way into the Amphictyonic Council. If anyone says a word about the

                    while you, after expecting the complete fulfilment, have witnessed the entire
                    disappointment, of your desires. You are nominally at peace; yet peace has
                    brought you greater calamities than war. Meantime these men have made money by
                    your misfortunes, and until today have never been brought to justice. <milestone

                    have the price of their perfidy in their pockets, has, I suppose, long ago been
                    manifest to you for many reasons; and I am afraid that, contrary to my desire, I
                    may be wearying you by submitting detailed proofs of facts well known to you.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="330"/>However, I must ask you to listen to one
                    more argument. Gentlemen of the jury, would you set up in the market-place a
                    statue of any of the ambassadors whom Philip sent? Or would you give to them
                    free maintenance in the Town Hall, or any of the other privileges with which you
                    reward your benefactors? Surely not; but why not? For in you there is no lack of
                    gratitude or justice or kindness. It is, you will say&mdash;and it is a fair
                    and honest reply&mdash;because they did everything for Philip and nothing
                    for us. <milestone unit="section" n="331"/>Then do you suppose that Philip acts
                    on an entirely different principle from yours, and gives all those handsome
                    presents to Aeschines and his friends because they conducted their mission duly
                    and honestly in your interest? That is not so. You have observed the reception

                    banished by proclamation the Athenian poet Xenocleides for offering them
                    hospitality as fellow-citizens. Such is his behavior towards your
                    representatives when they honestly speak out what they think; those who have
                    sold themselves he treats as he treated Aeschines and his friends. My argument
                    requires no other witnesses and no stronger proofs; nor can anyone erase these
                    proofs from your minds. <milestone unit="section" n="332"/><milestone
                        unit="para" ed="P"/>Some one came up to me just now in front of the court,
                    and told me a very odd thing. Aeschines, he said, had prepared himself to
                    denounce the general Chares,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Chares: for thirty
                        years an unlucky, or incompetent, commander by land and sea; politically, a

                        late for the relief of <placeName key="perseus,Olynthus"
                            >Olynthus</placeName>.</note> hoping to cajole you by his eloquent
                    treatment of that topic. I will not lay too much stress on the observation that,
                    whenever Chares has been brought to trial, he has been found to have acted
                    faithfully and loyally, so far as in him lay, in your interests, though he has
                    often failed of success by the fault of the people who do mischief for money. I
                    will go so far as to grant for argument's sake that every word Aeschines will
                    utter against him is true. But even on that assumption it is absolutely
                    ridiculous that a man in Chares' position should be denounced by a man like
                    Aeschines. <milestone unit="section" n="333"/>Observe that I do not blame
                    Aeschines for any of the misadventures of the war, for which the generals are
                    duly called to account. Nor do I blame him because the city made the peace: so
                    far I acquit him. What then is the basis of my speech and of my indictment?
                    That, when the city was making the peace, he supported Philocrates, and did not
                    support speakers whose proposals were patriotic; that he took bribes; that
                    thereafter, on the later embassy, he deliberately squandered his opportunities;
                    that he deceived the city, and confounded its policy, by suggesting the hope
                    that Philip would satisfy all our desires; and that subsequently, when others
                    warned you to beware of the perpetrator of so many iniquities, he addressed you
                    as his advocate. <milestone unit="section" n="334"/>These are my accusations. Do
                    not forget them. For a just and equitable peace I would be grateful; I would

                    Philip does not hold any of these advantages as a concession made with your
                    consent in the terms of peace. We owe them all to these men and to their
                    venality. If, then, Aeschines shirks the issue, if he tries to lead you astray
                    by talking of anything rather than the charges I bring, I will tell you how to
                    receive his irrelevance. &ldquo;We are not sitting in judgement on any

                    Phocians; prove to us that you are not to blame. If Demosthenes committed any
                    crime, why bring it up now? Why did you not lay your complaint at the statutory
                    investigation of his conduct? For that silence alone you deserve your doom.

                    peace. Deny, if you can, that the peace we have is a disgraceful and ignominious
                    peace; deny that after its conclusion we were deceived, and that by that
                    deception all was lost. The blame for all these calamities has been brought home
                    to you. Why do you still speak the praises of the man who inflicted
                    them?&rdquo; Keep guard over his tricks in that fashion, and he will have
                    nothing to say. He will only aggravate the thunders of his voice, and exhaust

                    that in the end he gave up his profession of actor of small parts; and I think
                    you would be behaving very strangely if now, when he has wrought measurable
                    mischief, not on the stage, but in his dealings with the most momentous affairs

                    or a candidate for public office, you seek an honest man, a man who exhibits a
                    proud spirit as your representative, and a spirit of equality as your
                    fellow-citizen. I, for example, showed no respect for Philip; I kept my respect
                    for the captives, I rescued them, I spared no effort. Aeschines, on the other
                    hand, grovelled at Philip's feet, sang his Hymn of Victory, and disregards you

                    you all share in its advantages. But when you find such powers in the possession
                    of a corrupt and evil-minded man, the slave of filthy lucre, discourage him, and
                    listen to him with aversion and animosity; for if knavery enjoys in your eyes

                    the speaker is paralyzed by the recalcitrance of his audience. Listen to him,

                    jury, it is chiefly because I consider that the State will benefit by the repeal
                    of this law, but partly also out of sympathy with the young son of Chabrias,
                    that I have consented to support the plaintiffs to the best of my ability. It is
                    clear, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, that Leptines
                    and anyone else who defends the law will have nothing fair to say in its favor,
                    but will urge the unworthiness of certain persons who have used their exemption
                    as a means of shirking the public services, and he will take his stand chiefly
                    on that ground. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>For my own part, I shall
                    forbear to retort that it is unjust to take away this privilege from all because
                    you find fault with some; for that objection has already been partially
                        stated,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">By the previous speaker,
                        Phormio.</note> and you probably realize its force. But I should like to ask
                    Leptines on what grounds, even if not some, but all the recipients had been to
                    the last degree undeserving, he has meted out the same treatment to you as to
                    them; for by the clause "none shall be exempt" he has taken away the privilege
                    from those who now enjoy it, while by the addition "nor shall it be lawful
                    hereafter to grant it" he takes away from you the right to bestow it. For surely
                    he cannot mean that precisely as he thought the holders of this privilege
                    unworthy, so he thought the people unworthy of the right to dispense its own
                    favors to whomsoever it wishes. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>But perhaps he
                    may object here that he framed his law in this way because the people are so
                    easily gulled. But by parity of reasoning why should you not be deprived of all
                    your rights&mdash;of the whole constitution in fact? For there is no
                    single&mdash;right which has not been abused in this way. You have often
                    been deceived into passing decrees; you have sometimes been induced to choose
                    weak allies rather than strong; and generally, I suppose, in many of your public
                    proceedings the same thing is bound to happen. <milestone unit="section" n="4"
                    />Shall we then make a law that hereafter neither Council nor Assembly shall be
                    permitted to deliberate or to vote on any subject? Not so, in my opinion; for we
                    ought not to be deprived of our rights, where we have been misled; we ought to
                    be instructed how to avoid such mistakes, and we ought to make a law, not to
                    strip us of our own authority, but to punish those who mislead us. <milestone

                    considerations aside, you would examine the real problem, whether it is more
                    advantageous that you should possess the power of bestowing this privilege, even
                    though you are sometimes duped into bestowing it on a scoundrel, or that by
                    being wholly dispossessed of it you should be unable to grant honors even where
                    they are deserved, you would find the former course the more advantageous. And
                    why? Because the result of rewarding too many citizens is to encourage many to
                    do you good service, but the result of rewarding no one, even if deserving, is
                    to discourage emulation in all. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>There is also
                    this other reason, that those who reward an undeserving individual may be
                    credited with some degree of artlessness,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb"
                            ><foreign lang="greek">eu)h/qeia</foreign>has many shades of meaning

                    requite their benefactors are charged with baseness. Just so far as it is better
                    to be thought artless than unscrupulous, it is more honorable to repeal this law
                    than to enact it. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"

                    reflection does it seem to me reasonable, when finding fault with some on the
                    ground of the rewards they already enjoy, to rob useful citizens of their
                    honors. For if, while these immunities exist, some of the recipients are, as our
                    opponents say, worthless and unprofitable, what result are we to expect when
                    there is no chance whatever of reward for the good citizens? <milestone

                    soundness&mdash;there is an interval of a year between each public service,
                    so that half the time a citizen is immune. And then, when all citizens, even
                    those who have not benefited you in the least, enjoy a half share in that
                    privilege, are we to take away from your real benefactors the addition that we
                    made to it? Surely not; for that would be dishonorable and, in your case,
                    especially unbecoming. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>When we have a law which
                    forbids cheating in the marketplace, where a falsehood entails no public injury,
                    is it not disgraceful that in public affairs the same state should not abide by
                    the law which it enjoins on private individuals, but should cheat its
                    benefactors, and that although it is itself likely to incur no small penalty?

                        the Ten 100 talents, but shortly afterwards Pausanias, the Spartan king, who
                        was no friend to Lysander, intervened, withdrew the Spartan son from the
                        Acropolis, and reconciled the parties. The story of the loan is narrated by
                        Xenophon and Plutarch; the decree of the Assembly, accepting responsibility
                        for the repayment, is attested also by <bibl n="Isoc. 7.67">Isoc. Areop.

                    others claimed that the first sign of reconciliation should be the joint
                    settlement of the debt, they say that the people chose to pay their contribution
                    and bear their share of the loss, so that there should be no breach of the

                    requite your benefactors by repealing this law, will it not be strange if you

                        n="15"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Moreover, gentlemen, I think that you
                    would come to a sounder judgement in this matter if you would observe this
                    further truth, that the present law removes just the one advantage which the
                    rewards of a democracy have over those of other constitutions. For in the
                    material value to the recipients of the rewards bestowed, a tyranny or an
                    oligarchy has an immense advantage in that they can make anyone they choose
                    instantaneously rich; but in honor and in security of possession you will find
                    that the gifts of a democracy are to be preferred. <milestone unit="section"
                        n="16"/>For not the receipt of a flatterer's pay with its taint of shame,
                    but to be honored, where speech is free, as one who is deemed
                    worthy&mdash;that is true glory; and to enjoy the willing admiration of
                    equals seems better than to accept the richest gift from a tyrant's hand. For in
                    those communities the fear of tomorrow outweighs the favor of today, but in your
                    city a man could keep what he won without fear of loss, at any rate in time
                    past. <milestone unit="section" n="17"/>So the law which destroys confidence in
                    the rewards takes away the one thing that gives a higher value to rewards which
                    you bestow. And indeed, if from any one of all known forms of government you
                    take away the right of loyal supporters of the constitution to receive favors,
                    you will find that you have deprived those governments of no unimportant
                    safeguard. <milestone unit="section" n="18"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now
                    perhaps Leptines will try to divert your attention from these points and assert
                    that at present the public services fall upon the poor, but that under his law
                    they will be performed by the wealthiest class. At first hearing, the plea seems
                    to have some weight; but examine it strictly and the fallacy will be exposed.
                    For there are, as you know, among us some services that fall upon resident
                    aliens and others that fall upon citizens, and the exemption, which Leptines
                    would remove, has been granted in the case of both. For from special
                    contributions for war or for national defence and also from the equipment of
                    war-galleys, rightly and justly in accordance with earlier laws, no one is
                    exempt, not even the descendants of Harmodius and Aristogiton, whom Leptines has
                    specially named. <milestone unit="section" n="19"/>Let us then see what
                    additional contributors he provides to perform those public services, and how
                    many will be passed over if we turn a deaf ear to him. Now the richest citizens,
                    when equipping a war-galley, are already exempt from the ordinary services,
                    while those whose wealth is insufficient necessarily enjoy exemption and are out
                    of the reach of this tax; so his law will not provide us with another
                    contributor from either of these classes. <milestone unit="section" n="20"/>He
                    may reply that he recruits many aliens for the services. But if he can point to
                    five such, I will eat my words. I will assume, then, that this is not the case,
                    but that if the law stands, both the number of aliens performing public services
                    will be greater, and of the citizens none will be excused because he is
                    equipping a war-galley. Now let us consider what the State will gain if all
                    these perform the services, for it will prove to be no compensation at all for
                    the disgrace it will entail. <milestone unit="section" n="21"/>Put it thus. Of
                    aliens there are exempt&mdash;I will assume ten. And by Heaven, as I said
                    before, I do not believe there are five. Moreover of the citizens there are not
                    half a dozen. Sixteen of both, then. Let us call it twenty, or thirty, if you
                    like. How many, pray, are there that annually perform the regularly recurring
                    services&mdash;chorus-masters, presidents of gymnasia, and public hosts?
                    Perhaps sixty in all, or a trifle more. <milestone unit="section" n="22"/>In
                    order, then, that we may have thirty more men for the public services, spread
                    over the whole period,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">As there was a list of

                        a list of 600 for the regular services. At the rate of 60 a year, it would
                        take 10 years to work through the list, if the contributors were called upon
                        strictly in rotation by the officials of their respective tribes. Therefore
                        the outside estimate of 30 additional contributors, rendered available by
                        abolishing the immunities, would provide only 3 more each year; i.e. 3
                        citizens out of 60 would be relieved annually. In case of a real shortage of
                        qualified contributors, Demosthenes would prefer the adoption of the system,
                        first instituted for the trierarchy in 357, whereby the <date value="1200"
                            >1200</date> were divided into 20 companies &lpar;<foreign

                        was the system reformed at a later date by Demosthenes himself.</note> is it
                    worth our while to excite the distrust of all? But surely we must know this,
                    that as long as <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> stands, there
                    will be plenty of citizens, without fail, to perform the services, but not a
                    soul will want to do us a good turn, if he sees our previous benefactors
                    wronged. <milestone unit="section" n="23"/>So far, so good. But if there were
                    the most serious shortage of possible contributors, in Heaven's name, which
                    would you prefer&mdash;to organize syndicates for those services as for the
                    equipment of war-vessels, or to rob your benefactors of what you have given
                    them? I think I should prefer the syndicates. By the present law, while each of
                    these thirty is performing a public service, Leptines affords a respite for the
                    others, and that is all; after that, each of them will have to spend as much as
                    before; but in the other case, each would pay a small contribution, proportioned
                    to his means, and none would be hardly treated, even if his property were quite
                    small. <milestone unit="section" n="24"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now some
                    of our opponents, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, are
                    so illogical that they make no attempt to answer these arguments, but take a
                    different line, saying for instance how monstrous it is that on the one hand
                    there is nothing left in the Exchequer, but on the other hand private
                    individuals will grow wealthy because they have secured an immunity. But it is
                    not fair to combine both these statements. For if a man has great wealth without
                    doing you any wrong, there is surely no need to look on him with envy; but if
                    they are prepared to say that he has stolen it or gained it in some other
                    disreputable way, there are laws by which he can be suitably punished. But as
                    long as they do not prosecute him, neither have they any right to make this
                    allegation. <milestone unit="section" n="25"/>Further, with regard to the
                    alleged poverty of the Exchequer, you must reflect that you will not be a whit
                    the better off if you abolish these exemptions, for the expenditure on these
                    services has nothing to do with the revenues or the surplus of the State. And
                    apart from all this, of two possible advantages&mdash;wealth and credit with
                    the rest of the world&mdash;our State today enjoys the latter. But if anyone
                    imagines that because we have no money we need not also keep our honor bright,
                    his judgement is at fault. For myself indeed, I pray Heaven that, if so it may
                    be, our wealth also may increase, but if not, then at least that our reputation
                    for good faith and constancy may remain sure. <milestone unit="section" n="26"
                        /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now take the large fortunes which,
                    according to our opponents, some citizens will amass if relieved of the
                    services, but which I will show to be available for your needs. For of course
                    you are aware that no one is exempt from the equipment of war-galleys or from
                    the special contributions for war. So this person, whoever he may be, who owns
                    much, contributes much to those objects; there is no getting out of it. And
                    again, all would agree that the resources which the State can rely on for these
                    objects should be as great as possible. For money spent by the chorus-masters
                    affords those of us who are in the theater gratification for a fraction of a
                    day; but money lavished on equipment for war gives security to the whole city
                    for all time. <milestone unit="section" n="27"/>Therefore whatever you remit
                    with one hand, you receive with the other; and you grant as an honor exemptions
                    which even those who receive them cannot enjoy, if they have wealth sufficient
                    for the equipment of a war-vessel. But although I suppose you all know that no
                    one is exempt from the latter service, the clerk shall read to you the actual
                    statute. Take the law about the trierarchy and read this clause only.<quote

                    <milestone unit="section" n="28"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>You see,
                    Athenians, how explicitly the law lays down that none shall be exempt from the
                    equipment of a war-galley except the nine archons. So those whose wealth falls
                    short of the qualification for that service will contribute by groups to the
                    special war-tax, but those who reach that qualification will be available both
                    for the war-galleys and for the war-tax. Then what relief does your law,
                    Leptines, afford to the main body of citizens, if from one or two tribes it
                    provides a single contributor, who, having relieved one other citizen on one
                    occasion, will thereafter be exempt?<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">According
                        to Demosthemes' lowest estimate, there would be 5 or 6 citizens exempt:

                        the total of citizens presumably 10 or 12. If spread over the l0 tribes, the
                        lower estimate would give, roughly, one contributor for 2 tribes; and the
                        higher, one for each tribe.</note> I can see no relief. On the other hand it
                    taints the honor and credit of the whole State. Therefore, when the damage it
                    will inflict is greater than the benefit it confers, ought it not to be repealed
                    by this court? Such would be my verdict. <milestone unit="section" n="29"
                        /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>My next point is this, gentlemen of the
                    jury. The law of Leptines explicitly states that "none, whether citizen or
                    enfranchised alien or foreigner, shall be exempt," and does not specify from
                    what, whether from the public service or from any other charge, but simply that
                    "none shall be exempt except the descendants of Harmodius and Aristogiton." The
                    word "none" must be taken to include all classes, and foreigner is not further
                    defined as resident at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="30"/>It follows that Leptines deprives
                        Leucon,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Leucon, son and succesor of Satyrus,

                        services here describd, the Athenians had made him a citizen, voted him a

                    birth, though by adoption an Athenian citizen, but on neither ground can he
                    claim exemption, if this law stands. And yet, while of our other benefactors
                    each has made himself useful to us on one occasion, Leucon will be found on
                    reflection to be a perpetual benefactor, and that in a matter especially vital
                    to our city. <milestone unit="section" n="31"/>For you are aware that we consume

                    whole amount from all other places of export. And this is not surprising; for
                    not only is that district most productive of corn, but also Leucon, who controls
                    the trade, has granted exemption from dues to merchants conveying corn to
                        <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, and he proclaims that
                    those bound for your port shall have priority of lading. For Leucon, enjoying
                    exemption for himself and his children, has granted exemption to every one of
                    you. <milestone unit="section" n="32"/>See what this amounts to. He exacts a

                    to benefit you, but that you have repudiated them while they still stand; and
                    that is a far worse offence than to pull them down<note anchored="yes"

                    in ours? To me, at least, it seems so. For it is the custom of all nations, for
                    the sake of their benefactors, rather to include some bad men in their rewards,
                    than to make the worthless men an excuse for withholding their rewards from
                    those who are acknowledged to merit them. <milestone unit="section" n="40"/>Nay
                    more, upon consideration, I cannot even see why anyone should not, if he wishes,

                        service in his stead or to exchange properties. Demosthenes is here putting
                        an extreme case, for it is difficult to believe that an honorary citizen
                        like Leucon, resident elsewhere, could be called upon for a service, even
                        though he had wealth deposited at <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                            >Athens</placeName>.</note> For there is always property of his at

                    it is not merely necessary to consider how Leucon may be spared

                    sense of honor rather than from his needs&mdash;but we must also consider

                    the jury, you have heard from the decrees what were the services for which
                    Epicerdes obtained his immunity. Do not stop to ask whether he gave you a
                    hundred minae and a talent as well&mdash;for I expect that even those who
                    received it were not struck by the amount of his gift&mdash;but think of his
                    zeal, his spontaneous act, and the occasion that he chose. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="46"/>For recompense is due to all alike who are forward to
                    do us service, but in a special degree to those who are friends in time of need;
                    and such an one clearly was Epicerdes. Are we not then ashamed, men of
                        <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, if it appears that we
                    have retained no memory of these services and have robbed of their reward the

                        unit="section" n="47"/>For if those who were then saved by him and who
                    bestowed on him this immunity were a different generation from you who now
                    propose to take it away, yet that does not remove the infamy of the act; nay, it
                    is just there that its atrocity lies. For if those who knew and experienced his
                    generosity felt that it merited this return, while we, who have only heard the
                    story told, shall revoke the gift as undeserved, shall we not be guilty of more
                    than ordinary atrocity? <milestone unit="section" n="48"/>Now my plea is the
                    same in this case as for those who overthrew the Four Hundred, and for those who
                    proved helpful to the democrats in exile; for I think they would all be
                    atrociously treated if any portion of the rewards then decreed to them should be

                    any of you is persuaded that our city is far from needing such a benefactor

                    him also reflect, first, that he is going to give his vote on a law under which,
                    if unrepealed, he will have to live, and secondly, that bad laws can injure even
                    communities which fancy they are dwelling in security. For there would have been
                    no changes for better or for worse in the fortunes of states, had it not been
                    that a nation in peril is guided to safety by good policy, good laws, and good
                    citizens and by the observance of order in all things, but in the case of a
                    nation that seems established in perfect prosperity, all these things, being
                    neglected, slip away from it little by little. <milestone unit="section" n="50"

                    but they do not take the trouble to guard it by the same means. Let not this
                    mistake be yours today, and do not think that you ought to ratify a law which
                    will taint the reputation of our city in the time of her prosperity and, if ever

                    times&mdash;whether as an eye-witness or hearing the story from one who
                    knew&mdash;if he should hear this law which revokes the gifts that were then
                    bestowed, how he would denounce the baseness of us who made the
                    law&mdash;and who were so generous and obliging when our need was pressing,
                    but when we have satisfied all our hopes, are so thankless and churlish that we
                    have robbed men of the rewards they enjoy, and have made a law that hereafter
                    no, such rewards should be bestowed! <milestone unit="section" n="56"
                    />&ldquo;Oh but,&rdquo; we shall be told, &ldquo;some of those who
                    received these rewards did not deserve them&rdquo;; for that thought will
                    run through all their argument. In that case shall we confess that we do not
                    know that a man's deserts should be examined at the time of the reward, and not
                    an indefinitely long time after? For to give no reward in the first instance is
                    an exercise of judgement; to take it away when given shows a grudging spirit,
                    and you must not seem to have been prompted by that. <milestone unit="section"
                        n="57"/>Furthermore, on the question of merit I shall not shrink from saying
                    this to you: I for one do not think that merit should be examined by the State
                    in the same way as by an individual, because the examination is not concerned
                    with the same questions. For in private life each of us tries to find who is
                    worthy, say, to marry into our family, or something of that sort, and such
                    questions are determined by convention and opinion; but in public affairs the
                    State and the people try to find who is their benefactor and savior, and that
                    question you will find is best decided by reference not to birth or opinion, but
                    to plain fact. So, whenever we want to receive benefits, are we to allow anyone
                    to confer them, but when we have received them, then shall we scrutinize the
                    merits of the benefactor? That will be a topsy-turvy policy. <milestone

                    the only sufferers will be those I have mentioned, and all my remarks apply to
                    them alone. That is quite untrue. But I could not even attempt to examine all
                    the instances of men who have benefited you, but who by this law, if it is not
                    repealed, will be robbed of their rewards; by calling your attention to one or
                    two further decrees, I absolve myself from discussing these cases. <milestone

                        <milestone unit="section" n="73"/>You will realize this if you compare the
                    way in which Themistocles, the most famous man of his age, accomplished the same
                    result. Now history tells us that Themistocles bade his countrymen get on with

                        >Sparta</placeName>, while he went off himself on an embassy to the
                    Lacedaemonians; and while negotiations went on there and the news kept coming
                    that the Athenians were fortifying, he denied it and told them to send envoys to
                    see for themselves, and when these envoys did not return, he urged them to send
                    more. Indeed, I expect you have all heard the story of how he hoodwinked them.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="74"/>Now I assert&mdash;and I earnestly
                    appeal to you, Athenians, not to take offence at what is coming, but to consider
                    whether it is true&mdash;I assert that in proportion as openness is better
                    than secrecy, and it is more honorable to gain one's end by victory than by
                    trickery, so <persName><surname>Conon</surname></persName> deserves more credit
                    than Themistocles for building the walls. For the latter achieved it by evading
                    those who would have prevented it, but the former by beating them in battle.
                    Therefore it is not right that so great a man should be wronged by you, or
                    should gain less than those orators who will try to prove that you ought to

                    any of you, gentlemen of the jury, that this man, who captured so many cities
                    and ships from your enemies by his victories on sea, and who was the source of
                    so much honor, but never of disgrace, to your city, deserves to be deprived of
                    the immunity which he obtained at your hands and bequeathed to his son? I cannot
                    believe it, for it is out of all reason. Had he lost a single city or as few as
                    ten ships, Leptines and his supporters would have impeached him for high
                    treason, and if he had been convicted, he would have been a ruined man for ever.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="80"/>But since, on the contrary, he took
                    seventeen cities, and captured seventy ships and three thousand prisoners, and
                    paid into the treasury a hundred and ten talents, and set up so many trophies,
                    in that case shall not his rewards for these services stand good? Moreover,
                    Athenians, it will be seen that Chabrias during his lifetime did everything in
                    your behalf, and that he met death itself in no other service; so that for this,
                    as well as for all that he did in his life, you ought to show yourselves
                    generously disposed to his son. <milestone unit="section" n="81"/>Then this too,
                    Athenians, demands your consideration&mdash;that we must not prove less
                    generous than the Chians in our treatment of our benefactors. For if they,
                    against whom Chabrias carried arms as an enemy, have not now revoked any of
                    their former gifts, but have made ancient services outweigh recent offences,
                    while you, in whose cause he marched against them to his death, so far from
                    honoring him the more on that account, are even going to rob him of part of the
                    reward of his past services, how will you escape the ignominy that you deserve?
                        <milestone unit="section" n="82"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Moreover,
                    should the son be robbed of part of his reward, his treatment would be
                    undeserved in view of the fact that no man's child was ever orphaned through the
                    fault of Chabrias, though he frequently led you in war, but the boy himself has
                    grown up an orphan, just because of his father's devotion to your cause. For to
                    me he seems truly to have been such a staunch patriot, that though reputed to be
                    the most cautious of commanders, as indeed he was, it was for your sake that he
                    displayed that quality whenever he led you, but for his own sake, when he found
                    himself assigned to the post of danger, he forgot all his caution and preferred
                    to lay down his life rather than tarnish the honors that you had bestowed.

                    to Timotheus, you also for his sake rewarded Clearchus and some others with the

                    alone. Now, if at the time when he was receiving his reward, he had claimed that

                    sake you should reward some of those men who have actually received the
                    immunity, but to whom our opponents object so strongly that they want all alike
                    to be deprived of it, would you not have granted him that boon? I cannot doubt

                    then; yet now, on their account, will you take away the immunity from Chabrias
                    himself? Why, that is absurd! For it is inconsistent to seem so generous, when
                    the benefits are recent, that you honor not the benefactors only but their
                    friends as well, but, when a short time has elapsed, to take away even the

                    laws now in force contain this provision&mdash;a capital one, men of

                    Equitable too, by all the powers! So Leptines should not have proposed his own
                    law until he had indicted and repealed this. As it is, neglecting proof of his
                    own violation of the law, he nevertheless proceeded to legislate, in face of the
                    fact that another law proclaims his law indictable for this very offence,
                    namely, for contradicting previous legislation. Here is the very law in
                        question.<quote type="Law">

                    law, Athenians, and you understand that it enables the deserving to retain their
                    rewards, and those who are judged otherwise to be deprived of any privilege they
                    have unjustly secured; for the future everything is left in your hands, as is
                    right, to grant or to withhold. Now I do not think that Leptines will deny that
                    this law is sound and just, or, if he does, that he will be able to prove it.
                    But perhaps he will try to lead you astray by repeating what he said before the
                    junior archons.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">At the <foreign lang="greek"
                            >a)na/krisis</foreign> or preliminary trial.</note> For he alleged that
                    the publication of this amended law was a mere trick, and that should his own
                    law be repealed, this one would never be passed. <milestone unit="section"
                        n="99"/>Now, to avoid dispute, I will not press the point that the old law
                    of Solon, in accordance with which the junior archons have notified these
                    amendments to you, clearly enjoins that if the law of Leptines is repealed by
                    your vote, the alternative law shall be valid.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb"
                        >We may conjecture that the old law &lpar;that if the original statute
                        was condemned, the amendment baecame law ipso facto&rpar; had in
                        practice been superseded.</note> I will pass to another point. Leptines, in
                    saying this, obviously admits that our law is better and fairer than his own,
                    but bases his argument on the way in which it is to be passed. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="100"/>Now, in the first place, there are many ways open to
                    him, if he wishes, of compelling the amender to introduce his own law. In the
                    next place, Phormio and myself and anyone else he likes to name are prepared to
                    guarantee that we will introduce it. You know there is a law making death the
                    penalty for anyone who breaks his promise to the Assembly or one of the Councils
                    or law-courts. You have our guarantee, our promise. Let the archons record it,
                    and let the matter rest in their hands. <milestone unit="section" n="101"
                    />Neither do anything that is unworthy of this court, nor, if a worthless person
                    is found among those who enjoy the grant, let him keep it; only let each case be
                    judged on its merits. But if Leptines shall say that that is all talk and
                    humbug, this at any rate is not mere talk; let him bring in the amended law
                    himself and cease to say that we will not do so. It is surely a greater honor to
                    propose the law, stamped with your approval,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb"
                        >Demosthenes is a trifle premature here.</note> than this of his own

                    seems to me, Athenians, that Leptines&mdash;and pray, be not angry,<note

                    for I am not going to say anything offensive about you&mdash;Leptines has
                    either never read Solon's laws or else does not understand them. For if Solon
                    made a law that every man could grant his property to whomsoever he pleased, in
                    default of legitimate offspring, not with the object of depriving the next of
                    kin of their rights of consanguinity, but that by making the prize open to all
                    he might excite a rivalry in doing good one to another; <milestone
                        unit="section" n="103"/>and if you, on the contrary, have proposed a law
                    that the people shall not be permitted to bestow on any man any part of what is
                    their own, how can you be said to have read or understood the laws of Solon? You
                    make the nation barren of would-be patriots by proclaiming unmistakably that
                    those who benefit us shall gain nothing by it. <milestone unit="section" n="104"
                    />Again, there is another excellent law of Solon, forbidding a man to speak ill
                    of the dead, even if he is himself defamed by the dead man's children. You do
                    not speak ill of our departed benefactors, Leptines; you do ill to them, when

                    use some such argument as this. The Lacedaemonians, who are a well-organized
                    state, and the Thebans grant no such reward to any of their citizens, and yet
                    possibly there are some good men among them. In my opinion, men of <placeName
                        key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, all such arguments are provocative,
                    and intended to persuade you to abolish the immunities, but just they are
                    certainly not. For I am quite aware that the Thebans and the Lacedaemonians and
                    ourselves do not observe the same laws and customs, nor the same form of
                    government. <milestone unit="section" n="106"/>For in the first place, if this
                    is their argument, they are about to do exactly what a man cannot do at
                    Sparta&mdash;praise the laws of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName> or of any other state; nay, so far from that, he is
                    obliged to praise, as well as do, whatever accords with his native constitution.
                    Then again, though the Lacedaemonians do not hold with these customs, yet there
                    are other honors at <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, which
                    our citizens to a man would shrink from introducing here. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="107"/>What, then, are those honors? Not to take each
                    singly, I will describe one which comprises all the rest. Whenever a man for his
                    good conduct is elected to the Senate, or Gerusia, as they call it, he is
                    absolute master of the mass of citizens. For at <placeName key="perseus,Sparta"
                        >Sparta</placeName> the prize of merit is to share with one's peers the
                    supremacy in the State; but with us the people is supreme, and any other form of
                    supremacy is forbidden by imprecations<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">At the
                        opening of every meeting of the Assembly and of the Council a herald recited
                        a curse on enemies of the State and on evil counsellors; see <bibl
                            n="Dem. 19.70">Dem. 19.70</bibl>.</note> and laws and other safeguards,
                    but we have crowns of honor and immunities and free maintenance and similar
                    rewards, which anyone may win, if he is a good citizen. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="108"/>And both these customs are right enough, the one at
                        <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> and the other here. Why?
                    Because in an oligarchy harmony is attained by the equality of those who control
                    the State, but the freedom of a democracy is guarded by the rivalry with which
                    good citizens compete for the rewards offered by the people. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="109"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Again, with regard to
                    the absence of honors at <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, I
                    think I can express the truth thus. The Thebans, men of <placeName
                        key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, plume themselves more on brutality
                    and iniquity than you on humanity and love of justice. If a prayer may be
                    allowed, may they never cease to withhold honor and admiration from those who do
                    them service, or to deal with kindred states in the same way &lpar;For you
                    remember how they treated <placeName key="tgn,7011034"

                    honoring your benefactors and winning your rights from your fellow-citizens by
                    debate and in harmony with the laws! <milestone unit="section" n="110"/>And in
                    general, I think that then only ought you to praise the habits and character of
                    other nations and decry your own, when it is possible to prove that they are
                    more prosperous than you. As long as you &lpar;thank Heaven!&rpar; are
                    more prosperous than they, in public policy, in internal harmony, and in every
                    other way, why should you belittle your national institutions and imitate
                    theirs? Even if theirs could be proved superior in theory, yet the good fortune
                    that you have enjoyed under your own institutions makes it worth your while to
                    retain them. <milestone unit="section" n="111"/>Besides all this, if I must say
                    what I think is right, I would put it in this way. It is not right, Athenians,
                    to cite the laws of the Lacedaemonians or of the Thebans in order to undermine
                    the laws established here; it is not right that you should want to put a man to
                    death for transplanting to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>
                    any of the institutions that have made those nations great, and yet lend a
                    willing ear to those who propose to destroy the institutions under which our
                    democracy has flourished. <milestone unit="section" n="112"/><milestone
                        unit="para" ed="P"/>Then they have another argument ready; that even at
                        <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> in former generations men
                    who had rendered great services met with no recognition of this sort, but were
                    content with an inscription in the Hermes-Portico.<note anchored="yes"
                        resp="Loeb">In the Agora. The inscription &lpar;quoted by <bibl

                    opinion, Athenians, this argument is in many ways prejudicial to the State,
                    besides being unjust. <milestone unit="section" n="113"/>For if anyone says that
                    even these men deserved no honor, let him say who does deserve it, if there is
                    no one either before or after them. If he shall say "no one," I should be very
                    sorry for our city, if no one in the course of its history has proved worthy of
                    reward. Again, if while admitting their merit he points out that they got
                    nothing by it, assuredly he accuses the city of ingratitude. But that is not the
                    truth or anything like it; but whenever a man maliciously gives a wrong twist to
                    his arguments, I think they must appear hateful. <milestone unit="section"
                        n="114"/>I, however, will explain the case to you, as truth and justice
                    demand. There were, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>,
                    plenty of zealous citizens in former generations, and our city even then honored
                    its good men; only honors then, like everything else, reflected the temper of
                    the times, just as they now reflect the temper of today. And why do I say this?
                    Because for myself I should be inclined to assert that they did get from the
                    State everything that they wished. <milestone unit="section" n="115"/>What is my
                    evidence? Lysimachus,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Son of Aristides the just,
                        pensioned for his father's merits.</note> only one of the worthies of that

                    silver and a pension of four drachmas a day. And the decree in which these gifts
                    are recorded stands in the name of Alcibiades. For then our city was rich in
                    lands and money, though now&mdash;she will be rich some day<note

                    put it in that way to avoid anything like obloquy. Yet today who, think you,
                    would not prefer a third of that reward to mere immunity? To prove the truth of
                    my words, please take the decree. <quote type="Decree">

                    another matter. So even if we should admit that neither Lysimachus nor anyone
                    else gained anything from our ancestors, does that make it any fairer in us to

                    bestowed, and you too have my leave to do the same, though the disgrace remains
                    none the less; but if no one can cite an instance from the whole course of our

                        >Sparta</placeName> or <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>,
                    nor those of our earliest ancestors, but those under which immunities were

                    there are no statutes to guide you, you are sworn to decide according to the
                    best of your judgement. So far, so good. Then you must apply these principles to
                    the law as a whole. <milestone unit="section" n="119"/>Is it right, Athenians,
                    to honor your benefactors? It is. Well then, is it right to allow a man to keep
                    what has once been given him? It is. Then, to observe your oaths, act on that
                    principle yourselves; resent the imputation that your ancestors acted otherwise;
                    and as for those who cite such instances, alleging that your ancestors rewarded
                    no man for great benefits received, look upon them as both knaves and
                    dullards&mdash;knaves, because they falsely charge your ancestors with
                    ingratitude; fools, because they do not see that were the charge proved to the
                    hilt, it would better become them to deny than to repeat it. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="120"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now I expect that
                    another argument of Leptines will be that his law does not deprive the
                    recipients of their inscriptions and their free maintenance, nor the State of
                    the right to confer honor on those who deserve it, but that it will still be in
                    your power to set up statues and grant maintenance and anything else you wish,
                    except this one privilege. But with respect to the powers that he will pretend
                    to leave to the State, I have just this to say. As soon as you take away one of
                    the privileges you have already granted, you will shake the credit of all the
                    rest. For how can the grant of a statue or of free maintenance be more
                    indefeasible than that of an immunity, which you will seem to have first given
                    and then taken away? <milestone unit="section" n="121"/>Further, even if this
                    difficulty were not likely to arise, I cannot think that it is well to bring the
                    State into this dilemma, that it must either put all citizens on an equality
                    with its greatest benefactors, or to avoid this must treat some with
                    ingratitude. Now as for great benefactions, it is not well that you should have
                    many opportunities of receiving them, nor is it perhaps easy for an individual
                    to confer them; <milestone unit="section" n="122"/>but the humbler duties to
                    which one can rise in time of peace and in the civil sphere&mdash;loyalty,
                    justice, zeal and the like&mdash;it is, in my opinion, both well and
                    necessary that they should be rewarded. Grants ought, therefore, to be so
                    apportioned that each man may receive from the people the exact reward that he
                    deserves. <milestone unit="section" n="123"/>And then again, with regard to what
                    he will say about leaving their honors to those who have received them, some
                    would have a perfectly plain and straightforward answer, when they claim their
                    right to all their rewards, because they were granted for the same service, but
                    the others will reply that the man who says that he leaves them anything is
                    mocking them.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">"Some" have received other rewards
                        together with immunity; "the others" immunity alone.</note> For if a man has
                    been thought to deserve immunity and has received that from you as his sole
                    reward, be he foreigner or citizen, what reward has he left, Leptines, if that
                    is taken from him? None whatever! Then you have no right to rob some because you
                    arraign the worthlessness of the others, or to rob one class of their sole
                    reward because you say that you are going to leave the other class something.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="124"/>To put it plainly, the danger is not that
                    of doing a greater or less injustice to one member of the whole body, but that
                    of rendering precarious the honors with which we reward men's services, nor is
                    immunity the main topic of my speech, but the evil precedent which this law will
                    establish, so that there will be no security for the nation's gifts. <milestone
                        unit="section" n="125"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Again, the most
                    unscrupulous argument that they have framed, as they think, to persuade you to
                    withdraw the immunities, is one which I had better explain for fear you should
                    be their innocent dupes. They are going to claim that all such payments are
                    religious dues, and that of course it is monstrous that anyone should be exempt
                    from the dues of religion. For my part, I see no unfairness in such exemption,
                    if the people have bestowed it; the really monstrous thing is the course which
                    they propose, if that is to be their argument. <milestone unit="section" n="126"
                    />For if by appealing to the name of the gods they try to justify a robbery
                    which they cannot justify otherwise, will not that be most impious and monstrous
                    conduct? In my opinion, whenever a man appeals solemnly to the gods, his conduct
                    ought to be clearly such as would not appear base even if supported only by
                    human authority. Now that there is a difference between exemption from religious
                    duties and exemption from public services, and that the defendants are trying to
                    deceive you by transferring the name of public services to religious acts, I
                    shall adduce Leptines himself as my witness. For the first clause of the law
                    says <milestone unit="section" n="127"/>"Leptines proposed that, to the end that
                    the wealthiest citizens may perform the public services, none shall be immune
                    save and except the descendants of Harmodius and Aristogiton." But if immunity
                    from religious duties were the same as immunity from public services, what was
                    the object of that clause? For immunity from religious duties has never been
                    granted even to the persons here named. To prove that this is so, please take
                    and read the copy of the inscription and then the beginning of the law of
                        Leptines.<quote type="Copy of Stela Inscription">
                        <title>Copy of Stela Inscription</title>

                    Now read the beginning of the law of Leptines.<quote type="Law">

                    end that the wealthiest citizens may perform the public services," he added "no
                    one shall be immune save and except, the descendants of Harmodius and
                    Aristogiton." Why so, if to pay for a religious rite is to perform a public
                    service? For if that is his meaning, his own drafting will be found to
                    contradict the inscription. <milestone unit="section" n="129"/>Now I should like
                    to put a question to Leptines. When you say that the public services come under
                    the head of religious dues, in what, according to you, did the immunity consist,
                    which our ancestors then granted and you now leave untouched? For by the old
                    laws they are not immune from all the special war-taxes or from the equipment of
                    war-galleys; and they enjoy no immunity from the state services, since they are
                    included in the religious duties. <milestone unit="section" n="130"/>And yet the
                    inscription says that they shall be immune. From what? From the tax on resident
                    aliens, since nothing else is left? Of course not. It is from the regularly
                    recurring services, as the inscription shows, as your law further specifies, and
                    as all history witnesses. During all that length of time no tribe has ever
                    ventured to nominate one of these descendants as chorus-master, and no one
                    nominated has ever ventured to challenge them to an exchange of property. If
                    Leptines dares to deny it, you must pay no heed to him. <milestone

                    it is one thing to be a Friend of the State and another to enjoy immunity. Be
                    not misled by them. Because slaves, like Lycidas and Dionysius and perhaps one
                    other, were made Friends of the State by men who are readily bribed to propose
                    such decrees, they must not try to take away the gifts that you have justly
                    bestowed on men of a different class&mdash;mentorious, freeborn, munificent

                    excuse for taking back rewards conferred on the master, and that on a false
                    plea! For neither Lycidas nor anyone else enjoys immunity as a Friend of the
                    State, unless such immurity has been expressly conferred by the people. The men
                    in question have not received it; I defy the defendants to prove it. If they
                    have the effrontery to assert it, they will be acting dishonorably. <milestone

                    of a matter about which I feel bound, Athenians, to warn you most seriously. For
                    even if one could admit the truth of all that Leptines will say in praise of his
                    law, it would be impossible under any circumstances to wipe out one disgrace
                    which his law, if ratified, will bring upon our city. To what do I refer? To the
                    reputation of having cheated our benefactors. <milestone unit="section" n="135"
                    />Now I think you would all agree that this is a distinct disgrace; how much
                    worse in you than in others, hear me explain. You have an ancient law, one held
                    in great respect, that if anyone deceives the people by false promises, he shall
                    be brought to trial, and if convicted shall be punished with death. And are you
                    not then ashamed, Athenians, to find yourselves doing the very thing for which
                    you punish other men with death? Nay, but in everything it is right to take heed
                    against doing whatever seems or is dishonorable, but especially in cases where a
                    man is seen to be indignant with others. For there is no room left even for
                    hesitation in avoiding acts which a man's own judgement has already condemned.

                    who admire bravery, not of men who envy the honors that bravery wins. Next, you
                    have from time immemorial given the richest rewards to those who win crowns in
                    the athletic games; nor, because such honors are necessarily confined to a few,
                    have you grudged or stinted the honors of the victors on that account. Beside
                    these notable instances, no one, I think, has ever surpassed our State in
                    generosity; such a superabundance of rewards has she heaped on those who serve

                    fair fame that has been yours in every age; do not suppose that anything else is
                    at stake in this trial save the honor of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"

                        unit="para" ed="P"/>But of all the astonishing features of Leptines' law,
                    what astonishes me most is his ignorance of the fact that just as a man who
                    assigns heavy penalties for offences would be unlikely to have contemplated an
                    offence himself, so one who abolishes the rewards for benefactions will not
                    himself be likely to have contemplated a good deed. Now if, as is just possible,
                    he did not know this, he will at once confess it by allowing you to repeal the
                    law which embodies his own error, but if he shows himself obstinate and eager to
                    ratify the law, I for one cannot praise him, though I refrain from censure.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="144"/>Then be not stubborn, Leptines; do not
                    insist on a course which will not add to your own reputation or that of your
                    supporters, especially as this trial no longer endangers you. For owing to the
                    death of the father of Apsephion here, Bathippus, who indicted Leptines when he
                    was still liable, the legal period has elapsed, and now our whole concern is
                    with the law, and its proposer runs no risk.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">See

                    however, that you assert that three distinct persons indicted you before

                    they did not endanger you, you must be fonder of danger than other people, but
                    if you bring it forward as a proof of the justice of your proposals, you are
                    doing a very silly thing. For how is your law improved by the fact that one of
                    those who indicted you died before he could come into court, or was induced by
                    you to drop the charge, or even was simply suborned by you? But I am ashamed

                        Leptines as a fifth, to defend the law. Aristophon, the best known, was the
                        leading Athenian statesman before the rise of Eubulus. He was now nearly
                        eighty years old, and could boast that he had been 75 times defendant in a
                            <foreign lang="greek">grafh\ parano/mwn</foreign> and had always

                    other things the gift of immunity, and when his case came before you, he lost
                    it. <milestone unit="section" n="147"/>Now the laws forbid the same man to be
                    tried twice on the same issue, be it a civil action, a scrutiny, a contested
                    claim, or anything else of the sort. But quite apart from all this, it would be
                    a most absurd result if on the first occasion the services of Chabrias
                    outweighed the arguments of Leodamas, but when to his services were added those
                    of all the other benefactors, then the combined effect should be weaker than the
                    arguments. <milestone unit="section" n="148"/>To Aristophon I think I could
                    raise many sound objections. He obtained his grant, which included immunity, by
                    your votes. I find no fault with that, for it is right that you should have it
                    in your power to bestow what is yours on anyone you please. But I do suggest
                    that it is unfair that he should raise no objection when he was going to receive
                    it himself, but when it has been given to others, he should take offence and
                    urge you to withdraw it. <milestone unit="section" n="149"/>Moreover it was
                    Aristophon who proposed to pay Gelarchus five talents for sums advanced to the

                        Gelarchus is not otherwise known. There were, apparently, no witnesses to
                        his gift.</note>; and he was right. Then, my friend, if you recommended the
                    repayment of unattested sums on the ground of service done to the people, you
                    must not advise the revocation of grants for services which the people
                    themselves attested by inscriptions in the temples, and which are indeed known
                    to all men. You must not exhibit yourself as at the same time proposing that
                    debts ought to be paid, and urging that a man should be deprived of what he has
                    won at the hands of the people. <milestone unit="section" n="150"/>Next, I have
                    this much to say to Cephisodotus. As an orator, men of <placeName

                    would be far more honorable to use his talents for the chastisement of
                    evil-doers than for the injury of those who deserve well. If he must make
                    enemies, I suggest that they should be those who injure the people, not those
                    who benefit them. <milestone unit="section" n="151"/>Then as to Dinias. Perhaps
                    he will tell you of the war-galleys he has equipped and of his other public
                    services. For my part, though Dinias has proved himself a valuable servant of
                    the public, as I sincerely believe, I would urge him rather to claim from you
                    some reward for himself than to tell you to take back rewards previously given
                    to others; for a man gives a surer proof of excellence by claiming a reward for
                    his own services than by grudging others the rewards they have received for
                    theirs. <milestone unit="section" n="152"/>But the most effective retort is one
                    which applies to all the commissioners alike. Each one of them has often before
                    served as commissioner for some business or other. Now you have a very sound
                    law&mdash;not, of course, directed against these men, but framed to prevent
                    any commissioner from using his opportunity for profit or
                    blackmail&mdash;that no one, elected by the people, be permitted to serve as
                    commissioner more than once. <milestone unit="section" n="153"/>Surely those who
                    are going to advocate a law and urge its necessity ought to show themselves
                    ready to obey existing laws; otherwise it is absurd for them to defend one law
                    as commissioners and violate another themselves. Take and read the law which I

                    laws, but especially of those on which depends the strength or weakness of our
                    State. And which are they? They are those which assign rewards to those who do
                    good and punishments to those who do evil. For in truth, if from fear of legal
                    penalties all men shunned wrongdoing, and if from ambition for the rewards of
                    good service all chose the path of duty, what prevents our city from being great
                    and all our citizens honest, with not a rogue among them? <milestone

                    Leptines, Athenians, does harm not only by abolishing the rewards of good
                    service and so rendering fruitless the good intentions of those who are
                    ambitious for honor, but also by leaving our city under the serious reproach of
                    imbecility. For you are of course aware that for each grave offence a single
                    penalty is provided by the law, which says explicitly that &ldquo;at any
                    trial there shall be not more than one assessment of penalty, whichever the
                    court imposes, whether a personal punishment or a fine, but not both.&rdquo;
                        <milestone unit="section" n="156"/>But Leptines has used a different measure
                    and says that if anyone claims a return from you, &ldquo;he shall be
                    disfranchised, and his property shall be confiscated.&rdquo; There you have
                    two penalties. &ldquo;The process shall be by laying information or by
                    summary arrest; and if he be convicted, he shall be liable under the law which
                    provides for the case of a man holding office while in debt to the
                    treasury.&rdquo; Death is what he means, for such is the punishment in that
                    case. Why, here are three penalties!<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">All this is

                        penalties assessed by the courts, not to those prescribed by statute.
                        Lastly, the so-called third penalty was imposed for the additional offence
                        of contempt, where one who had incurred <foreign lang="greek"

                    humanity is arrayed against envy, justice against malice, and all that is good
                    against all that is most base. <milestone unit="section" n="166"/>If you yield
                    to the nobler impulse and cast your votes with us, you will win for yourselves
                    the credit, and for the State the benefit, of a righteous verdict, and if ever
                    occasion arises, you will not lack friends willing to encounter risk in your
                    behalf. I ask you, therefore, to take all these considerations seriously to
                    heart and to beware that you are not forced into an error of judgement. For on
                    many occasions, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, the
                    justice of the case has not been brought home to you, but a verdict has been
                    wrested from you by the clamor, the violence and the shamelessness of the
                    pleaders. Let not that be your case today, for that would be unworthy of you;
                        <milestone unit="section" n="167"/>but hold fast to what you are convinced
                    is just, and bear it in mind until you vote, so that true to your oaths you may
                    cast your votes against the counsels of the wicked. If you punish with death
                    those who debase the coinage, I shall be surprised if you lend an ear to men who
                    render our whole State base and counterfeit. By all the gods, I will not believe
                    it of you. <milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I think I need say no more, for I
                    believe you understand all my arguments.</p>
