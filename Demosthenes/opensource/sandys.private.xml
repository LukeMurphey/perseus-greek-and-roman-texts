          <head>From the preface to the first edition.</head>
          <p>MY earliest interest in the Private Orations may be said to date from the time when it
            was my privilege as an undergraduate to attend, in the year 1865, a course of lectures
            by my friend Mr Moss, then Fellow and Lecturer of St John's College, and now Head-Master
            of Shrewsbury School. His selections included two of the six speeches edited in the
            present volume, the <title>Nicostratus</title> and the <title>Conon</title>; but, as the
            notes taken down from his lectures were too scanty to form even the basis of any attempt
            at constructing a complete edition, my commentary on those speeches has been mainly the
            result of independent reading and research, though I gladly acknowledge the help that is
            due to his soundness of judgment on several points on which I have consulted him while
            revising my notes on the <title>Conon.</title> In the case of the
              <title>Nicostratus,</title> when my own commentary was nearly ready for the press, I
            had the further advantage of attending in the spring of 1874 some of Dr Kennedy's
            professorial lectures on the Private Orations. From the excellent translation of his
            brother Mr Charles Rann Kennedy I have here and there quoted a few extracts; and if I
            have now and then drawn attention to an apparently erroneous interpretation, I have done
            so with the consciousness that in each case it is only a trifling blemish in what is
            nearly perfect of its kind. Similarly, several questionable explanations, retained even
            in the sixth edition of Liddell and Scott's <title>Lexicon,</title> have been duly
            pointed out in the course of my commentary, as it is only thus that a labourer in a
            limited field can offer any acknowledgement of his large indebtedness to their
              labours<note anchored="yes">
              <p>Some of these have since been corrected in the seventh edition.</p>
            </note>. The <pb n="vi"/> lexicography of Demosthenes cannot indeed be said to be at
            present in a completely satisfactory condition, as general lexicons have still to rely
            in a great measure on Reiske's <title>Index Graecitatis,</title> which, with the portion
            of his <foreign lang="la">opus magnum</foreign> including his notes on the speeches in
            this volume, was posthumously published exactly a century ago.<note anchored="yes">Some
              of these have since been corrected in the seventh edition.</note></p>
          <p>The volume opens with a speech on behalf of Phormion, in bar of a claim on the part of
            Apollodorus for the recovery of capital alleged to have been transferred to Phormion by
            Pasion, the father of Apollodorus. This is followed by two on behalf of Phormion's
            opponent Apollodorus, charging with false witness one of the deponents called on
            Phormion's side in the previous trial. These three speeches, though not actually
            delivered in the same lawsuit, virtually represent the arguments of the two opposite
            sides, and a comparison of their conflicting statements has an interest similar in kind,
            though different in degree, to that derived from reading the longer and more important
            orations of Demosthenes, <title>On the Embassy</title> and <title>On the Crown,</title>
            in contrast with those of his great rival Aeschines. The orations of Antiphon, the
            earliest of the Attic Orators, include indeed four sets of ingenious speeches written
            for the prosecution and the defence in cases of homicide, but his cases are merely
            imaginary, and the orations are intended as rhetorical exercises alone. The first three
            selections in this volume supply us with the only instance in all the remains of Attic
            oratory, where the legal issues raised on both sides in a suit of purely private
            interest lie before us as they were actually presented to an Athenian tribunal. Whether
            Demosthenes actually wrote for both sides is a vexed question, briefly discussed in the
            course of the <pb n="vii"/> Introduction; it is a question that has provoked a large
            number of dissertations, the titles of which I have recorded on a page devoted to a
            conspectus of the literature of the subject up to the present date. But the volume now
            published, while it happens to be the first English commentary on any of the selections
            included in it, is also the first attempt either in England or elsewhere to put together
            an edition of all these three speeches in their connexion with one another<note
              anchored="yes">
              <p>Since the above was written the <title>Index Demosthenicus</title> of S. Preuss has
                been published by Teubner, 1895.</p>
            </note>. As compared with the work demanded by the second half of this volume, where I
            have been conscious of moving more freely over ground familiarised by more frequent
            reading of that portion with private pupils between 1867 and 1870, and for public
            lectures at a later date, the task of writing the first half has proved a somewhat
            tedious one, owing partly to the necessity of constantly keeping in view all the nine
            speeches in which Phormion's opponent, Apollodorus, is more or less directly concerned,
            and of forming an opinion on the numerous points of literary criticism and chronological
            detail involved in the controversy on the authorship of those orations.</p>
          <p>Those who, after finishing the <title>pro Phormione,</title> do not care to study
            minutely the whole of the two speeches against Stephanus, ought, at the very least, to
            examine the vigorous attack on Phormion which extends from &sect; 71 to &sect;
            82 of the first of those two speeches. They should also endeavour to obtain a connected
            view of the argument by reading consecutively the italicised abstracts inserted at
            suitable intervals in the course of the commentary. With the help of these abstracts the
            general reader, the barrister, for instance, who has not <pb n="viii"/> remembered all
            the Greek of his younger days, may perhaps, if tempted to dip into these pages, form
            some opinion of his own on the forensic oratory of Athens; but my more immediate object
            in this part of my work has been to obviate any occasion for unduly burdening the notes
            with those literal renderings which are always welcome to students of the less
            industrious sort, by supplying instead either a free paraphrase or a condensed summary,
            as the occasion requires.</p>
          <p>The latter half of the volume includes the <title>Nicostratus,</title> which was
            delivered by the same speaker as the two orations against Stephanus, namely by
            Apollodorus, and also the <title>Conon,</title> which is certainly one of the most
            celebrated of the minor speeches of Demosthenes. To these selections, both of which
            throw much light on the social life of Athens, I have added the
              <title>Callicles,</title> which, though less well known than the others, will be found
            one of the pleasantest, while it happens to be the shortest, of all the Private
            Orations.</p>
          <p>The first volume of the Select Private Orations includes the speeches <title>contra
              Phormionem</title> (Or. 34), <title>Lacritum</title> (35), <title>Pantaenetum</title>
            (37), <title>Boeotum de nomine</title> (39), <title>Boeotum de dote</title> (40), and
              <title>Dionysodorum</title> (56). In the preface to that volume it has been already
            explained that the two volumes are a joint edition on the part of Mr Paley and myself,
            and I may here repeat that while Mr Paley is mainly responsible for the first volume, I
            am similarly responsible for the whole of the Introduction and for nearly all the notes
            of the second, though I have had the advantage of receiving from him a careful revision
            of all the proof-sheets of my commentary, and a large number of supplementary
            annotations, many of which have been incorporated with my own, and duly acknowledged by
            being placed in square brackets and followed by his initial.</p>

          <p>For the second edition of this volume, the work has been thoroughly revised, and the
            suggestions with which I have been favoured by scholars, who have had occasion to use
            it, have been carefully considered and in many cases adopted. Some redundant passages
            have been removed, and room has been found for many additional notes and references.
            Account has also been taken of the recent literature of the subject, and particularly of
            the volume on Demosthenes in the important work of Professor F. Blass, entitled
              <title>die Attische Beredsamkeit.</title> Lastly, the manuscripts of Demosthenes in
            the Paris Library have been specially examined by me during the early part of the
            present year, and the readings ascribed to them in the former edition have been verified
            and corrected accordingly.</p>

          <p>For the third edition, the text as well as the notes has been carefully revised. The
            text has been accommodated to that of Dindorf as edited by Blass in 1889; and the points
            in which the revised text differs from that of Dindorf's own edition, together with the
            reasons for such difference, have been indicated in the critical notes. In the
            explanatory notes I have added references to Aristotle's <title>Constitution of
              Athens,</title> and to the recent literature of the speeches included in the present
            volume. The work to which I have been most indebted is G. Huettner's valuable monograph
            on the first speech against Stephanus, published in 1895. The comparison of the language
            of that speech with that of the undoubtedly genuine speeches is there carried still
            further than I had occasion to carry it in my former edition. The result of this
            comparison is to give strong support to the view that the speech in question was really
            the work of Demosthenes.</p>

          <p>In this fourth edition, as in the third, the text adopted is that of Dindorf as revised
            by Blass. Neither the text of Dindorf nor that of Blass can claim the authority of a
              <title>Textus Receptus,</title> but no better recension of any of the Speeches
            included in this volume has at present been published. In the Preface to the First Part
            of the <title>Select Private Orations</title> it has been explained that the latest
            Teubner text has been adopted solely for the convenience of students and schoolmasters.
            Some schoolmasters object to editions with notes at the foot of the page, and the
            adoption of a generally accessible text admits of a copy of the plain text being used in
            class, while the annotated edition can be used in preparing the lesson. In revising the
            notes I have adopted many of the valuable suggestions which I had the pleasure of
            receiving in 1901 from a former Scholar of St John's, the Rev. T. Nicklin, one of the
            classical masters at Rossall School. I have also added references to the elaborate
            commentary appended to Mr Wyse's important edition of Isaeus (Cambridge, 1904), and to
            his admirable account of &lsquo;the Attic judicial system in the fourth
            century&rsquo;, included in the comprehensive <title>Companion to Greek
              Studies</title> edited by Mr Leonard Whibley (Cambridge, 1905). I have simplified the
            numerous references to Thalheim's <title>Rechtsalterth&uuml;mer,</title> and, in the
            course of the Introduction (p. lxx f), have briefly given the purport of the opinion of
            that expert in Attic law on the legal issue raised in the <title>Speech against
              Callicles,</title> as stated in the Schneidem&uuml;hl Program of 1892, for which I
            had searched in vain until the author was good enough to send me a presentation copy a
            year ago. It is now included in the bibliographical conspectus, which, like the rest of
            this volume, has, so far as practicable, been brought up to date.</p>

            incapacity for public speaking make it necessary for his friends to state his case on
            his behalf. They confront the plaintiff Apollodorus with a special plea in bar of
            action, not to waste time and evade the main issue, but to secure a final settlement of
            the case. Their friend, the defendant, has conferred many kindnesses on the plaintiff;
            and has further been released from all the legal claims of the latter, only to find
            himself at last the victim of a vexatious lawsuit. However, a brief recital of the
            transactions of the litigants will prove that the plaintiff's case is utterly untenable. </p>

            at Athens, Phormion (once the slave of the banker Pasion) was of barbarian birth; and
            though subsequently rewarded with the rights of freedom and citizenship, remained unable
            to speak good Greek. In a later speech arising out of the present action, Apollodorus,
            himself the son of one who was once a slave, taunts him with his foreign extraction and
            his indifferent pronunciation. <bibl n="Dem. 45.81">Or. 45 &sect; 81</bibl>

            received the rights of Athenian citizenship, Pasion gave him a lease of the Bank and the
            Shield - Manufactory. Subsequently Pasion became ill and died, leaving a will whereby
            Phormion married his former master's widow (Archippe), and became guardian to his
            younger son (Pasicles). The elder son (Apollodorus) proceeded to appropriate large sums
            out of the common estate, and the guardians accordingly deemed it prudent on behalf of
            their ward to determine on a partition of all the effects except the Bank and
            Shield-Manufactory, leased to the defendant, who was one of the guardians. The defendant
            paid a moiety of the rent of that property to the elder son, Apollodorus, who, when
            Pasicles came of age, discharged the defendant from his liability under the lease and
            from all further claims. The said property was thereupon divided between the two
            brothers, the elder exercising his option in favour of the Shield-Manufactory, as the
            safer though less remunerative business, and leaving the Bank, with its higher but more

            have formed part of the business when the plaintiff let it to the later lessees. The

            alleged to be missing. He did neither; he made no fresh transfer and he charged them the
            same rent. Therefore the property must have been in the same condition as when the
            defendant originally leased it from the plaintiff's father.&mdash; The context
            compels us to make Apollodorus the subject of the sentence <foreign lang="greek"
              >misqw=n&mdash;fanh/setai</foreign>, but the bank, it will be remembered, became
            the property not of Apollodorus, but of Pasicles, when the latter came of age and
            Phormion's lease expired; we must therefore conclude that the elder brother acted as

          <p>In Shilleto's copy of Kennedy's translation I find a manuscript note in which, after
            quoting the explanation given in Bekker's <title>Anecdota,</title> he adds:
            &ldquo;This is a clear statement and exactly in accordance with the meaning of the
            words: <foreign lang="greek">a)fi/hmi</foreign>, &lsquo;I let go, one whom I have a
            hold of&rsquo;; <foreign lang="greek">a)palla/ttw</foreign>, &lsquo;I get rid of
            one who has a hold of me.&rsquo; So I <foreign lang="greek">a)fi/hmi</foreign> a man
            on whom I have a claim by my condoning the debt, by receiving payment, postponing it,
            &amp;c.; I <foreign lang="greek">a)palla/ttw</foreign> a man who has a claim on me,
            by his condoning the debt, by my paying it, by my putting off the payment-day. So he who
              <foreign lang="greek">a)fi/h\sin, a)palla/ttetai</foreign> [passive]; he who <foreign
              lang="greek">a)palla/ttei, a)fi/etai</foreign> [passive]. I cannot conceive anything
            plainer.&rdquo; But owing to the twofold use of <foreign lang="greek"
              >a)palla/ttein</foreign>, both of <hi rend="italic">setting free</hi> and <hi
              rend="italic">getting rid of</hi> another, the question is not really quite as simple
            as this would make it appear. Thus in Isocr. Trapez. &sect; 26, after <foreign

              lang="greek">a)phllagme/nos tw=n e)gklhma/twn</foreign>, which is possibly a middle
            use, &lsquo;having got himself quit of all claims.&rsquo;&mdash;The
            distinction drawn in Platner's <title>Process</title> I 146, is that <foreign
              lang="greek">a)fie/nai</foreign> regards the release from an existing obligation
            mainly from the point of view of the person granting the release, whereas <foreign
              lang="greek">a)palla/ttein</foreign> implies a <hi rend="italic">twofold</hi>
            transaction and an agreement on the part of <hi rend="italic">both</hi> the persons
            concerned.&mdash; Kennedy, on p. 230 of his translation of Dem.
              <title>Pant.,</title> approves of Pabst's supposition that &lsquo;the two Greek
            verbs have no distinct meanings&rsquo;; and similarly Mr Paley held that
            &lsquo;although a shade of difference might be traced, and perhaps originally <pb
              n="27"/> existed between them, they had practically become synonyms.&rsquo;
            Reasons have been given above for dissenting from this view.</p>

            in particular. &lsquo;For <hi rend="italic">you,</hi> gentlemen of Athens, you who

            mainly for his treasonable collusion with an exiled relative, Callistratus. (See next
            note.) Timomachus was condemned, and put to death (<title>Schol.</title> on Aeschin. 1

          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">*kalli/ppon tou= nu=n e)n *sikeli/a|</lemma> The
            context shows that this Callippus (who must not be confounded with the <hi rend="italic"
              >plaintiff</hi> in the speech of Apollodorus <foreign lang="greek">pro\s
              *ka/llippon</foreign> Or. 52) can be none other than &lsquo;the son of Philon, of
            the deme Aexone,&rsquo; who, at the request of Timomachus, conveyed Callistratus on
            board an Athenian trireme to Thasos from his place of exile in Macedonia, after
            Apollodorus had stoutly refused to allow his own vessel to be used for so unlawful a
            purpose (Or. 50 &sect;&sect; 46&mdash;52). He may, with great probability,
            be identified with Plato's pupil of that name, with whom another of Plato's disciples,
            the well-known Dion of Syracuse, lived on friendly terms at Athens on his banishment
            from Sicily in B.C. 366. In August 357, Dion, with a small force, started from the
            island of Zacynthus, and during the absence of Dionysius the younger, made a triumphal
            entry into Syracuse, attended by his friend Callippus, who was one of his captains, and
            is described by Plutarch as <foreign lang="greek">lampro\s e)n toi=s a)gw=si kai\
              dia/shmos</foreign>. Ultimately, in the spring or summer of 353, Dion was assassinated
            by Callippus, who after usurping the government for thirteen months, was defeated in
            battle by a brother of the younger Dionysius, and <title>after wandering about in
              Sicily</title> and establishing himself in Southern Italy, at Rhegium, was shortly
            after (probably in B.C. 350) himself killed by his friends, with the very sword (as the
            story runs) with which he murdered Dion. (Plutarch, <title>Dion,</title> 17,
            28&mdash; 58; Plato, Ep. vii; Diodorus, xvi <hi rend="italic">passim.</hi>)</p>
          <p>In the present passage Apollodorus is stated to have prosecuted Callippus <foreign
              lang="greek">tou= nu=n o)/ntos e/n *sikeli/a|</foreign>. The Athenian fleet (with
            Callippus) reached Athens from the Thracian coasts in Feb. 360, and Callippus started
            for Syracuse from Zacynthus in Aug. 357, so that the plaintiff's prosecution of him
            cannot well be placed later than the spring of 357, though it may have been two years
            earlier in 359, and in any case about the same time as his prosecutions of Timomachus,
            Meno and Autocles. (A. Schaefer, <title>Dem. u. s. Zeit,</title> III 2,
            158&mdash;161.)</p>
          <p>If the present speech is as late as 350 B.C., Callippus was still alive; at any rate,
            the news of his death cannot have reached Athens. <title>Introd.</title> p. xxix. <pb

          <p><foreign lang="greek">ou( *timoqe/ou</foreign>;] The charge against Timotheus, the

            him bankrupt.&rsquo; The only passage quoted is Dem. 403, 7, where however there is
            no reference whatever to a bankruptcy, but only to the overturning of a table towards
            the close of a disorderly banquet. (The reference to Dem. 743, 1 [ = Timocr. &sect;

            stating that in Athens there was a story current among the old wives and the little

              a large property which got into the hands of Phormion, who also married Pasion's
              widow, my mother Archippe, during my absence from Athens on public service. On my
              return, I threatened Phormion with legal proceedings in consequence of this marriage,
              but my case did not come on; and afterwards a reconciliation was brought about.
              Subsequently, however, on Phormion's refusing to fulfil his engagements and attempting

              him at the earliest opportunity.</hi></p>
          <p>
            <title>Phormion thereupon put in a special plea in bar of action, and brought forward

              reflexion, however, I feel that the jury, in their ignorance of the real facts, could
              not, on the evidence, have found any other verdict; but I have a right to be indignant

          <p>This trierarchy of Apollodorus may almost certainly be connected with the negociations

              <title>Philologus</title> for 1857 (xii p. 571&mdash;8), that Atheman ambassadors

            not most of the documents inserted in the speeches of the Attic Orators, this deposition
            has been regarded as spurious. Its purport is to be found in &sect;&sect;
            9&mdash;26 and in <bibl n="Dem. 46.5">Or. 46 &sect; 5</bibl>. The names of
            Teisias, Cephisophon and Amphias are given in &sect;&sect; 10, 17, and <bibl
              n="Dem. 46.5">Or. 46 &sect; 5</bibl>. Stephanus and Teisias, as well as Pasion and
            Apollodorus, are assigned to the deme Acharnae in the documents only
            (&sect;&sect; 28, 46), not in the speech itself. <foreign lang="greek"
              >*ste/fanos *)axarneu\s</foreign> appears in an inscription as trierarch in B.C. 322,
            but this (it has been suggested) is not likely to be the defendant in the present
            action, for at that date the latter, if (as is not improbable) he was about the same age
            as Apollodorus, would be about seventy; and we can hardly suppose that one who was so
            poor a patriot as not to have undertaken any public services up to the age of 47 or
            thereabouts (&sect; 66), would have embarked on a trierarchy at so advanced an age.
            But the name was far from uncommon, and the <hi rend="italic">deme</hi> may (it is
            thought) have been assigned at random by the writer of the document.</p>
          <p>The name <foreign lang="greek">*)/endios *)epige/nous *lamptreu\s</foreign> (of the
            deme of Lamptra) is given in one MS only (Q). An inscription, however, of B.C. 325 gives
            the name <foreign lang="greek">*krito/dhmos *)endi/ou *lamptreu\s</foreign> whose father
            may be the <foreign lang="greek">*)/endios</foreign> of the text, though the name is not
            a rare one.</p>
          <p>Lastly, <foreign lang="greek">*sku/qhs</foreign> is naturally an uncommon name for an
              <title>Athenian,</title> tbough found as such in an inscription. The name of his
            father, <foreign lang="greek">*(armateu\s</foreign>, does not occur elsewhere, except in
            Stephanus of Byzantium, who makes it mean &lsquo;an inhabitant of Harma&rsquo;
            which he wiongly supposes to be a <hi rend="italic">deme</hi> of Attica, wheieas it was
            really the name <pb n="67"/> of a part of the range of Parnes. (Abridged from A.

          <p>Blass, however, sees no ground for rejecting the documents in this speech; the names
            of, the witnesses, as Westermann himself admits, are supported by the evidence of
            inscriptions (Blass <title>Att. Ber.</title> III 409). Their genuineness has been

              and if some one had produced a document purporting to be Pasion's will, it would have

              have appealed to the bystanders to bear witness to the discrepancy, which would have
              been a strong proof that the rest of their case was got up for a purpose.</hi> (2)
              <title>Had the contents agreed, I should have required the producer himself to give
              evidence. Had he consented, I should have had in him a responsible witness; had he
              declined, here again I should have had sufficient proof that the affair was a
              fabrication. On this hypothesis, I should huve had to deal with one witness only,
              instead of with many</title> (<hi rend="italic">as my opponents have made it
              out</hi>)<hi rend="italic">; and of course I should have preferred the former, and so

              rend="italic">there is room for cool calculation, no one would be so foolish as to
              abandon his own interests and do what would damage his case. And yet, by deposing that
              I refused to open the &lsquo;will,&rsquo; these witnesses represented me as
              doing what is improbable, unreasonable, and contrary to all experience.</hi></p>
          <p>In brief, the first point which the plaintiff attempts to make in proving the evidence
            to be false, is that, assuming he was challenged to open the &lsquo;will,&rsquo;
            he sees no reason why he should have refused a challenge which it would have been to his
            interest to accept. On the other side, it may be noticed that the plaintiff had a strong
            reason for refusing to open the &lsquo;will,&rsquo; and thus give express
            recognition to an important document, the contents of which, as he himself says
            elsewhere (&sect; 21), were detrimental to his own interests. (A. Schaefer,
              <title>Dem.</title> III 2, p. 171.) So far, the case clearly tends against A

            with <foreign lang="greek">fwraqei=en</foreign> (which cannot here be taken as a simple

            thus gained is fairly satisfactory: &lsquo;the witnesses combined the attestation of
            a challenge with the attestation of a will (made the former a pretext for the latter).
            The immediate result was that the jury in the previous trial believed the will was
            really my father's and therefore decided against me without giving me a hearing on my
            present wrongs. The ultimate result was that by that very means my opponents would be
            clearly convicted of having given false evidence.&rsquo;</p>

              those alleged, would be rather detrimental to my interests. The fact that, in spite of
              the alleged endorsement, it has been produced to Phormion, not to myself, and been let

              Cephisophon. However, I dismiss him for the present, especially as he has given no
              evidence on the contents of the will, which by the way is a strong proof of the
              falsehood of the deposition of Stephanus and his friends. Cephisophon, the very person
              who deposes to having the document, did not dare to depose to its identity with that
              produced by Phormion; and yet the present witnesses</hi> (<title>Stephanus and his

              though they cannot claim to have been present when the will was drawn up, never saw it
              opened before the arbitrator, and indeed have deposed that I refused to open it. If
              so, have they not clearly charged themselves with having given false
            evidence?</hi></p>

              *kefa/lwn</foreign> is a parallel form of <foreign lang="greek">*kefali/wn</foreign>
            and is found elsewhere (Plut. Arat. 52). One <foreign lang="greek">*khfisofw=n

            the name of the trierarch's father is not given (Boeckh, <title>Seewesen</title> p.
            442). The composer of the deposition may have been led to assign Cephisophon to Aphidna

            attained a wider signification and embraced all that was non-Hellenic in the customs,

            the Greeks view all family ties as almost inviolable. With all their respect for
            &lsquo;written law,&rsquo; the obligations of relationship had more of religious

            The plaintiff curiously argues the falsehood of the defendant's deposition from the
            nature of the material on which it is inscribed. The document, he points out, is
            &lsquo;whitened, and must have been brought from home purposely prepared.&rsquo;
            This would have been proper enough for a deposition attesting to the facts of the past,
            in which case there is time to draw up an elaborate document. But a deposition
            purporting to attest a Challenge (evidence to which might be given by any duly qualified
            person even accidentally present) would naturally be rapidly written on the spot
              <foreign lang="greek">e)n ma/lqh|</foreign>, i.e. on a waxen tablet. This would allow
            of any addition or erasure being made at the request of the witnesses before they
            attested it. &lsquo;The difference between these methods,&rsquo; as C. R.
            Kennedy remarks, &lsquo;was much the same as between writing with a pen on paper and
            with a pencil on a slate&rsquo; (Dict. Ant. s.v. <foreign lang="greek"
              >marturi/a</foreign>). The distinction here drawn is (as Mr Paley observes) between a

          <p>The law is quoted to prove that Pasion had no right to make a will, (1) because he had
            male issue lawfully begotten (sc, Apollodorus). But it will be noticed that the law does
            not forbid such persons from making any will whatsoever. It simply enacts that those who
            have no male issue may dispose of their property as they please. Pasion was not debarred
            by this law from making <hi rend="italic">a</hi> will, but was not allowed to make any
            disposition he chose, since (as in our law of entail) the right to the property was
            secured to the son.</p>
          <p>Again (2), Pasion was a citizen by &lsquo;adoption,&rsquo; whereas this law
            implies that no &lsquo;adopted&rsquo; person could dispose of his property as he
            pleased. But it will be observed on the other side, that the plaintiff has deliberately
            confounded two different senses of <foreign lang="greek">poiei=sqai</foreign> (1)
            &lsquo;to adopt into a family&rsquo; and (2) &lsquo;to present with the
            citizenship.&rsquo; <foreign lang="greek">e)pepoi/hnto</foreign> refers to
            &lsquo;family adoption&rsquo; (Or. 44 Leoch. ad fin.), and the plaintiff argues
            as though it meant the same as <foreign lang="greek">e)pepoi/hto poli/ths</foreign>.</p>

            was during the plaintiff's absence on this public service that the marriage of Archippe

            proper (<foreign lang="greek">e)/ghme</foreign>), intrigues had been going on at an

              the attempt to recover the money which he owed me. First, as I was then engaged in
              lawsuits against my relations, he made overtures to them and pledged himself to make
              common cause with them. Next, as he was acquainted with my proposed pleadings, he

          <p>Before entering on the details, it may be well to explain the general drift of the
            passage. Apollodorus is engaged in a variety of lawsuits, in one of which we must
            suppose that he was alleged to be in possession of certain articles, probably documents,
            either actually belonging to one of his opponents or such that the latter had a legal
            right to demand production of them. The proper course on the part of Nicostratus, who
            had made common cause with one of these opponents, would have been to serve Apollodorus
            with a summons, duly attested by witnesses, requiring him to produce the articles in
            question. If Apollodorus had, without assigning a legally valid reason, refused to do
            so, Nicostratus would have been entitled to have a fine levied on Apollodorus and to get
            him entered as a debtor to the state for the amount of that fine. Instead of this, it
            appears that Nicostratus served no summons on Apollodorus (the <foreign lang="greek"
              >e)pibolh\</foreign> was <foreign lang="greek">a)pro/sklhtos</foreign>), thus giving
            the latter no opportunity for shewing cause against the production of the articles
            demanded; he then proceeded to obtain a verdict against his opponent <hi rend="italic"

          <p>To a modern reader, the mention of a rose-bud is immediately suggestive of a pleasure
            garden; but whether we look to the character of its owner, who seems to have been a dry
            man of business and little more, or to the context with its fruittrees, its vines and
            its olives, <pb n="172"/> we are driven to the conclusion that his roses were mere
            articles of trade, grown to be sold in town for crowns and garlands. Just so, among the
            blessings of Peace, in the <title>Pax</title> of Aristophanes, 577, we find
            &lsquo;the violetbed beside the well&rsquo; mentioned in the very same breath as
            &lsquo;cakes and figs and myrtle- berries, sweet new wine and
            olive-trees.&rsquo; In <bibl n="Dem. 50.61">Or. 50 &sect; 61</bibl>, Apollodorus
            says of his garden, <foreign lang="greek">to\ u(/dwr...e)k tw=n frea/twn a)pe/lipen,

            5 &sect; 11 (with Wyse's note).</p>
          <p>The Greek appreciation of the rose seems to have been mainly utilitarian. Thus it is
            under the head of <foreign lang="greek">stefanw/mata</foreign> that Theophrastus dilates
            on the many beauties of the rose and on its numerous varieties (<foreign lang="greek"
              >plh/qei te fu/llwn kai\ o)ligo/thti kai\ traxu/thti kai\ leio/thti kai\ xroia=| kai\
              eu)osmi/a|</foreign>, <title>Hist. Plant.</title> VI 6). To the Greek, says Ruskin,
            &lsquo;a rose was good for scent, and a stream for sound and coolness; for the rest
            one was no more than leaves, the other no more than water&rsquo; (<title>Modern
              Painters</title> III 4 13 &sect; 13). &lsquo;A Greek despises
            flowers,&rsquo; says Mr Bent, unless &lsquo;they are sweet-smelling or useful
            for something&rsquo; (<title>Cyclades,</title> p. 276). It is indeed a noteworthy
            fact, attributable partly to the insignificance of the Attic flora, and still more to
            the defective development of Greek taste in this particular, that in what is known as
            the best period of Greek literature there is scarcely a single instance of a refined
            appreciation of the attractions of a flowergarden. One of the rare exceptions is the
            mention of <foreign lang="greek">kh/pous eu)w/deis</foreign> in Ar. Aves 1067. The
            passage in Eur. El. 777 <foreign lang="greek">kurei= de\ kh/pois e)n katarru/tois
              bebw/s, dre/pwn terei/nhs mursi/nhs ka/ra| plo/kous</foreign>, is hardly an exception,
            as the epithet &lsquo;well-watered&rsquo; is somewhat prosy, and the context
            shows that the only reason why Aegisthus is in his garden is for the purely practical
            object of making himself a myrtlewreath for his sacrifice to the mountain-nymphs. Cf.

          <p>&sect;&sect; 26&mdash;29. <title>My opponents are really claiming what is
              public property, that is, your own property, men of the jury, and I shall prove this
              by your own laws. When the jury were proposing to condemn Arethusius to death, my
              opponents proposed a pecuniary penalty and promised jointly to pay it. So far from
              fulfilling their guarantee, they are actually claiming your own property; and the laws
              declare that the property of persons who guarantee the payment of a sum to the state
              and fail to do so shall be confiscated; so that, even on this ground alone, the laws
              would require the slaves in question to be state property.</title></p>
          <p>
            <title>As soon as Arethusius becomes indebted to the treasury, instead of being, as was
              admitted in former days, the wealthiest of the brothers, he is now made out to be ever
              so poor, and part of his property is claimed by his mother, part by his brothers, as
              in the present instance by Nicostratus.</title>
          </p>
          <p>
            <title>I must ask you in conclusion to consider that there will never be any lack of
              claimants to contest your property, and to defraud the state of her dues, by making
              pitiful appeals to your compassion. If you disregard all such pleas in the present
              case, you will do wisely in finding a verdict against Nicostratus.</title>

          <p>This rhetorical device of professing to have compunctions at repeating the bad language
            of one's opponent is sufficiently obvious. The effect is threefold. (1) The court is
            left to imagine that the terms of abuse were singularly offensive. (2) The plaintiff is
            accredited with being a man of high principle for hesitating to repeat the abominable

            himself, abusive language is a <foreign lang="greek">pro/fasis</foreign> for dealing
            blows; blows again are a <foreign lang="greek">pro/fasis</foreign> for inflicting
            wounds; lastly wounding, for homicide. The laws, by ordaining a legal remedy at each
            stage, (1) defamation, (2) assault, (3) unlawful wounding, interpose to prevent
            defamation, which is a pretext for assault, growing into actual assault; similarly
            assault developing into unlawful wounding, and ultimately into homicide. &lsquo;The
            laws on <hi rend="italic">their</hi> part have, on the very contrary, made provision,
            even in the case of pleas of necessity, against <pb n="205"/> the development of those
            pleas into greater proportions.&rsquo;</p>
          <p>[The meaning is, that the law, by providing an action for every kind of insult, has
            made it unnecessary for the aggrieved to resort to extremes in avenging himself. By
              <foreign lang="greek">a)nagkai/a pro/fasis</foreign> he means, for instance, the plea,
            that a man was insulted and he was <hi rend="italic">obliged</hi> to resent it. The law
            says, &lsquo;that obligation must not be pressed too far, so as to justify you in
            taking very violent revenge.&rsquo; P.] Wyse, on Isaeus 4 &sect; 20, suggests
            that <foreign lang="greek">ta\s a/nagkai/as profa/seis</foreign> may here mean
            &lsquo;excuses that the courts are constrained to accept.&rsquo;</p>
          <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)na/gkh ga\r. ge/gonen</lemma> The plaintiff, a
            quiet, common-place soldier, is here on the verge of displaying a familiarity with legal
            technicalities which would be not only out of keeping with his ordinary character, but
            would be resented by those of the jury who happened to be less versed in legal learning.
            The court would be apt to ascribe his acquaintance with the details of the law of
            defamation, assault, and homicide to that over-litigiousness of character which was as
            unpopular as it was common at Athens; or, at the very least, they would put him down as
            a pedant. Hence Demosthenes introduces a passing apology, explaining that the plaintiff,
            honest man, owes all his legal lore to the enquiries rendered imperative by the
            maltreatment he had received from the defendant. Hence, too, the skilful disclaimer of

            (1) the plaintiff describes himself as one who is &lsquo;reluctant to swear even to

            &lsquo;contrary to usage&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">w(=n mh\
              nomi/zete</foreign>), whereas this very oath is elsewhere attributed to the mother of

              o)mo/sas</foreign>.</p>
          <p>If an easier alteration is preferred, we may retain the order as it stands in the MSS,
            simply inserting <foreign lang="greek">mhde\n</foreign> after <foreign lang="greek">w(=n
              mh\ nomi/zete</foreign>, and accounting for its loss by its similarity to the
            subsequent <foreign lang="greek">mhd' a)\n</foreign>. The MSS vary between <foreign
              lang="greek">mhd' a)\n</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">mhde\n</foreign>, and this
            proposal combines the two alternative readings. The sentence would then run thus:

              w(=n mh) nomi/zete mhde\n mhd' a)\n mellh/sas</foreign>. Thus <foreign lang="greek"
              >w(=n mh\ nomi/zete</foreign> depends on <foreign lang="greek">mhde\n</foreign> and
            does not refer to <foreign lang="greek">pai/dwn</foreign>, the sense of the second
            clause being that Ariston would never dream of taking any <hi rend="italic">such</hi>
            oath, by his children's lives, as would be contrary to general usage. Below, he
            describes himself as <foreign lang="greek">o)mnu/wn w(s no/mimon</foreign>.</p>

            asking whether any of his audience has ever seen or even heard of a watercourse running
            by the side of a public way, declares that he does not believe there is anything of the
            kind in the whole of Attica. The startling character of this assertion, which could
            hardly have been untrue, is only equalled by the delightful frankness with which he
            assigns the reason. &lsquo;What could induce any one,&rsquo; he asks,
            &lsquo;to make a channel through his private grounds for water, which, if let alone,
            would be sure to flow down along the public road?&rsquo; The passage is singularly
            suggestive on the state of the mountain roads of Attica. The public road, so called,
            would often be little better than the path of a mountain-torrent, which might be used in
            dry weather for purposes of transit, but in very wet seasons would reveit to the
            possession of the waters. In the days of Demosthenes many of the mountain roads were
            probably not much better than those of modern Attica, as described with perfect accuracy
            by Edmond About, in <title>Le Roi des Montagnes</title>:</p>
          <p>&ldquo;I crossed at a leap the Eleusinian Cephisus . . . One hundred paces turther
            on, the road was lost in a wide and deep ravine, hollowed by the rains of two or three
            thousand winters. I supposed with some show of justice that the ravine must be the road,
            for I had noticed in my previous excursions that the Greeks dispense with making a road
            wherever the water has been kind enough to take that duty on itself. In this country,
            where man but slightly thwarts the laws of nature, the torrents are royal roads, the
            rivers turnpikeroads, the rivulets cross-country roads. Storms do the office of highway
            engineers, and the rain is an inspector who keeps up without any control the means of
            communication, great and small&rdquo; (p. 45=p. 42 <title>Eng. transl.</title>
            1862).</p>
          <p>[Road-making, as we have it, is a modernart, and the want of roads is still the cause
            of backward civilisation and commerce in many countries. The hollow or sunken lanes,
            common in many parts of England, are caused by the excavating power of water running
            along tracks. The Romans <hi rend="italic">raised</hi> their roads (<hi rend="italic"
