                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>There is one
                    proof which I omitted in my former speech, quite as important as any of those
                    which were brought forward, to prove that these men did not pay the
                    marriage-portion to Aphobus. This I shall speak of first, and shall then
                    undertake to refute the falsehoods which the defendant has uttered before you.
                    For the fellow, men of the jury, when he first determined to lay claim to the
                    property of Aphobus, declared that he had paid as the marriage-portion, not a
                    talent, as he now alleges, but eighty minae; and he set up pillars<note
                        resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">To signify that the property was
                        mortgaged.</note> on the house for two thousand drachmae, and on the land
                    for a talent, wishing to preserve both the one and the other for Aphobus.
                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>When, however, the trial against him had
                    been decided, and he saw what your attitude was toward those who were too brazen
                    in their wrongdoings, he came to his senses, and concluded that I should appear
                    to be suffering outrageous treatment, if, after being robbed of such large sums,
                    I should be unable to recover anything whatever from Aphobus, who had my
                    property in his possession, but it should become clear that I was prevented by
                    the defendant from recovering anything. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>What,
                    then, does he do? He removes the pillars from the house, and declares that the
                    marriage-portion was a talent only, which sum was guaranteed by a mortgage on
                    the land. Yet, if the inscription on the house was set up by him in fairness and
                    sincerity, it is plain that the one on the land was also. But if he set up a
                    false inscription in the former case with the intent to commit fraud, it is
                    probable that the latter one was false also. <milestone n="4" unit="section"
                    />This matter you should consider, not in the light of the proofs which I have
                    advanced, but from the conduct of Onetor himself. No man on earth compelled him;
                    he took down the pillars himself; and thus by his own act he makes clear that he
                    is a liar. To prove that these statements of mine are true, that he even now
                    declares that the land is mortgaged for a talent, but that he laid claim to two
                    thousand drachmae more on the house, and took the pillars down after the suit
                    was decided, I shall bring forward witnesses who know the facts.<milestone
                        ed="P" unit="para"/>Now take the deposition.<quote type="Deposition">
                        <title>Deposition</title>
                    </quote>
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>It is plain,
                    then, that Onetor having put up pillars on the house for two thousand drachmae,
                    and on the land for a talent, intended to push his claim as though he had paid
                    eighty minae. Could you have stronger proof that there is not a word of truth in
                    what he now says, than the fact that his present story is different from the one
                    he told at first about the same matters? To me it seems that no stronger proof
                    than this could be found. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P"
                        unit="para"/>Now note the shamelessness of the man. He had the audacity to
                    say before you that he is not depriving me of what the land is worth beyond a
                    talent, and that, too, when he has himself fixed its value as nothing more. With
                    what end in view, Onetor, did you fix your pillars on the house for the two
                    thousand extra drachmae, when you were demanding eighty minae, if the land was
                    really worth more, instead of securing the two thousand drachmae also by a
                    mortgage on the land? <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>Or, when it suits your
                    purpose to save all of the property of Aphobus, is the land to be worth a talent
                    only, and are you to hold the house on a mortgage of two thousand drachmae more;
                    and the marriage-portion being eighty minae, will you claim the right to hold
                    both the land and the house; or again, when this is not to your interest, is all
                    to be different: the house is to be worth a talent, because now it is I that
                    hold it, and what is left of the farm is to be worth not less than two talents,
                    in order that it may seem that I am wronging Aphobus, not myself being robbed?
                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>Do you see that, while you pretend to have
                    paid the dowry, you are shown not to have paid it in any way whatsoever? For
                    that line of conduct is sincere and free from guile, which remains throughout
                    such as it was at the first, but you are proven to have followed the contrary
                    course, so as to fulfil your service as an underling to my detriment. <milestone
                        n="9" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>It is worth while to
                    consider in the light of these facts what sort of an oath he would have sworn,
                    if an oath had been tendered him. For, when he declared that the dowry was
                    eighty minae, if one had granted that he should recover that sum on condition of
                    his swearing that this statement of his was true, what would he have done? Is it
                    not plain that he would have taken the oath? What can he say to deny that he
                    would have sworn it under those circumstances, when he demands the right to do
                    so now? Well then, his own words prove that he would have perjured himself; for
                    he now claims that he paid, not eighty minae, but a talent. What reason is there
                    why one should believe that he is forswearing himself in one statement rather
                    than in the other? Or what opinion should one rightly hold of a man who thus
                    lightly convicts himself of perjury? <milestone n="10" unit="section"
                        /><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>But perhaps not all of his acts have been
                    of this nature, nor is he proven in every instance to be a trickster. Yet it has
                    been shown that he sought in Aphobus's interest to have the damages fixed at a
                    talent, and himself offered to act as bail for the payment to me of that sum.
                    Yet observe that this is a proof not only that his wife was living with Aphobus
                    and that Onetor was on intimate terms with him, but also that he had not paid
                    the dowry. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>For what man would be so foolish
                    as, first, to pay out so large a sum, then to take as security a single piece of
                    property, the title to which was under dispute, and finally, not satisfied with
                    his previous losses and assuming that the one who had wronged him was now going
                    to act justly, to become his bail for the damages assessed by the court? Nobody
                    would, to my thinking. The assumption is not even rational, that a man unable to
                    recover a talent for himself, should promise to pay that sum to another, and
                    further to give bail for it. No; from these facts alone it is clear that he has
                    never paid the dowry, but as a close friend of Aphobus he took this mortgage in
                    return for my large property, wishing to make his sister jointly with Aphobus an
                    inheritor of my estate. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>Then he seeks now to
                    deceive and beguile you by claiming that he set up the pillars before judgement
                    was given against Aphobus. Aye, Onetor; but not before it was given by you, if
                    what you now say is true. For it is clear that you acted as you did because you
                    were convinced of his guilt. Again, this language of yours is absurd, as though
                    you, men of the jury, did not know that all those who commit frauds of this sort
                    determine what they are going to say, and that no one ever lost a suit through
                    keeping quiet, or admitting that he was in the wrong; but it is, I think, when
                    he has been convicted of making a false statement, that men know what manner of
                    man he is. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>And this is what appears to me to
                    be exactly the plight of Onetor. For tell me, how can it be just, if you set up
                    pillars for eighty minae, that the dowry should be eighty minae; and, if for
                    more, more; and, if for less, less? Or how is it just, when your sister up to
                    this present day has never lived with any other man, or been separated from
                    Aphobus, when you have neither paid the dowry, nor been willing to have recourse
                    to the torture, or to any other fair means of determining the matters at issue,
                    that because you claim to have set up pillars, the farm shall belong to you? I
                    certainly do not see how it can be. It is the truth to which we must look, not
                    to arguments which a man has contrived &lpar;as you are doing&rpar; in
                    order to seem to speak with some plausibility. <milestone n="14" unit="section"
                    />Then&mdash;the most outrageous thing of all&mdash;suppose you had in
                    reality paid the marriage-portion &lpar;which you have not paid&rpar;,
                    whose fault was it? Was it not yours? For you paid it on the security of my
                    property. Was it not ten full years before he became your brother-in-law that
                    Aphobus took possession of my estate for which judgement has been rendered
                    against him? And was it right for you to recover the whole amount, while I, who
                    had been awarded damages against him, I, an orphan who had been wronged and
                    robbed of a marriage-portion that was genuine, I who with better right than any
                    other man should have been exempted from the risk of having to pay costs,<note

                        ed="P" unit="para"/>Men of the jury, having entered a plea that the action
                    is not admissible, I wish first to speak concerning the laws in accordance with
                    which the plea was entered. The laws, men of the jury, ordain that actions for
                    shipowners and merchants shall be upon loans for shipments to or from <placeName
                        key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, concerning which there shall be

                        /><milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Now between this man Zenothemis and
                    myself there has been no contract or agreement in writing, as he himself
                    acknowledges in his complaint. He states that he made a loan to Hegestratus, a
                    shipowner, and that after the latter was lost at sea, we appropriated the cargo.
                    This is his charge in the complaint. The same speech will suffice to prove to
                    you that his action is not maintainable, and to make you see the whole of his
                    plot and his rascality. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>I beg of you all, men
                    of the jury, if you ever attended closely to any matter, to attend to this. You
                    will hear of a man's audacity and villainy that go beyond all bounds, provided I
                    am able, as I hope to be, to tell you the whole tale of what he has done.
                        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Zenothemis,
                    who is here before you, being an underling of Hegestratus, the shipowner, who he
                    himself in his complaint states to have been lost at sea &lpar;how, he does
                    not add, but I will tell you&rpar;, concocted with him the following fraud.
                    Both of them borrowed money in <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse"
                        >Syracuse</placeName>. Hegestratus admitted to those lending money to
                    Zenothemis, if inquiries were made, that there was on board the ship a large
                    amount of grain belonging to the latter; and the plaintiff admitted to those
                    lending money to Hegestratus that the cargo of the ship was his. As one was the
                    shipowner and the other a passenger, they were naturally believed in what they
                    said of one another. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>But immediately on getting
                    the money, they sent it home to <placeName key="tgn,7008781"
                        >Massalia</placeName>, and put nothing on board the ship. The agreement
                    being, as is usual in all such cases, that the money was to be paid back if the
                    ship reached port safely, they laid a plot to sink the ship, that so they might
                    defraud their creditors. Hegestratus, accordingly, when they were two or three
                    days' voyage from land, went down by night into the hold of the vessel, and
                    began to cut a hole in the ship's bottom, while Zenothemis, as though knowing
                    nothing about it, remained on deck with the rest of the passengers. When the
                    noise was heard, those on the vessel saw that something wrong was going on in
                    the hold, and rushed down to bear aid. <milestone n="6" unit="section"
                    />Hegestratus, being caught in the act, and expecting to pay the penalty, took
                    to flight, and, hotly pursued by the others, flung himself into the sea. It was
                    dark, and he missed the ship's boat, and so was drowned. Thus, miserable as he
                    was, he met a miserable end as he deserved, suffering the fate which he purposed
                    to bring about for others. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>As for this fellow,
                    his associate and accomplice, at the first on board the ship immediately after
                    the attempted crime, just as though he knew nothing of it but was himself in
                    utter consternation, he sought to induce the sailing-master and the seamen to
                    embark in the boat and abandon the vessel with all speed, declaring that there
                    was no hope of safety and that the ship would presently sink; thinking that thus
                    their design might be accomplished, the ship be lost, and the creditors thus be
                    robbed of their money. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>In this he failed, for
                    our agent,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Presumably Protus, who seems to have
                        sailed as supercargo.</note> who was on board, opposed the plan, and

                    The ship safely brought to Cephallenia, thanks chiefly to the gods, and after
                    them to the bravery of the seamen. Again after this he schemed together with the

                    this man and Hegestratus deposited with one of the ship's company a written
                    agreement. Yet, if you had confidence in him when you gave the money, why should

                    wouldn't budge, declaring point-blank that he would not be put out of possession

                    was he who had paid the price, we demanded that Zenothemis be punished as a

                    had expended and a talent in addition and that we would relinquish our claim to
                    the grain. Despite this challenge and all that Protus and I could say, we made
                    no progress, but I had to choose either to put Zenothemis out, or to lose my

                    Aristophon, who has concocted the whole scheme. When they saw that, in the light
                    of the facts, they had absolutely no basis of right, they made overtures to
                    Protus, and induced him to leave the matter wholly in their hands. From the
                    first, as has now become plain to us, they had been working to this end, but had
                    been unable to carry their point. <milestone n="25" unit="section"/>For Protus,
                    so long as he thought to get a profit for himself from the grain by going, clung
                    to it, and chose rather to make his profit, and to render to us what was our
                    due, than to make common cause with these men, sharing with them the advantage
                    gained and doing us an injury. But when, after he had come back here and was
                    negotiating about these matters, grain fell in price, he straightway changed his
                    mind. <milestone n="26" unit="section"/>At the same time &lpar;for, men of
                        <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, the whole truth shall be
                    told you&rpar;, we on our part, who had made the loan, came to a quarrel and
                    felt bitter against him &lpar;for the loss on the grain was falling on
                    us&rpar;, and charged that he had secured for us this pettifogging scoundrel
                    instead of our money. After this, being manifestly none too honest by nature, he
                    went over to their side, and agreed to let judgement go by default in the suit
                    which Zenothemis had brought against him before they had come to an agreement
                    with one another. <milestone n="27" unit="section"/>For, if he had dropped his
                    suit against Protus, it would have been made clear at once that his action
                    against us was a malicious one, and Protus would not consent to have judgement
                    given against him while he was here present, in order that, if they should do
                    for him what they had agreed&mdash;well and good; but, if not, he might have
                    the judgement by default set aside. But why speak of all this? If Protus really
                    did what Zenothemis here has written in his complaint, he justly deserves, as it
                    seems to me at least, not merely to have judgement given against him, but to be
                    put to death. For if in danger and tempest he drank so much wine as to be like a
                    madman, what punishment does he not deserve to suffer? <milestone n="28"
                        unit="section"/>Or, if he stole documents, or secretly broke the seals?
                    However, the facts regarding all these things you will determine in your own
                    minds; but, Zenothemis, do not mix up that action with mine. If Protus has
                    wronged you in word or deed, you have, it seems, had satisfaction. No one of us
                    sought to hinder you, or now begs for leniency for him. If you have brought a
                    baseless charge against him, that is no affair of ours. Ah, but the fellow has

                    deprive us of his testimony, and to be able yourselves to say against him

                    contriving, you would at the same time have called him before the Polemarch, and
                    have had him put under bail; and, if he had appointed sureties, he would have
                    been forced to remain, or you would have had persons from whom you could recover

                    recourse to a special plea, that no one may bring a baseless or malicious suit,
                    but that actions may be confined to those among the merchants and shipowners who
                    are really wronged. Many defendants in mercantile suits have before now entered
                    special pleas in accordance with this law, and have come before you and proved

                    Apaturius has made a false charge against me, and is suing me contrary to law,
                    seeing that there had been a release and discharge from all contracts made
                    between him and me, and there exists no other contract made with him by me
                    whether for business by sea or on land, I have entered the special plea that the
                    action is not maintainable, according to the following laws.<quote type="Laws">

                    then, has instituted suit against me contrary to these laws and that his charges
                    are false, I shall show you by many proofs. I, men of the jury, have by now been
                    for a long time engaged in foreign trade, and up to a certain time risked the
                    sea in my own person; it is not quite seven years since I gave up voyaging, and,
                    having a moderate capital, I try to put it to work by making loans on adventures
                    overseas. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>As I have visited many places and
                    spend my time in your exchange, I know most of those who are seafarers, and with
                    these men from <placeName key="perseus,Byzantium">Byzantium</placeName> I am on
                    intimate terms through having myself spent much time there. My position, then,
                    was such as I have described, when this fellow put into our port with a
                    fellow-countryman of his, named Parmeno, a Byzantine by birth, who was an exile
                    from his country. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>The plaintiff and Parmeno
                    came up to me on the exchange and spoke about money. It happened that the
                    plaintiff owed forty minae on his ship, and his creditors were pressing him hard
                    with demands for their money, and were about to board the ship and take
                    possession of it, as his note was overdue. While he was in this embarrassment,
                    Parmeno agreed to give him ten minae, and the plaintiff asked me to contribute
                    thirty minae, charging that the creditors in their eagerness to secure the ship
                    had slandered him on the exchange, that they might seize the ship by putting him
                    in a position where he could not pay. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>I
                    happened to have no ready money in hand, but being acquainted with Heracleides,
                    the banker, I persuaded him to lend the money, and to take me as surety. But
                    when now the thirty minae had been procured, Parmeno happened to fall out with
                    the plaintiff. However, seeing that he had agreed to furnish him with ten minae
                    and had already given him three of them, he was compelled on account of the
                    money he had given to pay the remainder as well. <milestone n="8" unit="section"
                    />Not wishing, however, for the reason given, to make the loan in his own name,
                    he bade me to arrange it so that things should be as safe as possible for him.
                    So I took over the seven minae from Parmeno, and having had transferred to
                    myself the obligation for the three, which the plaintiff had already received
                    from him, caused a bill of sale to be executed on the ship and the slaves until
                    such time as he should repay me the ten minae, which he had received through me,
                    and also the thirty for which he had made me his surety with the banker. In

                    then, Apaturius here got rid of his creditors. Not long after this, the bank
                    having failed, and Heracleides for a time having gone into hiding, the plaintiff
                    schemed to send the slaves from <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName>, and to remove the ship from the harbor. This was the
                    cause of my first quarrel with him. For Parmeno, learning of the fact, laid
                    hands on the slaves as they were being taken away, and prevented the sailing of
                    the ship; then he sent for me, and told me of the affair. <milestone n="10"
                        unit="section"/>When I heard him, thinking this fellow a most impious wretch
                    because of his attempt, I set about considering how I might myself get free from
                    my guaranty to the bank, and how the foreigner<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes"
                        >The foreigner is, of course, Parmeno.</note> might avoid the loss of the
                    money he had lent this fellow through me. After stationing men to guard the ship
                    I told the whole story to the sureties of the bank and turned the security over
                    to them, telling them that the foreigner had a lien of ten minae on the ship.
                    Having arranged this, I attached the slaves, in order that, if any shortage
                    occurred, the deficiency might be made up by the proceeds of their sale.
                        <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>In this way, when I found that Apaturius
                    was a rascal, I set matters right in my own interest and in the interest of the
                    foreigner. But Apaturius, as though the wrong was on my side, and not on his,
                    made complaint to me, and asked if it were not enough for me to be released from
                    my guaranty to the bank, without also attaching the ship and the slaves to
                    secure his money for Parmeno, and thus making an enemy of himself in the
                    interest of one who was an exile. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>I replied
                    that, when a man had put his trust in me, I was all the less inclined to leave
                    him in the lurch, because, while he was an exile and in misfortune, he was being
                    wronged by the plaintiff; and after I had done everything possible, and had
                    incurred the utmost enmity on the part of this fellow, I with difficulty secured
                    the money, the ship being sold for forty minae, the precise amount for which she
                    was mortgaged. The thirty minae then having been paid back to the bank, and the
                    ten minae to Parmeno, in the presence of many witnesses, we cancelled the bond
                    in accordance with which the money had been lent, and mutually released and
                    discharged one another from our engagements so that the plaintiff had nothing
                    more to do with me, nor I with him. In proof that my words are true, hear the

                    laid hands on the slaves as they were being carried off, and because he had been
                    prevented by him from making the voyage to <placeName key="tgn,7003122"

                    furthermore made a deposit to be forfeited if he did not swear the
                        oath.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>In proof that my words are true, take

                    the oath by an action, he summoned Parmeno into court. When both actions had
                    been instituted, on the advice of persons present they proceeded to an
                    arbitration, and after drawing up an agreement they submitted the matter to one
                    common arbitrator, Phocritus, a fellow-country-man of theirs; and each one
                    appointed one man to sit with Phocritus, Apaturius choosing Aristocles of

                    judgement against him, wishing to break down the arbitration, he sought, in

                    statement, Parmeno demanded of Aristocles that he produce the agreement, adding
                    that if there had been any criminal meddling with the papers, proof of the fact
                    would not be far to seek, for his own slave had written them. <milestone n="18"

                    as surety, I shall free myself from such a charge in the proper way; I shall
                    first bring forward witnesses to prove that it was not I who became surety for
                    Parmeno, but Archippus of Myrrhinus; and I shall then undertake, men of the
                    jury, to make my defence by circumstantial proofs. <milestone n="23"
                        unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>In the first place, I hold
                    that the time is a witness for me to prove that the charge is groundless. For
                    the agreement to arbitrate made by this fellow and Parmeno and the award of
                    Aristocles took place two years ago; but merchants may bring action every month
                    from Bo&euml;dromion to Munichion,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Roughly,
                        from September to April, the period when the seas were closed, and the ships
                        laid up in port.</note> in order that they may obtain their rights without
                    delay and put to sea. So, if I was in truth a surety for Parmeno, why did not
                    Apaturius immediately after the award proceed to collect the sum guaranteed?
                        <milestone n="24" unit="section"/>It is not open to him to say that because
                    of his friendship for me he was loth to incur my enmity, for he had himself in
                    utter unfriendliness been forced by me to pay the one thousand drachmae due to
                    Parmeno; and when he was trying to get his ship out of the port in his plot to
                    sneak away and to defraud the bank of what was due, it was I who prevented him.
                    So, if I had become a surety for Parmeno, he would not have waited until two
                    years afterward to exact the sum guaranteed, but would have proceeded to do so
                    at once. <milestone n="25" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Ah,
                    but he was well provided with funds, so that it was open to him to proceed
                    against me later on, and at the moment he had no time, as he was about to put to
                    sea! On the contrary, he was in such straits that he had lost all his effects,
                    and had sold his ship. And, if there really had been anything to prevent his
                    immediately bringing suit against me, why, when he was in town last year, did he
                    not dare, I will not say to bring suit, but even to make a demand? It was surely
                    the proper course for him, if judgement had been given against Parmeno in his
                    favour, and if I was the latter's surety, to come to me himself accompanied by
                    witnesses, and to demand the amount guaranteed, if not the year before last, at
                    any rate in the year just past; and then, if I proffered payment, to take his
                    money, and, if I did not, to bring suit. <milestone n="26" unit="section"/>For
                    in claims of this sort everyone makes demand before he brings suit. Well, there

                    the year before, when this man either instituted proceedings against me or made

                    be another proof to you that Apaturius is lying. If I had become surety to him
                    for Parmeno, it is inconceivable that I should have made the plaintiff my enemy
                    for Parmeno's sake, taking every care that the latter should not lose what he
                    had lent the plaintiff through me, and yet have allowed myself to be left in the
                    lurch by him as his surety to the plaintiff. For what ground had I to hope that
                    leniency would be shown me by the man whom I had compelled to do justice to
                    Parmeno? And when I had made him my enemy by exacting from him what was
                    guaranteed to the bank, what treatment could I myself have expected to receive
                    at his hands? <milestone n="29" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"
                    />It is worth while also for you to bear this in mind, men of the jury, that, if
                    I had been surety, I should never have denied it. For my argument was much
                    stronger, if I admitted the guaranty and appealed to the agreement in accordance
                    with which the arbitration was to be held. That the matter was referred to three
                    arbitrators has been shown by testimony. When, then, there had been no decision
                    by the three, why in the world should I have denied the guaranty? For, if
                    judgement had not been given in accordance with the agreement, neither should I
                    have been open to action for my guaranty. Therefore, men of the jury, if I had
                    really become a surety, I should not have given up a defence which was at hand,
                    and have proceeded to deny the fact. <milestone n="30" unit="section"
                        /><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Again, the following fact has been
                    testified to you by witnesses, that, after the articles of agreement had been
                    made away with by these men, the plaintiff and Parmeno sought to have new
                    articles drawn up, thus admitting that their former agreement was without force.
                    Yet, when they sought to have other articles drawn in regard to the judgement
                    that was to be given, since the existing ones had been lost, how was it possible
                    that, if other articles were not drawn, there could be either arbitration or
                    guaranty? It was the fact that they disagreed upon this very point that
                    prevented their writing new articles, Apaturius demanding that there should be
                    one arbitrator, and Parmeno that there should be three. But, since the original
                    articles were made away with, in accordance with which he alleges that I became
                    a surety, and other articles were not written, what right has he to bring suit
                    against me, against whom he is able to produce no agreement? <milestone n="31"
                        unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Further, it has been
                    testified to you by witnesses that Parmeno forbade Aristocles to give judgement
                    against him without the concurrence of his co-arbitrators. When, therefore, it
                    is shown that the same person has made away with the document in accordance with
                    the terms of which the arbitration was to be made, and declares that he has made
                    the decision without his co-arbitrators, and in defiance of the notice
                    forbidding him to do so, how can you with any fairness credit the fellow and
                    condemn me? Consider this, men of the jury: <milestone n="32" unit="section"
                    />suppose it was not against me, but against Parmeno, that this man Apaturius
                    were now taking action, seeking to recover the twenty minae in reliance upon the
                    judgement of Aristocles; and that Parmeno was present and making his defence,
                    calling witnesses to prove that he had turned the matter over to Aristocles, not
                    as a single arbitrator, but as one of three; <milestone n="33" unit="section"
                    />that he had forbidden him to announce a decision against him without his
                    co-arbitrators; and that, after his wife and children had perished in the
                    earthquake, and he in the face of a disaster so appalling had sailed for home,
                    the man who had made away with the articles of agreement announced a judgement
                    against him by default in his absence, is there a single one of you who, when
                    Parmeno had brought out these facts in his defence, would have considered an
                    award so unjustly made to be valid? <milestone n="34" unit="section"/>More than
                    this; suppose that not every point was under dispute; that there were in
                    existence articles of agreement; that Aristocles was admittedly an arbitrator
                    having sole authority; that Parmeno had not forbidden him to make the award; but
                    that the calamity had befallen the man before the announcement of the award;
                    what adversary or what arbitrator would have been so cruel as not to postpone
                    the case until the man returned to the country? Then, if Parmeno, coming to
                    plead before you, should be judged in every point to speak with more justice
                    than the plaintiff, how can you justly give judgement against me, who have
                    absolutely no contract with this man? <milestone n="35" unit="section"

                    you, men of the jury, by many proofs. The main point is this: Apaturius will not
                    even attempt to say that he has any articles showing an agreement between us.
                    When he falsely states that my name was written in as surety in the agreement
                    made with Parmeno, demand of him the articles. <milestone n="36" unit="section"
                    />Meet him on this ground: that all men, when they make agreements with one
                    another, seal the articles and deposit them with persons whom they can trust,
                    for this very purpose, that, if a dispute arises between them, they may refer to
                    the document and so settle the point at issue. But when a man, after doing away
                    with the source of accurate knowledge, undertakes to deceive you with words, how
                    can you with justice put any confidence in him? <milestone n="37" unit="section"
                    />But perhaps some witness &lpar;for this is the easiest course for those
                    who have chosen to do wrong and to bring baseless charges&rpar; will testify
                    for him against me. If then, I take action against the witness, how will he
                    prove that his testimony is true? By the articles of agreement? Well, then, let
                    there be no delay about this; let the one who has them bring forward the
                    articles at once. But if he says they have been lost, how, then, shall I find
                    means of refuting the false testimony brought against me? If the document had
                    been deposited with me, it would have been open to Apaturius to charge that I

                    voyage to Athens, I should be able to get satisfaction from Phormio in your
                    court, but, when the contract has been made in your market, these men should say
                    that they will not be tried before you. <milestone n="44" unit="section"/>When
                    we referred the case to Theodotus for arbitration, they admitted that my action
                    against them was admissible; but now they say what is the direct opposite of
                    what they have themselves before admitted; as if, forsooth, it were proper that
                    they should be tried before Theodotus, the privileged alien, without a special
                    plea, but, when we enter the Athenian court, the action should no longer be
                    admissible. <milestone n="45" unit="section"/>I for my part am trying to
                    conceive what in the world he would have written in the special plea, if
                    Theodotus had dismissed the suit, when now, after Theodotus has decreed that we
                    should go into court, he declares that the action is not one that can be brought
                    before you, to whom Theodotus bade us go.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">If,
                        under the present circumstances, Phormio's insolence is so great, who can

                    Surely I should suffer most cruel treatment if, when the laws declare that suits
                    growing out of contracts made at Athens shall be brought before the
                    Thesmothetae, you, who have sworn to decide according to the laws, should

                    that he had not received the money. Further, Phormio is in a position to bring
                    my witnesses to trial, if he maintains that their testimony is false, but I have
                    no means of dealing with his witnesses, who say they know that Lampis testified

                    would perhaps have said that I ought to prosecute him for giving false
                    testimony; but, as it is, I have not this deposition, and Phormio thinks he

                    admits that he borrowed, but alleges that he has made payment, you should make
                    of none effect that which he himself admits and by your vote give effect to what
                    is under dispute? And if, when Lampis, on whose testimony my opponent relies,
                    after at first denying that he had received the money, now testifies to the

                    worthy of belief the lies which he told after he had been corrupted? Verily, men
                    of Athens, it is far more just to draw conclusions from statements made in the
                    first instance than from those subsequently fabricated; for the former he made
                    truthfully, and not with ulterior purpose, while the later ones are lies
                    designed to further his interests. <milestone n="49" unit="section"/><milestone

                    absurd for you to accept as worthy of credit that part of his testimony which
                    favors the defrauding party, and to discredit that which favors the party

                    come not from those who borrow, but from those who lend; and neither ship nor

                    was as yet undivided, the guardians, calculating in their own minds that, if it
                    should be necessary under the terms of the will to deduct from the undivided
                    fund, share for share, an equivalent of what the plaintiff spent, and then
                    distribute the remainder, there would be nothing left to distribute, determined

                    he should show his indignation; he should at once have done so then. Moreover,
                    he cannot say that he has not received the rents which became due subsequently.

                    the shield-factory in preference to the bank. Yet, if the plaintiff had any
                    private capital in the bank, why in the world should he have chosen the factory
                    by preference? The income was not greater; nay, it was less &lpar;the

                    bank. But he had no such capital. So the plaintiff was wise in choosing the
                    factory. For that is a property which involves no risk, while the bank is a
                    business yielding a hazardous revenue from money which belongs to others.

                    Phormio received no capital is, I think, this: that Pasio is set down in the
                    lease as debtor to the bank, not as having given banking capital to the
                    defendant. The second proof is that the plaintiff is shown to have made no
                    demands at the time of the distribution of the property. The third is that when
                    he subsequently leased the same business to others for the same sum, he will be
                    shown not to have leased any private capital of his own along with it.

                    has the audacity to bring suit for so many talents, just as if all these people

                    transactions which Phormio has had with Apollodorus you have heard, men of

                    unable to advance any just grounds in support of his claim, will repeat what he
                    had the audacity to say before the arbitrator, that his mother made away with
                    the papers at Phormio's instigation, and that, owing to the loss of these, he

                    in regard to these statements and this accusation, observe what convincing
                    proofs one could advance to show that he is lying. In the first place, men of

                    had not papers from which he could determine the amount of estate left him? No
                    man, assuredly. Yet it is eighteen years, Apollodorus, since you accepted the
                    distribution, and you cannot show that you at any time made any complaint about
                    the papers. <milestone n="20" unit="section"/>In the second place, when Pasicles
                    had come of age, and was receiving the report of his guardians' administration,
                    what man, even though he shrank from accusing his mother with his own lips of
                    having destroyed the papers, would have failed to reveal the fact to his

                    brought? For the plaintiff has brought suits against many citizens, and has
                    recovered large sums of money, charging in his complaints, &ldquo;So and so

                    is this: that Pasicles, though he is the brother of Apollodorus, the plaintiff,
                    has neither entered suit nor made any of the charges which the plaintiff makes.
                    But surely the defendant would not have abstained from wronging one who had been

                    For a man who has lost his suit in your court might perhaps say that you had
                    been deceived; but when a man has plainly decided against himself, by giving a

                    serve to convict those who advanced false claims. At the same time, since he
                    realized that neither the contracting parties nor the witnesses would live
                    forever, he put the law in their place, that it might be a witness of truth for

                    that he has suffered no wrong financially, will be indignant because Phormio has
                    married his mother. For he is not unaware of this&mdash;it is no secret to
                    him or to many of you&mdash;that Socrates, the well-known banker, having
                    been set free by his masters just as the plaintiff's father had been, gave his

                    his wife in marriage to Timodemus, who is still in being and alive, who had been
                    his slave. And it is not here only, men of Athens, that those engaged in this
                    line of business so act; but in Aegina Strymodorus gave his wife in marriage to
                    Hermaeus, his own slave, and again, after her death, gave him his own
                        daughter.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">It is probable that the word

                    <milestone n="30" unit="section"/>And one could mention many other such cases;
                    and no wonder. For although to you, men of Athens, who are citizens by birth, it
                    would be a disgrace to esteem any conceivable amount of wealth above your
                    honorable descent, yet those who obtain citizenship as a gift either from you or
                    from others, and who in the first instance, thanks to this good fortune, were
                    counted worthy of the same privileges, because of their success in money-making,
                    and their possession of more wealth than others, must hold fast to these

                    his sons, but seeing that the only protection for his business was that he
                    should bind the defendant to you by a family tie, for this reason gave to him in

                    you have the least right of any man in the world to speak thus. For Pasio, your
                    father, did not acquire his fortune, any more than Phormio did, by good luck or
                    by inheritance from his father, but he gave proof to the bankers, Antisthenes
                    and Archestratus, who were his masters, that he was a good man and an honest,
                    and so won their confidence. <milestone n="44" unit="section"/>It is remarkable
                    what a striking thing it is in the eyes of people who are active in commercial

                    imparted to Pasio by his masters; he was himself honest by nature; nor did your

                    have made honest, if he had had the power. If you do not know that for
                    money-making the best capital of all is trustworthiness, you do not know
                    anything at all. But, apart from all this, Phormio has in many ways shown

                    who does not go to law with you and say that he is outrageously treated, because
                    you wear a soft mantle, and have redeemed one mistress, and have given another
                    in marriage &lpar;all this, while you have a wife of your own&rpar;, and
                    take three attendant slaves about with you, and live so licentiously that even

                    condition. And yet if on this ground you think you have a claim on Phormio's
                    property, because he once belonged to your father, Antimachus has a stronger
                    claim than you have. For your father in his turn belonged to those men, so that
                    both you and Phormio by this argument belong to Antimachus. But you are so lost

                    credit with those who know him for so great an amount and for far larger sums,

                    It happened that the plaintiff also owed a talent to Mnesicles of Collytus<note

                    property and the slaves was Mnesicles, for he had purchased them for the
                    plaintiff from Telemachus, the former owner; and the plaintiff leased them from
                    us at a rent equal to the interest accruing on the money, a hundred and five
                    drachmae a month. We drew up an agreement in which the terms of the lease were
                    stated, and the right was given the plaintiff of redeeming these things from us
                    within a given time. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>When these transactions

                    nor is the plaintiff always consistent with himself; sometimes he says that he
                    was forcibly ousted from his leasehold by Evergus in violation of the agreement;
                    sometimes that Evergus was the cause of his being inscribed as a debtor to the

                    chooses to say. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>But Evergus tells a plain and
                    consistent story, that since he was not receiving his interest, and the
                    plaintiff was not performing any of the other things stipulated in the
                    agreement, he went and took from the plaintiff, with the latter's consent, what
                    was his own, and kept it; that after this the plaintiff went away, but came back
                    bringing men to make claim to the property; that he on his own part did not give
                    way in their favour, but made no objection to the plaintiff's holding that for
                    which he had given a lease, provided he should observe the terms of the
                    agreement. From these men, then, I hear stories of this sort. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/>This, however, I know well, that, if the plaintiff speaks
                    the truth, and has been outrageously treated, as he says, by Evergus, he has had
                    satisfaction to the amount at which he himself assessed his damages; for he came
                    into your court and won his suit against him; and surely he has no right to
                    obtain damages for the same wrongs both from the one who committed them and from
                    me, who was not even in Athens. But, if it is Evergus who speaks the truth, he
                    has been made the object, it appears, of a baseless and malicious charge; but
                    even so there is no ground for my being sued on the same charge.<milestone

                    sailed, I heard, and found it was true, that the plaintiff had given up the
                    property and that Evergus was in possession and control of what we had
                    purchased. I was distressed beyond words, seeing that the matter had got into an
                    awkward predicament; for it was now necessary for me either to enter into
                    partnership with Evergus for the working and management of the property, or have
                    him for a debtor instead of Pantaenetus, and draw up a new lease and enter into
                    a contract with him; and I liked neither of these alternatives. <milestone

                    and happening to see Mnesicles, who had sold us the property, I came up to him,
                    and reproached him, telling what sort of a man he had recommended to me, and I
                    questioned him regarding the claimants, asking what this was all about. On
                    hearing this, he laughed at the claimants, but stated that they wished to have a
                    conference with us. He declared that he would bring us together, and that he
                    would urge the plaintiff to do all that was right in my regard, and he thought
                    he would persuade him to do so. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>When we had
                    our meeting&mdash;what need is there to tell you all the
                    details?&mdash;the men came who claimed to have made loans to the plaintiff
                    on the security of the mining property and the slaves, which we bought from
                    Mnesicles; and there was nothing straightforward or honest about them. Then,
                    when they were convicted of falsehood in all their statements and Mnesicles
                    confirmed our having bought the property, they offered us a challenge, assuming
                    that we should not accept it, either to take all our money from them and
                    withdraw, or to settle with them by paying their claims; for the security which
                    we held was, they claimed, worth far more than the sums we had lent. <milestone

                    without even taking thought, I agreed to take my money, and I persuaded Evergus
                    to adopt the same course. But when the time came for us to receive our money,
                    the matter having been brought to this conclusion, the people who had previously
                    made the offer declared then that they would not pay us unless we became vendors
                    to them of the property, and in this point anyway, men of Athens, they were

                    stood thus, and the people whom the plaintiff had introduced to us would not

                    what we had purchased, he begged, and implored, and besought us to sell the
                    property. As he made this demand and begged me most earnestly&mdash;there is

                    evil disposition, that at the outset he had made charges to us against
                    Mnesicles, and then had quarrelled with Evergus, with whom he was on terms of
                    closest friendship; that at the first, when I returned from my voyage, he
                    pretended that he was glad to see me, but when the time came for him to do what
                    was right, he became surly with me; that he was a friend to all men until he got
                    some advantage and attained what he wanted, and thereafter became their foe and
                    was at variance with them; <milestone n="16" unit="section"/>I therefore thought

                    thus make a final settlement with him. This was agreed to, and he gave me a
                    release in full, while I, as he begged me to do, assumed the position of vendor
                    of the property, exactly as I had myself bought it from Mnesicles. Having, then,
                    recovered my money, and having done the plaintiff no wrong whatsoever, I

                    law, men of Athens, expressly stating that in cases where anyone has given a
                    release and discharge, there shall be no further action. And that both these
                    have been effected between the plaintiff and myself, you have heard from the
                    witnesses. One should not, of course, bring suit in any case when the law
                    forbids it, but least of all ought one in a case like this. For in regard to
                    sales made by the state, one might claim that it had made the sale unjustly, or
                    had sold what was not its own; <milestone n="20" unit="section"/>and in regard
                    to court decisions it might be claimed that the decision had been rendered
                    through error; and in all other cases where the law forbids action exception
                    might plausibly be taken to each one. But when anyone has himself yielded to
                    argument and given a release, he cannot in the very nature of the case charge
                    himself with having acted unjustly. Those who bring suit in defiance of any
                    other of these provisions fail to abide by what others have determined to be
                    just; but he who again brings suit in matters regarding which he has given a
                    release fails to abide by his own decision. Therefore, against all such your

                    who do any of the things mentioned in the law. But a man who has lent money to
                    Pantaenetus, and by persistently sticking to him has with difficulty got it
                    back, is not also to be made defendant in a mining suit; I should say not!

                    bringing suit regarding claims for which he had given a release, last month, men
                    of Athens, when I was on the point of entering the court, and the court-rooms
                    had already been allotted to the jurymen, he came up to me and surrounded me
                    with his minions &lpar;that gang of his fellow-conspirators&rpar;, and
                    did a most outrageous thing. <milestone n="40" unit="section"/>He read me a long

                    were true, I should have to pay him the damages charged without adjustment by
                    the jury; but if they were false, Mnesicles, the torturer, should determine the
                    value of the slave. When he had received sureties to this agreement from me and

                    prevail by a preponderance of fair play, made this

                    defendant in a suit which has no valid basis, you render me the succor which is
                    my due. The damages claimed in the action are, as you have heard, thirty minae;
                    but the sum for which we are really being sued is four talents. For there are
                    two of them, and they have entered four suits against us, all for a like amount,

                        The best established text can be rendered only as above; but the question at
                        once arises: why the long lapse of time between the filing of the suit and
                        the settlement? Again, the use of <foreign lang="greek"

                        unexplained. If with MS. A we read <foreign lang="greek"

                        accounting from their guardians.</note> when my father was now dead, with
                    whom the settlement had been made and also the guardians who after his death had
                    charge of our property, when their own mother, too, was dead, who was
                    well-informed regarding all these matters, and the arbitrators, the witnesses,
                    and almost everybody else, if I may so say, counting our inexperience and
                    necessary ignorance a boon to themselves, they have instituted these suits
                    against us, and have the audacity to make statements which are neither just nor
                    reasonable. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>They declare that they did not sell
                    their father's estate for the money which they received, nor did they give up
                    the property, but that all that was left them&mdash;credits, furniture, and
                    even money&mdash;still belongs to them. I, for my part, know by hearsay that
                    Xenopeithes and Nausicrates<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">The former was the
                        uncle, the latter the father of the plaintiff.</note> left their entire
                    property in outstanding debts, and possessed very little tangible property; and
                    that when the debts had been collected and some furniture and slaves had been
                    sold, their guardians purchased the farms and lodging-houses, which our
                    opponents received from them. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>If there had been
                    no dispute about these matters before, and no suit had been entered charging
                    maladministration of the property, it would have been another story; but since
                    these men brought suit against our father in the matter of his general conduct
                    as guardian and recovered damages, all these matters were at that time released.
                    For our opponents, I take it, did not bring suit for the mere name
                    &ldquo;mal-administration in guardianship,&rdquo; but for the money; nor
                    did the guardians buy off this name with the money which they paid, but they
                    bought off the claims. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P"
                        unit="para"/>That, therefore, these men have no right of action against us
                    for the debts which our father collected before the settlement, or, in general,
                    for monies which he received by virtue of his guardianship, seeing that they
                    have given a release for their claims, I think you have all adequately learned
                    from the laws themselves and from the release. Moreover, that it is impossible
                    that the collection of these funds should have been made subsequently
                    &lpar;this is the story they are making up to lead you astray&rpar;, I
                    wish to prove. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>As for my father, they cannot
                    charge that he received them; for he died three or four months after the
                    settlement was made with them; and that Demaretus, whom our father left as our
                    guardian, could not have received them either &lpar;for they have written
                    his name also in their complaint&rpar;, this, too, I shall show. <milestone
                        n="11" unit="section"/>These men are themselves our strongest witnesses; for
                    they will be shown never to have brought suit against Demaretus in his lifetime;
                    but, more than that, anyone who examines and studies the case itself will see,
                    not only that he did not receive the money, but that it was impossible that he
                    should have received it. For the debt was in Bosporus, a place which Demaretus
                    never visited; how, then, could he have collected it? Ah, but, they will say, he
                    sent someone to get the money. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>But look at the
                    matter in this way. Hermonax owed these men one hundred staters,<note
                        resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">The Athenian stater was a gold coin worth twenty
                        drachmae.</note> which he had received from Nausicrates. Aristaechmus was
                    for sixteen years the guardian and caretaker of these men. Therefore, the money
                    which Hermonax paid in his own person after these men had come of age, he had
                    not paid when they were minors; for he certainly did not pay the same debt
                    twice. Now is there any man so silly as voluntarily to pay money to one not
                    entitled to it, who demanded it by letter, when he had for so long a time evaded
                    payment to the rightful owners? For my part, I think there is not. <milestone

                    I am speaking the truth,&mdash;that our father died immediately after the
                    settlement, that these men never brought suit against Demaretus for this money,
                    and that he absolutely never went to sea, nor visited Bosporus, take the

                    father received it in payment, and passed it over to them as a debt due and

                    ground that he rendered no account. But if it is to be permitted you to bring
                    your malicious charge on both grounds, and at one time you collected money
                    because he did not hand something over to you, and at another are suing him on

                    say. Yes, and you made a settlement, too; so you have no right to bring a fresh
                    suit. Else it would be an outrageous thing, if for original wrongdoings the law
                    does not allow suit to be brought by orphans after five years against guardians
                    who have not been released, but now in the twentieth year you are to maintain an
                    action against us, the children of your guardians, for matters concerning which

                    facts of the case and upon the laws, and are prepared to assert that a large
                    estate was left them and that they were defrauded of it; and that they will
                    advance as a proof of this the large sum asked as damages in their original
                    suit, and they will wail over their orphanhood, and will go through the
                    guardianship accounts. These and such-like points are the ones upon which they

                    in the suits then brought is a stronger proof for us, that our father was the
                    victim of a malicious action, than for them, that they were being defrauded of a
                    large estate. For if he could prove his claims for eighty talents, no man in the
                    world would have accepted three talents in settlement; whereas anyone, being
                    defendant in a guardianship suit involving such large sums, would have paid
                    three talents to buy off the risk and the advantages with which at that time
                    nature supplied these men. They were orphans and young, and you were ignorant of
                    their real characters; and everyone says that in your courts these things have

                        ff.</note> For suppose one should grant that they have suffered the greatest
                    possible wrongs, and that everything which they will now allege about these
                    matters is true, this, at least, I presume you would all admit: that it has
                    happened to others ere now to have suffered many wrongs more serious than
                    pecuniary wrongs. For involuntary homicides, outrages on what is sacred, and
                    many other such crimes are committed; yet in all these cases the fact they have
                    yielded to persuasion and given a release is appointed for the parties wronged
                    as a limit and settlement of the dispute. <milestone n="22" unit="section"/>And
                    this just principle is so binding among all men, that, if one, having convicted
                    another of involuntary homicide, and clearly shown him to be polluted,
                    subsequently takes pity upon him, and releases him, he has no longer the right
                    to have the same person driven into exile. If, then, when life and all that is
                    most precious are at stake, a release has this power and validity, shall it be
                    without effect, when money is at stake, or claims of lesser importance? Surely
                    not. For the thing most to be feared is, not that I should fail to obtain
                    justice in your court, but that a just practice, established from the beginning

                    and then afterwards to seek to prevent it. And yet, if you had allowed him, my

                    he did in that of the clansmen. Then, O Earth and the Gods, it is monstrous for
                    him to claim that Mantias is his father, and yet to have the audacity to try to
                    make of none effect what Mantias did in his lifetime. <milestone n="22"

                    name Mantitheus; and he brought forward as witnesses persons with whom my father
                    was never known to be intimate. But I think that not one of you is unaware that
                    no man would have kept the tenth day for a child which he did not believe was
                    rightly his own; nor, if he had kept the day and shown the affection one would

                    is better for you to listen to a few statements. I remember seeing him, before
                    he became a relative of mine, casually, as one might see anyone else, and
                    thought him younger than I, and to judge by appearances, much younger; but I

                    questions: &ldquo;When you thought it right to join the chorus in the tribe
                    Hippothontis before you claimed to be the son of my father, what name would you
                    have set down as rightly belonging to you? For if you should say, Mantitheus,
                    you could not do so on the plea that you are older than I, for since at that
                    time you did not suppose you had any connection even with my tribe, how could
                    you claim to be related to my grandfather? <milestone n="29" unit="section"
                    />Besides, men of Athens, not one of you knows the number of the years, for I
                    shall say that I am the elder, and he will say that he is, but you all
                    understand the just way of reckoning. And what is this? That these men should be
                    considered children of my father from the date when he adopted them. Well then,
                    he entered me on the register of the demesmen as Mantitheus, before he
                    introduced this man to the clansmen. Therefore not by virtue of time only, but
                    also by virtue of justice I have the right to bear this name as a mark of
                    seniority. <milestone n="30" unit="section"/>Very well. Now, suppose one should
                    ask you this question? &ldquo;Tell me, Boeotus, how is it that you have now
                    become a member of the tribe Acamantis, and of the deme Thoricus, and a son of
                    Mantias, and have your share in the property left by him?&rdquo; You could
                    give no other answer than, &ldquo;Mantias while living acknowledged me, too,
                    as his son.&rdquo; If one should ask you what proof you had of this or what
                    evidence, you would say, &ldquo;He introduced me to the clansmen.&rdquo;
                    But if one asked under what name he enrolled you, you would say,
                    &ldquo;Boeotus,&rdquo; for that is the name by which you were
                    introduced. <milestone n="31" unit="section"/>It is, then, an outrage that
                    whereas thanks to that name you have a share in the right of citizenship and in
                    the estate left by my father, you should see fit to fling it aside and take
                    another name. Come; suppose my father were to rise from the grave and demand of
                    you either to abide by the name under which he adopted you, or to declare
                    yourself the son of some other father, would his demand not be thought a
                    reasonable one? Well then, I make this same demand of you, either to add to your
                    name that of another father, or to keep the name which Mantias gave you.
                        <milestone n="32" unit="section"/>Ah, you may say, but that name was given
                    you by way of derision or insult. No; very often, during the time when my father
                    refused to acknowledge them, these men used to say that the kinsfolk of the
                    defendant's mother were quite as good as those of my father. Boeotus is the name
                    of his mother's brother; and when my father was compelled to bring them into the
                    clan, when I had already been introduced as Mantitheus, he introduced the
                    defendant as Boeotus, and his brother as Pamphilus. For I challenge you to show
                    me any Athenian who ever gave the same name to two of his sons. If you can, I
                    will grant that my father gave you this name by way of insult. <milestone n="33"

                    regard as a brother. Therefore, during the time in which he refused to recognize
                    you, I also counted you as no relative; but ever since he, adopted you, I too

                    Boeotus, and not Mantitheus. For when I had entered this suit against Boeotus,
                    son of Mantias, of Thoricus, at the first he accepted service of the suit, and
                    put in an oath for delay, as being Boeotus; but finally, when there was no
                    longer room for evasion, he allowed the arbitrators to give judgement against

                    thus considerable time was wasted, and it came about that Solon died. These men
                    then instituted their suit against me afresh, and I my suit against the
                    defendant, summoning him under the name of Boeotus, and inscribing that name on

                    appeared and fought the case, but, since he was unable to establish any of their

                    making charges without any just basis, did not appeal to a jury, and has not now
                    entered any suit against me in regard to these matters, but in regard to some
                    others, thinking to break down this suit of mine by these counter-charges.<note

                    Boeotus in regard to the marriage-portion, since he was here in Athens and did
                    not appear before the arbitrator, the latter gave judgement against him by

                    Mantitheus; and thus, by quibbling about a name, he is in fact depriving me of
                    my mother's portion. As I was at a loss to know how one should deal with a

                    what he says; for he is fully conscious that in your court no man who confessed
                    his guilt was ever acquitted, whereas by lying and advancing arguments to lead

                    their mother did, bear in mind that he is manifestly lying. To begin with,
                    Pamphilus, the father of this man's mother, died owing five talents to the
                    public treasury, and so far from there being any surplus proceeds for his

                    indebtedness has not been paid in full, but to this day Pamphilus stands
                    inscribed as a debtor to the treasury. How, then, can it be that my father
                    received money from the estate of Pamphilus, which proved inadequate to pay in
                    full even the debt due to the city? <milestone n="23" unit="section"
                    />Furthermore, men of the jury, bear this in mind, that were it never so true
                    that this surplus money did accrue as these men pretend, it was not my father
                    who would have received it, but the sons of Pamphilus, Boeotus and Hedylus and
                    Euthydemus; and, I fancy, they are not men who would go to all lengths to get
                    hold of the property of others, as you all know, and yet at the same time
                    quietly have allowed my father to take possession of what was theirs. <milestone

                    mother did bring one, I shall easily show. In the first place, she was the
                    daughter of Polyaratus, who was both honored by you citizens, and had acquired a

                    large fortunes themselves, and who, after Cleomedon's death, received back the

                    did, should my father have denied that they were his sons, and have acknowledged
                    me, and brought me up? Because, forsooth, as these men will claim, he dishonored

                    that for the sake of the living woman, with whom he was in love all this time,
                    he would dishonor the son of her who was dead, than that for my sake and my dead

                    to cast your votes. <milestone n="61" unit="section"/>But if, having no
                    trustworthy witnesses, nor any other proofs regarding the matters upon which he
                    is being sued, he shall try unscrupulously to introduce irrelevant arguments,
                    and if he indulges in outcries and protestations which have nothing to do with
                    the matter, I adjure you by Zeus and the Gods, do not tolerate it; nay, render
                    me the help that is my due, remembering in the light of all that I have urged
                    that it is far more just that you should by your verdict give my mother's
                    portion to my daughter for her dowry, than that Plangon and these men, in
                    addition to all the rest that they have done, should, in utter defiance of
                    justice, rob me also of my house, which was set apart to secure the payment of
                    the marriage-portion.</p>
