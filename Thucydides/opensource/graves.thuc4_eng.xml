<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">tou= d' e)pigignome/nou qe/rous</lemma>&mdash;the opening words introduced by <foreign lang="greek">de/</foreign> complete the sentence which ends the preceding book, <foreign lang="greek">tau=ta me\n kata\ to\n xeimw=na tou=ton e)ge/neto k.t.l.</foreign> The third and fifth books begin in the same way. <hi rend="BOLD"><foreign lang="greek">qe/rous</foreign></hi>&mdash;&lsquo;in the summer&rsquo;; the genitive denotes the time <hi rend="ITALIC">within the limits of which</hi> a thing occurs, and is <hi rend="ITALIC">partitive</hi> in character (Madvig, &sect; 66).
Thucydides divides his history into summers and winters, thus reckoning more accurately, as he points out (<bibl n="Thuc. 5. 20">v. 20</bibl>), than by the names of the archons or other officials of the year in different states.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">peri\ si/tou e)kbolh/n</lemma>&mdash;lit. &lsquo;putting forth (ears)&rsquo;. Some time in April is probably denoted: see Arnold's note on <foreign lang="greek">tou= si/tou a)kma/zontos</foreign>, <bibl n="Thuc. 2. 19">ii. 19</bibl>; and Jowett on <bibl n="Thuc. 2. 1">ii. 1</bibl>. The latter holds that the terms <foreign lang="greek">a)kma/zein</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">e)n a)kmh=| ei)=nai</foreign> refer to the time when the corn was in full ear, though not ready for harvest. In Attica this would be about May 10&mdash;June 10, harvest beginning about June 15.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">pleu/sasai</lemma>&mdash;the order of the sentence shews that this word belongs to <foreign lang="greek">*surakosi/wn de/ka nh=es</foreign>: the Syracusans put to sea, and after being joined by the Locrians went to Messene.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">*lokri/des</lemma>&mdash;Locri Epizephyrii, a colony founded by the Locrians of Greece, was in the S.E. of what is now Calabria. It was in alliance with Syracuse (<bibl n="Thuc. 3. 86">iii. 86</bibl>). Messene (now Messina) had been forced to join the Athenian confederacy the year before (<bibl n="Thuc. 3. 90">iii. 90</bibl>). A summary of its history is given <bibl n="Thuc. 6. 4">vi. 4</bibl>. <foreign lang="greek">i)/sai</foreign>&mdash;&lsquo;an equal number&rsquo;: <bibl n="Thuc. 3. 75">iii. 75</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">i)/sas plhrw/santes</foreign>. <pb n="110"/>
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kate/labon</lemma>&mdash;&lsquo;occupied&rsquo;, especially used of taking up a military position: cf. <foreign lang="greek">katalamba/nwn</foreign>, ch. 3, 18: <bibl n="Thuc. 3. 31">iii. 31</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">tw=n po/lewn katalabei=n tina/</foreign>: so <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 455b">Plato, Gorg. 455 B</bibl>, speaks of <foreign lang="greek">xwri/wn kata/. lhyis</foreign> as a subject for military debate.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">au)tw=n e)pagagome/nwn</lemma>&mdash;&lsquo;the people themselves having invited them&rsquo;; the preceding <foreign lang="greek">*messhnhn</foreign> shews to what <foreign lang="greek">au)tw=n</foreign> refers: cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 1. 136">i. 136</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">feu/gei e/s *ke/rkuran, w)\n au)tw=n eu)erge/ths</foreign>.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)/pracan de)</lemma>&mdash;the verb being placed first, the subject is divided into two parts, <foreign lang="greek">oi\ me\n *surako/sioi . . . oi( de\ *lokroi/</foreign>, the respective motives of the allies being thus distinguished: cf. line 17.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">o(rw=ntes prosbolh\n e)/xon</lemma>&mdash;&lsquo;seeing that the place commanded, or afforded (lit. contained), an approach, or point of landing and attack&rsquo;, i.e. it was the key of Sicily. So the Messenians are said <foreign lang="greek">e/n prosbolh=| ei)=nai th=s *sikeli/as</foreign>, <bibl n="Thuc. 6. 48">vi. 48</bibl>; and an Athenian squadron despatched to the straits of Messene is said <foreign lang="greek">peri\ th\n prosbolh\n th=s *sikeli/as nauloxei=n</foreign>, <bibl n="Thuc. 7. 4">vii. 4</bibl>. <hi rend="BOLD"><foreign lang="greek">e)/xw</foreign></hi> is used in the same way in ch. 8, 40, <foreign lang="greek">a)po/basin ou)k e)/xousan</foreign>, &lsquo;not admitting of a landing&rsquo;. From the idea of &lsquo;containing in itself&rsquo; it is often used in the sense of &lsquo;bringing with itself&rsquo;, and therefore of <hi rend="ITALIC">involving</hi> or <hi rend="ITALIC">implying,</hi> the equivalent English depending on the context; e.g. <bibl n="Thuc. 1. 97">i. 97</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">a)po/deicin e)/xei</foreign>, &lsquo;affords a proof&rsquo;: <bibl n="Thuc. 2. 41">ii. 41</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">a)gana/kthsin e)/xei</foreign>, &lsquo;gives ground of complaint&rsquo;: <bibl n="Thuc. 2. 61">ii. 61</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">ai)/sqhsin e)/xei</foreign>, &lsquo;causes perception&rsquo;.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">th=s *sikeli/as</lemma>&mdash;<hi rend="ITALIC">objective</hi> gen. after <foreign lang="greek">prosbolh/n</foreign>: so ch. 83, 6, <foreign lang="greek">e/pi\ th=| e)sbolh=| th=s *lu/gkou</foreign>, &lsquo;at the <hi rend="ITALIC">pass into</hi> Lyncus&rsquo;.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)c au)tou= o(rmw/menoi</lemma>&mdash;&lsquo;making it a base of operations&rsquo; against Syracuse, lit. &lsquo;starting from it&rsquo;: so ch. 3, 22. <hi rend="BOLD"><foreign lang="greek">pote/</foreign></hi> &mdash;&lsquo;sooner or later, some day&rsquo;: so ch. 60, 16. If the Athenians had possession of Messene, their command of the sea would enable them to collect forces and supplies there, so as to attack Syracuse at their own time.
</p>
<p>Rhegium was on the Italian side of the straits of Messene. It was in alliance with the Athenians and Leontines (<bibl n="Thuc. 3. 86">iii. 86</bibl>). The Athenian ships under Pythodorus were apparently stationed there at the present time, but made no effort to save Messene. Pythodorus may have been crippled by a defeat he had lately sustained in an attack on a Locrian fortress (<bibl n="Thuc. 3. 115">iii. 115</bibl>).
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)mfote/rwqen</lemma>&mdash;by land and sea: so ch. 11, 9: <bibl n="Thuc. 3. 18">iii. 18</bibl>.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e\s th\n *(rhgi/nwn</lemma>&mdash;sc. <foreign lang="greek">gh=n</foreign>: <bibl n="Thuc. 1. 44">i. 44</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">th=| a:llh/lwn bohqei=n</foreign>.
</p>
  <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)pibohqw=si</lemma>&mdash;the subjunctive is more graphic than the optative, which according to rule should follow the pluperfect. &lsquo;The historians, especially Thucydides, seem often to have <pb n="111"/> thrown themselves so completely into the past events which they recorded that those events became <hi rend="ITALIC">as present</hi> to them, and hence a form of the <hi rend="ITALIC">subjunctive</hi> group follows a <hi rend="ITALIC">historic</hi> tense. Sometimes indeed forms from both groups occur in a clause dependent on the same historical tense, as <bibl n="Thuc. 3. 22">iii. 22</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">o(/pws a)safh= tense by the best Attic ta\ shmei=a toi=s polemi/ois h)=|, kai\ mh\ bohqoi=en</foreign>. In such examples the  <hi rend="ITALIC">subjunctive</hi> form often expresses the <hi rend="ITALIC">more immediate</hi> or more certain contingency, and the <hi rend="ITALIC">optative</hi> form the <hi rend="ITALIC">more remote</hi> or more uncertain contingency&rsquo; (Clyde's <hi rend="ITALIC">Greek Syntax,</hi> &sect; 40, obs. 2). Apart from cases which can be thus explained, the subjunctive is constantly used after a historic tense by the best Attic writers, and in later Greek tends to supplant the optative altogether (Clyde, loc. cit.: Madvig, &sect; 131 b).
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">cunepago/ntwn</lemma>&mdash;&lsquo;joining in promoting the invasion&rsquo;. ch. 84, 6. <foreign lang="greek">cunepa/gontes</foreign>: ch. 79, 11, <foreign lang="greek">ai\ plhsio/xwroi po/leis cuneph=gon</foreign>: so <hi rend="ITALIC">ib.</hi> line 7, <foreign lang="greek">e)ch/gagon to\n strato/n</foreign>: <bibl n="Thuc. 1. 107">i. 107</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">e)ph=gon</foreign>. In such instances the active differs from the middle, the latter meaning &lsquo;to invite&rsquo;, i.e. bring in <hi rend="ITALIC">to one's self.</hi> The reasons of the Locrian invasion are given in two clauses of different construction, a final clause, <hi rend="BOLD"><foreign lang="greek">i(/na mh/</foreign></hi>..., and a genitive absolute introduced by <hi rend="BOLD"><foreign lang="greek">a(/ma de/</foreign>.</hi>
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)stasi/aze</lemma>&mdash;&lsquo;had been for a long while in a state of faction&rsquo;. The imperfect shews that the state of faction still continued: this corresponds to the well-known use of the present to denote what is <hi rend="ITALIC">still going on,</hi> as <foreign lang="greek">nosei= pa/lai</foreign>, &lsquo;he has been long sick&rsquo;.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)du/nata h)=n</lemma>&mdash;&lsquo;it was impossible&rsquo;: so <bibl n="Thuc. 1. 59">i. 59</bibl>: <bibl n="Thuc. 2. 72">ii. 72</bibl>: <bibl n="Thuc. 3. 86">iii. 86</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">ei) dunata\ ei)/h</foreign>. Such neuter plurals are very common; see Shilleto on <bibl n="Thuc. 1. 7">i. 7</bibl>.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">h(=| kai\ ma=llon e)peti/qento</lemma>&mdash;&lsquo;wherefore they attacked them the more&rsquo;, this was a further reason for choosing this time for their attack: cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 1. 11">i. 11</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">h(=| kai\ ma=llon oi( *trw=es a)ntei=xon</foreign>: <bibl n="Thuc. 3. 13">iii. 13</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">h(=| kai\ ma=llon xrh/</foreign>. With this may be compared the Homeric <foreign lang="greek">tw=|</foreign>, e.g. <bibl n="Hom. Il. 1. 418">Il. i. 418</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">tw=| se kakh=| ai)/sh| te/kon. <hi rend="BOLD">e)peti/qento</hi></foreign>&mdash;lit. &lsquo;set on them&rsquo;: cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 3. 72">iii. 72</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">e)piti/qentai tw=| dh/mw|</foreign>, &lsquo;they attack the democracy&rsquo;.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)/llai ai( plhrou/menai</lemma>&mdash;lit. &lsquo;others. viz. those which were being manned&rsquo;, the definite article implying that such ships were in preparation, and contrasting them with those already afloat. Possibly <foreign lang="greek">ai(</foreign> has got into the text from the end of <foreign lang="greek">a)/llai</foreign>.</p>

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e(/mellon au)to/se e)gkaqormisa/menai</lemma>&mdash;&lsquo;were intended to take up their position in the harbour of Messene&rsquo;, etc. <hi rend="BOLD"><foreign lang="greek">au)to/se</foreign></hi> implies the idea of <hi rend="ITALIC">motion to</hi> the harbour: so <bibl n="Thuc. 3. 76">iii. 76</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">o(rmisa/menoi e)s lime/na</foreign>: ch. 8, 26, <foreign lang="greek">e)formi/sasqai e)s</foreign>. The place meant is <pb n="112"/> here determined by the preceding <foreign lang="greek">*messh/nhn</foreign>: cf. the use of <hi rend="BOLD"><foreign lang="greek">au)to/se</foreign>,</hi> ch. 2, 13. <foreign lang="greek">o(rmi/zw</foreign> and its compounds mean <hi rend="ITALIC">to bring</hi> (ships) <hi rend="ITALIC">to anchor,</hi> and in the middle to <hi rend="ITALIC">come to anchor.</hi> <foreign lang="greek">e/gkaqormi/zomai</foreign>, &lsquo;to come to anchor <hi rend="ITALIC">in</hi>&rsquo; a certain station, is not found elsewhere in Thucydides.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">*peloponnh/sioi...e)se/balon</lemma>&mdash;The Peloponnesian forces had invaded Attica every year since the outbreak of the war, with the exception of 429 and 426. Their ravages caused much suffering to the Athenians, who were driven from the country and crowded within the city walls. The distress was especially great in 430, the year remarkable for the outbreak of the great plague. The Athenians usually retaliated by ravaging the coasts of Laconia with their fleet. The phrase <foreign lang="greek">*peloponnh/sioi kai\ oi\ cu/mmaxoi</foreign> is commonly employed for the allied forces, e.g. <bibl n="Thuc. 2. 47">ii. 47</bibl>, <bibl n="Thuc. 3. 1">iii. 1</bibl>, in which passages the invasion is described in almost the same words which are here used. The article is omitted before <foreign lang="greek">*peloponnh/sioi</foreign>, as is not uncommon with proper names. Sometimes the omission has no particular force: at other times, as in ch. 10, 25, &lsquo;I call on you, who are Athenians&rsquo;, it calls attention to the particular characteristics of the people spoken of as bearing on the point in question. So we say, &lsquo;Is this worthy of Englishmen?&rsquo; i.e. of men who, <hi rend="ITALIC">as being Englishmen,</hi> profess to be brave, humane, etc.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)gkaqezo/menoi</lemma>&mdash;&lsquo;taking up their position <hi rend="ITALIC">in</hi>&rsquo; the country.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ta\s tessara/konta nau=s</lemma>&mdash;&lsquo;the forty ships which (as we have related) they were getting ready&rsquo;; see <bibl n="Thuc. 3. 115">iii. 115</bibl>. The use of the definite article and of the imperfect tense has reference to presupposed knowledge in the reader.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">*kerkurai/wn...e)pimelhqh=nai</lemma>&mdash;&lsquo;to see to the Corcyreans in the city&rsquo;. Two years ago the popular party in Corcyra had overcome the aristocratical party and massacred most of them. Five hundred who had escaped established themselves with a few auxiliaries on Mount Istone, and carried on a plundering warfare against the democracy (<bibl n="Thuc. 3. 70">iii. 70</bibl>&mdash;85). <hi rend="BOLD"><foreign lang="greek">paraple/ontas</foreign></hi> is put in the accusative before <foreign lang="greek">e)pimelhqh=nai</foreign>, though <foreign lang="greek">tou/tois</foreign> to which it refers closely precedes it: cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 1. 53">i. 53</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">e)/docen au)toi=s e/mbiba/. santas prospe/myai</foreign>. Such a violation of strict grammatical principle is very common in Greek writers, who study above all things to avoid stiffness of expression.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">timwroi/</lemma>&mdash;&lsquo;to help those in the mountain, and because they thought&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">timwroi/</foreign> is feminine, being a predicate in agreement with <foreign lang="greek">nh=es</foreign>: so <bibl n="Thuc. 3. 36">iii. 36</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">nh=es bohqoi/</foreign>. After this <hi rend="BOLD"><foreign lang="greek">nomi/zontes</foreign></hi> is introduced, in accordance with the sense of the passage, as if <foreign lang="greek">*peloponnh/sioi</foreign> had preceded and not <foreign lang="greek">*peloponnhsi/wn nh=es</foreign>: so <bibl n="Thuc. 1. 110">i. 110</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">trih/reis e)s *ai)/gupton e)/sxon, ou/k ei)do/tes tw=n gegenhme/nwn ou/de/n</foreign>.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">katasxh/sein ta\ pra/gmata</lemma>&mdash;&lsquo;would get the control of affairs&rsquo;: cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 3. 72">iii. 72</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">oi( e)/xontes ta\ pra/gmata</foreign>, &lsquo;those in power&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">katalamba/nw</foreign> &lsquo;to get hold of&rsquo; is used in the passive with <foreign lang="greek">ta\ pra/gmata</foreign>, <bibl n="Thuc. 3. 30">iii. 30</bibl>: and <foreign lang="greek">ta\ pra/gmata e)fai/neto katalhpta/</foreign> is found <bibl n="Thuc. 3. 11">iii. 11</bibl>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">o)/nti i)diw/th|</lemma>&mdash;&lsquo;who had held no command&rsquo;, lit. &lsquo;who had been (and was now) in a private position&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">i)diw/ths</foreign> in reference to any profession or business means a layman or non-professional person. Demosthenes had been sent round Peloponnesus with an Athenian force the year before. He met with a severe defeat in Aetolia, but was more successful in Acarnania, where he headed the natives against the Peloponnesians and Ambraciots (<bibl n="Thuc. 3. 94">iii. 94</bibl>&mdash;98, 100&mdash;102, 105&mdash;114). <foreign lang="greek">au)tw=| dehqe/nti</foreign>&mdash;&lsquo;at his own request&rsquo;.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)pe/xei ga/r</lemma>&mdash;the ancient territory of Messenia had been subdued by the Lacedaemonians, and the people driven from their country or reduced to serfdom. On the suppression of the final struggle for freedom in 455, the Athenians gave the Messenians a settlement at Naupactus on the Corinthian Gulf (<bibl n="Thuc. 1. 101">i. 101</bibl>&mdash;3). Demosthenes had acted with the Messenians of Naupactus in his last year's campaign (<bibl n="Thuc. 3. 94">iii. 94</bibl>, etc.). He proposed now to employ them in the occupation of some post in Peloponnesus, where their hatred of the Spartans, and knowledge of the country and the dialect might best be turned to account. For such a purpose Pylos seemed especially fit. It was far from Sparta, the district was uninhabited, the position was easy to defend, and it commanded an excellent harbour. The harbour of Pylos is identified with the modern Bay of Navarino; but the description given by Thucydides in ch. 8 of the narrowness of the two entrances is not in accordance with their present state. The southern channel is now some 1400 yards in width, and the northern not less than 150. <pb n="115"/> See Grote, vol. iv. ch. 52, and Arnold: also Jowett on the present passage.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">dapana=n</lemma>&mdash;commonly taken as governing <foreign lang="greek">th\n po/lin</foreign>, in the sense &lsquo;to use up, impoverish by expenditure&rsquo;.

On the other hand it is simpler to retain the usual sense of <foreign lang="greek">dapana=n</foreign>, &lsquo;to spend&rsquo;, and to make <foreign lang="greek">th\n po/lin</foreign> the subject before the infinitive, <hi rend="BOLD"><foreign lang="greek">katalamba/nwn</foreign>,</hi> by a slight irregularity, being taken closely with <hi rend="BOLD"><foreign lang="greek">bou/lhtai</foreign>.</hi> The sense will then be, &lsquo;if he wished, by occupying them, that the city should incur expense&rsquo;. This view is supported by the fact that Thucydides uses <foreign lang="greek">dapana=n</foreign> in other passages without an accusative following; <bibl n="Thuc. 1. 141">i. 141</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">a)po\ tw=n au)tw=n dapanw=ntes</foreign>: <bibl n="Thuc. 3. 46">iii. 46</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">pw=s ou) bla/bh dapana=n</foreign>; <bibl n="Thuc. 7. 29">vii. 29</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">ou) boulo/menoi dapana=n</foreign>.

</p>
<p>For a full discussion of the usage of <foreign lang="greek">te</foreign> see Jowett on <bibl n="Thuc. 1. 9">i. 9</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">kai\ nautikw=| te a(/ma</foreign>: also Shilleto on the same passage.

<p>We are not told the total number of the men under Demosthenes, but we can make an approximate calculation. He had forty Messenians, and the crews of three triremes. A trireme was manned by about 170 rowers (<foreign lang="greek">nau=tai</foreign>), some half-dozen officers, and a certain number of <foreign lang="greek">e)piba/tai</foreign>, heavy-armed men serving as marines.

When the two ships were sent to Zacynthus their <foreign lang="greek">e)piba/tai</foreign> may have been left at Pylos.

Besides the awkwardness thus involved in supplying the subject to <foreign lang="greek">e)pispa/sasqai</foreign> from the genitive absolute <foreign lang="greek">tou= tei/xous o)/ntos</foreign>, this necessitates giving a <hi rend="ITALIC">future</hi> meaning to the <hi rend="ITALIC">aor. inf.</hi> following <foreign lang="greek">h)gei=to</foreign>. Whether it will bear such a meaning is by no means clear. The same question arises on <bibl n="Thuc. 2. 3">ii. 3</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">e)no/misan krath=sai</foreign>: and perhaps on <bibl n="Thuc. 3. 24">iii. 24</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">nomi/zontes u(potoph=sai</foreign>.
</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the aor. inf. is used in reference to future things after phrases denoting <hi rend="ITALIC">expectation,</hi> such as <foreign lang="greek">e)lpi/zein, e)lpi/s e)stin, ei)ko/s e)stin</foreign> etc.: but it does not follow that words which express merely a <hi rend="ITALIC">thought</hi> or <hi rend="ITALIC">statement,</hi> like <foreign lang="greek">h(gei=to</foreign> in this passage, can be used in the same way. Madvig (&sect; 172 R.) considers that instances of such construction &lsquo;undoubtedly rest upon a false reading, either <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> having been accidentally omitted, or the aorist written by mistake for the future&rsquo;. Goodwin however (<hi rend="ITALIC">Greek Moods and Tenses</hi> &sect; 32) points out that &lsquo;unless we decide to correct a large number of passages against the authority of the MSS, we must admit even this anomalous construction; although it is to be considered strictly exceptional&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>In the passage before us it is perhaps best to cut the knot by reading the fut. <foreign lang="greek">e)pispa/sesqai</foreign>, passive in sense, with <foreign lang="greek">au)tou/s</foreign> as its subject&mdash;&lsquo;he considered that they would be led on to be eager&rsquo;, or possibly &lsquo;would be ready to be led on&rsquo;. It may be that <foreign lang="greek">proqumh/sesqai</foreign> is only an explanation of <foreign lang="greek">e)pispa/sesqai</foreign>, which has found its way into the text: on the other hand a redundancy of almost synonymous infinitives is by no means foreign to the style of Thucydides; while the future inf. is often found after words of <hi rend="ITALIC">thinking, wishing,</hi> etc. e.g. <bibl n="Thuc. 1. 27">i. 27</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek"><hi rend="BOLD">e)deh/qhsan</hi> nausi\ sfa=s cumprope/myein</foreign>.

Speech of Demosthenes to the garrison. His address is brief and soldierlike. We must fight, he says, and fight at once. Nor is there any need for despairing of success, if only we hold our ground.
The place is difficult of approach, and the enemy can only bring a small part of his numbers into action at once. Besides, he is at a disadvantage, having to force the landing from his ships. There is therefore no need to fear an overwhelming onslaught, and a vigorous resistance will make us victorious.

This construction occurs, he says, &lsquo;when the writer wishes to describe the first in time of two events, as not only preceding the other, but as preparing the way for it; so that in describing the second event he may place the prior event before the reader's mind at the same time, as that without which the notion of the second event would be incomplete&rsquo;.

The general sense of the passage is clear, that prudent men will not presume on a continuance of good fortune, especially in war. The grammatical form of the sentence has however given rise to much discussion, and requires close attention.

In the latter case, <foreign lang="greek">e)s a)mfi/bolon qe/sqai</foreign> means &lsquo;to <hi rend="ITALIC">reckon</hi> as doubtful&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">tiqe/nai e)s</foreign> meaning &lsquo;to put down to, count among&rsquo;, while the middle gives the sense &lsquo;in their own case&rsquo;: so <bibl n="Hdt. 3. 3">Hdt. iii. 3</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">e)n timh=| ti/qetai</foreign>, &lsquo;holds in honour&rsquo;.

The former gives the better sense, that <foreign lang="greek">po/lemos</foreign> is a potent thing, which when once called up, can not be got rid of at pleasure.

The meaning is &lsquo;the Lacedaemonians thought that, as the Athenians had all along been desirous of peace, they would now be glad to make it&rsquo;: cf. note on ch. 13, 5, <foreign lang="greek">e)lpi/zontes to\ tei=xos u(/yos me\n e)/xein, a)poba/sews de\ ou)/shs e(lei=n. <hi rend="BOLD">sfw=n de\ e)nantioume/nwn</hi></foreign>&mdash;so in <bibl n="Thuc. 7. 18">vii. 18</bibl> we find the Lacedaemonians admitting that they had forced on the war, and incurred the guilt of refusing negotiations. In 430, the second year of the war, the Athenians had made fruitless proposals for peace (<bibl n="Thuc. 2. 59">ii. 59</bibl>).

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e(toi/mous</lemma>&mdash;according to Poppo, Classen, etc. fem. agreeing with <foreign lang="greek">sponda/s</foreign>, &lsquo;ready for them&rsquo;.

Elsewhere however Thuc. has <foreign lang="greek">e(toi/mh</foreign>; for which reason Kr&uuml;ger takes <foreign lang="greek">e(toi/mous</foreign> as agreeing with <foreign lang="greek">*lakedaimoni/ous</foreign> understood. In this view <foreign lang="greek">poiei=sqai</foreign> is to be taken after <foreign lang="greek">e(toi/mous</foreign>, &lsquo;thinking that the Lacedaemonians were ready to make the truce etc.&rsquo; Besides the difficulty of thus supplying an object to <foreign lang="greek">e)no/mizon</foreign>, this involves the further awkwardness that <foreign lang="greek">pro\s au)tou/s</foreign> (as well as <foreign lang="greek">sfi/si</foreign>) must then be taken as referring to the Athenians.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)nh=ge</lemma>&mdash;&lsquo;urged on&rsquo;: ch. 24, 5, note. <hi rend="BOLD"><foreign lang="greek">*kle/wn o( *kleaine/tou</foreign></hi> &mdash;Cleon is first mentioned by Thucydides in <bibl n="Thuc. 3. 36">iii. 36</bibl>, where he urges the necessity of putting to death the whole of the revolted Mytileneans (B.C. 427). He is then described in very similar words as <foreign lang="greek">w)\n kai\ e)s ta\ a)/lla biaio/tatos tw=n politw=n tw=| te dhmw| para\ polu\ e)n tw=| tote piqanw/tatos</foreign>. It appears from Plutarch (<hi rend="ITALIC">Nicias</hi> ch. 2) that he had already come into notice during <pb n="153"/> the lifetime of Pericles. It is difficult to form a just estimate of the character of Cleon. He is known to us almost entirely through Thucydides and Aristophanes, the former certainly not his friend, the latter his bitter enemy. There can be little doubt that he was loud, overbearing, and violent; but he seems to have been by no means without patriotism and political ability. At the present time he was undeniably right in insisting upon substantial concessions before giving up the advantage which the Athenians had gained; though his conduct was such as to render successful negotiation almost hopeless.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">dhmagwgo/s</lemma>&mdash;&lsquo;leader of the people&rsquo;, a word not used elsewhere by Thucydides.

In the same sense Pithias <foreign lang="greek">tou= dh/mou proei/sthkei</foreign> at Corcyra (<bibl n="Thuc. 2. 70">ii. 70</bibl>); and Athenagoras is called <foreign lang="greek">dh/mou prosta/ths</foreign> at Syracuse (<bibl n="Thuc. 6. 35">vi. 35</bibl>). Such influence being readily open to abuse, the word <hi rend="ITALIC">demagogue</hi> has not unnaturally come to mean, as defined by Johnson, &lsquo;a ringleader of the rabble; a popular and factious orator&rsquo;.

Nisaea and Pegae were the chief ports of the territory of Megara. Troezen was the capital of a district in the E. of Argolis. What is meant by &lsquo;restoring Achaia&rsquo;, is however not so clear. The country of Achaia was an independent state, which in no intelligible sense belonged to the Lacedaemonians or Athenians, or could <pb n="154"/> be &lsquo;given up&rsquo; by the one to the other. In <bibl n="Thuc. 1. 111">i. 111</bibl> we find certain Achaeans accompanying an Athenian force as allies: and possibly alliance and influence with Achaea may have been the point at issue.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)nexw/rhsan a)/praktoi</lemma>&mdash;&lsquo;withdrew without effecting anything&rsquo;. Little else could be expected from the temper of both sides, and the way in which matters were managed. Cleon and the democracy are scarcely to be blamed for demanding more than the Lacedaemonians seemed prepared to grant, while on the other hand a delicate negotiation could not be carried on before the popular assembly. The conduct of affairs at this time seems to have rested chiefly with Nicias and his adherents, but they were powerless to force their views against the will of the people. According to Plutarch (<hi rend="ITALIC">Nicias</hi> ch. 7) it was from personal enmity to Nicias that Cleon persuaded the assembly to reject the truce, <foreign lang="greek">proqu/mws o(rw=n au)to\n sumpra/ttonta toi=s *lakedaimoni/ois</foreign>. Thucydides says nothing of the efforts of Nicias on this occasion, but he relates that in  <pb n="156"/> 422 he was most eager for peace, from his anxiety to preserve his own good fortune and name as a safe and successful general (<bibl n="Thuc. 5. 16">v. 16</bibl>). The impression which we form of his character is that he was a brave and careful commander when actually in the field, but disposed to magnify dangers and difficulties, and deficient in confidence and in a spirit of enterprise. He was also rich and prosperous, and &lsquo;had given hostages to fortune&rsquo;. It is therefore probable that if he had been one of the proposed <foreign lang="greek">cu/nedroi</foreign> he would willingly have agreed to one-sided terms; and Cleon showed both courage and statemanship in opposing such an arrangement.

The Syracusans and allies had thus two naval stations, to which they now fled, <hi rend="BOLD"><foreign lang="greek">w(s e(/kastoi e)/tuxon</foreign></hi>, i.e. each ship made for the nearer point. Classen however points out that there is no mention of any such naval station friendly to Syracuse near Rhegium, and thinks it possible that Thucydides means that the Syracusans returned to Messene, and the  <hi rend="ITALIC">Athenians</hi> to <hi rend="ITALIC">Rhegium,</hi> the sentence to which <foreign lang="greek">oi( *surako/sioi</foreign> is the nominative expanding in meaning at this point, and applying to the combatants <hi rend="ITALIC">on both sides:</hi> &lsquo;they departed, each combatant making for his own headquarters at Messene and Rhegium respectively&rsquo;.
For similar cases of what may be called <hi rend="ITALIC">expanded apposition</hi> see note on ch. 80, 18, <foreign lang="greek">kai\ prokri/nantes e)s disxili/ous..., oi( me\n ta\ i(era\ perih=lqon, oi( de\ k.t.l.</foreign> In the sentence before us however <pb n="160"/> <foreign lang="greek">w(s e(/kastoi</foreign> seems more applicable to the beaten Syracusans only, who fled as they best could in different ways.

Otherwise <foreign lang="greek">au)toi=s</foreign>, which has the better authority, might stand, meaning &lsquo;they destroyed for the enemy&rsquo;.

Hence the meaning seems to be that the Syracusans cast off their tow-ropes, and made an oblique movement at an <hi rend="ITALIC">obtuse angle</hi> to their former course, thus getting into the open and attacking the Athenians first. The Athenian fleet seems to have been in very incompetent hands since the arrival of Pythodorus (<bibl n="Thuc. 3. 115">iii. 115</bibl>).

</p>
<p>This is the first mention of laughter on this occasion, and it was excited simply by Cleon's boastful manner. There is no warrant whatever for the idea that the Athenians committed the incredible folly of forcing the command upon him by way of a joke. Plutarch (<hi rend="ITALIC">Nic.</hi> ch. 7) says <foreign lang="greek">toi=s de\ *)aqhnai/ois e)ph=lqe gela/sai me/ga ma=llon h)\ pisteu=sai</foreign>, when Cleon &lsquo;added his limit&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">prosdiwri/sato</foreign>) of twenty days. Still the majority of the assembly seem to have believed that the attempt ought to be made, and that Cleon would succeed in it. Nicias and his colleagues are however open to grave censure for entrusting the conduct of an expedition, from which they appear to have shrunk themselves, to a man of no military experience or capacity. If this was done merely in the hope of discrediting a political opponent, it would not be easy to find a more disgraceful party man&oelig;uvre. Possibly they may have considered the enterprise feasible, but were not unwilling that its risks should fall upon Cleon, while they knew that Demosthenes would be at hand to advise and direct.

There is no difficulty in the aor. following an expression which denotes <hi rend="ITALIC">expectation:</hi> see notes on ch. 9, 21 and 24, 12.

<p>It has been suggested that some secret communications had already passed between Demosthenes and Cleon, which made the latter ready to undertake the expedition. It is at any rate clear that he did not take a leap in the dark, but had full information as to the state of things at Pylos.

The Athenians were deficient in light-armed troops, and after holding out for some time against an enemy who could not be brought to close quarters, but harassed them at every point, they finally took to flight. Many lost their way in a wood, and were destroyed by fire. The Athenians lost many of their allies, and 120 of their best heavy-armed men. It is not a little remarkable that Cleon (ch. 28) at once announced his intention to bring troops of the very kind which Demosthenes had lacked in Aetolia, and which had operated against him with fatal effect. This certainly suggests the probability of some understanding between the two commanders.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">au)tou=</lemma>&mdash;the invariable MSS reading. Professor Kennedy considers it to be the genitive, referring to <foreign lang="greek">to\n si=ton</foreign> and governed by <foreign lang="greek">e)la/ssosi</foreign>, and translates &lsquo;suspecting that <hi rend="ITALIC">he</hi> (Dem.) was sending in the corn for a smaller number <hi rend="ITALIC">than the corn itself</hi>&rsquo;, i.e. smaller than corresponded to the rations imported according to the terms of the armistice. It is true that in ch. 16, lines 9 and 13, the words <foreign lang="greek">e)kpe/mpein</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">e)spe/mpein</foreign> are used of <hi rend="ITALIC">the Lacedaemonians,</hi> which is an argument in favour of their being here also the subject of <foreign lang="greek">e)spe/mpein</foreign>. The Spartans however would not be allowed by Demosthenes to convey the corn into Sphacteria themselves, and so to have constant intercommunication with their men on the island. Whatever the particular arrangements were, the rations would be delivered by the agency of the Athenians, and therefore <foreign lang="greek">e)spe/mpein</foreign> is here used of Demosthenes, who actually &lsquo;sent in&rsquo; the corn.
</p>
<p>It has also been proposed to take <hi rend="BOLD"><foreign lang="greek">au)tou=</foreign></hi> with <hi rend="BOLD"><foreign lang="greek">e)spe/mpein</foreign></hi> as equivalent to <foreign lang="greek">au)to/se</foreign>, but this seems impossible, the occurrence of such words as <foreign lang="greek">e)ntau=qa</foreign> and <hi rend="BOLD"><foreign lang="greek">e)kei=</foreign></hi> with verbs of motion (e.g. <foreign lang="greek">i(/na per m(/rmhnto</foreign>, ch. 48, 31), being no warrant for such a use of <foreign lang="greek">au)tou=</foreign>, which as an adverb means &lsquo;on the spot&rsquo;.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek">au)to/se, au)toi=s, au)tou/s</lemma>, and <foreign lang="greek">au)tou\s pe/mpein</foreign> have been suggested as emendations. Of these <hi rend="BOLD"><foreign lang="greek">au)tou/s</foreign>,</hi> which is read by Classen, gives the best sense and supplies a subject to <foreign lang="greek">e)spe/mpein</foreign>: though it is open to the objection that its meaning must be gathered from the context, those who sent in the corn not being identical with <foreign lang="greek"><hi rend="BOLD">tou\s</hi> *lakedaimoni/ous</foreign>, line 9.

It has the advantage of avoiding grammatical difficulty, and greatly improving the sense. The fire disclosed the number of the enemy, and made landing easier. Demosthenes then saw the prospect of effecting a capture, which was in truth worth a struggle, and accordingly prepared for the attempt.
</p>
<p>It must however be noted that according to manuscript authority the clause <hi rend="BOLD"><foreign lang="greek">to/te...poiei=sqai</foreign></hi> follows <hi rend="BOLD"><foreign lang="greek">e)spe/mpein</foreign>.</hi> If this <pb n="173"/> order be retained, the inf. <foreign lang="greek">poiei=sqai</foreign> depends on <foreign lang="greek">u(ponow=n</foreign> or the sense of <hi rend="ITALIC">thinking</hi> implied therein and it is necessary to insert <foreign lang="greek">de/</foreign> after <foreign lang="greek">to/te</foreign> (Poppo). We thus get the meaning, &lsquo;thinking that the Athenians were now the more eager, as for a prize worthy of their efforts&rsquo;.

</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">yiloi\ kai\ oi( a)porw/tatoi</lemma>&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">a)/poros</foreign> is taken by nearly all commentators as meaning in this passage &lsquo;hard to deal with&rsquo;, of those against whom a <foreign lang="greek">po/ros</foreign> or &lsquo;means of acting&rsquo; can not be found. The sense then is &lsquo;light armed troops and those the most difficult to cope with&rsquo;. The words <foreign lang="greek">kai\ oi)</foreign> come in very awkwardly with <foreign lang="greek">a)porw/tatoi</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">kai/</foreign> is bracketed by Classen, who takes <foreign lang="greek">yiloi\ oi( a)porw/tatoi</foreign> as subst. before adj. like <foreign lang="greek">kindu/nou tou= taxi/stou</foreign>.
</p>
<p>Probably however <hi rend="BOLD"><foreign lang="greek">kai\ oi( a)porw/tatoi</foreign></hi> means &lsquo;even the worst provided&rsquo;, being in <hi rend="ITALIC">partial apposition</hi> with <foreign lang="greek">yiloi/</foreign> and closely connected with <foreign lang="greek">e)/xontes a)lkh/n</foreign>. This view avoids any difficulty as to the construction of <foreign lang="greek">kai\ oi(</foreign>, and gives the excellent sense that <hi rend="ITALIC">even the least efficient</hi> combatants proved in the circumstances very effective foes.
</p>
<p>It is to be noticed that adjectives which, like <foreign lang="greek">a)/poros</foreign>, admit of both an active and a passive meaning, have usually an active sense when used of persons, and a passive sense when <pb n="177"/> used of things: e.g. <bibl n="Soph.

Ant. 90">90</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">a)mhxa/nwn e)ra=s</foreign>, &lsquo;you are enamoured of what can not <hi rend="ITALIC">be done</hi>&rsquo;. So <foreign lang="greek">a)/poros</foreign> of persons would naturally be &lsquo;without means&rsquo;, as <bibl n="Thuc. 1. 9">i. 9</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">h)=lqen e)s a)nqrw/pous a)po/rous</foreign>: <bibl n="Soph. Ant. 360">Soph. Ant. 360</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">a)/poros e)p' ou)de\n e)/rxetai</foreign>. It is however certainly used sometimes of persons in the passive sense, e.g. <bibl n="Plat.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">dieskeua/zonto</lemma>&mdash;this verb is only found here in Thucydides, who elsewhere prefers <foreign lang="greek">paraskeua/zomai</foreign>.

Plutarch (<hi rend="ITALIC">Nic.</hi> ch. 7) says that the Athenians were wont to indulge Cleon's <foreign lang="greek">koufo/ths</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">mani/a</foreign>.

</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)/qento ta\ o(/pla</lemma>&mdash;&lsquo;halted&rsquo;, or &lsquo;took up their position&rsquo;. The literal meaning of the phrase <foreign lang="greek">ti/qesqai ta\ o)/pla</foreign> is to ground, or put down one's arms, the Greeks being accustomed to lay down their shields and spears when they halted for any time, for instance to listen to an address from their commanders. The converse expression is <foreign lang="greek">a)nalamba/nein ta\ o(/pla</foreign> (ch. 130, 19: <bibl n="Hdt. 6. 78">Hdt. vi. 78</bibl>: <bibl n="Xen. Hell. 2.4.19">Xen. Hel. ii. 4, 19</bibl>, etc.). From the idea of taking up a position thus implied, the phrase <foreign lang="greek">ti/qesqai ta\ o(/pla</foreign> is often used, as in the present passage, when the idea of actually putting down the arms would be out of place. Thus the Thebans, after making their way by surprise into Plataeae, established themselves in the public place (<foreign lang="greek">qe/menoi e/s th\n a)gora\n ta\ o(/pla</foreign>), and made proclamation for any one who chose  <foreign lang="greek">ti/qesqai par' au(tou\s ta\ o)/pla</foreign> i.e. to <hi rend="ITALIC">join them</hi> (<bibl n="Thuc. 2. 2">ii. 2</bibl>). So <foreign lang="greek">ta\ o(/pla</foreign> is used for the camp or position occupied by troops <bibl n="Thuc. 1. 111">i. 111</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 3. 1">iii. 1</bibl>. Such phrases are especially common in the military language of Xenophon; see Shilleto on <bibl n="Thuc. 2. 2">ii. 2</bibl>.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">oi( plei=stoi...a)pe/qanon</lemma>&mdash;i.e. their chief loss was at this point. <foreign lang="greek">oi( plei=stoi</foreign> must mean the greater part of <hi rend="ITALIC">those who fell,</hi> not of their whole force, for we see afterwards that their total loss only amounted to 212: so <bibl n="Thuc. 7. 30">vii. 30</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">a)poktei/nousin au(tw=n e/n th=| e)kba/sei tou\s plei/stous</foreign>, where the total loss was 250 out of 1300. Classen takes the meaning to be that the greater part of the Corinthians on the right wing were slain, their allies escaping better.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)pikhrukeusa/menoi...a)nei/lonto</lemma>&mdash;asking leave to remove the dead was an admission of defeat, which is also implied by the use of <foreign lang="greek">e)pikhrukeu/esqai</foreign>. Thus Plutarch (<hi rend="ITALIC">Nic.</hi> ch. 6) says that Nicias preferred to sacrifice his victory and his glory rather than leave two Athenian citizens unburied.

</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)kribh=</lemma>&mdash;the strict force of this word is &lsquo;exact, complete in its details&rsquo;.

Buttmann considered that <foreign lang="greek">ei)/rgw</foreign> meant to shut out, <foreign lang="greek">ei)/rgw</foreign> to shut in.

The Athenians on attaining eighteen years of age were enrolled among the <foreign lang="greek">e)/fhboi</foreign>, and after some preliminary training, served till the age of twenty in the <foreign lang="greek">peri/poloi</foreign> or national guard. It seems probable that their first term of service was in Athens itself, while during the second year they formed a moveable force, employed in garrisoning fortified places in Attica, and in the defence of any point which might be threatened. They were armed with the hoplite's spear and shield. On the present occasion they seem to have been employed on service beyond the frontier of Attica, or to have been stationed at Minoa.

</p>
<p>Poppo retains <foreign lang="greek">prosela/santes</foreign>, which he considers may mean that the Athenians <hi rend="ITALIC">retired on</hi> Nisaea, so as to draw the enemy in that direction.

This construction is not elsewhere found with <foreign lang="greek">bla/ptw</foreign>, with which &lsquo;poetae, cum in vim <hi rend="ITALIC">privandi</hi> transeat, genitivo utuntur&rsquo; (Poppo); but it may be defended on the analogy of such passages as <bibl n="Thuc. 2. 65">ii. 65</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">sfale/ntes...paraskeuh=|</foreign>: <bibl n="Thuc. 6. 10">vi. 10</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">sfale/ntwn a)cio/xrew| duna/mei</foreign>: <hi rend="ITALIC">ib.</hi> <foreign lang="greek">metew/rw| po/lei kinduneu/ein</foreign>.

This is Poppo's translation, and it gives a fairly satisfactory sense. The Peloponnesian army was composed of contingents from different states: each contingent was only a portion of the whole available military force (<foreign lang="greek">cumpa/shs th=s duna/mews</foreign>) and of the army now under Brasidas (<foreign lang="greek">tw=n paro/ntwn</foreign>). Therefore a defeat would not cripple the Peloponnesian confederacy as a whole, while the several contingents might be willing to risk a battle with the chance of their neighbours suffering more than themselves. On the other hand any loss sustained by the Athenians would fall on the flower of their national troops.

<p>It has been proposed to take <foreign lang="greek">me/ros</foreign> as the object of <foreign lang="greek">kinduneu/ein</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">e(/kaston</foreign> as masc., &lsquo;each (commander) was naturally willing to hazard a portion&rsquo;, etc. But this use of <foreign lang="greek">kinduneu/ein</foreign> is doubtful, being only supported by such phrases as <bibl n="Thuc. 6. 57">vi. 57</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">pa/nta e)kindu/neuon</foreign>, and the improvement in sense is not great.

<p>For <hi rend="BOLD"><foreign lang="greek">kai\ tw=n paro/ntwn</foreign></hi> Donaldson adopts the conjecture <foreign lang="greek">o)li/gwn paro/ntwn</foreign> gen. abs., which gives a good sense and construction, but does not seem necessary.

We have then to supply a subject to <foreign lang="greek">e)qe/lein</foreign> from the general sense, sc. the enemy, or else <foreign lang="greek">toi=s de/</foreign> must be changed into <foreign lang="greek">tou\s de/</foreign>.

</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)pei/</lemma>&mdash;often thus used in elliptical expressions, where the context supplies the meaning; here the sense is &lsquo;it is plain that they always dreaded the Helots, <hi rend="ITALIC">for</hi>&rsquo;, etc.; cf. a similar use in ch. 78, 19, <foreign lang="greek">e)pei\ kai\ to/te</foreign>.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">to/de e)/pracan</lemma>&mdash;probably &lsquo;they once did, or had done&rsquo; at some time not stated, so Thirlwall. &lsquo;That this atrocity should have been committed at the very time when the Spartans were sending out a body of Helots on a foreign expedition is improbable in itself, and is contradicted by the words <hi rend="BOLD"><foreign lang="greek">kai\ to/te k.t.l.</foreign></hi> (line 22), which clearly imply that Thucydides is led by association to speak of what had occurred on some former occasion. Shortly after the expedition of Brasidas the Spartans changed their policy towards the Helots, and emancipated those of them who had served with him, <bibl n="Thuc. 5. 34">v. 34</bibl>. They had previously given promises of emancipation which were believed, and therefore probably fulfilled, to Helots conveying food into Sphacteria, ch. 26&rsquo; (Jowett). Grote however (vol. iv. ch. 53) considers that the massacre took place immediately after the capture of Sphacteria, which was in July or August of the previous year, and that there was an interval of several months before the government formed the idea of employing the Helots on foreign service, an interval &lsquo;quite sufficient to give a full and distinct meaning to the expression <foreign lang="greek">kai\ to/te</foreign>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">neo/thta</lemma>&mdash;either abstract, &lsquo;their youth (and vigour)&rsquo;, as in <bibl n="Thuc. 6. 17">vi. 17</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">h( e)mh\ neo/ths</foreign>: <hi rend="ITALIC">ib.</hi> 18, contrasted with <foreign lang="greek">gh=ras</foreign>: or with a concrete meaning (<hi rend="ITALIC">iuventus=iuvenes</hi>), as in <bibl n="Thuc. 2. 8">ii. 8</bibl>, <hi rend="BOLD"><foreign lang="greek">pollh\ neo/ths</foreign></hi>: so <bibl n="Thuc. 2. 21">ii. 21</bibl>.

</p>
<p>Instead of <hi rend="BOLD"><foreign lang="greek">neo/thta</foreign></hi> some manuscripts have <hi rend="BOLD"><foreign lang="greek">skaio/thta</foreign>,</hi> which is adopted among other editors by Classen. He understands it to mean the rash stupidity and wrong-headedness (<hi rend="ITALIC">stoliditas, importunitas</hi>), which would make bondsmen rise in <pb n="239"/> insurrection, even with little prospect of success: cf. <bibl n="Soph.

</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)ei\ ga/r</lemma>&mdash;the predicate of this sentence is <hi rend="BOLD"><foreign lang="greek">th=s fulakh=s pe/ri</foreign>,</hi> the sense being that &lsquo;most of the relations between the Lacedaemonians and the Helots always were of an eminently precautionary character&rsquo;: not that &lsquo;most of the Lacedaemonian institutions were intended mainly to guard against the Helots&rsquo;. This latter statement, besides not being true, would require a different wording: <hi rend="BOLD">cf.</hi> Shilleto on <bibl n="Thuc. 1. 17">i. 17</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">pro\s perioi/kous toi=s au(tw=n e(ka/stois</foreign>, &lsquo;between each state and its neighbours&rsquo;: so <bibl n="Thuc. 1. 127">i. 127</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">diabolh\n au)tw=| pro\s th\n po/lin</foreign>, &lsquo;prejudice between him and the city&rsquo;: cf. ch. 54, 14.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kai\ prokri/nantes...oi( me\n...oi( de/</lemma>&mdash;there is no difficulty in understanding this sentence; and an exact parallel to it occurs in <bibl n="Thuc. 3. 34">iii. 34</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">o( de\</foreign> (Paches) <foreign lang="greek">prokalesa/menos e)s lo/gous *(ippi/an...o( me\n</foreign> (Hippias) <foreign lang="greek">e)ch=lqe par/ au)to/n, <hi rend="BOLD">o( de\</hi></foreign> (Paches) <hi rend="BOLD"><foreign lang="greek">e)kei=non e)n</foreign></hi> <pb n="240"/> <foreign lang="greek">fulakh=| ei=xen</foreign>.

Thus in the passage before us the sense is &lsquo;they chose out some 2000 Helots, and <hi rend="ITALIC">while they</hi> decked themselves with garlands on the strength of being set free, the Lacedaemonians etc.&rsquo; This is an extension of the ordinary idiom of expressing the <hi rend="ITALIC">contrast between</hi> two things by coordinate clauses with <foreign lang="greek">me)n</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">de/</foreign>, the clause with <foreign lang="greek">me/n</foreign> being in sense subordinate to that with <foreign lang="greek">de/</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">e)gw\ me\n...su\ de/</foreign>, &lsquo;<hi rend="ITALIC">although</hi> I ...yet you&rsquo;, etc.); see Madv. &sect; 189.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ou)dei\s h)/|sqeto</lemma>&mdash;Diodorus (1st cent.

A stratagem at once so perfidious in the contrivance, so murderous in the purpose, and so complete in the execution, stands without parallel in Greek history&mdash;we might almost say without a parallel in any history. The Ephors must have employed numerous instruments, apart from each other, for the performance of this bloody deed. Yet it appears that no certain knowledge could be obtained of the details&mdash;a striking proof of the mysterious efficiency of this Council of Five, surpassing even that of the Council of Ten at Venice&mdash;as well as of the utter absence of public inquiry or discussion&rsquo; (Grote iv. ch. 53).</p>

</p>
<p>Both (<hi rend="ITALIC">a</hi>) and (<hi rend="ITALIC">b</hi>) come under a general head, the comparison of a particular statement with a general one introduced by <foreign lang="greek">w(s</foreign> or <hi rend="ITALIC">ut.</hi> In most instances the context shows to which division a passage should be assigned, but there is at times a doubt: thus <bibl n="Soph.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ferome/nois</lemma>&mdash;Classen and Poppo explain the position of the partcp. in accordance with the principle noted on ch. 5, 10. Surely however the words <foreign lang="greek">ferome/nois par' *)aqhnai/ous</foreign> have a most forcible predicative sense; &lsquo;that the Lacedaemonians may not be injured by <hi rend="ITALIC">Athens receiving</hi> your revenues&rsquo;, lit. &lsquo;by your revenues being paid to the Athenians&rsquo;: cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 3. 20">iii. 20</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">tw=| si/tw| e)pilipo/nti e/pie/zonto</foreign>, they suffered from failure of the corn. <hi rend="BOLD"><foreign lang="greek">fe/rw</foreign></hi> is the regular word for payment of tribute to a ruling state.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ou) ga\r dh\ ei)ko/tws</lemma>&mdash;Arnold has an excellent note on the connexion of thought in this passage. Brasidas urges that his second motive&mdash;the deliverance of Greece&mdash;is what actuates him most of all. And it is this, and no selfish ambition of Sparta, which justifies him in refusing to tolerate the neutrality of Acanthus.
</p>
<p>The natural meaning of <hi rend="BOLD"><foreign lang="greek">ta/de</foreign></hi> is &lsquo;what we are now doing&rsquo;: Classen therefore follows Dobree in writing <foreign lang="greek">e)pra/ssomen</foreign> for <hi rend="BOLD"><foreign lang="greek">pra/ssoimen</foreign>,</hi> giving the sense &lsquo;otherwise we should not <hi rend="ITALIC">be now</hi> acting with good reason&rsquo; (but we are). This would be an instance of unfulfilled condition, see Goodwin, &sect; 49. 2.
</p>
<p>The optative however presents no difficulty if we give <foreign lang="greek">ta/de</foreign> a more general sense, sc. &lsquo;our coercion of neutrals (in any supposed case) would not be right&rsquo;: this agrees with the general character (<foreign lang="greek">tou\s mh\ boulome/nous</foreign>) of the rest of the sentence, and is better than to take <foreign lang="greek">tade</foreign> as=<foreign lang="greek">to dh|ou=n th)n gh=n</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">to\ e)a=n kwlu/esqai tou\s *)/ellhnas k.t.l.</foreign>

<p>Grote points out (vol. iv. ch. 53) that it is clear that the Acanthians had no great reason to complain of the rule of Athens. They did not welcome Brasidas as a deliverer, but only joined him under compulsion. So in the other towns of Thrace, while a party was in favour of Sparta, the main bulk of the people seem to have been well satisfied to be subject allies of Athens. It follows that the empire of the Athenians could not have been so harsh and burdensome as it was often represented.</p>
<p>With regard to the surrender of Acanthus, Grote remarks that &lsquo;Grecian political reason and morality&rsquo; appear to unusual advantage in the free discussion, the care to protect individual independence of judgment, and the established respect to the vote of the majority, which the citizens observed. It would be more difficult to praise the reason and morality of the decision itself, which is rather an instance of the political untrustworthiness of a democracy, and its readiness to adopt any change however momentous. The Acanthians revolted from Athens, not because they were dissatisfied or oppressed, but &lsquo;because Brasidas said what was attractive, and from fear for their fruit&rsquo;.</p> <pb n="252"/>

That the vines were used in building the wall appears from ch. 100, 16, and their use appears to have been to form a sort of wattling to keep the earth together; as at Plataeae the clay for the besiegers' mound was rammed into flat cases or frames of reeds (<foreign lang="greek">e)n tarsoi=s kala/mou e)nei/llontes</foreign>), and as the earth was enclosed besides in a wooden frame, <foreign lang="greek">o(/pws mh\ diaxe/oito e)pi\ polu\ to\ xw=ma</foreign>, <bibl n="Thuc. 2. 75">ii. 75</bibl>, 76&rsquo; (Arnold).

The original idea of the sentence seems to have been &lsquo;the Boeotians thought that the dead were really lying on Athenian ground, but that still they might plausibly refuse to let the Athenians remove them till they evacuated Delium&rsquo;.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kata\ to\ u(ph/koon</lemma>&mdash;&lsquo;as being subject to them&rsquo;: <bibl n="Thuc. 1. 95">i. 95</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">kata\ to\ cuggene/s. kai\ ou)k a)/n</foreign>&mdash;&lsquo;and (yet) they could not&rsquo;: <foreign lang="greek">kai/</foreign> has a somewhat similar adversative force in <bibl n="Thuc. 2. 90">ii. 90</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">a)/kwn kai\ kata\ spoudh/n</foreign>: <hi rend="ITALIC">et</hi> is at times similarly used, especially in late Latin.

</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">to\ de/</lemma>&mdash;&lsquo;but (considering) that the reply, Let them evacuate our land and then take back what they ask for, was a plausible answer to give&rsquo;. &lsquo;They considered it a fair diplomatic way of meeting the alternative raised by the Athenian herald&rsquo; (Grote). The substantive of <foreign lang="greek">to/</foreign> is formed by the quoted words. The harsh break in the citation is intended to emphasize the phrase <hi rend="BOLD"><foreign lang="greek">e)k th=s e(autw=n</foreign></hi> as the main point in the answer, to which the term <foreign lang="greek">eu)prepe/s</foreign> especially belongs. We have a somewhat similar order in the concluding sentence of ch. 98.
</p>
<p>The Boeotian answer was in fact a second demand for the evacuation of Delium couched in different terms. Comparing line 3 with ch. 97 line 21 we see that <foreign lang="greek">e)k th=s e(autw=n</foreign> is simply substituted for <foreign lang="greek">e)k tou= i(erou=</foreign>. Originally they had called on the Athenians to leave the temple which they profaned; now they bid them leave the territory of Boeotia. The demand seems at first to refer to the district of Oropus, where the dead were lying; but no Athenians were left there (ch. 96 fin.) nor could there be any reason for the Athenians insisting on its occupation. Delium, on the other hand, they claimed to be their own by right of conquest; and the Boeotians, who held <pb n="265"/> Oropia, turn against them their own unlucky argument of <hi rend="ITALIC">de facto</hi> possession. Greek feeling, as Grote points out, was violated by the Boeotians in thus refusing to restore the dead, nor is it likely that they could have persisted in their refusal. On the other hand they might reasonably complain of the occupation of a temple as an advanced hostile post; which was a very different thing from conquering a country and taking over the temples as well.

	<head>CHAPTER CVIII</head>
		<p>This important chapter, a typical example of the writer's style, deals with the political situation after the capture of Amphipolis.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kai\ o)/ti...gegenh=sqai</lemma>&mdash;the cause of Athenian alarm was that the capture of Amphipolis <hi rend="ITALIC">had removed</hi> the obstacles which had hitherto prevented the advance of the Spartans beyond the Strymon. This is stated in the final clause, <foreign lang="greek"><hi rend="BOLD">to/te de/,</hi> k.t.l.</foreign>, the preceding part of the sentence being subordinate in sense though co-ordinate in form: cf. note on ch. 80, 18.
</p>
<p>It is to be noticed that there are two clauses with <foreign lang="greek">de), <hi rend="BOLD">th=s de\ gefu/ras</hi></foreign> line 7, and <hi rend="BOLD"><foreign lang="greek">to/te de/</foreign></hi> line 10. The sense is equivalent to <foreign lang="greek">pro/teron me/n</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">me/xri me/n...th=s de/</foreign>)<foreign lang="greek"><hi rend="BOLD">...to/te</hi> de/</foreign>. The repeated <foreign lang="greek">me/n</foreign> would however have been stiff and clumsy and is therefore avoided. For other instances of <foreign lang="greek">me/n</foreign> followed by <foreign lang="greek">de/...de/</foreign>, see Shilleto on <bibl n="Thuc. 1. 142">i. 142</bibl>.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">me/xri me\n...proselqei=n</lemma>&mdash;these words refer to the state of things before Amphipolis was taken. In themselves they are a good illustration of co-ordinate construction with <hi rend="BOLD"><foreign lang="greek">me/n</foreign></hi> and <hi rend="BOLD"><foreign lang="greek">de/</foreign>:</hi> <pb n="273"/> &lsquo;<hi rend="ITALIC">though</hi> (hitherto) the Lacedaemonians might have got as far as the Strymon, yet they could have advanced no further without the command of the bridge&rsquo;.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">mh\ kratou/ntwn</lemma>&mdash;&lsquo;but if they were not masters of the bridge, seeing that above the town the river formed a great lake, while on the side toward Eion they were watched by the enemy's triremes, they could not have pushed their advance&rsquo;. The gen. abs. <hi rend="BOLD"><foreign lang="greek">kratou/ntwn</foreign></hi> and <hi rend="BOLD"><foreign lang="greek">throume/nwn</foreign></hi> refer to the Lacedaemonians, and supply the subject to <foreign lang="greek">du/nasqai. <hi rend="BOLD">proselqei=n</hi></foreign>&mdash;the reading of the best manuscripts, &lsquo;to get at&rsquo; the city or the allies. Most editors have <foreign lang="greek">proelqei=n</foreign>, &lsquo;to advance&rsquo;. The words are perpetually confused.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)pi\ polu/</lemma>&mdash;&lsquo;extending far&rsquo;. <hi rend="BOLD"><foreign lang="greek">tou= potamou=</foreign></hi>&mdash;formed by the river.

</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ou)k a)\n du/nasqai</lemma>&mdash;the original construction with <foreign lang="greek">o(/ti</foreign> is now lost sight of, the inf. depending on the idea which is implied of what the Athenians said or thought.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">to/te de/</lemma>&mdash;now that Amphipolis was lost. The reading <hi rend="BOLD"><foreign lang="greek">r(a/|dia</foreign></hi> is undoubtedly to be preferred to <foreign lang="greek">r(a|di/a</foreign> (sc. <foreign lang="greek">h( pa/rodos</foreign>), for the <foreign lang="greek">pa/rodos</foreign> had been open all along.

</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a(\ pare/xetai</lemma>&mdash;&lsquo;the terms (or advantages) which (Brasidas) offers&rsquo;: see note on ch. 64, 1. There is some awkwardness in making Brasidas the subject of <foreign lang="greek">pare/xetai</foreign>, which however is lessened by the fact that <foreign lang="greek">a)/lwsin</foreign> is an <hi rend="ITALIC">active</hi> word = &lsquo;his taking&rsquo;.

The meaning is that they grossly underrated the power which Athens proved to possess; but this is expressed in a confused way, <hi rend="BOLD"><foreign lang="greek">o(/sh</foreign></hi> being written (instead of <foreign lang="greek">o(/son mei/zwn h)\ w)/|onto</foreign> or the like) as if <foreign lang="greek">ou) tosau/thn nomi/zousi</foreign> had gone before. <hi rend="BOLD"><foreign lang="greek">diefa/nh</foreign></hi>&mdash;&lsquo;proved on trial&rsquo;; <bibl n="Thuc. 1. 18">i. 18</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">tau=ta me/gista diefa/nh</foreign>: <bibl n="Thuc. 6. 17">vi. 17</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">diefa/nhsan tosou=toi o)/ntes</foreign>. <pb n="274"/>

</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ei)wqo/tes oi( a)/nqrwpoi</lemma>&mdash;&lsquo;men being accustomed&rsquo;; lit. &lsquo;being accustomed, that is to say, men (being accustomed)&rsquo;: the subject of the sentence, viz. the Athenian allies, is by <hi rend="ITALIC">expanded apposition</hi> extended to human beings in general.

</p>

In Ar. <hi rend="ITALIC">Vesp.</hi> 268 <foreign lang="greek">e)folko/s</foreign> has the middle or passive sense of &lsquo;lagging behind&rsquo;.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">w(s au)tw=|...cumbalei=n</lemma>&mdash;this sentence corresponds closely to the words of Brasidas in his speech at Acanthus, ch. 85, fin. The construction however is not so clear, and seems to require the addition of <foreign lang="greek">bohqh/santi</foreign>. As the sentence stands, <foreign lang="greek">au)tw=|</foreign> is governed directly by <foreign lang="greek">cumbalei=n</foreign>, and <hi rend="BOLD"><foreign lang="greek">e)pi\ *ni/saian</foreign></hi> might be connected with <foreign lang="greek">h)qe/lhsan cumbalei=n</foreign> in the sense of attacking or approaching Nisaea. There is however the objection that it was <hi rend="ITALIC">Brasidas,</hi> not the Athenians, who approached Nisaea (ch. 69&mdash; 73); and though this difficulty would be removed by adopting the correction <foreign lang="greek">e)pi\ *nisai/a|</foreign>, the words <foreign lang="greek">th=|...stratia=|</foreign>, dat. of &lsquo;the force which&rsquo; Brasidas had with him, stand most awkwardly without a participle.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)pi\ sfa=s bohqh=sai</lemma>&mdash;sc. to reduce them to obedience; cf. ch. 25, 35.

The use of neuter participles to express abstract ideas is characteristic of Thucydides: see the instances cited by commentators on <bibl n="Thuc. 1. 36">i. 36</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">to\ me\n dedio\s...to\ de\ qarsou=n. <hi rend="BOLD">to\ prw=ton</hi></foreign>&mdash;  <pb n="275"/> &lsquo;for the first time&rsquo;.

The comparative is to be explained as noted on ch. 17, 17: it &lsquo;means the period of several years, generally stipulated in a treaty of peace, as opposed to the brief interval of a mere truce&rsquo; (Arnold).
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">tou\s ga\r dh\ a)/ndras...krath/sein</lemma>&mdash;in the following notes it is at first assumed that this sentence is descriptive of the actual feelings of the Lacedaemonians: a different view is noticed afterwards.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">peri\ plei/onos</lemma>&mdash;if the reading <hi rend="BOLD"><foreign lang="greek">w(s e)/ti</foreign></hi> is right, the meaning seems to be, &lsquo;they were more anxious to recover their men, as (because) Brasidas was still successful&rsquo;, i.e. they now saw a chance of concluding negotiations with Athens, and this increased their anxiety to get the men back. So we read in <bibl n="Thuc. 5. 16">v. 16</bibl>, that the party desirous of peace &lsquo;became much more eager&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">pollw=| dh\ ma=llon proequmou=nto</foreign>), when they saw a prospect of it. This view agrees with what is said in <bibl n="Thuc. 5. 15">v. 15</bibl>, that the Spartans increased their efforts to obtain terms, as soon as the Athenians had been defeated at Delium.
</p>
<p>Some editors regard <foreign lang="greek">w(s e)/ti</foreign> as equivalent to <hi rend="ITALIC">dum,</hi> a very questionable interpretation, cf. ch. 76, 6: others read <foreign lang="greek">e(/ws</foreign>, in accordance with the scholiast on <bibl n="Aristoph. Peace 475">Ar. Pax, 475</bibl>, where the passage is cited with <foreign lang="greek">e(/ws o(/te</foreign>. In either case <foreign lang="greek">peri\ plei/ouos</foreign> is explained by what follows, the sense being that the Lacedaemonians attached greater importance to the immediate recovery of the captives while Brasidas was still successful, than to the possibility of future conquests with the risk of losing their men; cf. ch. 108, 42, <foreign lang="greek">ta\ de\ kai\ boulo/menoi ma=llon k.t.l.</foreign> For the phrase <foreign lang="greek">peri\ plei/onos poiei=sqai</foreign>, &lsquo;to esteem of greater value&rsquo;, cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 2. 89">ii. 89</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">peri\ plei/stou h(gei=sqe</foreign>: <bibl n="Hdt. 1. 73">Hdt. i. 73</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">peri\ pollou= poieo/menos au(tou/s</foreign>.

</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)pi\ mei=zon</lemma>&mdash;cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 1. 17">i. 17</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">e)pi\ plei=ston e)xw/rhsan duna/mews</foreign>:  <bibl n="Thuc. 1. 118">i. 118</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">e)pi\ me/ga e)xw/rhsan duna/mews. <hi rend="BOLD">a)nti/pala katasth/santos</hi></foreign>&mdash;lit. &lsquo;if he made things equally balanced&rsquo;: cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 7. 13">vii. 13</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">e)peidh\ e)s a)nti/pala kaqesth/kamen</foreign>: neut. plur. as in ch. 108. It would seem that the Lacedaemonians did not consider that Brasidas was yet on terms of equality with the enemy in Thrace notwithstanding his great successes. Possibly they did not appreciate the importance of his conquests; at any rate we have already seen that their leading men were not desirous of forwarding his enterprise (ch. 108 fin.). Grote supposes the words to mean &lsquo;if he should put himself and his newly-acquired gains in battle-front against the enemy&rsquo;, i.e. if he should risk losing his conquests by attempting more: but though the sense may be good it is not to be found in the Greek. Moreover, though any further success on the part of Brasidas would put the Spartans in a better position to dictate terms in general, it would certainly interfere with the <hi rend="ITALIC">immediate</hi> recovery of the captives, which was the thing they now had most at heart.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">tw=n me\n ste/resqai</lemma>&mdash;either &lsquo;to remain deprived of them&rsquo; for an indefinite time (Jowett); or &lsquo;to be deprived of them&rsquo; by their being put to death. The Athenians had determined to kill the captives in case of any invasion of Attica (ch. 41, 5); and there was therefore reason to fear that they might kill them in exasperation at their losses in Thrace.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">toi=s de/</lemma>&mdash;either (1) to be taken as instrumental dative with <hi rend="BOLD"><foreign lang="greek">a)muno/menoi</foreign>,</hi> &lsquo;defending themselves, keeping up the struggle, with the others&rsquo;, i.e. with the rest of their forces as opposed to the captives: so <bibl n="Thuc. 1. 69">i. 69</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">th=| duna/mei a)muno/menoi</foreign>: <bibl n="Thuc. 6. 82">vi. 82</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">du/namin h)=| a)munou/meqa</foreign>: or (2) &lsquo;as for the Athenians&rsquo;, i.e. in the contest against them; an ethical dative like ch. 10, 13, <foreign lang="greek">u(poxwrh/sasi</foreign>: ch. 56, 1, <foreign lang="greek">toi=s *)aqhnai/ois</foreign>: ch. 73, 27, <foreign lang="greek">toi=s de/</foreign>. In (1) two parts of the Spartan forces are contrasted with <foreign lang="greek">me/n</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">de/</foreign>: while (2) contrasts their captured friends with their enemies.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kinduneu/ein kai\ krath/sein</lemma>&mdash;As these words stand they must mean &lsquo;to have a chance of future victory&rsquo;; lit. &lsquo;to be likely also to prove victorious&rsquo;. This force of <foreign lang="greek">kinduneu/w</foreign> however, which is common in Plato and Xenophon, is not found elsewhere in Thucydides, except perhaps in <bibl n="Thuc. 6. 87">vi. 87</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">mh\ a)deei=s ei)=nai kinduneu/ein</foreign>. In other passages the meaning with the inf. is &lsquo;to be in danger of&rsquo;, e.g. <bibl n="Thuc. 7. 40">vii. 40</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">tou= <hi rend="BOLD">panto\s</hi> kinduneu=sai diafqarh=nai</foreign>. The rendering &lsquo;to be in danger <hi rend="ITALIC">of losing</hi> final victory&rsquo; is good in sense, but does not lie in the words. <hi rend="BOLD"><foreign lang="greek">kai/</foreign></hi> &lsquo;also&rsquo; emphasizes <foreign lang="greek">krath/sein</foreign>,=actually, eventually. For the future cf. ch. 126, 34, <foreign lang="greek">e)kfobh(sein</foreign>.
</p>
<p>It will be seen that it is possible to give a fairly satisfactory sense to the words as they stand in the text. There is however <pb n="285"/> a difficulty in the final clauses <foreign lang="greek">tw=n me\n...toi=s de/</foreign>. The sense required is clearly, &lsquo;though they might be finally victorious, they were certain to lose their men&rsquo;. We should therefore expect <foreign lang="greek">toi=s me\n...krath/sein tw=n de\ ste/resqai</foreign>, the clause with <foreign lang="greek">me/n</foreign> being subordinate in sense to that with <foreign lang="greek">de/</foreign>. Here however the order is reversed. Jowett compares <bibl n="Thuc. 2. 42">ii. 42</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">tou\s me\n timwrei=sqai tw=n d' e/fi/esqai</foreign>. &lsquo;The emphasis&rsquo;, he says, &lsquo;is on <foreign lang="greek">tw=n me\n ste/resqai</foreign>: the antithetical form has got the better of the logical point of the sentence&rsquo;. In ch. 121, 19 we have a somewhat similar inversion.
</p>
<p>To obviate the difficulty arising from the order of <foreign lang="greek">me/n</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">de/</foreign>, as well as from the doubtful meaning which the text obliges us to attach to <foreign lang="greek">kinduneu/ein</foreign>, it has been proposed to read <foreign lang="greek">mh\ krath/sein</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">krath/sesqai</foreign> (passive) instead of <foreign lang="greek">krath/sein</foreign>. We thus get the sense &lsquo;they were sure to lose their men, and would be in danger of final defeat besides&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>It remains to notice the view of the whole passage which was suggested by Herbst, and is adopted by Classen. It is that Thucydides is giving in his own words the ideas, not of the Lacedaemonians, but of the Athenians; in fact explaining the words <foreign lang="greek">a)/per e)/deisan</foreign> in line 8. The <hi rend="ITALIC">Athenians thought</hi> that the Lacedaemonians were now likely to offer acceptable terms, and they were not unwilling to listen to their offers; for if Brasidas pursued his victorious career, the opportunity would be lost, and the chance was that the Lacedaemonians, though they lost their captives, might prove victorious in the end.
</p>
<p>Herbst and Classen attach particular force to <foreign lang="greek">w(s e)/ti *brasi/das eu)tu/xei</foreign>, to which they give the meaning &lsquo;with his present limit of success&rsquo;, i.e. before his conquests gave the Spartans an overwhelming advantage. At present they valued the recovery of the men more highly (<foreign lang="greek">peri\ plei)onos</foreign>) than might be the case hereafter, when they could insist on terms.

		<p>Terms of the truce for one year. It appears to have been drawn up and agreed to at Sparta, and then sent to Athens for ratification there: see Arnold's note. The main provisions of the treaty concern (1) the temple at Delphi: (2) the retaining by both sides of possessions and conquests: (3) rights at sea: (4) arrangements for further negotiation, arbitration, etc.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">peri\ me\n tou= i(erou=</lemma>&mdash;&lsquo;a concession to Athens, as the Delphians were always so strongly attached to Lacedaemon, that the Athenians would find it difficult during the war to have access to the temple at all&rsquo; (Arnold). <pb n="286"/>
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">dokei= h(mi=n</lemma>&mdash;i.e. this is what we are ready to agree to, and offer for your acceptance.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">xrh=sqai</lemma>&mdash;so <bibl n="Thuc. 1. 126">i. 126</bibl>, without case, <foreign lang="greek">xrwme/nw| e)n *delfoi=s</foreign>, &lsquo;consulting the oracle&rsquo;: here the word contains also the idea of access in general.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)s du/namin</lemma>&mdash;so <bibl n="Thuc. 8. 27">viii. 27</bibl>, in a negative sentence.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">peri\ de\ tw=n xrhma/twn</lemma>&mdash;editors agree that this is a general provision, not referring to any particular misuse of the sacred treasures that had lately taken place. In 432 we find the Corinthian envoys proposing to borrow the money at Delphi and Olympia for war purposes (<bibl n="Thuc. 1. 121">i. 121</bibl>); and this article may be directed against such appropriation, though if so it is very vaguely expressed.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">peri\ me\n ou)=n tou/twn</lemma>&mdash;these words plainly refer to what has gone before, while <hi rend="BOLD"><foreign lang="greek">ta/de</foreign></hi> refers to what follows. The reading in the text is that which is approved by Poppo and adopted by Arnold and Classen. In the great majority of manuscripts the words <hi rend="BOLD"><foreign lang="greek">e)a\n sponda/s k.t.l.</foreign></hi> follow immediately after <foreign lang="greek">cumma/xois</foreign> in line 13, a whole line being omitted, as might easily happen from the recurrence of the same form of words. It has indeed been proposed to take the manuscript reading thus: &lsquo;this is agreed to by the Lacedaemonians, on condition that the Athenians stipulate (<foreign lang="greek">e)a\n sponda\s poiw=ntai k.t.l.</foreign>) that each side remain in possession etc.&rsquo; But it is much more likely that the several articles of the treaty should follow separately, dependent on <foreign lang="greek">e)/doce</foreign> expressed or implied.

The subject of <hi rend="BOLD"><foreign lang="greek">cune/qento</foreign></hi> is apparently the people of Troezen, and we must suppose that they had made some arrangement with the Athenian garrison. Arnold originally considered that <foreign lang="greek">e(kate/rous e)/xein</foreign> should be understood after <foreign lang="greek">ta\ e)n *troizh=ni</foreign>, and that <foreign lang="greek">oi(=a cune/qento</foreign> refers to the Lacedaemonians, and denotes the terms of the thirty years peace of 445, by which they recovered possession of Troezen (<bibl n="Thuc. 1. 115">i. 115</bibl>). The meaning would then be that the Athenians should keep the peninsula of Methone, and the Peloponnesians the rest of the district.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">th=| qala/ssh| xrwme/nous</lemma>&mdash;to be connected with what follows, &lsquo;as for access to the sea, the Lacedaemonians may sail&rsquo; etc. <hi rend="BOLD"><foreign lang="greek">o(/sa a)/n</foreign></hi>&mdash;with subj. implied, &lsquo;so far as they may (sail)&rsquo;.

A further restriction is enacted, that only rowing vessels be allowed, and the size of these is strictly limited. Arnold considers that the intention of the Athenians was not only to secure their naval supremacy, but also &lsquo;to stop the commerce of Peloponnesus, and particularly their trading voyages eastward to Egypt and Phoenicia, which could only be performed in <foreign lang="greek">o(lka/des</foreign> worked by sails&rsquo;.

<p>In construction this clause seems defective, no verb following: cf. ch. 40, 6, <foreign lang="greek">a)pistou=nte/s te k.t.l.</foreign> Classen however considers that  <foreign lang="greek">tou\s *(aqhnai/ous</foreign> stands in apposition to <foreign lang="greek">tou\s strathgou\s kai\ tou\s pruta/neis</foreign>, as in ch. 108, 25. <pb n="289"/>

As however <foreign lang="greek">kaq' o(/ ti</foreign> is perpetually used in the language of decrees for making provision &lsquo;as to how&rsquo; something is to be done, we should expect that here too it would introduce a relative clause dependent on <foreign lang="greek">bouleu/sasqai</foreign> &lsquo;the Athenians to decide in what way&rsquo; etc. According to the regular and common construction it would then be followed by the future indicative, as in line 56. Poppo suggests the deliberative <hi rend="BOLD"><foreign lang="greek">e)si/h|</foreign></hi> without <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">e)si/oi a)/n</foreign>, which would be nearly equivalent to a future indicative.

Further the Spartan month Gerastius here corresponds with the Attic month Elaphebolion, but there we find that Elaphebolion corresponds with the Spartan Artemisius&rsquo;. This is <pb n="290"/> from Arnold's note. He considers that owing to the system of intercalation, the details of which varied in different places, the same months at Athens and Sparta might no longer correspond with each other after an interval of two years. Grote supposes, with Poppo, that the fourteenth of Elaphebolion and the twelfth of Gerastius designate the same day.

The imperfect of <foreign lang="greek">e)/rxomai</foreign> and its compounds is rarely, if ever, found in Attic Greek, and is considered quite inadmissible in prose by many critics. Some editors accordingly would substitute <foreign lang="greek">e)ph=|san</foreign>.

</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)n ai(=s ou) polloi/</lemma>&mdash;the general sense is plain, but there is great awkwardness in the mode of expression. It has therefore been suggested to omit <hi rend="BOLD"><foreign lang="greek">ou)</foreign></hi> or the preceding <hi rend="BOLD"><foreign lang="greek">mhde/</foreign></hi>: or else to read <foreign lang="greek">e)n oi)=s</foreign>=<foreign lang="greek">a)ll' e)n u(mi=n</foreign>. Words of denying however are commonly followed by a redundant and untranslatable negative, and possibly this sentence comes under the same head. The speaker forgets that he has already cast his statement in a negative form; he passes on to the character of the constitutions which he has in his mind, and in the clause with <foreign lang="greek">ou)</foreign> insists on the denial which has been already made. Arnold compares <bibl n="Thuc. 2. 62">ii. 62</bibl>, where <foreign lang="greek">ma=llon h)\ ou)</foreign> follows a negative and is equivalent to &lsquo;rather than&rsquo;. See the Appendix to Buttmann's <hi rend="ITALIC">Meidias</hi> &lsquo;de abundantia negationis&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>Kr&uuml;ger and others connect the negative force of <foreign lang="greek">mhde/</foreign> solely with <foreign lang="greek">toiou/twn</foreign>, and refer the latter to what has gone before, &lsquo;not such&rsquo; as those in which men fear a multitude. So Jowett, &lsquo;you come from cities of another kind, and in those cities etc.&rsquo; This explanation, as Poppo points out, is not without harshness, &lsquo;cum <foreign lang="greek">toiou/twn ai(=s</foreign> inter se cohaerere nemo non suspicari debeat&rsquo;.

The meaning is further explained by <foreign lang="greek">di' *)aqhnai/ous</foreign>. It was fear of Athens which had made it his &lsquo;habitual principle&rsquo; to court the Spartan alliance; but now his injuries made him forget his interests.

</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ta\s a)/nw pu/las</lemma>&mdash;inland and northwards. <hi rend="BOLD"><foreign lang="greek">e)/tuxe...kei/mena</foreign></hi>&mdash;&lsquo;during a siege the arms of the citizens were kept constantly piled in one or more of the open spaces within the walls, that on any sudden alarm they might assemble there, and at once arm themselves, and be marshalled in their proper divisions. In fact the city for the time became a camp, and therefore, like a camp, had a place where the arms were regularly piled, and which served all the purposes of a parade. Compare <bibl n="Thuc. 8. 69">viii. 69</bibl>, and <bibl n="Xen. Anab. 2. 2. 20">Xen. Anab. ii. 2. 20</bibl>: <bibl n="Xen.

The optative joined with the indicative is one of innumerable instances. Here, the indicative refers to a particular point of time, while the optative is more general; but though such an explanation may often be found, this is by no means always the case, and the variation seems merely due to the Greek dislike of rigid uniformity.

The order of words is like <foreign lang="greek">kata\ to\n *)akesi/nhn potamo/n</foreign> ch. 25, 33. Classen omits <foreign lang="greek">e)s</foreign>, and connects the accusative with the words which follow, comparing ch. 68, 21 etc., where <foreign lang="greek">e)spi/ptein</foreign> alone means to force an entrance. <foreign lang="greek">e(spi/ptein e(s</foreign> however is quite common, as in <bibl n="Thuc. 2. 4">ii. 4</bibl>.
