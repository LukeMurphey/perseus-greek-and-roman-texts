<div3 type="SECTION" n="1"><p>  </p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)bou/lonto</lemma>&mdash;&lsquo;the word is here (as in Xen. <hi rend="ITALIC">Hel.</hi> III.  4, 2, and elsewhere) used not so much of <hi rend="ITALIC">will</hi> as of <hi rend="ITALIC">intention</hi> (Bloomfield). This is not accurate. Trans. &lsquo;felt a wish.&rsquo;  <foreign lang="greek">bou/lomai</foreign> expresses a vaguer wish than <foreign lang="greek">dianoou=mai</foreign>: it never means &lsquo;make up one's mind,&rsquo; and consequently cannot, like <foreign lang="greek">dianoou=mai</foreign>, be constructed with a fut. infin.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">au)=qis</lemma>&mdash;with <foreign lang="greek">e)pi\ *sikeli/an pleu/santes</foreign>. It is the habit of Thuc. to place the prominent word early in its clause. For the previous A. expeditions see Intr. p. x.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">mei/zoni paraskeuh=|</lemma>&mdash;the numbers that sailed under Laches are not known. [Pythodorus and] Eurymedon took forty ships with them.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">*aa/xhtos</lemma>&mdash;in Sicily 427-426 B.C.; replaced in winter of 426 by Pythodorus. He was a supporter of Nicias in arranging the peace of 421. Plato's <hi rend="ITALIC">Laches</hi> is named after him. It has been conjectured that he is represented under <hi rend="ITALIC">Tydeus</hi> in the <hi rend="ITALIC">Supplices</hi> of Euripides (produced <hi rend="ITALIC">circ.</hi> 420 B.C.). He is the dog Labes in Aristoph. <hi rend="ITALIC">Wasps.</hi> He was attacked by Cleon.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kai/</lemma>&mdash;joins the names of two commanders who were not in power at the same time. Hence the full form would be <foreign lang="greek">th=s</foreign> <pb n="116"/> <foreign lang="greek">meta\ *la/xhtos kai\ th=s meta\ *eu)r</foreign>.: but it is worth noticing how with the second of two expressions joined by <foreign lang="greek">kai/</foreign> it is possible to omit (1) the <hi rend="ITALIC">article</hi>, (2) the <hi rend="ITALIC">preposition.</hi> Such omissions are common even when the connected expressions are quite distinct.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">*eu)rume/dontos</lemma>&mdash;on returning to Athens from Sicily in 424, he had been tried on a charge of taking bribes (<foreign lang="greek">grafh\ dw/rwn</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">dwrodoki/as</foreign>), and was fined. He was not <foreign lang="greek">strathgo/s</foreign> again until 414 B.C. This long period of retirement is probably connected with his trial and condemnation.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)pi\ *s. pleu/santes katastre/yasqai</lemma>&mdash;it is regular to construct the common object of a partieiple and verb so as to suit the participle.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)/peiroi oi( polloi/</lemma>&mdash;in limiting apposition to <foreign lang="greek">*)aqhnai=oi</foreign>. Thuc. enlarges or contracts the subject at will.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">tou= mege/qous . . tou= plh/qous</lemma>&mdash;<hi rend="ITALIC">chiasmus</hi> is so common in Thuc. as to amount to a mannerism. Cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 5. 61">V. 61</bibl> <foreign lang="greek">th/n te tou= tei/xous a)sqenei/an kai\ tou= stratou= to\ plh=qos</foreign>. (On <foreign lang="greek">me/geqos</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">plh=qos tw=n e)noikou/ntwn</foreign> in reference to the <hi rend="ITALIC">City</hi> see Aristot. <hi rend="ITALIC">Pol.</hi> 1326 a, with Fowler's <hi rend="ITALIC">City-State</hi>, p. 276.)
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kai\ o(/ti</lemma>&mdash;a clause introduced by <foreign lang="greek">o(/ti</foreign> in either of its meanings is often co-ordinated to a noun, as in <bibl n="Thuc. 7. 58">VII. 58</bibl>, 4 <foreign lang="greek">dia\ me/geqo/s te po/lews kai\ o(/ti</foreign> (&lsquo;because&rsquo;) <foreign lang="greek">e)n megi/stw| kindu/nw| h)=san</foreign>. Cf. Demosth. <bibl n="Thuc. 8. 71">VIII. 71</bibl> <foreign lang="greek">ou)de\n a)\n tou/twn ei)/toimi, a)ll) o(/ti . . ou)de\n politeu/omai</foreign>. (1) A similar use of &lsquo;and that&rsquo; is common in eighteenth-centnry English prose; as also is (2) the habit of using together two constructions after a single verb or governing expression&mdash;here <foreign lang="greek">tou= mege/qous . . kai\ o(/ti</foreign> after <foreign lang="greek">a)/peiroi o)/ntes</foreign>. Thus in <bibl n="Thuc. 8. 4">VIII. 4</bibl>, 1 we have <foreign lang="greek">pareskeua/zonto de\ . . th/n te nauphgi/an kai\ *sou/nion teixi/santes</foreign>: Addison has &lsquo;It was his design <hi rend="ITALIC">to</hi> marry her to such a gentleman, <hi rend="ITALIC">and that</hi> her wedding should be celebrated on such a day&rsquo;; &lsquo;They believe <hi rend="ITALIC">the same</hi> of all works of art . . <hi rend="ITALIC">and that</hi>, as any one of these things perish, their souls go into another world&rsquo;; Cowper has &lsquo;The fine gentleman would find his ceilings too low, <hi rend="ITALIC">and that</hi> his casements admitted too much wind&rsquo;; Johnson, &lsquo;They think veneration gained by such appearances of wisdom, <hi rend="ITALIC">but that</hi> no ideas are annexed to the words.&rsquo; Thackeray, Carlyle, and Ruskin also indulge in this and similar constructions.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ou) pollw=| tini</lemma>&mdash;Hudson wrongly says &lsquo;<foreign lang="greek">tini</foreign> <hi rend="ITALIC">videtur</hi> <foreign lang="greek">pleona/zein</foreign>.&rsquo; Greek has three words for our &lsquo;very,&rsquo; &lsquo;really,&rsquo; or &lsquo;actually&rsquo; (<hi rend="ITALIC">quidam</hi> with adjeetives)&mdash;(1) <foreign lang="greek">tis</foreign> (generally with adjectives of degree); (2) <foreign lang="greek">pa/nu</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">sfo/dra</foreign> (often with words other than numcrals <hi rend="ITALIC">which cannot be compared.</hi> See <hi rend="ITALIC">Class. Rev.</hi> VIII. p. 152<hi rend="ITALIC">b</hi>). With negatives <foreign lang="greek">tis</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">pa/nu</foreign> or both together can be used. (See Stein on Herod. <bibl n="Thuc. 5. 33">V. 33</bibl>.) <pb n="117"/>
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">u(podee)steron</lemma>&mdash;antithesis to <foreign lang="greek">mege/qous kai\ plh/qous</foreign>, as in <bibl n="Thuc. 2. 89">II. 89</bibl>, 6 <foreign lang="greek">e)k pollw=| u(podeeste/rwn . . me/ga ti th=s dianoi/as to\ be/baion e)/xontes</foreign>: <bibl n="Thuc. 5. 20">V. 20</bibl> <foreign lang="greek">u(podee/steron o)\n ta\ me/gista timh/sei</foreign>.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)nh|rou=nto</lemma>&mdash;the pres and imperf., especially of -<foreign lang="greek">gi/gnomai</foreign> and -<foreign lang="greek">di/dwmi</foreign>, often express <hi rend="ITALIC">intention</hi> or <hi rend="ITALIC">attempt;</hi> as Aristoph. <hi rend="ITALIC">Pax</hi> 408 <foreign lang="greek">prodi/doton th\n *(ella/da</foreign>: Eur <hi rend="ITALIC">H. F</hi> 538 <foreign lang="greek">kai\ ta)/m' e)/qnh|ske te/kn), a)pwllu/mhn d' e)gw/</foreign> <hi rend="ITALIC">liberi mei morituri erant, ego autem peritura.</hi></p></div3>
<div3 type="SECTION" n="2"><p>  </p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">*sikeli/as</lemma>&mdash;here follows a description of Sicily, in which Thuc., &lsquo;like Herodotus, retains the spirit of the older geographers and logographers,&rsquo; and writes with something of the grace that characterises the style of Herodotus. It has been commonly supposed since Nicbuhr that Thuc. borrows from his contemporary Antiochus of Syracuse&mdash;so Goller, Wolfflin, Classen, Mahaffy,&mdash;but there is no certainty (see Freeman, <hi rend="ITALIC">Hist. Sic.</hi> I. p. 456). Thuc. probably visited Sicily during his exile.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)/lasson</lemma>&mdash;not <foreign lang="greek">e)la/sswn</foreign>: the adverbs <foreign lang="greek">ple/on, e)/lasson</foreign> are regularly used in such cases. Cf. c. 95, 1 <foreign lang="greek">e)pra/qh tala/ntwn ou)k e)/lasson pe/nte kai\ ei)/kosi</foreign>. The repetition of <foreign lang="greek">ou) pollw=| tini</foreign> emphasises the vastness of the undertaking.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">h(merw=n</lemma>&mdash;so <bibl n="Thuc. 2. 97">II. 97</bibl>, 1 <foreign lang="greek">peri/plous tessa/rwn h(merw=n</foreign>. The length of the coasts of Sicily is 512 miles. In ancient times, astronomy not being applied to navigation, distance round the coasts of a country of which the measurements were unknown, could be reckoned only by the time occupied in the voyage.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">tosau/th ou)=sa</lemma>&mdash;Thuc. &lsquo;seems to think that there is a geographical incongruity in so large an island being separated from the mainland by so narrow a channel&rsquo; (note in Jowett); or rather, he adds as a second proof of the geographical importance of the island&mdash;and consequently of the magnitude of the new undertaking&mdash;the fact that Sicily, in addition to its size, is so close to the mainland as to be almost part of the continent. Athens was in the habit of reducing islands&mdash; <foreign lang="greek">pleu/santes katastre/yasqai</foreign>&mdash;but she had not the means for reducing a large <hi rend="ITALIC">continental</hi> country. (Stein explains similarly.)
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)n . . me/trw|</lemma>&mdash;a difficult use of <foreign lang="greek">e(n</foreign> in its <hi rend="ITALIC">quasi</hi>-instrumental sense, &lsquo;<hi rend="ITALIC">res in qua aliqua actio vel qualitas cernitur.</hi>&rsquo; c. 16, 5 <foreign lang="greek">e)/n tinos lampro/thti proe/sxon</foreign> is the same use. It is from this use that adverbial phrases like <foreign lang="greek">e)n ta/xei</foreign> come.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">to\ mh/</lemma>&mdash;Soph. <hi rend="ITALIC">Phil.</hi> 1141 <foreign lang="greek">e)/stin tis e)/stin o(/s se kwlu/sei to\ dra=n</foreign>. <hi rend="ITALIC">M.T.</hi> 811: Wecklein on <hi rend="ITALIC">Agam.</hi> 1588. It is <hi rend="ITALIC">internal accus.</hi>
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ei)=nai</lemma>&mdash;see crit. note. Poppo defended <foreign lang="greek">ou)=sa</foreign> here as a confusion between two constructions; but Classen is probably right in thinking that <foreign lang="greek">ou)=sa</foreign> got in from <foreign lang="greek">tosau/th ou)=sa</foreign> above. <pb n="118"/> Among recent critics, only L. Herbst defends <foreign lang="greek">ou)=sa</foreign>: he thinks that <foreign lang="greek">to/</foreign> does not affect the construction here and in other places, but is used as a demonstrative particle. Would <foreign lang="greek">mh/</foreign> then be possible?</p></div3></div2>
<div2 type="CHAPTER" n="2"><p></p>
<div3 type="SECTION" n="1"><p>  </p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">w)|ki/sqh de/</lemma>&mdash;answering to <foreign lang="greek">peri/plous me/n</foreign> above.  cc. 2-5 are generally described as a digression; but the passage is perhaps rather a continuation of the description of the greatness of Sicily. &lsquo;The greatness of Sicily,&rsquo; Freeman says, &lsquo;was essentially a colonial greatness, the greatness of communities which did not form whole nations but only parts of nations, nations of which other parts remained in their elder homes.&rsquo;
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">to\ a)rxai=on</lemma>&mdash;distinguish from <foreign lang="greek">kata\ to\ a/rxai=on</foreign> (&lsquo;in the ancient manner&rsquo;).
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)/sxe</lemma>&mdash;sc. <foreign lang="greek">au)th/n. ta\ cu/mpanta</foreign> is nom., agreeing with <foreign lang="greek">e)/qnh</foreign>. When the art. precedes <foreign lang="greek">pa=s</foreign> and its compds., the whole is regarded as the sum of its component parts. (To take <foreign lang="greek">ta\ cu/mpanta</foreign> as accus. is wrong. A complete list of tribes is what Thuc. gives; their geographical distribution is also described, but that is already referred to in <foreign lang="greek">w)=de w)|ki/sqh</foreign>. Cf, the last sentence of c. 2, where the same ideas recur in inverse order.)
<foreign lang="greek"><hi rend="BOLD">le/gontai</hi>&mdash;le/gomai</foreign> used personally or impersonally is regularly constructed with an infin.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">*ku/klwpes</lemma>&mdash;Homer does not say that the Cyclopes dwelt in Sicily (<hi rend="ITALIC">Od.</hi> IX); but the scene of his story was always localised by later writers (as by Euripides) in Sicily.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">*laistrugo/nes</lemma>&mdash;mythical beings (<hi rend="ITALIC">Od.</hi> X. 81) like the Cyclopes, dwelling, like them, in fairy-land. The story that they lived in Sicily is the product of Greek fancy. (See Freeman <hi rend="ITALIC">l.c.</hi> pp. 100, 106.)
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">poihtai=s</lemma>&mdash;esp. Homer. Observe that the perf. pass., when the subject is non-personal, regularly has the agent in dat.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">w(s e(/kastos gignw/skei</lemma>&mdash;so in <bibl n="Thuc. 2. 48">II. 48</bibl>, of the origin of &lsquo;the Plague.&rsquo;
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">peri\ au)tw=n</lemma>&mdash;Classen takes <foreign lang="greek">au)tw=n</foreign> as neut., &lsquo;these questions,&rsquo; <hi rend="ITALIC">i.e.</hi> <foreign lang="greek">ge/nos, o(po/qen e)sh=lqon k.t.l</foreign>. Of this rather vague use of <foreign lang="greek">au)ta/</foreign> Thuc. is fond. But <foreign lang="greek">met' au)tou/s</foreign> below is strongly in favour of making <foreign lang="greek">au)tw=n</foreign> masc.</p></div3>
<div3 type="SECTION" n="2"><p>  </p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">*sikanoi/</lemma>&mdash;some modern critics, including Holm, think that <foreign lang="greek">*sikanoi/</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">*sikeloi/</foreign> are &lsquo;simply dialectal differences of the same name.&rsquo; Freeman combats this view <hi rend="ITALIC">l.c.</hi> pp. 472 <hi rend="ITALIC">fol.</hi>
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)noikisa/menoi</lemma>&mdash;&lsquo;settled there.&rsquo; The next words mean &lsquo;or rather (<foreign lang="greek">kai/</foreign>=<hi rend="ITALIC">immo</hi>) before them, according to their own account.&rsquo; There is an instance of the sarcastic humour of <pb n="119"/> which Thuc. is rather fond in <foreign lang="greek">e)noikisa/menoi . . au)to/xqones</foreign>: if &lsquo;original inhabitants,&rsquo; they could not be &lsquo;settlers.&rsquo;
</p>

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">w(s me\n au)toi/ fasi</lemma>&mdash;this is placed early in order to bring out the antithesis sharply. It is a very common trick of order in Thuc.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">dia\ to\ . . ei)=nai</lemma>&mdash;the inf. with <foreign lang="greek">dia\ to/</foreign> is very common in Thuc. (63 cases according to Behrendt), but <foreign lang="greek">dia\ tou=</foreign> with inf. is not found. The inf. with art., commoner in Thuc. and Demosth. than in any other author, is in Thuc. found chiefly in the speeches and the loftier parts of narrative. The construction and usage of the Eng. inf. in -<hi rend="ITALIC">ing</hi> (as distinct from the <hi rend="ITALIC">verbal noun</hi>) are precisely similar to the Gk. inf. with art., except only that the Eng. inf. can be qualified, not only by the def. art., but by a pronoun and by a substantive in the possessive case.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">*)/ibhres</lemma>&mdash;great value attached to a well-authenticated claim to be <foreign lang="greek">au)to/xqones</foreign>: hence Thuc. marks the antithesis to <foreign lang="greek">dia\ to\ au/. ei)=nai</foreign>, instead of writing <foreign lang="greek">u(/steroi</foreign> in contrast with <foreign lang="greek">pro/teroi</foreign>. Stein reads &lt;<foreign lang="greek">u(/steroi</foreign>&gt;,  <foreign lang="greek">*)/ibhres</foreign>.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">*sikanou=</lemma>&mdash;has been thought to be the S&egrave;gre or even the Seine, but it is unknown. It is not certain from what quarter these Iberians really immigrated to Sicily.
14 </p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">*trinakri/a</lemma>&mdash;Freeman points out that this name, derived from <foreign lang="greek">trei=s a)/krai</foreign>, is probably a mere corruption of the Homeric <foreign lang="greek">*qrinaki/h</foreign>, with which island Sicily was identified, the supposed reference being to the triangular shape of Sicily. Ov. <hi rend="ITALIC">Fast.</hi> <bibl n="Thuc. 4. 419">IV. 419</bibl> <hi rend="ITALIC">Trinacris a positu nomen adepta loci.</hi>
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kaloume/nh</lemma>&mdash;this tense of the partic. (imperf.) is invariably used when a name now obsolete is referred to. <foreign lang="greek">klhqei/s</foreign>= &lsquo;called&rsquo; (timeless), or &lsquo;having received the name,&rsquo; and is used of names given under some definite circumstances referred to, as in c. 4, 1 <foreign lang="greek">tou\s *(u. klhqe/ntas</foreign>, and c. 4, 5.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ta\ pro\s e(spe/ran</lemma>&mdash;adverbial. For the expression cf. <foreign lang="greek">ta\ pro\s borra=n</foreign> &sect; 5 and <foreign lang="greek">to\ pro\s no/ton</foreign> <bibl n="Thuc. 3. 6">III. 6</bibl>. <foreign lang="greek">pro\s e(spe/ran</foreign> also means &lsquo;towards evening,&rsquo; <hi rend="ITALIC">sub vesperum.</hi></p></div3>
<div3 type="SECTION" n="3"><p>  </p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a(liskome/nou</lemma>&mdash;Classen makes this historic pres.; but it cannot be shown that the historic pres. is used in any mood but the indic. Stahl takes it with <foreign lang="greek">diafugo/ntes</foreign>&mdash;&lsquo;escaped at the time of the capture.&rsquo; This is possible; but Goodwin (<hi rend="ITALIC">M.T.</hi> &sect; 27) classes <foreign lang="greek">a(li/skomai</foreign> with <foreign lang="greek">a)dikw=, feu/gw, nikw=</foreign>, etc., so that the pres. may here resemble a perf.: but observe (1) when the pres. indic. of <foreign lang="greek">a(l</foreign>. refers to the past, it appears to he <hi rend="ITALIC">historic pres.;</hi> (2) <foreign lang="greek">a(lisko/menos</foreign> is either (<hi rend="ITALIC">a</hi>) coincident in time with the main verb, or (<hi rend="ITALIC">b</hi>) approaches to the perf., like <foreign lang="greek">a/dikw=</foreign>. (An <hi rend="ITALIC">imperf.</hi> <pb n="120"/> partic. in gen. abs. joined to a historic pres. sometimes gives the <hi rend="ITALIC">cause</hi> of the verb; as <bibl n="Thuc. 1. 136">I. 136</bibl> <foreign lang="greek">dedie/nai fasko/ntwn *kerkurai/wn e)/xein au)to/n, diakomi/zetai e)s th\n h)/peiron</foreign>.)
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)fiknou=ntai</lemma>&mdash;verbs of &lsquo;going&rsquo; and &lsquo;sending&rsquo; are especially common in the hist. pres.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">cu/mpantes me/n</lemma>&mdash;Jowett renders &lsquo;they settled near the Sicanians, and both took the name of Elymi&rsquo;; but Freeman says &lsquo;I certainly always understood this simply to mean that the whole people were called E. . . . but that there were two separate Elymian cities.&rsquo; Freeman is clearly right. The Sicanians had given their name to the island, and they remained quite distinct from the Elymi. Also, is J.'s rendering of <foreign lang="greek">cu/mpantes</foreign> possible? <foreign lang="greek">c</foreign>. is often contrasted with <foreign lang="greek">kata\ po/leis</foreign>, whereas it <hi rend="ITALIC">never</hi> means in Thuc. &lsquo;they with the others.&rsquo; And Thuc. is clearly giving the name and the cities of the new settlers.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">*)/eruc</lemma>&mdash;the story of the Trojan origin of Eryx is accepted and elaborated by Virgil m Aeneid V.; but Freeman shows that the older legend did not assign to it a Trojan origin.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">*)/egesta</lemma>&mdash;this is the Greek name; but the native name, retained by the Romans, was Segesta. It is the Acesta of <hi rend="ITALIC">Aen.</hi> <bibl n="Thuc. 5. 718">v. 718</bibl>. To the Romans is due the tradition that it was founded by Aeneas, who named it after Acestes.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">proscunw/|khsan de\ . . kai/</lemma>&mdash;a characteristic <hi rend="ITALIC">anaphora</hi> of <foreign lang="greek">o(/moroi . . oi)kh/santes</foreign>. Thuc. does not <hi rend="ITALIC">in narrative</hi> balance the clauses exactly by <hi rend="ITALIC">anaphora</hi>, whereas in Xenophon such balance is very frequent. Cp. c. 20, 4.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">*fwke/wn</lemma>&mdash;the statement that Phocians settled in Sicily receives no support except from a single passage in Pausanias. And this testimony is really of slight value, as P. is enumerating the Greek settlers in Sicily, as distinct from the barbarians, among whom he places the Elymi (Phrygians, <hi rend="ITALIC">i.e</hi> Trojans). The correction <foreign lang="greek">*frugw=n</foreign> is not really supported, because when later writers speak of Phrygians in Sicily they mean Trojans. It looks as if in <foreign lang="greek">tw=n *trw/wn tine/s</foreign> above Thue. refers to that arrival which appears under a much-developed form in Dion. Hal. as the return of Acestes. Whether in <foreign lang="greek">*fwke/wn tine/s</foreign> we have an early form of the legend that reappears in the story of Aeneas, is much more doubtful. Dion. Hal. assigns an Areadian origin to Aeneas: and it should be borne in mind that the Trojans are barbarians in Thuc. and Pausanias, but Hellenes in Dion. Hal. and Virgil. Dion. Hal. speaks of the Trojans under Aeneas as <foreign lang="greek">ta\s po/leis sunoiki/zontes toi=s *)elu/mois e/n *sikeli/a|</foreign>. These faets only show how great was the confusion <pb n="121"/> in the stories concerning the settlement of the Elymi, and how impossible it is to correct <foreign lang="greek">*fwke/wn</foreign> with any confidenee.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">to/te</lemma>&mdash;refers back to <foreign lang="greek">diafugo/ntes</foreign> (Stahl).
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)s *libu/hn</lemma>&mdash;it is not impossible that this suggested to Virgil the bringing of Aeneas to Carthage.

(2) How, after an exception so vital, could he add <foreign lang="greek">u(perba/llontes toi=s pa=si</foreign>? (3) How in c. 31 could Thuc. say of the A. force that its superiority over that of the euemy was conspicuous, if in the great arm of war N. can assert that it will of course be inferior? Would not such a statement from a responsible general be ridiculous? (<hi rend="ITALIC">b</hi>) Classen makes <foreign lang="greek">to\ o(plitiko/n</foreign> refer to the A. hoplites, and makes the sense &lsquo;except as regards our hoplites as compared with their whole fighting force&rsquo;; but Stahl rightly objects that the comparison <hi rend="ITALIC">should then</hi> be between <hi rend="ITALIC">part</hi> and <hi rend="ITALIC">part</hi>, not between <hi rend="ITALIC">part</hi> and <hi rend="ITALIC">whole</hi>, of the rival forces. The remedy is not to read <foreign lang="greek">to\ i(ppiko/n</foreign> with Urlichs,&mdash;for N. had proposed to take a force of <foreign lang="greek">sfendonh=tai</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">toco/tai</foreign> which should be <foreign lang="greek">a)nti/palon</foreign> to the enemy's cavalry,&mdash;but to make <foreign lang="greek">to\ o(plitiko/n</foreign> the object of <foreign lang="greek">paras keuasa/menoi</foreign>. Hence trans. &lsquo;not only with a <pb n="162"/> force of hoplites a match for them, except when compared with their fighting strength (i e. with our hoplites equal to their hoplites), but actually surpassing them in every point.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">to\ ma/ximon au)tw=n</lemma>&mdash;this is the whole of the enemy's forces. The A. were in the habit of relying on their hoplites in the field: N. reminds them that there are other kinds of troops to be reckoned with besides hoplites. He is referring back to his remark in c. 22, 1. Not only must the hoplites be a match for them (excluding of course their cavalry), but hoplites <hi rend="ITALIC">and light-armed troops</hi> must be <hi rend="ITALIC">more than a match</hi> for their whole fighting force, and even thus it will be hard to deal with them. <foreign lang="greek">to\ o(plitiko/n</foreign> is in an emphatic position, because it is contrasted with <foreign lang="greek">to\ e)kei/nwn i\ppiko/n</foreign>, as in c. 22.

That (<hi rend="ITALIC">b</hi>) is right is shown by the sentence that follows.

And &sect; 2 below, <foreign lang="greek">e)xw/rei eu)qu/s dro/mw|</foreign>, is inconsistent with the supposition.
