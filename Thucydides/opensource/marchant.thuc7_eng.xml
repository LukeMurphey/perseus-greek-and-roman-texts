            autumn, owing to differences with Brasidas, he made terms with the Athenians, but lent
            no assistance. (7) In 418 winter, he again joined Sparta, after the battle of Mantiuea.

              scholiast is probably right, since there is no other instance of great carnage,
                <foreign lang="greek">fo/nos</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">sfagh/</foreign>, in
              the Sicihan war with which the last disaster could be aptly compared; and as Thuc. was
              writing the history of the Sicilian expedition, not as a separate work, but as part of
              his general history, it is strange that he should speak of the Sicilian campaigns only
              in giving an idea of the extent of the loss. (Arnold says &lsquo;it is as if an
              historian of the French campaign in Russia were to say of their loss at the Beresina,
              &ldquo;that it was greater than on any other occasion throughout this Russian

              he was more than a <hi rend="ITALIC">moral</hi> coward. Thuc. himself admits moral
              cowardice on the part of N. when he attributes superstition to him. The construction
              is disputed, but it is natural to suppose that both <foreign lang="greek"
