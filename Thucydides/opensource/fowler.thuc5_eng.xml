<p>The Athenians for religious reasons drive the Delians from their island.</p>
<p> <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ai( spondai\ diele/lunto</lemma>: the truce was at an end, but no warlike operations are recorded until Cleon led the expedition to Thrace, after the Pythian festival (Metageitnion, Ol. 89, 3, i.e. Aug., 422 B.C.). See App. &mdash;<lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)kexeiri/a|</lemma>: here and in <bibl n="Thuc. 5.2.2">c. 2. 2</bibl>; 49. 14, the <gloss>truce</gloss> in consequence of the festival. See App.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">i(erw=sqai</lemma>: pf. pass., depends upon <foreign lang="greek">h(ghsa/menoi</foreign>. It refers to the purification and consecration of Delos which had taken place four years before (cf. iii. 104). The Athenians now thought that the Delians had at that time been consecrated (again) to Apollo when they were not yet entirely purified and cleansed from an ancient pollution; that is, that the re-consecration had taken place too soon. But besides (<foreign lang="greek">kai\ a(/ma</foreign>), they thought that the manner of purification (by removal of the coffins) had not been sufficiently thorough.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">h(=| pro/tero/n moi dedh/lwtai</lemma>: upon this depends the indir. disc. <foreign lang="greek">w(s . . . e)no/misan poih=sai</foreign>: &ldquo;In which I have before related that they believed,&rdquo; etc. See App.</p>

Ida.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">*farna/kou</lemma>: Pharnaces was at that time still satrap on the Hellespont. He was succeeded in this office by his son Pharnabazus. Cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 8.6.3">viii. 6. 3</bibl>.&mdash;<lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">w(/rmhto</lemma>: with ellipsis of <foreign lang="greek">oi)kh=sai</foreign>.

<p>The expulsion of the Delians is regarded by Boeckh (Abh. d. Berl. <pb n="12"/> Akad., 1834, p. 6 ff.) and Curtius (<title>Hist. of Greece</title>, III. p. 200) as an unjust and tyrannical measure. But perhaps the scrupulousness in matters of religion which is expressed in the beginning of the treaty of peace (<bibl n="Thuc. 4.118.1">iv. 118. 1</bibl>), and which caused the Delians to be brought back the very next year (<bibl n="Thuc. 5.32.4">c. 32. 4</bibl>), was really the motive of the action of the Athenians.

<div2 type="chapter" n="19">
<p>The day of the ratification of the treaty and the names of those on both sides who took the oath.</p>
<p>This chapter is part of the official document recording the peace. It determines the day with which the peace shall begin for all parties, and gives the names of the men who are to take the oath. In c. 20 the narrative is resumed with the mention of the date of the ratification of the treaty. The indics. <foreign lang="greek">a)/rxei, w)/mnuon kai\ e)spe/ndonto</foreign>, are not unusual in treaties. See Steup, <title>Stud.</title> I. p. 68.</p>
<p> <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)/rxei</lemma>: the manner of dating differs from that of <bibl n="Thuc. 4.118.49">iv. 118. 49</bibl>, inasmuch as here, not the day, but the year appears as subj.; for <foreign lang="greek">e)/foros *pleisto/las</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">a)/rxwn *)alkai=os</foreign> are the usual expressions for the year, Ol. 89, 3. The dats. (<foreign lang="greek">teta/rth|</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">e(/kth|</foreign>) denoting the day immediately follow the nouns denoting the year. Lit., <hi rend="italic">the year of the Ephor Pleistolas, etc., begins the peace on the fourth day from the end of Artemisios; i.e.</hi> the peace begins on the fourth, etc. The 27th of Artemisios in Sparta or the 25th of Elaphebolion in Athens for the year 421 B.C. fell about the middle of April. See Curtius, <title>Hist. of Greece</title>, III. p. 207.</p>
<p> <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">*pleistoa/nac, *)=agis</lemma>: see App.&mdash; 8. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">*)aqhnai/wn de/</lemma>: of the seventeen Athenians, eleven (since for <foreign lang="greek">*)aristokri/ths</foreign> of the Mss. we must certainly write <foreign lang="greek">*)aristokra/ths</foreign> from c. 24; cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 8.89.12">viii. 89. 12</bibl>) are known to us as generals in the course of the war. Among these Nicias, Laches, Hagnon, Lamachus, and Demosthenes are the most noted. Lampon was celebrated (Plut. <title>Per.</title> c. 6) and derided (Ar. <title>Av.</title> 521, 988) as an oraclemonger. Only Isthmionicus, Procles (for the general Procles of Ol. 88. 2 fell in the campaign against the Aetolians; see <bibl n="Thuc. 3.98.23">iii. 98. 23</bibl>), Myrtilus, Iolcius, and Timocrates are not elsewhere mentioned. The reason for the number seventeen cannot be determined with any degree of certainty. Ullrich suggests on the Athenian side perhaps two priests, half of the generals of that year, and one citizen of each phyle. Perhaps the oath was taken on the Lacedaemonian side by a number of Lacedaemonians and one each from the allied cities which took part in the peace. Certainly the words <foreign lang="greek">kai\</foreign> <pb n="46"/> <foreign lang="greek">w)/mosan kata\ po/leis</foreign> in <bibl n="Thuc. 5.18.2">c. 18. 2</bibl> seem to imply that the allies took part in the oath as prescribed in <bibl n="Thuc. 5.18.47">c. 18. 47</bibl> ff., though Ullrich, p. 19, believes that they did not. Perhaps the number of Athenian envoys at Sparta had gradually risen to seventeen, all of whom were then commissioned to take the oath, or perhaps Kirchhoff is right in deducing the number from the peculiar Spartan constitution, in which case the seventeen Athenians would be appointed to correspond to the seventeen Spartans. See App. on <bibl n="Thuc. 5.18.50">c. 18. 50</bibl>.
