<div2 type="chapter" n="1"><head>Life of Cicero.</head> 	
<p>Marcus Tullius  Cicero, partly on account of his natural abilities and partly on account of the times in which he lived, has left a name associated with some of the most important events in the history of the world, as well as with some of the most potent forces in our civilization. Few men have made so distinct an impression on modern literature and thought. He touched many things which he did not adorn, but there is hardly any kind of intellectual activity that is not conspicuously indebted to his precepts or his example.  <pb n="xiii"/></p>
<div3 type="section" n="1"><head>Cicero's life from his birth to the opening of his political career (<dateRange from="-106" to="-76"><date value="-106">B.C. 106</date>-76</dateRange>).</head> 	

<p>Cicero was born at Arpinum, a city with the Roman franchise (which was also the birthplace of Marius), Jan. 3, <date value="-106">B.C. 106</date>, of an equestrian family. His grandfather, who had a small estate in that region, was of Volscian stock, and thus belonged to the old virile country people of the republic. His grandmother was a Gratidia, closely connected by adoption with the great Marius and with prominent Roman politicians. His father, who was the eldest son, had increased the family estate by agriculture and by the profits of a fulling-mill, so that he was among the richest of his townsmen, and possessed the census of a Roman knight. By his marriage with Helvia, a woman of the nobility, he became connected with many senatorial  <pb n="xiv"/> families. She was a woman of great economic and domestic virtues, and a strong support to her husband, who was of a somewhat weak constitution. The father was a man of cultivated mind and devoted himself to the education of his two sons, Marcus, afterwards the orator, and the younger brother Quintus. For this purpose he removed to the city. His ambition, like that of every Roman of fortune, was to have his sons enter politics and so to establish a senatorial family. He lived to see both of them succeed in this career, and the elder become one of the most distinguished men in Rome.
</p>
<p>Cicero himself was early stimulated by the success of Marius and the general atmosphere of Roman ambition to desire a prominent place in the state. <note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">pollo\n a)risteu/ein kai\ u(pei/roxos e)/mmenai a)/llwn</foreign>. Ad Quintum Fratrem, iii. 5, 6.</note> His father's connections with men and women of rank brought the boy into contact with the great orators M. Antonius and L. Crassus,<note anchored="yes">See p. <ref n="p. xxxvii" targOrder="U">xxxvii</ref>.</note> who interested themselves in his education.<note anchored="yes">This debt he amply repays by his tribute to them in the <title>De Oratore</title>. See Defence of Archias, <bibl n="Cic. Arch. 1">ch. 1</bibl>.</note> Among his companions were the sons of Aculeo, Lucius Cicero, his cousin, his intimate friend Atticus, L. Torquatus, C. Marius the younger, and L. Aelius Tubero. His instructors were Greeks; but, as he had already formed the purpose of attaining office through the power of oratory, he did not confine himself to theoretical or technical learning. He frequented the Forum to hear the great orators of his day, especially Antonius and Crassus, who discoursed with him on literary subjects, so that they became in a manner his teachers. He received instruction from Archias<note anchored="yes">See p. <ref n="p. xxxix" targOrder="U">xxxix</ref>.</note>; he sought the society of L. Accius, the poet, and he studied the art of delivery in the theatre, becoming intimately acquainted with the great actors Roscius and Aesopus. He practiced <pb n="xv"/> many kinds of composition, but his most important means of education, as he tells us, was translation from the Greek.
</p>
<p>At the age of sixteen (<date value="-90">B.C. 90</date>), Cicero received the <foreign lang="la">toga virilis</foreign> (the "coming out" of a Roman boy), and from that time he devoted himself to law and statesmanship as well as oratory. For this purpose he was put under the charge of Mucius Scaevola, the augur, and later he attached himself to the no less celebrated Pontifex of the same name. In <date value="-89">B.C. 89</date> he served one campaign in the army under Cn. Pompeius Strabo. After this short military experience, he returned with still greater vigor to his literary and political studies. He studied philosophy under Phaedrus and Philo, oratory under Molo of Rhodes, and all the branches of a liberal education under Diodotus the Stoic.
</p>
<p>When about twenty-five years of age, Cicero began his active career. It was customary to win one's spurs by attacking some political opponent; but this was contrary to Cicero's pacific nature, and throughout his life he prided himself on always taking the side of the defence. His first oratorical efforts have not been preserved to us. The earliest of his orations which we possess is his defence of P. Quinctius in a civil action (<date value="-81">B.C. 81</date>). This suit involved no political question; but no case at that time could be entirely free from politics in one form or another, and nothing is more significant of Cicero's character than the skill with which he constantly used political bias for his client's advantage without seeming to take sides. To defend Quinctius was a bold undertaking for a young advocate; for the opposing counsel was the great orator Hortensius, backed by powerful influence on behalf of the plaintiff. The case, too, was a somewhat dry one; but Cicero's skill as an advocate is shown by the fact that he raises it above the ordinary business and technical level into a question of universal justice and the rights of common humanity. <pb n="xvi"/></p>
<p>Next year occurred the trial of Sextus Roscius of Ameria for parricide (<date value="-80">B.C. 80</date>), a case growing out of the abuses of Sulla's dictatorship. <note anchored="yes">See pp. 1, 2, below (Introduction to the Oration).</note> Cicero showed his courage by undertaking the defence, and his forensic skill by converting his plea into a powerful attack on the accusers in the regular manner of Roman invective. In <date value="-79">B.C. 79</date> he came into still more daring antagonism with Sulla in the case of a woman of Arretium. The oration has not come down to us, but from its boldness it must have added greatly to the orator's fame. The same year&mdash;either on account of his health or, less probably, from fear of Sulla&mdash;he went to Greece and the East to continue his studies; for at that time such a journey was like "going to Europe" among us. He visited the greatest orators, rhetoricians, and philosophers of the East, especially at Rhodes, then a seat of the highest culture. After an absence of two years, he returned to Rome, with an improved style of oratory, and again engaged in law cases, in which he had as opponents his two great rivals Hortensius and Cotta.  </p></div3>
<div3 type="section" n="2"><head>From the quaestorship in Sicily to the consulship (<dateRange from="-75" to="-64"><date value="-75">B.C. 75</date>-64</dateRange>)</head>
<p>In <date value="-76">B.C. 76</date> Cicero began his political career, becoming candidate for the quaestorship (the lowest grade of the <foreign lang="la">cursus honorum</foreign>), <note anchored="yes">See p. <ref n="p. lix" targOrder="U">lix</ref>.</note>	 while Cotta was candidate for the consulship and Hortensius for the praetorship. All three were elected, and Cicero's lot <note anchored="yes">See p. <ref n="p. lix" targOrder="U">lix</ref>.</note> assigned him to the province of Sicily under Sextus Peducaeus. It was in this administration that his ability and honesty gained the favor of the Sicilians, which gave him the great opportunity of his life in the impeachment of Verres, in <date value="-70">B.C. 70</date>. <note anchored="yes">See pp. 26-28, below.</note> This prosecution he undertook in the interests of his own ambition, in spite of the fact that the  <pb n="xvii"/> Senate was as a class on the side of the accused, who was also supported by many of the most influential men of the state. But it was, on the other hand, a popular cause, and many of the most decent of the nobility favored it. The orator's success, by force of talent and honest industry, against the tricks of Verres and his counsel Hortensius broke the domination of this rival in the courts, <note anchored="yes">See p. 303, below.</note> and made Cicero the first advocate of his time.
</p>
<p>In <date value="-69">B.C. 69</date> Cicero became curule aedile, and in <date value="-67">B.C. 67</date> he was elected praetor with great unanimity. In the latter year began the agitation for the Manilian Law, <note anchored="yes">See p. 66, below.</note> by his advocacy of which Cicero endeared himself to the people and gained the favor of Pompey, whose powerful support was a kind of bulwark against the envious and exclusive nobility. In his praetorship (<date value="-66">B.C. 66</date>) he was allotted to the presidency of the Court for Extortion,  <note anchored="yes">See p. lxv, N.1</note> and in this, as in all his public offices, he was honest and unselfish. During all these years he had continued his career as an advocate, engaging in such cases as seemed likely to extend his political influence and advance him most rapidly in the regular succession of curule offices. After his praetorship he refused a province <note anchored="yes">See p. <ref n="p. lxi" targOrder="U">lxi</ref>.</note> in order to remain at home and canvass for his consulship.  </p></div3>
<div3 type="section" n="3"><head>Consulship (<date value="-63">B.C. 63</date>).</head>
<p>For the consulship of <date value="-63">B.C. 63</date> there were six candidates, but of these only Cicero, Catiline, and C. Antonius were prominent. The contest was not merely one of personal ambition. The first and second conspiracies of Catiline, as well as his notorious character, could have left no doubt that his aims were treasonable. Antonius had combined with him for mutual support in securing election by illegal means, and was himself a weak and <pb n="xviii"/> unprincipled man. On the other hand, Cicero was a <foreign lang="la">novus homo</foreign>, <note anchored="yes">See p. 50, below.</note> a champion of the <foreign lang="la">equites</foreign> (though without being an enemy of the senatorial order), and had had an unusually clean record in his office as well as in the Forum. Thus the cause of Cicero's ambition was, at the same time, the cause of good government against both the worthless and debauched members of the senatorial order on the one hand, and the dregs of the people on the other. It was also the cause of the great middle class against the patricians and the official nobility, who were so entrenched in power that for many years no <foreign lang="la">novus homo</foreign> had been elected consul. The success of Cicero unquestionably prolonged the existence of the already doomed republic. Antonius, the less dangerous of his two rivals, was elected as his colleague.
</p>
<p>Cicero had now reached the goal for which he had striven from his earliest youth. His administration is famous for the overthrow of the Catilinarian conspiracy, which has cast into obscurity all his other consular acts. These, however, were of such a character, in relation to the needs of the times, as to be unimportant. By birth an <foreign lang="la">eques</foreign>, but by virtue of his offices a member of the senatorial order, Cicero had always been eager to reconcile and unite these, the two upper classes in Roman society and politics. <note anchored="yes">On the strife between the Senate and the <foreign lang="la">equites</foreign>, see p. <ref n="ag cic. p. lxv" targOrder="U">lxv</ref>.</note> He failed to see that the real needs of the commonwealth, as well as its real strength, centred in the interests of the common people. His association with Pompey, and his own rise in official rank, made him incline more and more to the side of the Senate, and he seems to have thought it his mission to restore that body, now thoroughly effete, to its former purity and political importance. The minor acts of his administration <note anchored="yes">Such were his opposition to the agrarian law proposed by the tribune Rullus, his support of the <foreign lang="la">Lex Roscia</foreign>, which gave the <foreign lang="la">equites</foreign> fourteen rows of seats in the theatre, and his laws against bribery at elections.</note> were dictated by such sentiments as these,  <pb n="xix"/>  and are significant only as illustrating his character and opinions.
</p>
<p>The history of Catiline's conspiracy is given in the Introduction to the four Orations against Catiline, <note anchored="yes">See pp. 98, 113, 126, 141, below.</note> and need not be repeated here. The conspirators were completely thwarted, and five of them were, in accordance with a resolution of the Senate, put to death by the consul without a trial. This victory was the climax of Cicero's career, and he always regarded it as one of the greatest of human achievements. In fact, however, it marked the beginning of his downfall.  </p></div3>
<div3 type="section" n="4"><head>Consulship to Banishment (<dateRange from="-63" to="-58"><date value="-63">B.C. 63</date>-58</dateRange>).</head>
<p>The execution of the conspirators without the forms of law was a blunder, and grievously did Cicero answer for it. He had distinctly violated the constitution, and thus he had laid himself open to the attacks of his enemies. At the end of his consulate, one of the tribunes, Q. Metellus Nepos, prevented him from making the customary speech to the people "because he had put to death Roman citizens without a trial." The next year, when he was defending P. Sulla, the accuser (L. Torquatus) upbraided him as a tyrant, "the third foreign king of Rome." A year later P. Clodius <note anchored="yes">For the character of Clodius, see p. 169, below.</note> began to speak of him in the same terms. Clodius, indeed, continued to pursue him till he accomplished his banishment and the confiscation of his property. Almost the whole time from his consulship till the year of his banishment was spent in seeking support against his enemies. He attached himself more closely to Pompey, and pleaded causes of all kinds to win friends, but his efforts were useless.
</p>
<p>In <date value="-60">B.C. 60</date> Roman politics took a turn extremely unfavorable to Cicero. Pompey, who on his return from the East had been  <pb n="xx"/> unfairly treated by the extreme senatorial party, allied himself with the democratic leaders, Caesar and Crassus, in a coalition often called the First Triumvirate. As a result, the Senate became for a time almost powerless, and everything was in the hands of the popular party. The next year, Caesar, as consul, procured the passage of an iniquitous law for dividing the fertile and populous territory of Campania among needy citizens of Rome. Cicero refused to serve on the board appointed to execute this law. Thus he not only exasperated the mob, but brought down upon himself the resentment of the triumvirs,who, though two of them, Caesar and Pompey, still professed to be his personal friends, refused to protect him against the attacks of his enemies. Accordingly, in <date value="-58">B.C. 58</date>, Clodius, then tribune, <note anchored="yes">In order to be eligible for this oflice, Clodius, by birth a patrician, had procured his adoption into a plebeian family. His express purpose in the whole transaction was to accomplish the ruin of Cicero. For the cause of his animosity, see note on Defence of Milo, sect. 13 (<ref n="pl176.14" targOrder="U">p. 176, l. 14</ref>).</note> brought forward a law that whoever had put to death a Roman citizen, without trial, "should be denied the use of fire and water" (the Roman formula for banishment). This bill was obviously aimed at Cicero's action in the case of the Catilinarians. Cicero at once took alarm, and after appealing in vain to the consuls of the year, L. Calpurnius Piso and A. Gabinius, as well as to Pompey, left Rome about March 20, just as the affair was coming to blows. Immediately after his departure, Clodius procured the passage of a special bill against him, forbidding him, by name, the use of fire or water anywhere within four hundred miles of Rome. At the same time his house on the Palatine <note anchored="yes">see note on Cat. 1., sect. 1, <ref n="pl99.4" targOrder="U">p. 99, l. 4</ref>.</note> and his Tusculan <note anchored="yes">Cf. note on Plunder of Syracuse, sect. 12, <ref n="pl54.27" targOrder="U">p. 54, l. 27</ref>.</note> villa were pillaged and destroyed by a mob. Upon receiving news of these proceedings, Cicero prepared to leave Italy altogether. He embarked from Brundisium, April 29, and arrived at Thessaonica  <pb n="xxi"/> on the 23d of May. <note anchored="yes">For the exact chronology of Cicero's flight, see C. L. Smith, <title>Harvard Studies in Classical Philology</title>, VII. 65 ff.</note> Here he remained as the guest of his friend Plancius, then quaestor of Macedonia, until November, when he removed to Dyrrachium. His friends at Rome were constantly agitating for his recall, but without success.
</p>
<p>The next year, however, <date value="-57">B.C. 57</date>, it suited the designs of Pompey, then once more inclining to the senatorial party, to allow his return. His influence with the nobility as well as with the equestrian order, was a point to be secured in the great game of politics. On the 1st of January, the consul L. Cornelius Lentulus Spinther brought forward a bill for his recall. This was vetoed by a tribune. Other attempts were made by his friends, which resulted only in riot and disorder. Finally, partly through the efforts of T. Annius Milo, who met the violence of Clodius with opposing violence, partly through the partisanship of Pompey and the Senate, which brought to the city the citizens of the <foreign lang="la">Municipia</foreign> and the Italian colonies ("the country members"), <note anchored="yes">See p. <ref n="p. liii" targOrder="U">liii</ref>.</note> a law was passed, Aug. 4, <date value="-57">B.C. 57</date>, revoking the decree of exile. Cicero arrived in Rome September 4. His journey through Italy was like a continuous triumphal procession, and to his exalted imagination, freedom, which had departed with him, was now returned to Rome. But in fact his restoration had been merely a piece of selfish policy on the part of the great leaders. He remained the most consummate rhetorician of all time, but his prominence in the state was gone forever. He had never been a statesman, and now he had not the chance to be even a politician.  </p></div3>
<div3 type="section" n="5"><head>From Cicero's recall to the breaking out of the Civil War (<dateRange from="-56" to="-49"><date value="-56">B.C. 56</date>-49</dateRange>).</head> <pb n="xxii"/>
<p>Upon his return he delivered two famous speeches <note anchored="yes"><title>Post Reditum</title>: 1. (<title>in Senatu</title>); 2. (<title>ad Quirites</title>).</note> (one in the Senate and one before the people), in which he thanked the state for restoring him, and lauded Pompey to the skies. The "triumvirs" were still all-powerful at Rome, and Cicero, like the rest, was forced to conform to their wishes and designs. In this same year he proposed a measure which gave Pompey extraordinary powers over the provincial grain market, for the purpose of securing the city against scarcity of provisions. Next year (<date value="-56">B.C. 56</date>) he spoke strongly in favor of continuing Caesar's proconsular authority in Gaul. <note anchored="yes">See the oration <title>De Consularibus Provinciis</title>.</note> With Crassus, the third "triumvir," Cicero had never been on good terms, but, at the request of the other two triumvirs, he became reconciled with him in <date value="-55">B.C. 55</date>, shortly before the latter set out on his fatal expedition against the Parthians.
</p>
<p>During these years, becoming less and less important in politics, Cicero began to devote himself more to literature, and wrote the <title>De Oratore</title>, the <title>Republic</title>, and the treatise <title>De Legibus</title>. He also continued his activity at the bar on his own behalf and that of his friends, as well as at the request of the powerful leaders. He secured the restoration of his property, <note anchored="yes"><title>Pro Domo Sua</title> (<date value="-57">B.C. 57</date>).</note> and defended Sestius, <note anchored="yes"><title>Pro P. Sestio</title>, on a charge of assault (<date value="-56">B.C. 56</date>).</note> who had been active in his recall. Toward the end of this period he also defended Milo for the murder of Clodius. <note anchored="yes"><date value="-52">B.C. 52</date>. For the circumstances, see pp. 169, 170, below.</note> His defence of Gabinius and Vatinius (<date value="-54">B.C. 54</date>), creatures of Pompey and Caesar respectively, was less honorable to him; but he was hardly a free agent in these matters. "I am distressed," he writes to his brother Quintus, "I am <pb n="xxiii"/> distressed that there is no longer any government nor any courts, and that this time of my life, which ought to be brilliant with the prestige of a Senator, is either worn out in the labors of the Forum, or made endurable by literature at home. Of my enemies, some I do not oppose, and others I even defend. I am not only not free to think as I will, but not even to hate as I will." <note anchored="yes"><title>Ad Quintum Fratrem</title>, iii. 5 (6).</note></p>
<p>The disturbances following the death of Clodius led to the appointment of Pompey as consul without colleague <note anchored="yes">See p. 170, below.</note> (practically dictator), in <date value="-52">B.C. 52</date>. One of his acts was to pass a law postponing the provincial administration of consuls and praetors until five years after their year of office. The interval was to be filled by such former magistrates as had never held a province. Among these was Cicero, who therefore had to submit to the lot. He drew Cilicia, in which an inroad of the Parthians was expected.
</p>
<p>About May I, <date value="-51">B.C. 51</date>, he set out for this province. His administration was in accord with the principles expressed in his writings,&mdash;clean and honest,&mdash;a thing worthy of notice in an age of corruption and greed. He had the good fortune to escape the test of a formidable war, but he was successful in overcoming some tribes of plundering mountaineers. For this he was hailed as imperator, according to custom, and he even hoped for the honor of a triumph, the highest conventional distinction which a Roman could obtain. He returned to Rome late in <date value="-50">B.C. 50</date>, and was still endeavoring to secure permission to celebrate his triumph <note anchored="yes">These efforts were unsuccessful.</note> when the great Civil War between Caesar and Pompey broke out (<date value="-49">B.C. 49</date>). </p></div3>
<div3 type="section" n="6"><head>From the beginning of the Civil War to the Murder of Caesar (<dateRange from="-49" to="-44"><date value="-49">B.C. 49</date>-44</dateRange>).</head> <pb n="xxiv"/>
<p>Cicero was now in a very difficult position. It became necessary for every man of importance to take sides; yet he could not see his way clear to join either party. For some time he vacillated, while both Caesar and Pompey made earnest efforts to secure his support. His great hope was to mediate between them; and, after Pompey had left Italy, he remained behind with this end in view. Finally, however, he decided for Pompey as the champion of the senatorial party, and set out, though with great reluctance, to join him at Dyrrachium (June 11, <date value="-49">B.C. 49</date>). In the camp he found things even worse than he had expected, and he gave up the cause of the Republic for lost. <note anchored="yes">See the passages from Cicero's letters quoted in note to <title>The Pardon of Marcellus</title>, sect. 16 (<ref n="pl219.4" targOrder="U">p. 219, l. 4</ref>).</note> On account of illness he was not present at the Battle of Pharsalia (Aug. 9, <date value="-48">B.C. 48</date>). After the fate of the contest was decided, he refused to continue the struggle or to follow the adherents of the lost cause to Africa, but returned to Italy (September, <date value="-48">B.C. 48</date>), to make terms with the conqueror. He remained at Brundisium until Caesar's return from Egypt in September, <date value="-47">B.C. 47</date>, when he at once sought an interview. Caesar received him with great kindness and respect, and allowed him once more to return to Rome.
</p>
<p>From this time until the assassination of Caesar in <date value="-44">B.C. 44</date>, Cicero remained for the most part in retirement at his Tusculan villa, absorbed in literary pursuits, though in <date value="-46">B.C. 46</date> he delivered his <title>Oration for Marcellus</title> <note anchored="yes">See pp.213 ff., below.</note> (remarkable for its praise of Caesar), and his <title>Defence of Ligarius</title>, <note anchored="yes">See pp. 225 ff., below.</note> and, in the following year, his <title>Defence of King Deiotarus of Galatia</title>, charged with attempting the murder of Caesar. The chief literary fruits of this period of leisure were three works on oratory (<title>De Claris Oratoribus</title>, <pb n="xxv"/> <title>Orator</title>, and <title>De Partitione Oratoria</title>), and several philosophic works (<title>De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum</title>, <title>Academica</title>, <title>Tuscalanae Quaestiones</title>, <title>De Natura Deorum</title>, <title>De Senectute</title>): Meantime his domestic relations were far from happy. In <date value="-46">B.C. 46</date> he had divorced his wife Terentia and married his rich young ward Publilia, from whom, however, he separated in the following year. In <date value="-45">B.C. 45</date> his daughter Tullia died suddenly. Cicero was tenderly attached to her, and it was in part as a distraction from his grief that he wrote some of the works just mentioned. He now seemed to be thoroughly given over to a life of dignified literary retirement, when the murder of Caesar (March 15, <date value="-44">B.C. 44</date>) once more plunged the state into a condition of anarchy.  </p></div3>
<div3 type="section" n="7"><head>From the Murder of Caesar to the Death of Cicero (<dateRange from="-44" to="-43"><date value="-44">B.C. 44</date>-43</dateRange>)</head>
<p>Though Cicero had no share in the conspiracy against Caesar, his sympathy was counted on by Brutus and Cassius, and he hailed the death of the Dictator as the restoration of the republic. But the conspirators had made no adequate provision for carrying on the government, and Cicero soon felt that his hopes were doomed to disappointment. Bitterly chagrined by the disorderly scenes that followed, he retired once more to the country. <note anchored="yes">About this time were written the <title>De Divinatione</title>, <title>De Fato</title>, <title>De Amicitia</title> and <title>De Officiis</title>.</note> and in July, <date value="-44">B.C. 44</date>, set out for a journey to Greece, but, changing his plans in consequence of better news from Rome, he returned to the city in the following month. The chief power was now in the hands of the surviving consul, Mark Antony, whose principal rival was Octavianus (afterwards the Emperor Augustus), Caesar's adopted son. <note anchored="yes">For further details see Introduction to the <title>Fourteenth Philippic</title>, pp 239-241, below.</note> Cicero appeared <pb n="xxvi"/> again in the Senate and began his celebrated series of orations against Antony with the First Philippic (Sept. 2). Once more he took an active part in politics, apparently assuming his old position as leader, and speaking with all the charm and effectiveness of his earlier days. But he had fallen upon evil times; arms could no longer yield to the gown, and it soon became clear that there could be no peace except by the complete victory of a single aspirant for the supremacy.
</p>
<p>Octavianus at first joined with the Senate against Antony, but he soon broke with the constitutional authorities, and, in <date value="-43">B.C. 43</date>, formed with Antony and Lepidus the coalition known as the Second Triumvirate. A merciless proscription at once began. Octavianus had every reason to be grateful to Cicero, but he was of a cold and ungenerous nature, and when Antony demanded his death he made no objection. Cicero's name was accordingly placed on the list of proscribed citizens. Cicero was at this time at his Tusculan villa. He made a half-hearted attempt to escape from Italy, but was overtaken near his villa at Formiae by the soldiers of the triumvirs, and met his death with firmness (Dec. 7, <date value="-43">B.C. 43</date>). Antony satisfied his hatred by indignities to the mangled remains.
</p>
<p>The career of Cicero is a remarkable example of a sudden rise, followed by an utter collapse and fall. His rise was the natural result of his own ability, industry, and ambition; his fall was as naturally caused by his defects, coupled with his good qualities,&mdash;a mixture that produced a certain weakness of character. Had he been less timid or less scrupulous, or, on the other hand, had he been more far-sighted, he might have remained on the pedestal to which he was proud to have raised himself and on which he was ambitious to stand. But the times needed a different kind of man, and others, far less worthy, but able and willing to cope with the contending forces in the state, supplanted him. One quality was particularly instrumental both in his rise and his fall. He excelled in forcible <pb n="xxvii"/> and witty abuse. He dearly loved a bitter jest, and he lived among a people that were constitutionally inclined to abusive language. No doubt it was this talent for invective that made him popular when it happened to be directed in accordance with the people's taste. But it also alienated his friends, and embittered his enemies. He was called a <title>Scurra</title> and a Cynic, and it was perhaps a pun that cost him the favor of Octavianus; certainly it was his abuse of Antony and Fulvia that cost him his life. But he was the first orator of all time, a literary worker of the rarest gifts, and according to his lights a lover and servant of the state.  </p></div3>

<div2 type="chapter" n="2"><head>Roman Oratory.</head>
<p>From the earliest times of which we have historical knowledge, up to the establishment of the Empire as the result of Civil War, the constitution of Rome was republican, in so far that all laws were passed and all magistrates elected by a vote of all the citizens. The principle of "representation," however, which to us seems inseparable from republican institutions, was unknown to the Romans. All laws were passed, and all officers were elected, at what we should call a mass meeting of the entire body of citizens, convened at the central seat of government. The absence of newspapers, also, made a distinct difference between ancient political conditions and those of our own times. Conversation and public addresses were the only means of disseminating political ideas. And even the scope of public addresses was much limited; for meetings could be called by a magistrate only, and could be addressed by only such persons as the presiding magistrate would permit. Obviously, under such a regime, public speaking, which even now has a distinct potency in state affairs, must have been far more efficacious as a political instrument than it is today.
</p>
<p>To this must be added the fact that under Roman polity <pb n="xxxv"/> the only means of social advancement was success in a political career. The Senate, the Roman peerage (see p. <ref n="p. l" targOrder="U">l</ref>), consisted practically only of persons who had been elected to one or more of the three graded magistracies, quaestorship, praetorship, consulship (the <foreign lang="la">cursus honorum</foreign>: see p.<ref n="p. liv" targOrder="U">liv</ref>). Hence every ambitious Roman, of high or low estate, had to become a politician and follow the regular course of office-holding. The curule magistrates were at once generals, judges, and statesmen. To achieve success, therefore, a politician had to show ability in all of these directions. Occasionally, to be sure, a man succeeded by virtue of a single talent,&mdash;like Marius, who owed his advancement solely to his valor and military skill; but such instances were rare. Next to military fame, the strongest recommendation to the favor of the people was oratorical ability. Then, as now, the orator's power to move the multitude in public affairs was the readiest means of advancement. Further, political prosecutions, and private suits prompted by political motives, were of the commonest occurrence, and these afforded an eloquent advocate abundant opportunity to make himself known and to secure the favor of large bodies of supporters. Again, the Senate was a numerous and somewhat turbulent body, always more or less divided in a partisan sense; and, though it had no legislative functions, it still exercised a very strong influence on politics. To be able to sway this large assembly by force of oratory was of great moment to an aspiring Roman. Finally, though the contention for office ceased with the consulship, there still continued among the consulares, who formed almost a distinct class in society and public life, a vehement rivalry to be regarded as the leading man in the state.
<note anchored="yes">See p. 473, below (note on <ref n="pl248.13" targOrder="U">p. 248, l. 13</ref>).
</note> For all these reasons, the art of oratory was perhaps more highly esteemed and of greater practical value in the later period of the Roman Republic than at any other time in the history of the world. <pb n="xxxvi"/></p>
<p>But even from the very establishment of the commonwealth, oratory was highly prized, and Cicero gives a long roll of distinguished orators from the First Secession of the Plebs (<date value="-494">B.C. 494</date>) to his own time. The most eminent of those whose art was still uninfluenced by Greek rhetoric, was Cato the Censor (died <date value="-149">B.C. 149</date>), who may be called the last of the natural Roman orators. His speeches are lost, but more than a hundred and fifty of them were known to Cicero, who praises them as <foreign lang="la">acutae</foreign>, <foreign lang="la">elegantes</foreign>, <foreign lang="la">facetae</foreign>, <foreign lang="la">breves</foreign>.
</p>
<p>It was in Cato's lifetime that the introduction of Greek art and letters into Rome took place; and oratory, like all other forms of literature, felt the new influence at once. The oration, though still valued most for its effectiveness, soon came to be looked on as an artistic work as well. The beginning of this tendency is seen in Ser. Sulpicius Galba (cons. <date value="-144">B.C. 144</date>) and M. Lepidus (consul <date value="-137">B.C. 137</date>). Galba, in the words of Cicero, "was the first of the Latins to employ the peculiar arts of the orator,&mdash;digressions to introduce ornament, the art of captivating the minds of his hearers, of moving them with passion, of exaggerating a case, of appealing to pity, and the art of introducing coinmonplaces.
<note anchored="yes">That is, digressions on general subjects which would fit any particular oration when a point of the kind arose.
</note> It was in Lepidus, however, that the full effect of Greek art first manifested itself, not to such a degree as to destroy originality, but sufficiently to foster native talent and develope a truly national school of speaking. Cicero, who had many of his orations, declares that he was "the first Roman orator to show Greek smoothness and the unity of the period."
<note anchored="yes">For the Latin period, see p. <ref n="p. xlvi" targOrder="U">xlvi</ref>.
</note> His influence was particularly felt by C. Papirius Carbo (consul <date value="-120">B.C. 120</date>), the best advocate of his time, Tiberius Gracchus, the illustrious tribune, and Caius Gracchus, his younger brother. Of the last mentioned, Cicero speaks with great admiration as a man "of <pb n="xxxvii"/> surpassing genius" and of unequalled excellence,  whose early death was a heavy loss to Latin literature.
<note anchored="yes" n="1"> A little fragment of one of his speeches became classic at Rome and used to be learned by heart. " Wretched man that I am! Whither shall I go ? In what direction shall I turn? To the Capitol? But it is reeking with the blood of my brother. To my home? To see there my mother crushed with grief and lamentation?"&mdash;"These words," says Cicero, "were delivered in such a way, by the help of eyes, voice, and gesture, that even his enemies could not restrain their tears."
</note></p>
<p>In the generation immediately preceding Cicero, in which oratory was enthusiastically cultivated and carried to a high pitch of perfection, two figures tower above all others, Marcus Antonius (the grandfather of Mark Antony) and L. Crassus. Both were Cicero's masters in his youth,
<note anchored="yes">See p. <ref n="p. xiv" targOrder="U">xiv</ref>.
</note> and he finds it hard to prefer one to the other; but, on the whole, he seems to regard Crassus as the greater orator. " The lofty earnestness and dignity of his nature were relieved by the brightest humor and the wittiest vein of genius. His diction was as choice and elegant as it was free and unaffected, and with the mastery of tasteful exposition he united the clearest logical development of thought."
<note anchored="yes">Cicero's testimony, as summed up by Piderit.</note></p>
<p>Crassus appears in the <title>De Oratore</title> as the exponent of Cicero's own views of the aim, function, appointments, and preparation of the orator. To Crassus the orator was no mere handicraftsman, confined to manipulating juries and popular assemblies, but statesman and philosopher as well, requiring for his equipment all the knowledge that could be gained on the highest subjects that interest mankind. He was himself familiar with all the ancient systems of philosophy as expounded by the wise from Plato to Diodorus, and had discussed the nature and functions of oratory with the philosophers of his time in person at Athens. This ideal of the orator, contrasted with Cato's definition <foreign lang="la">vir bonus dicendi peritus</foreign>, shows the <pb n="xxxviii"/> advance of the art as such between the earliest times and those of Cicero.
</p>
<p>Yet in the Roman orations, addressed as they were to an intensely practical people, matter had always been more attended to than manner, effective force than artistic elegance. Even Cicero himself, in his public addresses, conceals, and even disparages, his knowledge of Greek art, philosophy, and literature. But in his time the study of oratory as an art began to be pursued for a definite end,&mdash;the acquiring of a distinct style. And in this study two different styles offered themselves to the choice of the aspiring young Roman,&mdash;namely, the <emph>Asiatic</emph> and the <emph>Attic</emph>.
</p>
<p>The precise difference between the two styles cannot be exactly determined; but from the middle of the first century B.C., both were advocated and practiced by enthusiastic partisans in a controversy like that between realism and romanticism, or Wagnerism and classicism.
</p>
<p>It would seem, in a general way, that Atticism stood for directness, force, and naturalness, while Asiaticism (or Asianism) represented display and affectation in all its forms. Cicero says in one place (Brutus, 95, 325), "The styles of Asiatic oratory are two,&mdash;one epigrammatic and pointed, full of fine ideas which are not so weighty and serious as neat and graceful; the other with not so many sententious ideas, but voluble and hurried in its flow of language, and marked by an ornamented and elegant diction." From these hints, as well as from the practice of imperial times (in which this style had full sway), we may gather that the "Asiatic" orators sought the applause of the audience and a reputation for smartness, and were overstrained and artificial.
<note anchored="yes">This Asiatic oratory was the decayed development of the highly ornamented style cultivated by Isocrates (<dateRange from="-436" to="-338"><date value="-436">B.C. 436</date>-338</dateRange>).</note></p>
<p>About Cicero's time a reaction had set in, and a school had <pb n="xxxix"/> arisen which called itself <emph>Attic</emph>, and attempted to return to the simplicity of Xenophon and Lysias. But in avoiding the Eastern exaggeration, it had fallen into a meagreness and baldness very different from the direct force of Demosthenes. Probably this tendency was really no more sincere than the other, for both styles alike aimed to excite the admiration of the hearer rather than to influence his mind or feelings by the effective presentation of ideas.
</p>
<p>Hortensius, the great contemporary and rival of Cicero, was a special example of the Asiatic school. He was a somewhat effeminate person, with a dandified air both in composition and delivery. "His voice," we read, "was resonant and sweet, his motions and gestures had even more art than is suitable for an orator."
<note anchored="yes">Brutus, xcv, 326.</note></p>
<p>The extreme Attic school was represented by C. Licinius Calvus.
<note anchored="yes">Born May 28, <date value="-82">B.C. 82</date>; died before <date value="-47">B.C. 47</date>.</note> "Though he handled his style with knowledge and good taste," writes Cicero, "yet being too critical of himself" and fearing to acquire unhealthy force, he lost even real vitality. Accordingly, his speaking, repressed by too great scrupulousness, was brilliant to the learned and those who listened to him attentively, but by the crowd and the Forum it was swallowed like a pill."
<note anchored="yes">Brutus, lxxxii, 284.</note></p>
<p>It is important to settle Cicero's own position in this contest. He himself fancied that he followed the true and best form of Atticism. We see by his oratorical works that his ideas were formed on the best models; that he was familiar with all the rhetorical systems of the Greeks of the best period, and fully appreciated all the excellencies of the earlier Roman orators, as well as the simplicity and directness of Demosthenes. But taste had declined, and everything had to be overdone to satisfy the public. Cicero seems to have taken a   <pb n="xl"/>  middle course, following the style of the <foreign lang="la">Rhodian</foreign> school, a branch or outgrowth of the Asiatic, with strong Attic tendencies. It professed to abhor the luxuriance and affectation of Asianism and to aim at the old directness and true feeling; but Cicero was assailed in his own time for exaggeration, false pathos, and artificial rhetoric, such as were characteristic of Asianism.   Nor could we expect anything else.  He could not restore a style which the age could not appreciate, nor rise to a height for which his native genius was insufficient. With him, however, Latin oratory reached the acme of its development.
</p>
<p>Immediately after Cicero, came the Empire with its suppression of free thought, and in this the extreme style of Asiatic exaggeration and posing became the rage.  Many literary men endeavored to stem this tide, but in vain.  The younger Pliny attempted to take Cicero as his model, but the only oration of his that we possess is merely a fulsome rhetorical exercise. Quintilian wrote a treatise on the education of the orator, full of sound learning and good sense. Oratory was the favorite study of all literary men, and even emperors entered the lists to contend for pre-eminence.  But "art for art's sake" had become the aim in literature generally; and oratory, now divorced from real feeling, could not but end in affected brilliancy and false emotion, such as mark all we know of later Roman work.
</p>
<p>Before the Romans came into contact with Greek oratory, that art had been reduced to a very elaborate and even pedantic science.  All the principles by which a public speaker could proceed had been formulated into rules which even to this day, with or without the speaker's knowledge, guide all discussion.  Without going into the minute details of the system, one may well notice the scientific principles which had been carefully mastered by Cicero, and which formed the basis of his skill as an orator. <pb n="xli"/></p>
<p>Naturally the first matter to be attended to was the settlement of the question at issue (<foreign lang="la">constitutio causae</foreign>).  As the ancient science of rhetoric had to do with discourse of every kind, all questions that might arise were divided into two classes: those whose discussion was directed to acquiring knowledge merely (<foreign lang="la">quaestiones cognitionis</foreign>), and those directed to determining what action should be taken as the result of the enquiry (<foreign lang="la">quaestiones actionis</foreign>).  With the former we have nothing to do here. They are confined to philosophical discussion only, and the orations of Cicero are all on practical subjects.
</p>
<p>The practical questions included under the <foreign lang="la">quaestiones actionis</foreign> were of several different kinds: they might be judicial questions coming before some form of court (<foreign lang="la">genus judiciale</foreign>); they might be deliberative and come before an assembly or senate (<foreign lang="la">genus deliberativum</foreign>); or they might be questions of praise or blame in reference to some particular person or act not under judicial investigation (<foreign lang="la">genus demanstrativum</foreign>).  The last class would include eulogies and the like.
</p>
<p>The oration itself had also its divisions, which were established particularly in regard to the <foreign lang="la">genus judiciale</foreign> as the most important of the three kinds.  The <foreign lang="la">exordium</foreign> contained necessary preliminary remarks and the approach to the subject. The <foreign lang="la">narratio</foreign> gave the facts on which the argument was founded.  The <foreign lang="la">propositia</foreign> was the statement of the theme or view to be maintained, and often contained a <foreign lang="la">partitio</foreign> or division of the proposition.  The <foreign lang="la">argumentatio</foreign> embraced the <foreign lang="la">confirmatio</foreign> or arguments for the main thesis, and the <foreign lang="la">confutatio</foreign> (<foreign lang="la">refutatio</foreign>) or refutation of real or supposed arguments of the opponent.  The address ended with the <foreign lang="la">peroratio</foreign>, the place for such application of the argument, or appeal to the hearers, or general remarks, as were suitable to the occasion. Naturally, as the art of speaking came before the science, and was at all times more or less free from scientific trammels, these divisions
<pb n="xlii"/>
could not well cover the whole ground, and each of them was accordingly subdivided into several smaller parts, which varied according to the character of the oration.  Thus the <foreign lang="la">exordium</foreign> contained a <foreign lang="la">principium</foreign> and an <foreign lang="la">insinuatio</foreign> (the suggestions to be made in order to gain the favorable attention of the hearer), and all the various forms of proof had their place as well as their names in the <foreign lang="la">confirmatio</foreign>.  Even the main divisions are not all clearly marked, but generally they can be made out in Cicero's speeches.  For examples, see the summary and the running analysis of each oration in the notes.
</p>
<p>With the same particularity were the necessary duties of the orator divided, and furnished each with its technical name: <foreign lang="la">inventio</foreign>, the gathering of material; <foreign lang="la">dispositio</foreign>, the arrangement; <foreign lang="la">elocutio</foreign>, the suitable expression in language; <foreign lang="la">memoria</foreign>, the committing to memory; <foreign lang="la">actio</foreign>, the delivery.  Under each of these, again, was a body of lore with its technical phrases. <foreign lang="la">Elocutio</foreign> embraced the whole doctrine of what we should call <emph>style</emph>, and the use of all rhetorical devices, ornaments (<foreign lang="la">lumina</foreign>), and forms of speech. So that no science was ever more completely digested and labelled than this of oratory.
</p>
<p>Of the orations in the present edition, <title>Roscius</title>, <title>Verres</title>, <title>Archias</title>, <title>Milo</title>, and <title>Ligarius</title> belong purely to the <title>genus judiciale</title>; the <title>Manilian Law</title> and the four <title>Orations against Catiline</title> belong to the <title>genus deliberativum</title>; the <title>Thirteenth Philippic</title> belongs, in the first part, to the <foreign lang="la">genus deliberativum</foreign>, but in the eulogy on the generals and their soldiers it gives a specimen of the <foreign lang="la">genus demonstrativum</foreign>; and the <title>Marcellus</title> belongs almost entirely to this last class. </p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="3"><head>Cicero as an Orator.</head> <pb n="xliii"/>
<p>Cicero's success as an orator was due more than anything else to his skill in effectively presenting the strong points of a case and cleverly covering the weak ones.  For this he had extraordinary natural  talents, increased by very  diligent study and practice, and never, even in his greatest success, did he relax the most careful study of his cases to this end. Attention is called throughout the notes to his felicities in this branch of his art, which, because it is not strictly literary, is likely to be overlooked, and all the more because such art must always be carefully concealed.  It is sufficient, however, to call attention to it here generally, referring the student to the notes for details.
</p>
<p>On the literary side of oratory, Cicero's only rival is Demosthenes, to whom he is superior in everything except moral earnestness and the power that comes from it, a quality which belongs to the man rather than the orator.  Teuffel (<title>Gesch. der Röm. lit.</title>) ascribes to him an extraordinary activity of intellect, a lively imagination, quickness and warmth of feeling, a marvellous sense of form, an inexhaustible fertility of expression, an incisive and diverting wit, with the best physical advantages.  As to his "form," he speaks of it as "clear, choice, clean, copious, appropriate, attractive, tasteful, and harmonious."  The whole range of tones from light jest even to tragic vehemence was at his command, and especially did he excel in an appearance of conviction and emotion, which he increased by an impassioned delivery.  Of course he is not always at his best, but it is never safe to criticise his compositions without a careful study of the practical necessities of the occasion.
</p>

<p>Thus Cicero's style is often criticised as redundant and tautological, a criticism which must proceed either from <pb n="xliv"/> ignorance or inattention. One of the great arts of the public speaker is to keep before his audience a few points in such a way that they cannot be lost sight of.  To accomplish this, these points must be repeated as many times as possible, but with such art that the fact of repetition shall not be noticed.  Hence the same thing must often be said again and again, or else dwelt upon with a profusion of rhetoric, in order to allow time for the idea to gain a lodgement.  It was to this art that the late Rufus Choate owed his success as an advocate, though the literary critic would fain reduce his speeches to one-half their length. Literary tautology is in fact a special oratorical virtue. A spoken word you hear but once unless it is repeated, and there are things which have to be heard many times before they can have their effect.
</p>
<p>Again, apart from "repetitional" tautology, it must be remembered that the Latin language was in a sense a rude tongue, lacking in nice distinctions. Such distinctions must be wrought out by a long-continued effort to express delicate shades of thought. Hence it often becomes necessary in Latin to point the exact signification of a word or phrase capable of several meanings, either by contrasting it with its opposite, or else by adding another word which has an equally general meaning, but which, like a stereoscopic view, gives the other side of the same idea, and so rounds out and limits the vagueness of the first.  Thus the two together often produce as refined distinctions as any language which has a larger and more precise vocabulary.
</p>
<p>In the oration for the Manilian Law (<bibl n="Cic. Man. 1">1</bibl>. <bibl n="Cic. Man. 3">3</bibl>), for instance, we have <foreign lang="la">singulari eximiaque virtute</foreign>.  Here <foreign lang="la">singulari</foreign> might mean simply <emph>odd</emph> (not found in others).  This of itself is not necessarily a compliment any more than <emph>peculiar</emph> is in English, but when Cicero adds <foreign lang="la">eximia</foreign>, the two words together convey the idea that the <foreign lang="la">virtus</foreign> is not only peculiar to Pompey, but exemplary and of surpassing merit.  At the same time the two  <pb n="xlv"/>  words allow the orator to dwell longer on a point that he wishes to emphasize.
</p>
<p>In the same oration (<bibl n="Cic. Man. 5">5</bibl>. <bibl n="Cic. Man. 12">12</bibl>) the words <foreign lang="la">periculum et discrimen</foreign> occur.  In a treatise on synonyms it would be impossible to distinguish between these two, because each is very often used for the other with precisely the same meaning.  But when the two are used together, as tn this passage, they are not tautological, as would at first appear to a microscopic critic.  The first refers to the immediate moment of doubt, the question whether it (the <foreign lang="la">salus</foreign>) shall be preserved or not ; the second, to the ultimate decisive moment, which determines that doubt and finally decides.  In English we should ordinarily put the whole into one (modified) idea, and say "most dangerous crisis," or the like.  But the Latin has a habit of dividing the two parts of an idea and stating each separately.  Hence we have the figure that we call <foreign lang="la">hendiadys</foreign>, which simply means that one language, or age, states separately and coordinately what another language, or age, unites into one complex.
</p>
<p>In <foreign lang="la">gloriam . . . tueri et conservare</foreign> (the same oration, <bibl n="Cic. Man. 5">5.12</bibl>), <foreign lang="la">tueri</foreign>, the first word, refers to the action of the subject, the effort to maintain; <foreign lang="la">conservare</foreign>, the second, to the result [to be] attained, the preservation of the glory.  To complete the idea both are necessary, because from the general turn of the thought both the effort and the result are alike important.  In this way the same general idea can be artfully repeated from two different points of view without the hearer's suspecting a repetition.
</p>
<p>To such causes as these is to be attributed the frequent use of words in a manner often called tautological. </p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="4"><head>Latin and English Style.</head> <pb n="xlvi"/>
<p>Two differences between Latin and English prose are noticeable.  Latin prose is periodic in its structure ; i.e. the main idea, instead of being expressed at once, briefly followed or preceded by its modifications, all in short detached sentences (as in English), is so put as to embrace all its modifying clauses with itself in one harmonious whole. This is also done at times in formal discourse in English, but in Latin it was the prevailing style. Though this method of presentation seems to us involved, yet it is after all only an artistic elaboration of the loose parenthetical way of speaking habitual with unlettered persons, or, in other words, it simply follows the natural processes of the human mind.  But when developed it allows and stimulates an antithetic balance of thought both in sound and sense, so that each element of an idea is brought into notice by an opposing one, or is so embroidered on the level surface of the main idea or injected into it that it cannot fail to get its true effect at the instant when that effect is required.
<note anchored="yes"> See A. S. Hill's <title>Foundations of Rhetoric</title>, pp.220-222.</note></p>
<p>If we take the opening period of the oration for Roscius (p.2), the main clause is <foreign lang="la">credo ego</foreign>; the rest of the sentence is all the object of <foreign lang="la">credo</foreign> in the indirect discourse.  The main verb of the indirect discourse is <foreign lang="la">mirari</foreign> (changed from <foreign lang="la">miramini</foreign>), with <foreign lang="la">vos</foreign> in the accusative as its subject.  The object of <foreign lang="la">mirari</foreign> is the indirect question <foreign lang="la">quid sit quod</foreign>, etc., embracing all the rest (changed from a direct question <foreign lang="la">quid est quod</foreign>, etc.). Again, the subject of <foreign lang="la">sit</foreign> is all that follows, being a clause with <foreign lang="la">quod</foreign>, of which <foreign lang="la">surrexerim</foreign> is the main verb and all the other clauses are modifiers. The clause <foreign lang="la">cum . . . sedeant</foreign> is a kind of adverbial modifier of <foreign lang="la">surrexerim</foreign>, while the clause <foreign lang="la">qui . . . sim . . . comparandus</foreign> is a kind of adjective modifier of <foreign lang="la">ego</foreign> the subject of <foreign lang="la">surrexerim</foreign>, and <foreign lang="la">qui sedeant</foreign> is a kind of adjective modifier of <foreign lang="la">his</foreign>.  <pb n="xlvii"/>  <foreign lang="la">Omnes hi</foreign> etc., is an independent sentence, but is connected in thought with the preceding, and explains the fact at which the jurors are supposed to be surprised, i.e.  "I suppose you wonder", etc., "but the fact is," etc.
</p>
<p>In another sentence, the beginning of the Manilian Law, we have a good example of the antithetic balancing of one word or clause against another which marks the Latin periodic style. The sentence consists of two parts, - the first concessive, introduced by <foreign lang="la">qumquam</foreign>; the second adversative, introduced by <foreign lang="la">tamen</foreign>.  So, in the first, <foreign lang="la">conspectus</foreign> balances <foreign lang="la">locus</foreign>, which is brought into relief by <foreign lang="la">autem</foreign> ("and again"); while <foreign lang="la">ad agendum amplissimus</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">ad dicendum ornatissimus</foreign> are balanced in like manner against each othen  In the second part, the relative clause <foreign lang="la">qui. . . patuit</foreign> (virtually concessive) is, as usual, embodied in the main clause, bringing the relative as near as possible to its antecedent <foreign lang="la">aditu; voluntas</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">rationes</foreign> are set in antithesis by <foreign lang="la">sed</foreign>; while the main verb, <foreign lang="la">prohibuerunt</foreign>, comes last as usual.  The logical form of the whole is, "Though political speaking has its advantages, yet I have been prevented," etc.
</p>
<p>By stating first the leading thought (<foreign lang="la">hoc aditu</foreign>, etc.), and putting the verb at the end, Latin is able to make the main clause active, thus partly disguising the art of the antithesis.  Here, as elsewhere, it is of great help in reading to observe these two rules: (1) that Latin puts first the main idea, the key to the whole; and (2) that it constantly deals in antitheses, often forcing them when they do not naturally occur (as in <foreign lang="la">amplissimus</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">ornatissimus</foreign>), each thought or expression having its pendant, like ornaments which go in pairs.
</p>
<p>The second main difference between Latin and English prose style is that in English the emphasis gravitates towards the end, while in Latin the more emphatic word always comes first.  This is not, like the corresponding usage in English, a mere tendency, but a universal practice, which can be and is managed by the writer with exquisite skill, so that a Latin prose  <pb n="xlviii"/>  sentence bears on its face its own emphasis, giving the same effect to the eye that the best reader or speaker in English can to the ear.
</p>
<p>Thus the first paragraph of the oration for Roscius (above cited) shows its emphasis as follows: "<emph>I suppose</emph> (conceding something he will presently contradict or explain) <emph>you</emph> (who do not, as I do, know or think of the state of things) <foreign lang="la">wonder</foreign> why it is that, etc., but the fact is (implied as the antithesis of the emphatic <foreign lang="la">credo</foreign>)," etc. Again, <foreign lang="la">omnes</foreign> is emphatic, i.e.  I am not the only one, but <emph>all</emph> would speak were it not for circumstances," which he proceeds to mention.  Even <foreign lang="la">videtis</foreign> has an emphatic position:  "who, <emph>as you see</emph>, are in attendance."  Again, <foreign lang="la">putant oportere defendi</foreign> i.e.  <emph>think</emph> (though they do nothing) <emph>ought</emph> to be averted by a defence, but <emph>to make the defence themselves</emph>," etc.
</p>
<p>If we take the beginning of the oration for Milo, there is the same artistic arrangement: "Though I am <emph>afraid</emph>,
<note anchored="yes">As we might say, "I am <emph>afraid</emph> you won't like it, but I have done so and so."
</note> gentlemen, that it is not quite <emph>becoming</emph>, when I get up to speak for a <emph>very brave man</emph>, to be alarmed, and that it is <emph>particularly</emph> unbecoming, when TITUS ANNIUS himself is more alarmed for the welfare of the <emph>state</emph> than for <emph>his own</emph>, that I in his case cannot show an <emph>equally</emph> lofty spirit, nevertheless this <emph>strange</emph> form of a <emph>strange court</emph> terrifies me as I gaze on it, for <emph>wherever my eyes fall</emph> they miss the <emph>customary appearance</emph> of the Forum and the <emph>old established</emph> style of courts."
</p>
<p>It is only by attention to this feature of Latin style that the full force of the author, with all the implications, connotations, and hints, can be clearly seen.
</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="5"><head>Delivery.</head> <pb n="xlix"/>
<p>The delivery of a Latin oration was marked by a fire and force of which we have small conception. Though the Romans were an extremely dignified and formal race, yet beneath the surface they had all the violent emotions which we in modern times associate with the Mediterrannean nations.  The <foreign lang="la">actio</foreign> or delivery occupies one of the first places in ancient treatises on oratory (<foreign lang="la">actio in dicendo una dominatur</foreign>, de Or. III, lvi, 213). The range of expressed emotion was much wider than is usual with us, not only in pitch of voice and inflection of tone, but also in bodily activity, sometimes going beyond what the best orators of the time regarded as becoming.  Violent movements of the arms, stamping of the feet, changes of position, gestures of the whole body, so that sometimes the knee would touch the ground, were not infrequent.  The Latin language, however, did not have that violent and sudden stress with which we are familiar, and on which we depend for spasmodic force.  It had instead a more sustained and singing tone, capable of infinite variations. The syllabic accent, too, was very slight, and almost merged in a kind of rhythmic ictus depending on the quantity of the syllables.
</p>
<p>Hence particular attention was paid to the <foreign lang="la">numerus</foreign>, or succession of long and short syllables, so as to give, along with varying tones of emphasis, an agreeable musical cadence which is foreign to the spirit of most modern languages.  The most emphatic words were indicated by an intensity of tone throughout as in modern music, and the less emphatic, coming at the end, were pronounced with a full, rotund utterance, so as to round out the period, but with a descending stress rather than with a rising one such as we have in English.  Such a close as <foreign lang="la">temeritas fili comprobavit</foreign> was regarded as especially effective.  So <foreign lang="la">quin ejusdem hominis sit qui improbos probet</foreign> is praised by Cicero as an ideal cadence. </p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="6"><head>The Roman Constitution.</head> <pb n="l"/>
<p>In the time of Cicero the Roman "State" had technically a republican constitution, that is, every citizen had a share in the government.  But not every citizen had an equal share, partly from fixed constitutional principles, and partly from differentiations in social prominence which affected constitutional rights.
</p>
<div3 type="section" n="1"><head>Citizenship and Orders in the State.</head>
<p>Accordingly there were among Roman citizens three social (and in a manner political) ranks (<foreign lang="la">ordines</foreign>)  the Senatorial Order (<foreign lang="la">ordo senatorius</foreign>, the Equestrian Order (<foreign lang="la">ordo equestris</foreign>), and the People (<foreign lang="la">populus</foreign>, in the narrower sense).  The first two of these made up the Roman aristocracy.
</p>
<div4 type="subsect" n="1"><head>Senatorial Order.</head>
<p>The <foreign lang="la">Ordo Senotorius</foreign> was strictly speaking only another name for the Senate, the members of which, by virtue of their life tenure of office, their privileges and insignia, and their <foreign lang="fr">esprit de corps</foreign>, formed a kind of Peerage. The list of Senators, regularly numbering 300, was in early times made up by the Censors at their discretion from among those who had held high magistracies.  But after the reforms of Sulla (<date value="-80">B.C. 80</date>) every person who had held the quaestorship &mdash;the lowest grade of the regular magistracy (see below, p. <ref n="p. lix" targOrder="U">lix</ref>)  was lawfully entitled to a seat in the Senate.  This aristocracy was therefore an official or bureaucratic class. Their number fluctuated, running up to five or six hundred.
</p>
<p>Nobility, however, did not really depend on holding offices oneself, but on being descended from an ancestor who had held a curule office. <note anchored="yes">Whoever held any curule office &mdash; that is, dictator, consul, interrex, praetor, magister equitum, or curule aedile &mdash; secured to his posterity the <foreign lang="la">jus imaginum</foreign>; that is, the right to place in the hall and carry at funeral processions a wax mask of this ancestor, as well as of any other deceased members of the family of curule rank. (See Def. of Milo, sect. 33, <ref n="pl185.14" targOrder="U">p. 185, l. 14</ref>.)
</note>When any person not so descended was chosen a magistrate, he was called a <foreign lang="la">novus homo</foreign>,
<note anchored="yes">Examples are Cato the Censor, Marius, and Cicero.
</note> and, though he of course became a member of the Senatorial Order, he was not regarded as a noble.  His posterity, however, would belong to the nobility.  But such instances were very uncommon; for the Senate and the magistrates had such control over the elections that it was very difficult for any person not already a member of the nobility to be chosen to any office entitling him to enter the Senate.  Hence the Senatorial Order and the Nobility were practically identical, and "new men"  <pb n="li"/>  became necessarily identified with the class to which their posterity would belong, rather than that from which they themselves had come.  This double relation of Cicero&mdash;a member of the Senate, but sprung from the Equestrian Order&mdash;goes a great way to explain what is inconsistent and vacillating in his political career. </p></div4>
<div4 type="subsect" n="2"><head>Equestrian Order.</head>
<p>The title <foreign lang="la">Equites</foreign> was originally applied to the members of the eighteen centuries <foreign lang="la">equitum equo publico</foreign> under the Servian constitution, to whom a horse was assigned by the state, together with a certain sum of money yearly for its support, and who constituted the old Roman cavalry.  Those who served <foreign lang="la">equo publico</foreign> had to have the equestrian census,
<note anchored="yes">This requirement grew up only after the establishment of the <foreign lang="la">equites equo privato.</foreign>
</note> i.e. possess a fortune of 400,000 sesterces; and the horses were assigned by the Censors, as a rule, to the young men of senatorial families.  These <foreign lang="la">centuriae equitum</foreign> were therefore composed of young noblemen.  When they entered the Senate, they were (in the later years of the republic) obliged to give up the public horse.  Therefore, on becoming Senators, they voted in the centuries of the first class, not with the Equites (see p. <ref n="p. lv" targOrder="U">lv</ref>, below).  This aristocratic body had, however, long before Cicero's time, ceased to serve in the field; they formed a parade corps (somewhat like the Royal Guards in England), from which active officers of the legion, <foreign lang="la">tribuni militum</foreign>, were taken.
<note anchored="yes">When the Roman <foreign lang="la">equites</foreign> ceased to serve as cavalry, troops of horse were demanded of the allies; and in the time of Caesar we find that the Roman legion consisted exclusively of infantry, the cavalry being made up of such auxiliaries.
</note></p>
<p>During the time that the <foreign lang="la">equites equo publico</foreign> still served in the field as cavalry, another body grew up by their side, consisting of <foreign lang="la">equites equito privato</foreign>: that is, persons of the equestrian census (having a property of 400,000 sesterces), who had not received a horse from the state, but who volunteered with horses of their own.  This body consisted mainly of young men of wealth who did not belong to noble (that is, senatorial) families.  No very distinct line was, however, drawn between the two classes until the <foreign lang="la">Lex Judiciaria</foreign> of C. Gracchus (<date value="-123">B.C. 123</date>), which prescribed that the <foreign lang="la">judices</foreign> should not, as heretofore, be taken from the Senators (see p. <ref n="p. lxv" targOrder="U">lxv</ref>), but from those who possessed the equestrian census, and at the same time were not members of the Senate.  This law did not formally exclude nobles who were not members of the Senate; but the entire body of nobility was so far identified in spirit and interest with the Senate, that an antagonism immediately grew up between them and this new judicial class.  A principal cause of the antagonism was that members of the Senate were prohibited from being engaged in any trade or business;  <pb n="lii"/>  while, as has been shown above, the Senate, by its control over the elections, virtually filled its own vacancies, of course from the ranks of the nobility.  Hence, as rich men of non-senatorial families were excluded from a political career, and so from the nobility, while Senators were excluded from a business life, there were formed during the last century of the republic two powerful aristocracies, - the nobles, or Senatorial Order, a governing aristocracy of rank, and the Equestrian Order, an aristocracy of wealth, corresponding to the moneyed aristocracy of our day.  The name <foreign lang="la">Ordo Equestris</foreign> was given to the latter body because its members possessed the original equestrian census:  that is, that amount of property which would have entitled them to a public horse.  From the ranks of the nobility were taken the oppressive provincial governors: the Equestrian Order, on the other hand, furnished the <foreign lang="la">publicani</foreign> the equally oppressive tax-gatherers.
</p>
<p>The Equestrian Order, <foreign lang="la">Ordo Eqitestris</foreign>, is therefore not merely distinct from the <foreign lang="la">centuriae equitum</foreign>, but strongly contrasted with them.  The former is the wealthy middle class, the latter are the young nobility.  The term <foreign lang="la">equites</foreign> is sometimes applied to both indiscriminately, although the strictly correct term for the members of the Equestrian Order was <foreign lang="la">judices</foreign>.</p></div4>
<div4 type="subsect" n="3"><head>Populus.</head>
<p>Below these two aristocratic orders, in estate and so in social position, were all the rest of the free-born citizens not possessing a <foreign lang="la">census</foreign> of 400,000 sesterces.  Among these there was naturally great variety in fortune, cultivation, and respectability; but they all had a status superior to that of the <foreign lang="la">libertini</foreign> (freedmen) and the foreign residents.  it was this third class which was under the control of the <foreign lang="la">tribuni plebis</foreign> and which by its turbulence brought on all the disturbances which ultimately resulted in the overthrow of the republic.  It must not be supposed, however, that these humbler citizens were debarred from political preferment except by their want of money, and in fact many of them rose to positions of wealth and influence.
</p>
<p>The <foreign lang="la">populus</foreign> (in the narrower sense) was often confounded with the <foreign lang="la">plebs</foreign>, but in reality the distinction between the <foreign lang="la">plebs</foreign> and the <foreign lang="la">patricians</foreign> was in Cicero's time historical rather than political  The patricians had been originally a privileged class of hereditary nobility, entirely different from the later senatorial nobility; but only a few patrician families remained, and these, though still proud of their high birth, had no special privileges and had been practically merged in the Senatorial Order. Opposed to the patricians had been originally the <foreign lang="la">plebs</foreign>, a class of unknown origin (probably foreign residents) destitute of all political rights.  These had gradually, in the long controversies of the earlier Republican times, acquired all the rights and privileges of full citizens, and a majority of the Senatorial and Equestrian Orders were of plebeian origin.  In time <foreign lang="la">plebs</foreign> in an enlarged  <pb n="liii"/></p>
<p>sense and <foreign lang="la">populus</foreign> in its narrower acceptation had become synonymous, meaning the "third estate" or, in other words, all citizens not Senators or <foreign lang="la">equites</foreign>.  Officially, however, <foreign lang="la">Populus</foreign> (in its wider sense) includes all Roman citizens.
<note anchored="yes">So in the formula for the Roman government: <foreign lang="la">Senatus Populusque Romanus.</foreign>

<div4 type="subsect" n="4"><head>Roman Citizenship.</head>
<p>Roman citizenship, like all rights that have grown up in a long period of time, included many minute details.  The important points, however, may be included under two heads: (i) political rights, including those of voting <foreign lang="la">kus suffragii</foreign>) and holding office (<foreign lang="la">jus honorum</foreign>), and (ii) civil rights, especially those securing personal freedom by the right of appeal (<foreign lang="la">jus provocationis</foreign>), etc., and by other privileges limiting the arbitrary power of magistrates (see remarks on the <foreign lang="la">imperium</foreign>, p. lviii, below).  Among the civil rights were those of trade (<foreign lang="la">commercii</foreign>), intermarriage (<foreign lang="la">connubii</foreign>), making a will (<foreign lang="la">testamenti</foreign>), and others, which, though affecting the status of a man before the law, were unimportant in comparison with the great political and civil privileges first mentioned. Full citizens of Rome (<foreign lang="la">cives optimo jure</foreign>) enjoyed not only all the civil rights referred to, but also the <foreign lang="la">jus suffragii et honorum</foreign>; but many persons, not <foreign lang="la">cives optimo jure</foreign>, had important civil rights without being entitled to vote or hold office.  The <foreign lang="la">jus provocationis</foreign> was especially sought after by foreigners as affording a powerful protection all over the world in times when the rights of common humanity were scantily recognized.</p></div4>
<div4 type="subsect" n="5"><head>Italian Towns.</head>
<p>Roman citizenship was originally restricted to the inhabitants of the city and a small amount of adjacent territory.  But as Rome enlarged her boundaries the rights of citizenship were extended, in different degrees, to the conquered Italians.
</p>
<p>A native Italian town which lost its original independence and was absorbed in the Roman state, ceased to be a separate <foreign lang="la">civitas</foreign>, and became a <foreign lang="la">municipium</foreign>; its citizens now possessed Roman citizenship as well as that of their own town.  This Roman citizenship was possessed in various degrees.  Some <foreign lang="la">municipia</foreign> lost all rights of self-government, without receiving any political rights at Rome in their place:  that is, their political existence was extinguished, and their citizens became mere passive citizens of Rome, with civil rights, but no political ones.  A second class of towns retained their corporate existence, with the right of local self-government, but without the Roman franchise.  The condition thus established was called <foreign lang="la">jus Caeritum</foreign>, because the Etruscan town of Caere was taken as the type.  The most favored class of <foreign lang="la">municipia</foreign> retained all powers of self-government, with magistrates of their own election, at the same time being full citizens of Rome.  If, as happened in many cases, colonists were sent from Rome (or Latium) to occupy the conquered territory, these retained  <pb n="liv"/>  their full Roman citizenship though living at a distance from the city.
</p>
<p>Thus a class of towns called <foreign lang="la">colaniae</foreign>, possessing special privileges, grew up.
</p>
<p>After the Social War, which resulted (<date value="-90">B.C. 90</date>) in giving full Roman citizenship to the inhabitants of all the Italian towns not already enjoying it, there were practically but three classes of such towns:  <foreign lang="la">coloniae</foreign>, <foreign lang="la">municipia</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">praefecturae</foreign>. There was no longer any real distinction between the <foreign lang="la">colaniae</foreign> and the <foreign lang="la">municipia</foreign>, though the former were looked upon with more respect.  The <foreign lang="la">praefecturae</foreign>, however, had not full rights of self-government, for the administration of justice was in the bands of prefects (<foreign lang="la">praefecti</foreign>) sent from the capital. </p></div4>
<div4 type="subsect" n="6"><head>Provincials.</head>
<p> The foreign conquests of Rome were organized as fast as possible as provinces (<foreign lang="la">provinciae</foreign>). The native inhabitants of these would not be Roman citizens at all, unless citizenship, usually of the lowest grade, was specially conferred upon them.  Thus St. Paul was a free-born citizen of Tarsus, for his father had in some way secured the lesser Roman citizenship, which conferred civil rights but did not carry with it the right of suffrage or any other political privileges (see p. <ref n="p. liii" targOrder="U">liii</ref>, above).</p></div4>
<div4 type="subsect" n="7"><head>Freedmen.</head>
<p>Besides the free-born citizens (<foreign lang="la">ingenui</foreign>), the Roman state included a large class of <foreign lang="la">libertini</foreign> or freedmen.  Manumitted slaves became citizens, but their exact status was a standing subject of controversy in politics.  In Cicero's time they voted in the four city tribes, though there had been various attempts to make them eligible for membership in all the tribes so that their suffrages might count for more (see under Assemblies, p. lv, below).  Throughout the history of the republic, there was a constant tendency to extend the suffrage, in spite of the efforts of the upper classes.
</p>
<p>The government of this complex assemblage of citlzens was in the hands of a still more complex system of magistrates and assemblies.  As in our own day, we must distinguish the <emph>Legislative</emph> the <emph>Executive</emph>, and the <emph>Judicial</emph> though these various branches of the state authority were not so scrupulously kept separate as with us.
</p></div4></div3>
<div3 type="section" n="2"><head>The Public Assemblies.</head>
<p>The <foreign lang="la">Legislative</foreign> (or law-making) power proper resided in the Public Assemblies (<foreign lang="la">comitia</foreign>). There were, in Cicero's time, two principal assemblies, both of them having as their basis the thirty-five local tribes into which the whole people were divided for administrative purposes.
</p>
<div4 type="subsect" n="1"><head><foreign lang="la">Comitia Centuriata</foreign>.</head>
<p>The <foreign lang="la">Comitia Centuriata</foreign>, or great comitia, was the military organization of Servius Tullius endowed with new political powers at the foundation of the republic.  Later it was reorganized  <pb n="lv"/>  upon the basis of the thirty-five tribes. There is no precise statement as to either the time or the manner of this reorganization.  It must, however, have taken place between the First and Second Punic Wars, and, according to one theory, was carried out in the following manner.  The old division of the people into five classes (according to wealth)
<note anchored="yes">See p. <ref n="p. lxii" targOrder="U">lxii</ref>.
</note>being retained, for each tribe there were now formed two centuries of each class, one of <foreign lang="la">seniores</foreign> (above 45), one of <foreign lang="la">juniores</foreign>, making in all 350 centuries.  To these were added 18 centuries of <foreign lang="la">equites</foreign> (the young men of senatorial families, see p. <ref n="p. li" targOrder="U">li</ref>), guilds of smiths, carpenters, hornblowers, and trumpeters, and a century of freedmen and <foreign lang="la">capite censi</foreign> (those who had no property) &mdash; 373 in all. Each century had one vote, determined by the majority of its voters. These <foreign lang="la">comitia</foreign> were regularly presided over by the consul; they elected all the higher magistrates, and had full power of making laws, as well as jurisdiction in criminal cases so far as this had not been transferred to the <foreign lang="la">Quaestiones Perpetuae</foreign>.
<note anchored="yes">See p. <ref n="p. lxv" targOrder="U">lxv</ref>.
</note> </p></div4>
<div4 type="subsect" n="2"><head><foreign lang="la">Comitia Tributa.</foreign></head>
<p>Legislation had, before Cicero's time, however, practically passed into the hands of the tribal assembly (<foreign lang="la">Comitia Tributa</foreign>). There were two distinct assemblies which passed under this name:
</p>
<p>(a) The <foreign lang="la">Comitia Tributa</foreign> proper, an assembly of the entire people according to the thirty-five tribes (each tribe having one vote), which elected the inferior magistrates (curule aedile, quaestor, etc.), and was presided over by the praetor.
</p>
<p>(b) The far more important tribal assembly of the plebeians exclusively, presided over by the Tribune of the People.  Strictly speaking, this latter was not <foreign lang="la">comitia</foreign>, inasmuch as it was not composed of the whole people, <foreign lang="la">populus</foreign>, &mdash;the patricians being excluded from it.  But these were now reduced to a few noble families, whose members would not have cared to take part in this democratic assembly even if they had been permitted; and by the Hortensian Law (<date value="-287">B.C. 287</date>) acts of this assembly, <foreign lang="la">plebiscita</foreign>, had received the validity of laws.  This plebeian assembly elected the plebeian magistrates (tribunes, plebeian aediles).  It was also the principal organ for making laws.
</p>
<p>The <foreign lang="la">Comitia Centuriata</foreign>, which elected the higher magistrates, being originally a military organization, could only be convened outside the city, and accordingly met in the Campus Martius or parade-ground.  The <foreign lang="la">Comitia Tributa</foreign>, however, being purely a civil assembly, usually met in the Forum, but could be convened in any suitable place. </p></div4>
<div4 type="subsect" n="3"><head><foreign lang="la">Comitia Curiata</foreign>.</head>
<p>A third assembly, the <foreign lang="la">Comitia Curiata</foreign>, more ancient than the other two, retained only certain formal functions.  <pb n="lvi"/>  especially that of ceremonially investing the consuls with the <foreign lang="la">imperium</foreign> or military authority (see p. <ref n="p. lviii" targOrder="U">lviii</ref>, below).
<note anchored="yes" n="1">This was done annually by passing a law called <foreign lang="la">lex curiata de imperio </foreign> On such occasions the thirty <foreign lang="la">curiae</foreign> were represented by bailiffs (<foreign lang="la">lictores</foreign>).
</note> It had no longer any real power or political importance.  Membership in the <foreign lang="la">comitia curiata</foreign> was originally confined to patricians, but it is not clear whether this restriction was continued in Cicero's time.</p></div4>
<div4 type="subsect" n="4"> <head><foreign lang="la">Contio.</foreign></head>
<p>Besides these assemblies, there were meetings, theoretically for discussion, called <foreign lang="la">contiones</foreign>.  A <foreign lang="la">contio</foreign> could be called by any magistrate who had a matter to lay before the people, and was held regulariy in the <foreign lang="la">Comitium</foreign> or the Forum.
<note anchored="yes" n="2">For an example of an address at such a meeting see the <title>Oration for the Manilian Law</title>.
</note> After a <foreign lang="la">rogatio</foreign> (proposition of a law) had been offered, such a meeting was regularly convened in order that the voters might hear the arguments on both sides.  After that, on the same or a subsequent occasion, the <foreign lang="la">comitia</foreign> voted on the bill, Yes or No, at a regular meeting for that purpose.  </p></div4></div3>
<div3 type="section" n="3"><head>The Senate.</head>
<p>The Roman Senate (<foreign lang="la">senatus</foreign>), as its name indicates, was originally the council of elders" (cf. the Homeric <foreign lang="greek">boulh\ gero/ntwn</foreign>), advisers of the king. It had, therefore, strictly speaking, no authority to make laws or to enforce their execution, and its votes were simply <foreign lang="la">consulta</foreign>, i.e. matters agreed upon as advisable, and its power was <foreign lang="la">auctoritas</foreign>.  When annual magistracies succeeded the regal power, this advisory function continued, but the influence of the Senate increased, and the increase went on until, in the third century B.C., this body came to be the actual (though not formal) governing power in the state, and its <foreign lang="la">consulta</foreign> became <emph>ordinances</emph>, by which the Senate directed the administration of the whole state, though it still had no power to pass laws, and was itself subject to the laws.  The organization of a new province, for example, was an executive measure, put in force not by a law of the people, but by an ordinance of the Senate; and in this ordinance was embodied the entire authority of Rome over the province, except so far as this was defined by general laws passed by the whole people.</p>
<p>It will thus be seen that the Senate, though originally a "council," had by the time of Cicero absorbed a great part of the legislative as well as the executive power in the state.
<note anchored="yes" n="1">For membership in the Senate, see <ref n="p. l" targOrder="U">p. l</ref>, above.
</note></p>
<p>The Senate could only be called together by some magistrate regularly.  <pb n="lvii"/>  possessing the <foreign lang="la">imperium</foreign> (usually the Consul), or by the tribunes of the people (<foreign lang="la">tribuni plebis</foreign>)  the magistrate who summoned it also presided, and laid before it (<foreign lang="la">referre</foreign>) the business for which it was convened.  He might at this point give his own judgment.  He then proceeded to ask (<foreign lang="la">rogare</foreign>) the Senators individually their opinions (<foreign lang="la">sententiae</foreign>). The order was to ask in their turns the <foreign lang="la">consulares</foreign>, <foreign lang="la">praetorii</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">aedilicii</foreign> (that is, those who sat in the Senate by virtue of having held these offices respectively).  It has been disputed whether the <foreign lang="la">senatores pedarii</foreign>&mdash;i.e. those who had held no curule office &mdash; had the <foreign lang="la">jus sententiae</foreign>, or right to debate.  There are, however, numerous instances of their having taken part in discussion.  If the annual election had already taken place, &mdash; which was usually in July, six months before the new magistrates assumed their offices, &mdash; the magistrates elect (<foreign lang="la">designati</foreign>) were called upon before their several classes.  The <foreign lang="la">princeps Senatus</foreign> (see note, Cat. 3.10) was called upon first of all, when there were no <foreign lang="la">consules</foreign> <foreign lang="la">designati</foreign>.  The presiding officer, however, had it in his power to vary the order, and honor or slight any Senator by calling upon him <foreign lang="la">extra ordinem</foreign>.  For a deliberative oration, delivered in the Senate, see Catiline 4.
</p>
<p>As the Senate was primarily a body of councillors, its business was as a rule laid before it in general terms, not in any special form for action each Senator could, as he chose, give his judgment in full, by argument (<foreign lang="la">sententiam dicere</foreign>), or by simply expressing his assent to the judgment of another (<foreign lang="la">verbo adsentiri</foreign>).  No Senator had a right to introduce any matter formally by motion, as with us, but it was possible for a Senator, when called on, to give his opinion on any subject not included in the questions referred.   The vote was taken by a division (<foreign lang="la">discessio</foreign>), i.e. the Senators went to one side or the other of the house.  When a majority had decided in favor of any <foreign lang="la">sententia</foreign>, it was written out in proper form by the secretaries (<foreign lang="la">scribae</foreign>), under the direction of the presiding magistrate, in the presence of some of its principal supporters (<foreign lang="la">adesse scribundo</foreign>), and promulgated.  Cf. the closing sections of the Fourteenth Philippic (pp. 255, 256, below). </p></div3>
<div3 type="section" n="4"><head>The Executive.</head>
<div4 type="subsect" n="1"><head>The Consuls.</head>
<p>After the expulsion of the kings, their absolute authority (<foreign lang="la">imperium</foreign>), both in peace and war, was vested in two Consuls (originally <foreign lang="la">praetores</foreign>).  Gradually, however, these autocratic powers were limited by various checks, so that in one sense a Consul had no more power than the president of a modern republic. He could, it is true, do <emph>anything</emph> in his year of office without lawful question from anybody; yet, as he could be called to account at the end of his term, any violation of the constitution  <pb n="lviii"/>  was extremely dangerous. Particularly was this true in regard to objections from any one of the ten tribunes.
<note anchored="yes">See p. <ref n="p. lxii" targOrder="U">lxii</ref>.
</note> The danger of transgressing this limitation was so immediate that it was rarely incurred, and practically in almost all cases the "Veto" (<foreign lang="la">intercessio</foreign>) of a tribune was sufficient to stop any action on the part of the curule magistrates. Another limitation on the consular power came from the curious Roman arrangement of coordinate magistrates or "colleagues." The objection of one consul was sufficient to annul any act of the other.  This principle also applied to other magistracies, so that the wheels of government could be stopped by any colleague of equal rank.  To override such an objection was an act of unconstitutional violence, which, however, was often practised when public opinion could be relied on to sustain the illegal action.  In practice, the two consuls either took turns in the administration (sometimes alternating month by month) or agreed upon a division of functions.
</p>
<p>The consuls were regularly elected in July and entered upon their office on the first day of the following January.  They possessed two kinds of authority,&mdash;<foreign lang="la">potestas</foreign>), or power in general (which all magistrates had in some degree), and <foreign lang="la">imperium</foreign>,
<note anchored="yes" n="2">Of the other regular magistrates only the praetors possessed the <foreign lang="la">imperium</foreign> (see p. <ref n="p. lix" targOrder="U">lix</ref>). The <foreign lang="la">imperium</foreign> was formally conferred on the consuls by the <foreign lang="la">comitia curiata</foreign> (see p. <ref n="p. lvi" targOrder="U">lvi</ref>).
</note> military or sovereign power, as of a general in the field. This <foreign lang="la">imperium</foreign> was originally exercised by the consuls, not only in the army but in the city, so that they had absolute authority of life or death  but this was limited, early in the history of the republic, by the <foreign lang="la">Lex Valeria</foreign>, which gave every citizen the right of appeal (<foreign lang="la">jus pravocationis</foreign>) to the <foreign lang="la">comitia centuriata</foreign> (see p.321, below) against a sentence of capital or corporal punishment, and later by the <foreign lang="la">Lex Porcia</foreign>, which forbade the scourging of citizens.  By the <foreign lang="la">Lex Sempronia</foreign> of Caius Gracchus the right of appeal in capital cases was established even against the military <foreign lang="la">imperium</foreign>.
<note anchored="yes" n="3">Cf. Crucifixion of a Roman Citizen, sect. 6.
</note> In other respects, however, the military <foreign lang="la">imperium</foreign> remained practically absolute, but it could not be exercised inside the walls, except by virtue of the <foreign lang="la">senatus consultum</foreign>, "<foreign lang="la">Dent operam consules ne quid res publica detrimenti capiat</foreign>," which revived the ancient powers of the consuls and was equivalent to a declaration of martial law.
<note anchored="yes" n="4">4 see note on Cat. 1.2 (<ref n="pl100.12" targOrder="U">p. 100, l. 12</ref>).
</note> After the Sullan reforms (<date value="-80">B.C. 80</date>) the consuls did not receive the military <foreign lang="la">imperium</foreign> until their year of office had expired and they were about to set out for their provinces.
<note anchored="yes" n="5">See p. <ref n="p. lxi" targOrder="U">lxi</ref>.
</note> The civil powers of the consuls were analogous to those of any chief  <pb n="lix"/>  magistrate.  Most important among them were the right to call together, consult, and preside over the Senate, and the right to convene the <foreign lang="la">comitia centuriata</foreign> and preside over the election of the higher curule magistrates.

<div4 type="subsect" n="2"> <head>Praetors. </head>
<p><foreign lang="la">Praetor</foreign> was the original Italic title of the consuls, but, as the result of the agitation for the Licinian Laws, in <date value="-366">B.C. 366</date>, a special magistrate of that name was elected "who administered justice, a colleague of the consuls and elected under the same auspices."
<note anchored="yes" n="1">He was, however, inferior in rank to the consul, who had <foreign lang="la">major potestas</foreign>.
</note> Gradually other praetors were added, until in the time of Cicero there were eight. They were essentially judicial officers, and their functions were assigned by lot.
<note anchored="yes" n="2">See p. <ref n="p. lxv" targOrder="U">lxv</ref>.
</note> As curule magistrates, however, they could on occasion command armies or assist the consuls in emergencies (see Cat. 3. 5), and were assigned as <emph>propraetors</emph> to provinces abroad after their year of office.

<div4 type="subsect" n="3"> <head>Quaestors.</head>
<p>The quaestors (<foreign lang="la">quaestores</foreign>), or public treasurers, were in Cicero's time twenty in number.  Two (called <foreign lang="la">quaestores urbani</foreign>) had charge of the treasury and archives at Rome, while the others were assigned to the several military commanders and provincial governors, to serve as quartermasters and paymasters.  The quaestors entered upon office on Dec. 5, when they drew lots to determine their respective places of service.
<note anchored="yes" n="4">They were originally appointed by the consuls, but in Cicero's time were elected by the <foreign lang="la">comitia tributa</foreign>. The practical management of the treasury was with the clerks (<foreign lang="la">scribae quaestorii</foreign>), as in our modern civil service. These formed a permanent and powerful corporation. Cf. Cat. 4.15 (p. 149. ll. 10, 11).

<div4 type="subsect" n="5"> <head><foreign lang="la">Cursus Honorum</foreign>.
</head>
<p>No one could be chosen praetor until he had been quaestor, or consul until he had been praetor.  These three magistracies, then, formed a career of office &mdash; the so-called <foreign lang="la">cursus honorum</foreign>&mdash;which it was the aim of every ambitious Roman to complete as soon as possible.  To be elected quaestor a man had to be at least 30 years old,
<note anchored="yes" n="5">In the time of the Gracchi the age was 27.
</note> and the lowest legal ages for the praetorship and the consulship were 40 and 43 respectively.  The consulship could in no case be held until three years after the praetorship. Consuls and praetors were curule magistrates, but this was not the case with the quaestor.  The office of curule aedile (see below) was often held between the quaestorship and the praetorship, but it was not a necessary grade in the <foreign lang="la">cursus honorum</foreign>.  The minimum age for this office was the twenty-seventh year.   </p></div4>
<div4 type="subsect" n="6"> <pb n="lx"/><head>Aediles.</head>
<p>The aediles (from <foreign lang="la">aedes</foreign>, a temple) were four magistrates, who had the general superintendence of the police of the city, criminal jurisdiction with the power of imposing fines, the care of the games, public buildings, etc.  They did not form a board (<foreign lang="la">collegium</foreign>), but were of two grades, two being necessarily plebeians, while the other two, the <foreign lang="la">curule aediles</foreign>, who ranked with the higher magistrates, might be patricians.  The aedileship was not a necessary step in a political career, but it was eagerly sought, between the quaestorship and the praetorship, by ambitious men, for the reason that the superintendence of the public games gave great opportunity for gaining popular favor.  A certain sum was appropriated from the public treasury for these games  but an aedile who wished to rise to higher positions, and not to be thought mean, took care to add a good sum from his own pocket.

<div4 type="subsect" n="7"><head>Lictors, Insignia, etc. </head>
<p>The consuls and praetors were accompanied by special officers called lictors (<foreign lang="la">lictores</foreign>), who were at the same time a symbol of the supreme power and the immediate ministers of the will of the magistrates.  They carried a bundle of rods and an axe bound together (the <foreign lang="la">fasces</foreign>), to inflict the punishment of flogging and death according to the regular Roman mode of execution.  Each consul had twelve lictors, each praetor had six.  After the right of appeal was established (see p. <ref n="p. lviii" targOrder="U">lviii</ref>, above), the lictors did not carry the axe inside the city.  Besides the "imperial" lictors, all magistrates were attended by ministers of various kinds, <foreign lang="la">viatores</foreign> (summoners), <foreign lang="la">praecones</foreign> (criers), and slaves.  All the curule magistrates wore as a mark of authority the <foreign lang="la">toga praetexta</foreign> (white with a crimson border), and the <foreign lang="la">latus clavus</foreign> (or broad stripe of crimson) on the front of the tunic.  As commanders of armies, they wore instead of the toga the <foreign lang="la">paludamentum</foreign>, a kind of cloak entirely of crimson.  In fact, the majesty of the law was symbolized in the most striking manner in the case of all magistrates except the tribunes,
<note anchored="yes" n="3">See p. <ref n="p. lxii" targOrder="U">lxii</ref>.
</note> who, as champions of the <foreign lang="la">plebs</foreign>, wore no distinguishing dress, the quaestors and the plebeian aediles. </p></div4>
<div4 type="subsect" n="8"><head>Proconsuls and Propraetors.</head>
<p>All the magistrates so far mentioned were elected annually.  When it was desired to retain the services of a consul or a praetor after his term had expired, his <foreign lang="la">imperium</foreign> was extended (<foreign lang="la">prorogatum</foreign>) by the Senate, and he was known as a <foreign lang="la">proconsul</foreign> or<foreign lang="la">propraetor</foreign>. It was only the military <foreign lang="la">imperium</foreign> that was thus prorogued,
<note anchored="yes" n="4">Sometimes a private citizen was invested with the <foreign lang="la">imperium</foreign> and called proconsul (see <bibl n="Cic. Man. 62">Manil. Law 62</bibl>).
</note> not the civil   <pb n="Ixi"/>  power. Thus the proconsul had no authority within the city, and could not, like the consul, call together the Senate or an assembly of the people.
</p>
<p>As the "state" grew, it became customary to commit the government of conquered provinces to proconsuls and propraetors, and to this end the prorogation of the <foreign lang="la">imperium</foreign> for a second year became regular.  After the time of Sulla, all provinces were so governed,
<note anchored="yes" n="1">After the Sullan reforms (<date value="-80">B.C. 80</date>) the military <foreign lang="la">imperium</foreign> was not enjoyed by the consuls and praetors until their year of civil magistracy had expired.
</note> one of his laws providing that the consuls and praetors should set out for their provinces immediately on the expiration of their term of office in the city.
<note anchored="yes" n="2">This arrangement was changed by a law of Pompey (<date value="-52">B.C. 52</date>) which provided that five years should intervene between the magistracy and the provincial government. See Life of Cicero, p. <ref n="p. xxiii" targOrder="U">xxiii</ref>, above.
</note> No difference was made between the power of a proconsul and that of a propraetor. Both officers had the full military and civil command and were almost absolute monarchs, except for their liability to be afterwards called to account (cf. p. <ref n="p. lviii" targOrder="U">lviii</ref>, above).  Their opportunities for plunder were almost unlimited.
<note anchored="yes" n="3">Cf. Impeachment of Verres.
</note> Their power, however, did not extend to the city itself, in which they were mere private citizens.  Hence it often happened that a commander, on returning from his province, remained outside the city so as to retain his military <foreign lang="la">imperium</foreign> for some reason or other. </p></div4>
<div4 type="subsect" n="9"><head>Censors.</head>
<p>The Censors (<foreign lang="la">Censores</foreign>) were two in number, elected from men of consular dignity (<foreign lang="la">consulares</foreign>), originally at a minimum interval of four years, afterwards once in five years,&mdash;the interval called a <foreign lang="la">lustrum</foreign>,&mdash;and holding office for eighteen months. They ranked as <foreign lang="la">magistratus majores</foreign>, but did not possess the <foreign lang="la">imperium</foreign>, and had no power to convene either the Senate or an assembly of the people.  Their functions were (i) to inspect the registry of citizens of every class and order; (2) to punish immorality, by removal from the Senate, the equestrian centuries, or the Tribe (<foreign lang="la">nova censoria</foreign>, <foreign lang="la">infamia</foreign>, <foreign lang="la">ignominia</foreign>); (3) to superintend the finances (giving out contracts for collecting the revenues) and the public works.  In the intervals of the censorship, these last were under the care of the aediles (see p. <ref n="p. lx" targOrder="U">lx</ref>, above).  Sulla tacitly abolished the office of censor, but it was revived in the consulship of Pompey and Crassus, <date value="-70">B.C. 70</date>.
</p>
<p>The property registration, of which the censors had charge, was called <foreign lang="la">census</foreign>, and on it depended not only taxation but the position of a citizen in the <foreign lang="la">centuriae</foreign> (see p. <ref n="p. lv" targOrder="U">lv</ref>, above, on the <foreign lang="la">comitia centuriata</foreign>). The classes under the <foreign lang="la">census</foreign> were divided as follows:  <pb n="lxii"/>  <table> <row role="data"><cell cols="1" role="label" rows="1">First class:</cell><cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">having property valued at 100,000 asses or more.</cell></row> <row role="data"><cell cols="1" role="label" rows="1">Second class:</cell><cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">75,000</cell></row> <row role="data"><cell cols="1" role="label" rows="1">Third class:</cell><cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">50,000</cell></row> <row role="data"><cell cols="1" role="label" rows="1">Fourth class:</cell><cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">25,000</cell></row> <row role="data"><cell cols="1" role="label" rows="1">Fifth class:</cell><cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">11,000</cell></row> </table></p>
<p>The <foreign lang="la">census</foreign> of a Roman <foreign lang="la">eques</foreign> was, in Cicero's time, 400,000 sesterces, and this provision was one of long standing. </p></div4>
<div4 type="subsect" n="10"><head>Tribuni Plebis.</head>
<p>Side by side with the "kingly" magistrates there had arisen a class of magistrates of the people whose only privileges originally were prohibitive, but who had come to have great power in the state.
</p>
<p>The <foreign lang="la">Tribuni Plebis</foreign> (or <foreign lang="la">Plebi</foreign>), ten in number and elected by the <foreign lang="la">Comitia Tributa</foreign>, were the magistrates of that portion of the people (a state within the state) known as the <foreign lang="la">Plebs</foreign>. The plebeians at this epoch, however, composed the whole people, with the exception of the few families of the patrician aristocracy (such <foreign lang="la">gentes</foreign> as the Cornelian, Julian, Aemilian, Claudian).
<note anchored="yes" n="1">See p. <ref n="p. lii" targOrder="U">lii</ref>.
</note> Not being technically magistrates of the city or the whole people, but only of a single class, the tribunes did not possess the <foreign lang="la">imperium</foreign>, but only <foreign lang="la">potestas</foreign>, had no real executive power, and indeed were not magistrates at all in the strict sense of the term.  On the other hand, their persons were held sacred, and they had two very important and wide-reaching functions:  1. The right of interfering, <foreign lang="la">jus intercedendi</foreign> ("veto"), to arrest almost any act of another magistrate. (This right practically extended to a veto on legislation, elections, and ordinances of the Senate, these being all under the direction of magistrates.) 2. The right to hold the assembly of the <foreign lang="la">plebs</foreign>, organized by tribes.  In this assembly, known as <foreign lang="la">comitia tributa</foreign>, the plebeian magistrates (tribunes and plebeian aediles)
<note anchored="yes" n="2">See p. <ref n="p. lx" targOrder="U">lx</ref>.
</note> were chosen, and laws were passed, <foreign lang="la">plebiscita</foreign>, which of course were originally binding only upon the <foreign lang="la">plebs</foreign>, but which, by the Hortensian Law (<date value="-287">B.C. 287</date>), received the force of <foreign lang="la">leges</foreign> (see p. <ref n="p. lv" targOrder="U">lv</ref>, above); fines were likewise imposed by this assembly.
</p>
<p>Out of these original powers had been developed a very extensive criminal jurisdiction, which made the tribunes and aediles the chief prosecuting officers of the republic, the tribunes acting in cases of a political character.  This order of things continued until the time of Sulla, when the administration of criminal justice was entrusted to the standing courts, <foreign lang="la">quaestiones perpetuae</foreign>, established by him (see p. <ref n="p. lxv" targOrder="U">lxv</ref>, below).  But Sulla's provisions were abolished by Pompey (<date value="-70">B.C. 70</date>), the people fancying that the corruptions of the courts could be remedied by restoring this power to  <pb n="lxiii"/>  the tribunes. The tribunes also had authority to convene the Senate and bring business before it, preside, and take part in debate. These privileges they acquired very early, by irregular practice passing into custom, rather than by any special enactment.</p></div4>
<div4 type="subsect" n="11"><head>The Auspices.</head>
<p>The absolute continuity of the government, which was more necessary at Rome than elsewhere, on account of a kind of theocratic idea in the constitution, was secured by a curious contrivance. The regular succession in Roman magistrates was as rigid as later in the Church. The welfare of the state was supposed to depend upon the favor of the gods, and this could only be transferred from one officer to another by an election which was practically a religious ceremony in which both officers took part. This favor, technically known as the <foreign lang="la">auspicia</foreign>, would lapse unless the election and inauguration were rightly performed. The ceremony consisted in taking the <foreign lang="la">auspices</foreign>, a regular process of religious divination by the flight of birds, etc., according to a very antiquated ritual (see below).  </p></div4>
<div4 type="subsect" n="12"><head>Augurs.</head>
<p>The magistrates alone were authorized to consult the auspices, that is, to observe the various signs by which the gods were supposed to declare their will with regard to the state.  The interpretation of the auspices, however, which had been developed into an extremely technical science (<foreign lang="la">jus augurium</foreign>), was in the hands of a much honored body (<foreign lang="la">collegium</foreign>) of distinguished citizens, called augurs (<foreign lang="la">augures</foreign>). These were not themselves magistrates,
<note anchored="yes" n="1">See Philippic 14. 14, and note.
</note> but simply the official interpreters of the <foreign lang="la">jus augurium</foreign>, which they alone were supposed to know.  Since all important public acts (especially the holding of the <foreign lang="la">comitia</foreign>) were done <foreign lang="la">auspicato</foreign> (i.e., under authority of the auspices), the augurs naturally came to have great political influence. Their interpretation and advice could be disregarded, but such disregard was at the risk of the magistrate and was almost sure to affect his popularity, especially if misfortune followed.  The augurs held office for life.  Originally they had the right to fill vacancies on their board, but later such vacancies were sometimes filled by election by the people.
<note anchored="yes" n="2">The rule in this matter was several times changed by law.
</note> Cicero himself became an augur, <date value="-53">B.C. 53</date>. </p></div4>
<div4 type="subsect" n="13"><head>Interrex.</head>
<p>Whenever there was a suspension of legal authority, by vacancy of the chief magistracy, it was understood that the <foreign lang="la">auspicia</foreign>&mdash;which were regularly in possession of the magistrates &mdash; were lodged (in accordance with the most ancient custom) with the patrician members of the Senate until new magistrates should be inaugurated.  The renewal of the regular order of things was begun by the patrician senators coming together and appointing one of their own number as <foreign lang="la">interrex.</foreign> He held  <pb n="lxiv"/>  office for five days, as chief magistrate of the commonwealth and possessor of the <foreign lang="la">auspicia</foreign>; then he created a successor, who might hold the <foreign lang="la">comitia</foreign> for the election of consuls, but who usually created another successor for that purpose.</p></div4>
<div4 type="subsect" n="14"><head>Dictator.</head>
<p>The dictator was an extraordinary magistrate, possessing absolute power, appointed by the consuls, at the instance of the Senate, in times of great public danger. Properly he held office for but six months. The laws of appeal, and other safeguards of individual liberty, had at first no force against this magistrate. In later times (after <date value="-202">B.C. 202</date>) dictators were no longer appointed, but instead the Senate, when occasion arose, invested the consuls with dictatorial power.
<note anchored="yes" n="1">See p. <ref n="p. lviii" targOrder="U">lviii</ref>.
</note> Sulla, and afterwards Caesar, revived the name and authority of the dictatorship but in their case the office became equivalent to absolute sovereignty, since each of them was appointed dictator for life (<foreign lang="la">perpetuo</foreign>). The <foreign lang="la">Magister Equitum</foreign>, appointed by the Dictator, stood next in command to him and also had the <foreign lang="la">imperium</foreign>.  </p></div4></div3>
<div3 type="section" n="5"><head>The Courts.</head>
<p>Our division of legal business into <emph>civil</emph> and <emph>criminal</emph>, though not exactly corresponding to the Roman classification of cases as <foreign lang="la">causae privatae</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">causae publicae</foreign>, still affords the most convenient basis for an understanding of the ancient courts.
</p>
<p>In <emph>civil cases</emph> between individual citizens as well as foreign residents, the jurisdiction, originally belonging to the king, was, on the establishment of the Republic transferred to the consuls, but in the times with which we are especially concerned, it rested with the praetors. The <foreign lang="la">praetor urbanus</foreign> had charge of all civil cases between Roman citizens; the <foreign lang="la">praetor peregrinus</foreign>, of all civil suits to which an alien was a party.  Civil processes were various and complicated, and, since none of the orations in this edition were spoken in such cases, they may be left out of account here.
</p>
<p><emph>Criminal Jurisdiction</emph> also originally rested with the king, and, later, with the magistrates (consuls, etc.) who succeeded him. But by the various laws concerning appeal, the trial of all important offences was transferred to the assemblies of the people.  In accordance with its origin the jurisdiction of these bodies was always theoretically an appellant jurisdiction.  The case was supposed first to be decided by the magistrate, who, having given notice (<foreign lang="la">diem dicere</foreign>) to the defendant (<foreign lang="la">reus</foreign>), brought forward a bill (<foreign lang="la">rogatio</foreign>) enacting the punishment. If the case was a capital one, i.e. involving the life or status of a Roman citizen, it was brought before the <foreign lang="la">comitia centuriata</foreign> convened by the magistrate for the purpose, and decided like any other question. It would appear that any curule magistrate  <pb n="lxv"/>  well as the tribunes could take such action. If the case involved only a fine, it was tried before the <foreign lang="la">comitia tributa</foreign> by an aedile or tribune.
</p>
<p>These methods of trial were practically superseded after the time of Sulla by the establishment of the standing courts (see below).  They were, however, sometimes revived, as in Cicero's own case.
</p>
<p>It had always been competent for the people to establish a <foreign lang="la">quaestio</foreign> or investigation to try persons suspected of crimes (<foreign lang="la">quaestiones extraordinariae)</foreign>.  After the analogy of this proceeding, Sulla established standing courts (<foreign lang="la">quaestiones perpetuae</foreign>) differing from previous <foreign lang="la">quaestiones</foreign> only in that they were continuous instead of being appointed upon any particular occasion. It was before these that most crimes were tried.
<note anchored="yes" n="1">Sulla's <foreign lang="la">quaestiones perpetuae</foreign> were eight or ten in number. Six of these &mdash;<foreign lang="la">Repetundae</foreign> (extortion), <foreign lang="la">Ambitus</foreign> (bribery), <foreign lang="la">Peculatus</foreign> (embezzlement), <foreign lang="la">Majestas</foreign> (treason), <foreign lang="la">de Sicariis et Venefeis</foreign> (murder), and probably <foreign lang="la">Falsi</foreign> (counterfeiting and fraud)&mdash;were presided over by six of the eight praetors. For the other two (or four), ex-aediles (<foreign lang="la">aedilicii</foreign>) were appointed to preside as <foreign lang="la">judices quaestionis</foreign>.
</note> Examples of such trials are found in <title>Rosc. Am.</title> (p. 1) and <title>Verres</title> (p. 26).
</p>
<p>Such a court consisted of a presiding judge, <foreign lang="la">quaesitor</foreign> (<foreign lang="la">praetor</foreign>, or <foreign lang="la">judex quaestionis</foreign>), who caused a jury (<foreign lang="la">judices</foreign>) to be impanelled and sworn (hence called <foreign lang="la">jurati</foreign>), varying in number in the different courts and at different times, to try the case under his presidency. These <foreign lang="la">judices</foreign> were drawn by lot from a standing body (<foreign lang="la">judices selecti</foreign>), the exact number of which is unknown,
<note anchored="yes" n="2">For cases of extortion the number was specially fixed by the <foreign lang="la">Lex Acilia</foreign> at four hundred and fifty, from whom fifty were chosen as jurors.
</note> and a right of challenging existed as with us. This body was originally made up from the Senatorial Order, but a law of C. Gracchus (<date value="-123">B.C. 123</date>) provided that the <foreign lang="la">judices</foreign> should be taken from non-Senators who possessed the equestrian <foreign lang="la">census</foreign> (see p. <ref n="p. lxii" targOrder="U">lxii</ref>, above). From this time the Senators and the <foreign lang="la">Equites</foreign> contended for the control of the courts. Sulla restored to the Senators the exclusive privilege of sitting as <foreign lang="la">judices</foreign> (<date value="-80">B.C. 80</date>), but the Aurelian Law (<date value="-70">B.C. 70</date>) provided that the jurors should be taken, one-third from the Senators and two-thirds from the Equestrian Order, and that one-half of the <foreign lang="la">Equites</foreign> chosen (i.e. one-third of the whole number of <foreign lang="la">judices</foreign>) should have held the office of <foreign lang="la">Tribunus Aerarius</foreign> (i.e. president of one of the thirty-five local tribes, see p. <ref n="p. liv" targOrder="U">liv</ref>, above). This regulation remained in force until the dictatorship of Caesar, <date value="-45">B.C. 45</date>, when this <foreign lang="la">decuria</foreign> of <foreign lang="la">Tribuni Aerarii</foreign> was abolished.  A majority of the jurors decided the verdict.  The president had no vote, nor did he decide the law of the case: he had merely charge of the proceedings as a presiding magistrate.  (Cf. <bibl n="Cic. Ver. 1.1.32">Verr. 1. 32</bibl>, for a hint at his powers.)

<p>Sextus Roscius was a rich and respected citizen of Ameria, an Umbrian town (<foreign lang="la">municipium</foreign>) about fifty miles north of Rome.   He had a taste for city life, and spent most of his time at the capital, where he was on intimate terms with some of the highest families, especially the Metelli and Scipios.  Meantime his son Sextus, who certainly lacked his father's cultivated tastes, and who was accused by his enemies of rudeness and clownishness, had charge of the extensive family estates at Ameria.
</p>
<p>Sometime during the dictatorship of Sulla (probably in the autumn of <date>81 B.C.</date>) the elder Roscius was murdered one evening as he was returning from a dinner party.  The murder was no doubt procured, or at least connived at, by one Titus Roscius Magnus, his fellow-townsman and enemy. However that may be, the name of the murdered man was put upon the proscription-list by a freedman and favorite of Sulla, one Chrysogonus, who bought his confiscated estates at auction at a nominal price.  Three of these estates (there were thirteen in all)  he transferred to a certain Titus Roscius Capito, another townsman and enemy of the deceased, and a leading man at Ameria; the remainder he put in charge of Magnus as his agent.  The younger Sextus, a man of forty, thus robbed of his patrimony, had recourse to his father's friends in Rome for protection and help.  The three conspirators, fearing that they might be compelled to disgorge, resolved to secure themselves by accusing him of his father's murder.   This they did through a professional prosecutor (accusator) named Erucius, who undertook the legal formalities of the prosecution.
</p>
<p>The aristocratic friends of Roscius, not daring to brave the creature of the dictator, but unwilling to leave their guest-friend (<foreign lang="la">hospes</foreign>) undefended, prevailed upon Cicero, then young and ambitious, to undertake the case.  To oppose Chrysogonus was an act that called for disinterested courage, and nothing in Cicero's career is more to his credit.  By his successful conduct of the case he obtained the well-merited rank of a leader among the rising advocates of Rome. The Defence of Roscius was the first of Cicero's public orations or pleas; and it is criticised by the author himself in his <bibl>Orator, ch. 30</bibl>.

<p>By this skillfully modest opening, Cicero not only explains why he, an obscure young advocate, appears in so important a case, but he indicates on which side are the sympathies of the best citizens, and he contrives at the same time to suggest the odds against which Roscius and his counsel must contend.  Thus the remarks are not merely personal and introductory, but form an essential part of the argument.  A famous modern example of similar art is Erskine's Exordium in his Defence of Lord George Gordon on a charge of high treason.</p>

<p>This section tells of Roscius's political associations.

They also prepare for the exoneration of Sulla (in sect. <bibl n="Cic. S.

At first only the names of those who had justly forfeited their lives were proscribed ; afterwards it became easy for friends and favorites of the dictator (like Chrysogonus, attacked in this oration) to put upon the list the names of innocent men, and even of men already dead, so as to work confiscation of their property.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">tu</lemma>: emphatic, as opposed to the general run of accusers. Cicero is here using the famous "argument from probability," a favorite with ancient orators and rhetoricians from the fifth century B.C. "For example, if a physically weak man be accused of an assault, he is to ask the jury, 'Is it <emph>probable</emph> that a weakling like me should have attacked anybody?' while if the accused is a strong man he is to claim that it is <emph>improbable</emph> that he should have committed an assault in a case where his strength was sure to be used as a presumption against him." </p></div4>

<p>Here the "argument from probability" is very skillfully carried out.  In sect. <bibl n="Cic. S.

This leads up at once to the question of motive:  if Roscius's character was so little suited to the crime, the motive must have been extraordinarily powerful ; but no motive at all has been shown (sect. <bibl n="Cic.

In this section (and in the two chapters that follow, omitted in this edition) Cicero disposes of the former; in <bibl n="Cic. S. Rosc. 19">ch. 19</bibl> (also omitted) he argues that there is no evidence that the elder Roscius meant to disinherit his son.  In chs. <bibl n="Cic. S. Rosc. 20">20</bibl> and <bibl n="Cic. S. Rosc. 21">21</bibl>(omitted) he goes on to say that the prosecutor has shown no case and to inveigh against him for bringing a baseless charge.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">qua re</lemma>, <gloss>why</gloss>; <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">quo modo</lemma>, <gloss>how</gloss>.  Cicero contends that he is not obliged to discuss the manner of the murder, since Erucius has not raised that point, and has not even been able to assign a motive.  His own position in the argument is so strong, however, that, he says, he can afford to concede a point by waiving the question of <gloss>motive</gloss> and allowing Erucius to argue the case on the basis of the <gloss>means</gloss> by which Roscius could have committed the crime.  This is of course a rhetorical device to introduce one of Cicero's strongest arguments.  It cannot be proved that it was even possible for Roscius to kill his father under the circumstances. By calling for the details of the murder Cicero shows that none can be produced. The whole passage serves also as an effective preparation for the countercharge (omitted in this edition), in which it is shown that Sex. Roscius Magnus had not only a motive, but every opportunity.

<p>It is so important for Cicero to show that this Case has no political bearings that he has been forced to abandon the question of the murder for a time, and to discuss the illegal sale of the property.  He must now return to the charge against his client, and he does so by remarking that Roscius has no complaint to make of his treatment by Chrysogorius if the latter will only let him off with his life.

<p>Caius Verres, a man of noble birth, but notorious for his crimes and exactions in the civil war and in the offices he had held since, was city praetor (<foreign lang="la">praetor urbanus</foreign>) <date>B.C. 74</date>. At the close of his term of office, he went, in accordance with the law, as propraetor, to govern the province of Sicily. By reason of the disturbed condition of Italy, from the revolt of Spartacus, he was not relieved at the end of a year, as the law required, but continued two years longer in the government of the province, when he was succeeded by Lucius Caecilius Metellus. During these three years he was guilty of the most abominable oppressions and exactions; and the Sicilians, as soon as they were relieved of his presence, brought suit against him in the court of Repetundae (that for the trial of cases of Extortion), then presided over by the praetor Manius Acilius Glabrio. To conduct the prosecution they had recourse to Cicero, who already stood high among Roman advocates, and who was personally known and trusted by the Sicilians on account of his honorable administration of the quaestorship in their island in <date>B.C. 77</date>. Cicero willingly took charge of the case, the more so  as the counsel for Verres was Hortensius, the leading lawyer of the time, against whom he was eager to measure his strength.
</p>
<p>Although the cruelty and rapacity of Verres were notorious, yet his relations to the Roman nobility insured him the same kind of support at home which recently, under somewhat similar circumstances, was afforded to Governor Eyre in England, on his return from Jamaica: not only Hortensius, but Curio, a man of excellent reputation, with members of the eminent families of Scipio and Metellus, stood firmly by him. The only hope of Verres lay in preventing a fair and speedy trial. First he tried to obtain a prosecutor who should be in collusion with him, and would not push him too hard. For this purpose one Caecilius was put forward, an insignificant person, but a native of Sicily. Cicero's first speech in the case (<title lang="la">In Q. Caecilium</title>) was therefore a preliminary argument before the praetor Glabrio in person, to show that he, rather than Caecilius, should be allowed to conduct the case. This it was not hard to do, and he set out at once for Sicily to collect evidence, for which purpose he was allowed one hundred and ten days.
</p>
<p>To consume time the opposition had planned to bring before the same court a trumped-up action against another provincial governor which should have precedence of the trial of Verres. To this end they had procured for the prosecutor in the rival suit an allowance of one hundred and eight days for collecting evidence in Achaia &mdash; or two days less than the time which Cicero was expected to need. This intrigue was foiled by Cicero's industry and skill. He used not quite half of the time allowed him, arriving in Rome, with ample evidence, not only before the prosecutor in the rival case was ready, but even before the latter had left Italy on his pretended tour of investigation. The trial of Verres was now fixed for Aug. 5, <date>B.C. 70</date> (consulship of Pompey and Crassus).
</p>
<p>Meantime (in the latter part of July) the elections were held for the next year. As was the custom in Rome, these occurred several months before the newly elected magistrates were to enter upon their offices. The successful candidates, under the title of <foreign lang="la">designati</foreign>, enjoyed a dignity almost equal to that of the actual magistrates, although with no real power (see <bibl n="Cic. Ver. 1.1.9">ch. ix</bibl>.). In these elections Cicero was designated aedile; but his rival Hortensius was chosen consul, with Quintus Metellus Creticus, Verres' fast friend, as his colleague. More than this, Marcus Metellus, brother of Quintus, was chosen praetor, and the lot fell to him to preside the next year in the court of Repetundae. If now the trial could be put over till the next year, when Hortensius and the two Metelli would be in the three most influential positions in the  State, Verres felt quite sure of getting clear. Neither did it seem as if this would be very hard to bring about; for the last six months of the Roman year were so full of festivals and other days on which the court could not sit, that the case would be liable to constant interruptions and delays. The postponement would have disappointed Cicero sorely, for, by good luck in drawing the names, and sagacity in challenging, he had a jury that he could trust, and he was not willing to run the risk of a change.
</p>
<p>Under these circumstances Cicero made the second speech of the Verrine group &mdash; that which is known as the Actio Prima (included in the present edition, pp. 28-47 below). In this oration he declared his intention of departing from the usual course of procedure in order to push the trial through before the New Year. It was customary for the prosecutor, after opening the case (as in the present speech), to present his proofs and arguments in a long connected oration (or a series of orations); there followed a reply from the defendant's counsel, and then the witnesses were introduced. Cicero, omitting the long statement just described, proceeded to bring forward his witnesses immediately. Since the only hope of the defence lay in putting off the trial, Cicero's promptitude was decisive: Hortensius soon threw up his case, and Verres went into exile, with a name forever associated with extortion and misgovernment. Full restitution of the plunder was, however, not obtained: a compromise was made, by which a less sum was paid in satisfaction of the claims. The five speeches known as the "Accusation" proper (<title lang="la">Actio Secunda</title>) were never delivered, but were written out and published in order to put on record the facts which Cicero had gathered with so much pains, and to give a specimen of his powers in the way of forensic composition.
</p>
<p>With the trial of Verres the student may compare the impeachment of Warren Hastings in the eighteenth century, probably the most famous modern instance of the arraignment of a provincial governor for alleged misgovernment, extortion, and cruelty. The prosecution in this case (and in particular Burke) seem to have modelled their speeches on the Verrine orations of Cicero, and many parallels may easily be discovered A few of these are quoted in these notes. That the similarity of the two situations was clearly felt at the time may be seen from Lord Erskine's Defence of Stockdale (December, 1789) on a charge connected with the impeachment of Hastings: &ldquo;When Cicero impeached Verres before the great tribunal of Rome, of similar cruelties and depredations in her provinces, the Roman people were not left to such inquiries. All Sicily surrounded the Forum, demanding justice upon her plunderer and spoiler, with tears and imprecations. It was not by the eloquence of the orator, but by the cries and tears of the miserable, that Cicero prevailed in that illustrious case. Verres fled from the oaths of his accusers and their witnesses, and not from the voice of Tully.&rdquo;</p>

<div3 type="summary" n="1">
<p>The trial of Verres gives the senatorial order an opportunity to redeem the reputation of the courts. Verres had no defence, but had expected to escape by bribing the jury in case he should be prosecuted. His guilt was notorious, so that the chief question now to be determined was that of the integrity of the jury. Cicero accordingly makes this the main point of the present oration: it is the court, he insists, that is on trial rather than Verres.

<p>Verres attempted to buy up the court in advance, but, on the selection of the present jury, lost heart (sects. <bibl n="Cic. Ver. 1.1.16">16</bibl>, <bibl n="Cic. Ver. 1.1.17">17</bibl>). The election of Hortensius to the consulship gave him fresh courage (sect. <bibl n="Cic. Ver. 1.1.17">17</bibl>). A significant incident on election day (sects. <bibl n="Cic.

<p>Cicero here returns to the subject of bribery. He has already asserted (sects. <bibl n="Cic. Ver. 1.1.3">3</bibl>-<bibl n="Cic. Ver. 1.1.10">10</bibl>) that this had always been the sole hope of Verres; he has pointed out that Verres need not expect to corrupt the present tribunal (sect. <bibl n="Cic. Ver. 1.1.10">10</bibl>), and that his guilt is so enormous and so notorious that no honest jury could fail to convict him (sects. <bibl n="Cic. Ver. 1.1.10">10</bibl>-<bibl n="Cic. Ver. 1.1.14">14</bibl>). He now goes on to show that in endeavoring to postpone the trial Verres is, as heretofore, trying to defeat justice by corrupt means. In establishing this point, the orator reviews the several schemes of bribery, thus leading up to the matter immediately before the court and bringing out the fact that it is like the devices that had preceded it.</p>

Cicero will oppose the arrogance of Hortensius and offers himself as the opponent of any who shall hereafter attempt to bribe the courts. The illegal domination of Hortensius is dangerous to justice. It must be met by proofs of judicial corruption, which are abundant (sects. <bibl n="Cic. Ver. 1.1.34">34</bibl>-<bibl n="Cic. Ver. 1.1.39">39</bibl>). The acquittal of Verres will be subversive of the whole judicial system (sects. <bibl n="Cic. Ver. 1.1.40">40</bibl>-<bibl n="Cic. Ver. 1.1.42">42</bibl>). The jurors are urged to vindicate the courts (sects <bibl n="Cic. Ver. 1.1.43">43</bibl>, <bibl n="Cic. Ver. 1.1.45">45</bibl>). All Rome is on the watch, and bribery is sure to be detected.

<p>The skill of the argument in sects. <bibl n="Cic. Ver. 1.1.32">32</bibl>-<bibl n="Cic. Ver. 1.1.50">50</bibl>  is remarkable. Cicero contrives, without directly asserting that Hortensius is guilty of judicial corruption, to suggest that he is in a measure responsible for its prevalence. He declares his intention of devoting his aedileship to exposing such practices, and adds that he expects to be opposed by Hortensius. He calls attention to several notorious cases of bribery which he means to use as illustrations in pressing his reforms. Then, in a moment, he makes it clear, by a sudden turn, that he has not been digressing, but simply accumulating force for his main point: "How shall I feel," he asks suddenly (sect. <bibl n="Cic. Ver. 1.1.40">40</bibl>), "if I find this present case of Verres added to the long list of instances of corruption? His guilt is clear: <emph>it is the court that is on trial!</emph>" In this way what appears at the outset to be a personal attack on the opposing counsel is made a most effective means for the introduction of the central point of the whole oration.</p>

In this he shows clearly one of his principal motives in undertaking the prosecution, namely, to overthrow the latter's excessive control of the courts. The attack is skillfully introduced. His sole reason, he says, for departing from the ordinary course of procedure is that Hortensius does not wish to meet him in fair legal fight. The sally against Hortensius, again, serves as a transition to Cicero's final appeal to the sense of shame and the prudence of the court.

<p>The passage which follows is from the fourth oration of the <foreign lang="la">Accusatio</foreign>, the most famous of all, known as the <title lang="la">De Signis</title> because it treats chiefly of the works of art stolen by Verres. Cicero has been describing the plundering of many temples and public buildings, and in this passage he recounts in detail the case of one chief city, Syracuse, as a climax. Syracuse was by far the largest and richest of all the Greek cities of Italy and Sicily. It was a colony of Corinth, founded <date>B.C. 734</date>, and in course of time obtained the rule over the whole eastern part of Sicily. It remained independent, with a considerable territory, after the western part of the island (far the larger part) passed under the power of Rome in the First Punic War; but in the Second Punic War (B.C. 212) it was captured by Marcellus, and ever after was subject to Rome. It was at this time the capital of the province.

</p>
<p> The contrast between Verres and Marcellus is a brilliant one; nevertheless, the orator exaggerates, as on so many occasions.  "Not only did Marcellus stain his military honor by permitting a general pillage of the wealthy mercantile city, in the course of which Archimedes and many other citizens were put to death, but the Roman Senate lent a deaf ear to the complaints which the Syracusans afterwards presented regarding that celebrated general, and neither returned to individuals their property nor restored to the city its freedom" (Mommsen).

</p>
<p> Notwithstanding this doctrine, the Romans were often, as in the case of Marcellus, prevented by religious feeling (<foreign lang="la">religione</foreign>) from violating the sacred edifices of conquered cities.

<list type="simple"><item><bibl n="Cic. Man. 24">24</bibl>. Cicero supports the law purely from devotion to the commonwealth.</item></list></item></list></argument>
<p>The last serious resistance to the Roman power in the East was offered by Mithridates VI., king of Pontus, the most formidable enemy encountered by Rome since the death of Hannibal.     The dominions of Mithridates embraced the whole eastern coast of the Black Sea (Pontus Euxinus), including the kingdom of Bosporus (Crimea) on the one hand, and Paphlagonia on the other, while the king of Armenia also was closely allied to him by marriage.  There were three several "Mithridatic Wars."   In the First the Romans were commanded by Sulla (<dateRange from="-88" to="-84">88-84 B.C.</dateRange>), who gained great successes, and forced Mithridates to pay a large sum of money.    In the Second (<dateRange from="-83" to="-82">83-82</dateRange>), a short and unimportant affair, Murena, the Roman commander, was worsted. The Third broke out <date>B.C. 74</date>, and was successfully conducted by Lucius Licinius Lucullus, the ablest general of the aristocracy.
</p>
<p>When this war had continued for several years, the democratic faction (<foreign lang="la">populares</foreign>) took advantage of some temporary reverses sustained by Lucullus, and of the unpopularity of his administration, to revoke his command and give to the consul of B.C. 67, M'. Acilius Glabrio (the same who had presided at the trial of Verres), the eastern war as his "province."  The law effecting this change was proposed by  the tribune A. Gabinius, one of the most active demagogues of the time. Another law (<foreign lang="la">lex Gabinia</foreign>), proposed <date>B.C. 67</date> by the same politician, required the Senate to appoint a commander of consular rank, with extraordinary powers for three years by land and sea, to suppress the piracy which infested every part of the Mediterranean, having its chief seat in Cilicia.  It was understood as a matter of course that Gnaeus (or Cneius) Pompey, who had been living in retirement since his consulship, <date>B.C. 70</date>, would receive this appointment.  Pompey accomplished his task with the most brilliant success, and in three months had the seas completely cleared.  (See <bibl n="Cic. Man. 12">below, ch. xii</bibl>.)
</p>
<p>Meantime Glabrio had shown himself wholly incompetent to conduct the war against Mithridates, and early in <date>B.C. 66</date>, the tribune Caius Manilius proposed a law extending Pompey's command over the entire East.  Power like this was quite inconsistent with the republican institutions of Rome and with the established authority of the Senate; so that the law was of course opposed by the aristocracy (optimates), led by Hortensius and Catulus.    Cicero vas now praetor.    He was no democrat of the school of Gabinius and Caesar; but on the other hand he had no hereditary sympathies with the Senate, and he probably failed to recognize the revolutionary character of the proposition and considered merely its practical advantages.  He therefore advocated the passage of the Manilian Law with ardor.
</p>
<p>The law was passed, and Pompey fulfilled the most sanguine expectations of his friends.  He brought the Mithridatic War to an end, organized the Roman power throughout the East, and returned home, <date>B.C. 61</date>, with greater prestige and glory than had ever been won by any Roman before him.
</p>
<p>The Oration on the Manilian Law was Cicero's first political speech. Till now he had been a public-spirited lawyer; from this time on he was essentially a politician, and it is not hard to see how unfavorably his character was influenced by contact with the corrupt politics of that day.
</p>
<p>The Oration for the Manilian Law is a famous example of a <emph>deliberative</emph> oration constructed on a systematic rhetorical plan.  <table> <row role="data"><cell cols="1" role="label" rows="1"> I.</cell><cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1"><foreign lang="la">Exordium</foreign> (introduction): Chap. <bibl n="Cic.

<p>The oration was delivered in a <foreign lang="la">contio</foreign> or public meeting of Roman citizens held not for voting, but for debate or address merely. A <foreign lang="la">contio</foreign> could be called by any magistrate who had a matter to lay before the people, and was held regularly in the <foreign lang="la">Comitium</foreign> or the Forum.  After a <foreign lang="la">rogatio</foreign> (proposition of a law) had been offered, such a meeting was regularly convened in order that the voters might hear the arguments on both sides.  Later the <foreign lang="la">comitia</foreign> voted on the bill, Yes or No.
</p>
<p> Thus the present speech in many respects resembled our modern political addresses on important public measures, like the tariff or the currency.  It has, however, an official character.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">quem ad finem</lemma>:  almost equivalent to <foreign lang="la">quamdiu</foreign>, but implying some shock or crisis (<foreign lang="la">finem</foreign>) which must follow.

<milestone n="99.4" unit="pg_l"/></p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Palati</lemma>: one of the strongest positions in the city, commanding the Forum, and so most likely to be seized by the conspirators.  The <foreign lang="la">Palatium</foreign>, an isolated hill, of a rudely quadrangular shape, was the original seat of the city of Rome, from which the city spread gradually over the other hills. In the last years of the Republic, the Palatine became the fashionable place for residences.  Here was Cicero's house as well as Catiline's.  It was because of its nearness to his house, as well as because of the strength of its position, that Cicero selected this temple for the meeting of the Senate on this occasion.  Under the Empire the Palatine became the seat of the imperial residence, and its name, <gloss>palace</gloss>, has passed in this sense into most modern languages.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">bonorum</lemma>: the Senate was surrounded by a crowd of <foreign lang="la">equites</foreign> and other citizens (see sect. <bibl n="Cic. Catil. 1.21">21</bibl>, below).

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">locus</lemma>: the Senate was assembled, not, as usual, in the <foreign lang="la">Curia Hostilia</foreign>, but in the Temple of Jupiter Stator, which occupied a commanding position on the brow of the Palatine Hill and faced the Sacred Way.  The ruins of this temple were discovered some years ago (see view in text).

<milestone n="100.12" unit="pg_l"/></p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">ad mortem</lemma>: the consuls originally possessed full powers of judgment in criminal cases, including punishment by death.  These highest powers of the <foreign lang="la">imperium</foreign> were suspended within the city by laws which gave the right of appeal to the people (note, <ref n="pl110.16" targOrder="U">p. 110, l. 16</ref>), but the Senate could revive them in cases of danger by the formula <foreign lang="la">Videant consules ne quid res publica detrimenti capiat</foreign>, &mdash; a proceeding analogous to the proclamation of martial law.  This action the Senate had taken Oct.21, nearly three weeks before.

<milestone n="100.13" unit="pg_l"/></p>

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">vir amplissimus</lemma>, <foreign lang="la">pontifex maximus</foreign>: observe how these words strengthen the force of the example.

<milestone n="100.18" unit="pg_l"/></p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Ti.

Requiring more time to make his legislation effective, he attempted illegally to secure his own re-election as tribune, when he was attacked and killed by a mob of Senators headed by P. Scipio Nasica.

<milestone n="100.16" unit="pg_l"/></p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">privatus</lemma>: at the time referred to, Nasica was only a private citizen of consular rank.  He afterwards went into exile, and was made Pontifex Maximus in his absence.  The word <foreign lang="la">privatus</foreign> is rhetorically opposed to <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">nos consules</lemma>.

</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Opimius</lemma>: Lucius Opimius was consul <date value="-121">B.C. 121</date>, when Caius Gracchus, the younger brother of Tiberius, was attempting to carry through a series of measures far more revolutionary than those of his brother.  The Senate took alarm, and entrusted the consul with absolute power. In the tumult that ensued, some 3,000 are said to have lost their lives, including Gracchus and his leading associate, Fulvius.

He was secretly in league with the revolutionists,  &mdash;Saturninus and Servilius Glaucia, corrupt demagogues, unworthy imitators of the noble Gracchi.  When it came to the point, however, the courage of Marius failed him: he deserted his accomplices, and joined the Senate in crushing the revolt.

<p>Two courses were open to Catiline: to leave the city or to run his chances of being put to death.  If he left the city, he could, of course, either join his accomplice Manlius in the insurgent camp at Faesulae, or abandon his projects and go into voluntary exile.  Apparently some of the Senators had privately urged him to adopt the latter alternative, promising, in that case, that all proceedings should be dropped, and Catiline, though rejecting their advice, had declared that he would not refuse to obey a <foreign lang="la">senatus consultum</foreign> decreeing his banishment.  Such a decree would, however, have been favorable to Catiline's plans, for, since he bad not been formally brought to trial, he would have been able to pose as an injured citizen exiled by an arbitrary aristocratic party.  Hence Cicero refuses to put the question to the Senate, though he asserts there could be no doubt about the result.  By taking this course Cicero forced Catiline to make his intentions plain by the overt act of leaving the city of his own accord and hastening to the camp of Manlius.

<p>Now that Catiline had been driven into open war, the conspiracy within the city was in the hands of utterly incompetent men. Lentulus, who claimed the lead by virtue of his consular rank, was vain, pompous, and inefficient. The next in rank, Cethegus, was energetic enough, but rash and bloodthirsty. The consul easily kept the run of events, and at last succeeded in getting the conspirators to commit themselves in writing, when he had no difficulty in arresting them and securing the documents. How this was accomplished is told in the third oration.

<p>Two days later the Senate was convened, to determine what was to be done with the prisoners. It was a fundamental principle of the Roman constitution that no citizen should be put to death without the right of appeal to the people. Against the view of Caesar, which favored perpetual confinement, Cicero urged that, by the fact of taking up arms against the Republic, the conspirators had forfeited their citizenship, and that therefore the law did not protect them. This view prevailed, and the conspirators &mdash; Lentulus, Cethegus, Statilius, Gabinius, and Caeparius &mdash; were strangled by the public executioners.
</p>
<p> As this is the first deliberative oration, delivered in the Senate, contained in this collection, it will be well for the student to consult the account of a senatorial debate given in the Introduction, p. lvii.
</p>
<p> In the present case &mdash; in which the question was what sentence should be passed upon the captured conspirators &mdash; the consul elect, D. Junius Silanus, had advised that they be put to death; C. Julius Caesar (as praetor elect), on the contrary, that they be merely kept in custody. At the end of the discussion, Cicero, as presiding consul, gave his views as expressed in the present oration.  (For the speeches of Caesar and Cato, see Sallust, Catiline, chs. 51,52.)

When Gracchus and Flaccus found themselves (<date value="-121">B.C. 121</date>) drawn into a collision with the Senate, they sent the young son of Flaccus with a proposition of compromise.  The Senate, however, refused to listen to any terms, threw the messenger into prison, &mdash; where he was afterwards strangled, &mdash;and moved upon the insurgents with all the power of the state.  In the contest that followed, both leaders and several thousands of their partisans lost their lives.  It was to these events that L.

<p>The case of Archias, though not a public one, yet had its origin in the politics of the time.  The aristocratic faction, suspecting that much of the strength of their opponents was derived from the fraudulent votes of those who were not citizens, procured in B.C. 65 the passage of the <foreign lang="la">Lex Papia</foreign>, by which "all the strangers who possessed neither Roman nor Latin burgess-rights were to be ejected from the capital." Archias, the poet, a native of Antioch, but for many years a Roman citizen, a friend and client of Lucius Lucullus, was accused in <date>B.C. 62.</date> by a certain Gratius, under this law, on the ground that he was not a citizen.  Cicero, a personal friend of Archias, undertook the defence, and the case was tried before the brother of the orator, Quintus Cicero, then praetor
</p>
<p>It was a very small matter to disprove the charge and establish Archias' claims to citizenship.  The greater part of this speech, therefore, is made up of a eulogy upon the poet and upon poetry and literature in general. It is, for this reason, one of the most agreeable of Cicero's orations, and perhaps the greatest favorite of them all.

Latin became the official language; justice was administered by Roman law; and in most cases their government was organized on the model of Rome, having <foreign lang="la">duumviri</foreign>,for consuls, and a <foreign lang="la">curia</foreign> for the Senate.  The passage here given from the Plautian-Papirian Law contains its application to citizens of foreign birth, like Archias.

<p>T. Annius Milo was a young man of good family and a recognized leader, on the aristocratic side, in the turbulent politics of the time during the absence of Caesar in Gaul and following the disastrous campaign of Crassus in the East. His bitterest opponent was P. Clodius, the leader of the popular party, a man of high birth and versatile talents, but of infamous life, and an unscrupulous partisan. Both sides depended to a great extent on organized violence. On the one side was the city mob, headed by Clodius. On the other, Milo maintained a band of professional bullies and prize-fighters (<foreign lang="la">gladiatores</foreign>).
</p>
<p>Under these two leaders, the old political strife, always attended with some violence, became almost a succession of riots. The disorders were so great that the year <date>B.C. 53</date> was half over before the consuls, who should have been chosen six months before the beginning of the year, could be elected. When finally, in July, 53, Cn. Domitius Calvinus and M. Valerius Messala were chosen, the campaign for the following  year began at once. Milo was a candidate for the consulship, and Clodius for the praetorship. Riots were of almost daily occurrence, and no elections could be held. The year 52 began without either consuls or praetors in office, and it became obvious that peace could be restored only by the death of either Clodius or Milo. The latter was a candidate for the consulship, but his election had been successfully resisted by Clodius. On the 18th of January the quarrel came to a bloody crisis. Milo had set out from Rome, towards nightfall, with a large retinue, including his troop of armed guards, for Lanuvium, a village about twenty miles SE. of Rome, where he held an office of some local dignity. He was met on the Appian Way, a few miles out, by Clodius, who was returning to the city from one of his estates on horseback, with thirty armed attendants. As they passed each other, their followers came to blows. Clodius was wounded, and driven into a shop or tavern by the wayside. Milo, unwilling to leave so dangerous an enemy alive, followed him up; and Clodius, with a dozen others, among them the owner of the tavern, was killed. The meeting was probably accidental on both sides; but each had openly threatened the other's life, and hence each party loudly accused the other of premeditated assault and actual or intended murder. Anarchy broke loose in Rome. The funeral of Clodius was an occasion of riot and conflagration. Other disorders followed. Quiet was only restored by the appointment of Pompey as "consul without colleague" (practically dictator), and for about six months the city was held by him under a sort of martial law. A special court was established for the trial of all cases arising out of the brawl in the Appian Way. The arraignment of Milo before this court on the charge of assault and homicide took place about the 10th of April. Cicero undertook his defence both from political motives and from personal regard. By Pompey's orders the court was surrounded by armed troops (a strange sight at that time in Rome) to protect it from the violence of the mob which raged outside. Cicero, whose nerves were shaken by the uproar, lost his self-command, and spoke "not with his usual firmness." Milo was condemned by thirty-eight votes out of fifty-one, and went into exile at Marseilles. Cicero, dissatisfied with the speech actually delivered, as taken down by short-hand, wrote out at his leisure the masterpiece of eloquence and specious argument which follows.

<p> The second part of the <foreign lang="la">Confirmatio</foreign> comprises sects. <bibl n="Cic. Mil. 72">72</bibl>-<bibl n="Cic. Mil. 75">75</bibl>.  The real case, Cicero says, is now complete, for he has shown that Milo killed Clodius in self-defence.  But, even if Milo had not had this justification, his act would deserve reward rather than punishment, for the killing of Clodius was a service to the state.  If Milo were guilty he would boast of his guilt.  It is impossible, however, to claim this merit for Milo, for the death of Clodius was the work of the gods, who, to save the republic, prompted him to attack Milo. This part of the <foreign lang="la">Confirmatio</foreign> is managed with great skill.  In effect, it is an appeal to the judges to recognize the relief which the state feels in the death of Clodius and not to punish Milo for what is really a meritorious deed. In form, however, it is an additional argument in support of the main contention, &mdash; that Milo acted in self-defence; for it is incredible, Cicero urges, that, if he had really planned to kill Clodius, he should not now admit it and secure the gratitude of the whole country.  By giving the argument this form, Cicero makes two inconsistent theories of the defence tell in favor of his client. </p>

<p>Marcus Claudius Marcellus (consul, B.C. 51) had been an honest but active and bitter partisan of the Senate in the struggle which finally broke out in civil war. It was he who introduced the several decrees which set a limit to Caesar's power and put him in the attitude of a public enemy. Even after the defeat at Pharsalia, and the death of Pompey, he refused to make terms with the victor, and remained in voluntary exile at Mitylene. When, contrary to the general fear, no massacre or proscription followed Caesar's victory, the friends of Marcellus were encouraged to hope for a full pardon; and, in the summer of <date>B.C. 46</date>, at a meeting of the Senate, Caesar was openly entreated in his behalf. In reply, the dictator reminded the senators of the intense and persistent hostility of Marcellus; but added that he would not stand in the way if the Senate desired his restoration. The senators were accordingly called on for the expression of their wishes; and, when it came to Cicero's turn, he expressed the formal thanks of the body in the following speech. The oration is remarkable &mdash; especially in contrast to the language which Cicero used two years later&mdash;for  its tone of eulogy in regard to Caesar, and for the hope it expresses of an era of good feeling and a restored republic.
</p>
<p>Marcellus set out for Rome, but never arrived. He was assassinated at the Piraeus, and buried in the Academy near Athens.
</p>
<p>This oration for Marcellus is not argumentative but eulogistic, belonging to the <foreign lang="la">genus demonstrativum</foreign> (see general Introd., p. xli).  It is therefore not divided into <foreign lang="la">narratio</foreign>, <foreign lang="la">confirmatio</foreign>, etc., like most of the other orations in this volume.

<p>Quintus Ligarius, in the first year of the Civil War, had held a subordinate position in Africa, under the Pompeian general, P. Attius Varus. In this capacity it had fallen to him to prevent the landing of L. Aelius Tubero, whom the Senate had sent to take command in Africa, but to whom Varus refused to give up the post. When the war was over, Caesar spared the life of Ligarius, but kept him in exile, until a personal application for his recall was made by his brother, T. Ligarius. Quintus Tubero (afterwards a distinguished jurist) came forward to oppose this, on the ground that Ligarius had not merely taken sides in the Civil War, but had stood with Juba and the foreign enemies of Rome against his native country. The case was argued in the Forum before Caesar himself, sitting in judgment as Dictator. With characteristic magnanimity, Caesar gave Ligarius a full pardon. This Ligarius requited, a year and a half later, by joining in the plot for his murder.
</p>
<p>Though the case of Ligarius is of no importance in itself, the speech of Cicero in his defence ranks among the first of his orations in rhetorical merit, and is interesting, besides, for the glimpse it gives of the state of feeling in Rome during Caesar's dictatorship.

<p>A strange charge is this, &mdash; that Ligarius was in Africa; and this charge is confessed: Ligarius must then depend on Caesar's mercy only.
</p>
<p> The first section is elaborately ironical: to have been in Africa was, of course, no crime, nor was the fact that Ligarius had been there unknown.  The whole not merely leads up to Cicero's main contention (that the siding of Ligarius with the Pompeians was due to circumstances and not to hatred of Caesar), but introduces his clever sarcasm on Tubero, himself an ex-Pompeian (sect. <bibl n="Cic.

<p> With the praise of Caesar in the Orations for Marcellus and Ligarius compare the celebrated portrait of him in Cicero's Second Philippic, published shortly after Caesar's death.  This is interesting as the only extant testimony, publicly spoken at the time, of one who was at once contemporary, rival, and peer: <quote><foreign lang="la">Fuit in illo ingenium, ratio, memoria, litterae, cura, cogitatio, diligentia. Res bello gesserat, quamvis rei publicae calamitosas, at tamen magnas. Multos annos regnare meditatus, magno labore, multis periculis, quod cogitarat effecerat. Muneribus, monimentis, congiariis, epulis multitudinem imperitam delenierat: suos praemiis, adversarios clementiae specie devinxerat.  Quid multa? attulerat jam liberae civitati, partim metu partim patientia, consuetudinem serviendi. Sed ex plurimis malis, quae ab illo rei publicae sunt inusta, hoc tamen boni est, quod didicit jam populus Romanus quantum cuique crederet, quibus se committeret, a quibus caveret</foreign>.</quote></p></div4></div3></div2></div1>

<p> The Fourteenth Philippic consists of two parts, one argumentative and the other eulogistic.  There is no lack of connection, however, for the argument is necessary as a basis for the eulogy.  The substance of the speech may be stated in one sentence: "Antony is an enemy to the state (<foreign lang="la">hostis</foreign>) ; hence the victory of the consuls should receive the honors regularly awarded only to successes in foreign wars."  The opening passage (sects. <bibl n="Cic. Phil. 14 0">0</bibl><bibl n="Cic. Phil. 14.1">1</bibl>-<bibl n="Cic. Phil. 14.5">5</bibl>) is in form an objection to the proposed vote to lay aside the military garb; but it is in effect an <foreign lang="la">exordium</foreign>, since it serves to introduce Cicero's first proposition, &mdash; that Antony is a public enemy.  This proposition is established in sects. <bibl n="Cic. Phil. 14 0">0</bibl><bibl n="Cic. Phil. 14.6">6</bibl>-<bibl n="Cic. Phil. 14.25">25</bibl>, and the rest of the oration is a tribute of honor to the generals and their soldiers. The <foreign lang="la">sententia</foreign> with which the address concludes (sects. <bibl n="Cic. Phil. 14.36">36</bibl>-<bibl n="Cic. Phil. 14.38">38</bibl>) sums up all that Cicero has said, and takes the place of the usual <foreign lang="la">peroratio</foreign>.
</p>
<p> Sects. <bibl n="Cic. Phil. 14.13">13</bibl>-<bibl n="Cic. Phil. 14.20">20</bibl> form a digression in which Cicero defends himself from certain attacks on the purity of his intentions.  But this digression is closely connected on the one hand with the rejoicings over the victory and on the other with the necessity of declaring Antony a <foreign lang="la">hostis</foreign>. </p></argument>
<p>Julius Caesar was assassinated on the Ides of March (March 15), <date>B.C. 44</date>, by a band of conspirators, headed by Marcus Junius Brutus and Caius Cassius Longinus. The conspirators fancied that if the dictator were out of the way the old constitution could be restored. But Caesar's victory had made a republic forever impossible. Nor had the conspirators made any arrangements for a permanent government, or even for their own safety. The sole question was, who should succeed to the supreme power of the murdered dictator. And the only persons who had any real claims were Caesar's surviving colleague in the consulship, Mark Antony, and the young Octavianus, Caesar's grand-nephew, adopted son, and heir (afterwards the emperor Augustus).
</p>
<p>Antony, who had come into possession of Caesar's papers and estates, caused his "acts" to be legally confirmed, seized the public funds, abolished the office of dictator, and secured as large a share of authority as he could. He was a man of inordinate ambition, controlled only by an equally unbounded self-indulgence, utterly without principle or scruple, and (if we may trust the character of him drawn by Cicero) a  monster of profligacy and crime. He had married for his third wife Fulvia, widow of Publius Clodius, and shared, with her, that tribune's vindictive hate of Cicero. His colleague was P. Cornelius Dolabella, Cicero's son-in-law, who had assumed the consulship at Caesar's death, on the ground that the latter had appointed him his successor in that office. Dolabella dallied with the conspirators, suppressed the violence of the mob that threatened them, and might have had some pretensions to the power, with the support of the aristocracy, but was easily out-generalled or bought off by Antony. Lepidus, who had a military command, and in whom the aristocracy had some hope, was also gained over by him. Octavianus, now twenty years old, hastened from Epirus to claim his inheritance and take part in the conflict which he saw approaching. He was a young man of precocious talent, of cool and wary temper, of ambition equal to Antony's, and of a political sagacity which, through his long life, seems never to have been at fault.
</p>
<p>Neither of the two chief claimants was strong enough alone to be quite independent of the other. At first, however, they stood in the attitude of rivals, and in their antagonism there seemed still some hope for the republic. Each endeavored to secure the countenance of the Senate and to gain control over the public armies; and each succeeded in attaching to himself a considerable force, though neither was strong enough to hold the capital against the other.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile Cicero, who at first hailed the death of Caesar as the restoration of the republic, lost courage, and set out in July for Greece. Detained, however, by contrary winds, and receiving more favorable news from Rome, he returned to the city at the end of August, to find that all his hopes were idle. Still, he made an effort at conciliation, in a speech in the Senate, on the 2d of September. In this he replied severely to an attack made upon him by Antony the day before, but still took pains to leave the door open for a restoration of good-will. It was to no purpose. Antony replied, September 19, with such bitterness &mdash;directly charging Cicero with the murder of Clodius and of Caesar &mdash; that it was clear he meant there should be no alternative but civil war. Cicero did not venture to answer him in the Senate; but replied, ten weeks later, in a pamphlet &mdash; by many regarded as his masterpiece &mdash; as bitter and uncompromising as the consul's attack. From its likeness in tone to the famous invectives of Demosthenes against  Philip of Macedon, this was called a "Phiippic"; and the term has  been extended to the entire series of fourteen orations against Antony,  commencing with that of September 2, and ending with the triumphant  speech (given below) with which Cicero's political career closed.
</p>
<p>The winter was spent in attempts at negotiation, every stage illustrated by the running commentary of Cicero's Philippics. At last, in the spring of <date>B.C. 43</date>, diplomacy was at an end. Actual hostilities broke out first in Cisalpine Gaul, where Decimus Brutus&mdash;who had taken command of that province, according to Caesar's last will&mdash;held the town of Mutina (Modena) against Antony. Octavianus, with his independent force, had also ranged himself on the side of the Senate. The consuls of that year, Aulus Hirtius and C. Vibius Pansa, had, after some hesitation, vigorously taken up the same cause. In April the consuls met Antony in two battles, &mdash; on the 15th at Bononia (Bologna), on the 27th near Mutina. In both he was defeated; but in the first Pansa was mortally wounded, and in the second Hirtius was killed. It was on the reception of the news of the victory at Bononia, while Pansa's fate was unknown, that Cicero, in the Senate, delivered his fourteenth and last Philippic (April 22).
</p>
<p>The rejoicings were soon at an end. Octavianus found that his own interests were best served by uniting with Antony against the Senate. These two &mdash; with Lepidus as a third triumvir &mdash; came easily into possession of supreme power. A remorseless proscription followed, in which the most illustrious victim was Cicero, sacrificed to Antony's resentment, the vindictive hate of Fulvia, and the cold ingratitude of Octavianus.
</p>
<p>Of the fourteen Philippics, the Second is by far the most famous. It is a long and elaborate invective, &mdash; in some parts exceedingly bitter and coarse, &mdash; reviewing the domestic and political career of Mark Antony, and charging him with every personal vice and almost every public crime. In its allusions to the acts of Caesar, its hostility is uncompromising, vindictive, often scornful. The revival of the title "perpetual dictator" seems to have inspired Cicero with hatred, horror, and fear; and his real enmity was no longer disguised after Caesar's death.
</p>
<p>The Fourteenth Philippic has a unique interest as the last free voice of the Roman Senate, and from its ill-timed confidence in the future emperor. It is also interesting as an example of labored and stately panegyric, after the manner of the Greeks, on patriots fallen in battle, and from the formal resolution of thanks and honor with which it closes. Its immediate occasion was a resolution of P. Servilius, that the citizens should lay aside the military garb and that a public thanksgiving should be celebrated in honor of the victory of Hirtius and Pansa at Bononia.

Only magistrates had the right to take the auspices (see note, Cat. 4, sect., <ref n="pl142.4" targOrder="U">p. 142, l. 4</ref>).  The augur was not in any sense a magistrate, though he had the power of interpreting the auspices.  Hence Cicero, though an augur, would be unable to take the first step to any usurpation of power. A technical obstacle like this would not stand long in the way of a modern usurper; but the stress here laid upon it illustrates the degree to which the peculiar formalism of the Roman religion had become worked into the Roman mind, and, further, the power that lay in this formalism to protect the institutions of the state.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">sententia</lemma>, i.e. a formal proposition for a decree (analogous to "a motion reduced to writing " in a modern deliberative assembly).  In the Roman Senate questions were proposed only by a magistrate; and this was done not in the form of a set motion, as with us, but the whole question was presented (<foreign lang="la">de re referre</foreign>) for discussion. The result of the deliberation might be several formal propositions for a decree, all, any, or none of which might be formally put to vote by the presiding officer. If one of these was carried, it would stand as the <foreign lang="la">senatus consultum</foreign>.  (Cf. Introd., p. lvii, above).
</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">complectar</lemma>, i.e. <gloss>my views on the whole question</gloss>.

<p>What follows is a somewhat rare example of a regular resolution of the Senate.  The stately and formal character of the language is noteworthy.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">senatum. . . judicare</lemma>, indir. disc. depending on <foreign lang="la">censeo</foreign> (l. 7); in the decree it would be <foreign lang="la">senatus . . . judicat</foreign>

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">uti . . . constituat</lemma>: in the decree this would depend on some word of commanding (like <foreign lang="la">decernit</foreign>) in the heading; hence it stands unchanged in Cicero's indirect statement.

<milestone n="255.26" unit="pg_l"/></p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">alter ambove</lemma>: the <foreign lang="la">imperium</foreign> of the two consuls was absolutely equal, and the power of neither was impaired by the special assignment of any duty to the other. Any such special assignment of functions was only made by mutual consent, and either had a legal right to interfere in the other's province.  Of course, however, any such interference was regarded as unwarranted, and in practice the two colleagues either took turns in the administration or agreed upon a division of functions between them.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">pulvinaria</lemma>: see note on Cat. 3, sect. <bibl n="Cic. Catil. 3.23">23</bibl> (<ref n="pl137.14" targOrder="U">p. 137, l. 14</ref>). A <foreign lang="la">supplicatio</foreign> was one of the few religious rites of the Romans in which the whole people took part.  The proper temples were opened and the gods symbolically served with a feast The citizens repaired to these temples and paid their individual devotions to the gods in peculiar forms of humiliation not ordinarily observed in the public sacrifices. </p></div4>
