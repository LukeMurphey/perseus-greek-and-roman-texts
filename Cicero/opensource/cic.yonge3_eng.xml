					<head>THE SPEECH OF M. T. CICERO FOR HIS HOUSE. ADDRESSED TO THE PRIESTS</head>
					<argument>
						<head>THE ARGUMENT.</head>
						<p>Cicero soon after his consulship, had purchased the house of Marcus
                            Crassus on the <placeName key="tgn,2565724">Palatine Hill</placeName>,
                            which adjoined that in which he had always lived with his father; it was
                            one of the finest houses in <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, and cost him nearly thirty thousand pounds, and
                            was joined to the colonnade or portico called by the name of Catulus,
                            who had built it out of the Cimbric spoils on that area where Flaccus
                            formerly lived, whose house had been demolished by public authority for
                            his seditious union with Caius Gracchus. </p>
						<p>As soon as Clodius had carried his decree against Cicero after his
                            flight, he immediately began plundering and destroying all his houses;
                            the consuls, <persName><surname>Piso</surname></persName> and Gabinius,
                            divided the greater part of his furniture and of the ornaments of his
                            house and villa between them; and, in the hope of making the loss of his
                            house at <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> irretrievable,
                            Clodius consecrated the area on which it stood to the service of
                            religion, building on it a temple to Liberty, and he pulled down the
                            adjoining portico of Catulus in order to rebuild it of the same order as
                            the temple. The law being that a consecration, legally performed, made
                            the thing consecrated inapplicable ever after to any private use. </p>
						<p>The affair was to be determined by the college of priests, who were the
                            judges in all cases relating to religion; since the senate could only
                            make a provisional decree, that, if the priests discharged the ground
                            from the service of religion, then in that case the consuls should
                            rebuild the house at the public charge. The cause now came before the
                            priests on the last day of September. Cicero endeavoured, in the first
                            place, to disabuse their minds of any enmity to him which might have
                            been instilled into their minds by Clodius on account of his late
                            conduct with respect to Pompey. (For there had been a great scarcity at
                                <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, partly occasioned by
                            the great multitudes that had come from all parts of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> on Cicero's account; and Cicero
                            had supported a resolution of the senate by which Pompey was entreated
                            to undertake the province of restoring plenty to the city, and to this
                            end the consuls had been ordered to draw up a law by which the whole
                            administration of the corn and provisions of the republic was granted to
                            Pompey for five years. And in consequence of Cicero's advocacy of the
                            measure Clodius endeavoured to excite odium against him, as having
                            deserted the cause of the senate to pay court to Pompey; though the
                            measure had been very successful, as the credit of Pompey's name
                            immediately reduced the price of provisions in the markets.) </p>
						<p>As, however, the main question turned upon the legality of the
                            consecration, Cicero applies to establish the fact of its illegality by
                            proving that Clodius could not legally consecrate anything, as his
                            election to the tribunate was illegal; since his adoption into a
                            plebeian family, or at least into that particular family into which he
                            had been adopted, was in violation and defiance of all the laws made for
                            such cases; if his adoption was illegal, clearly he could not have
                            legally been elected tribune, nor have legally done any action as
                            tribune. </p>
						<p>The priests decided that if he who performed the office of consecration
                            had not been legally authorized to do so, then the area in question
                            might without any scruple of religion be restored to Cicero. The point
                            of law they left to the senate, who, after many interruptions from
                            Clodius and Serranus, passed a decree that Cicero's damage should be
                            made good to him, and his houses rebuilt at the public charge. </p>
						<p>Cicero himself thought very highly of this speech, and published it
                            immediately; and says, in one of his <bibl n="Cic. Att. 4.2">letters to
                                Atticus, (iv. 2)</bibl> that &ldquo;if ever he was great in
                            speaking, he was so especially now, as his indignation and the greatness
                            of the injury done to him gave him especial energy and force of
                            oratory.&rdquo; Some critics, but apparently without any good
                            reason, have doubted the genuineness of this oration.</p>

					<p>Many things, O priests, have been devised and established with divine wisdom
                        by our ancestors; but no action of theirs was ever more wise than their
                        determination that the same men should superintend both what relates to the
                        religious worship due to the immortal gods, and also what concerns the
                        highest interests of the state, so that they might preserve the republic as
                        the most honourable and eminent of the citizens, by governing it well, and
                        as priests by wisely interpreting the requirements of religion. But if there
                        has ever been a time when an important cause has depended on the decision
                        and power of the priests of the Roman people, this indeed is that cause;
                        being such that the dignity of the whole republic, the safety of all the
                        citizens, their lives, their liberties, their altars, their hearths, their
                        household gods, their properties and condition as citizens, and their homes,
                        all appear to be committed and entrusted to your wisdom integrity, and
                        power. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> You have got to decide this day
                        whether you prefer for the future to deprive frantic and profligate
                        magistrates of the protection of wicked and unprincipled citizens, or even
                        to arm them with the cloak of religion and of the respect due to the
                        immortal gods. For if that pest and conflagration of the republic succeeds
                        in defending his own mischievous and fatal tribunate by appeals to divine
                        religion, when he cannot maintain it by any considerations of human equity,
                        then we must seek for other ceremonies, for other ministers of the immortal
                        gods, for other interpreters of the requirements of religion. But if those
                        things which were done by the madness of wicked men in the republic at a
                        time when it was oppressed by one party, deserted by another, and betrayed
                        by a third, are annulled by your authority and your wisdom, O priests, then
                        we shall have cause rightly and deservedly to praise the wisdom of our
                        ancestors in selecting the most honourable men of the state for the
                        priesthood. </p>
					<p><milestone n="3" unit="section"/> But since that madman has thought that he
                        should find a ready road to your attention by blaming the sentiments that I
                        in the last few days have expressed in the senate concerning the republic, I
                        will deviate from the natural arrangement of my speech, and I will make a
                        reply to what I will not call the speech of that furious fellow, (for that
                        is more than he is capable of,) but to his abuse, that being an employment
                        which he has fortified himself in the practice of by his own intolerable bad
                        temper, and by the length of time that he has been allowed to indulge it
                        with impunity. <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>And in the first place, I ask you this, O you insane and frantic man, what
                        excessive punishment for your wickednesses and crimes is it that distracts
                        you so as to make you think that these men&mdash;men of their high
                        character, who support the dignity of the republic, not only by their
                        wisdom, but also by their dignified appearance&mdash;are angry with me,
                        because in delivering my opinion I connected the safety of the citizens with
                        the honour of Cnaeus Pompeius, and that they are likely at this present time
                        to have different feelings with respect to the general interests of religion
                        from those which they entertained when I was absent? <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;you had
                        the advantage before the priests, but now you must inevitably get worst off
                        since you have had recourse to the people.&rdquo; Is it so? Will you
                        transfer that which is the greatest defect in the ignorant
                        multitude,&mdash;namely, its fickleness and inconstancy, and change of
                        opinion, as frequent as the changes of the weather, to these men, whose
                        gravity protects them from inconsistency, while their fixed and definite
                        principles of religion and the antiquity of precedents, and the authority of
                        written records and monuments, effectually deters them from all capricious
                        change of sentiment? &ldquo;Are you,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;the
                        man whom the senate was unable to do without? whom the good lamented? whom
                        the republic regretted? by whose restoration we expected that the authority
                        of the senate was restored? and who destroyed that authority the very first
                        thing you did?&rdquo; I am not at present speaking of my own matters; I
                        will first of all reply to your impudence. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>Did you then, O you deadly pest of the republic, by means of the sword and
                        arms, by the terror of an armed force, by the wickedness of the consuls, and
                        the threats of most audacious men,&mdash;by enlisting slaves, by
                        besieging the temples, by occupying the forum, by oppressing the senate,
                        contrive to compel the departure of that citizen from his home and from his
                        country, in order to prevent actual battles between the virtuous and wicked
                        citizens,&mdash;though you now confess that he was regretted and sent
                        for back and recalled by the senate, by all good men, and by the whole of
                            <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, as the only means of
                        preserving the republic? &ldquo;But on that day of disturbance you ought
                        not,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;to have come into the senate, you ought
                        not to have entered the Capitol.&rdquo; <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>But I did not come, and I kept in my own house as long as that disturbance
                        lasted; while it was notorious that your slaves had come with you armed into
                        the Capitol, ready for plunder and for the massacre of all good men, with
                        all that band of wicked and profligate partisans of yours. And when this was
                        reported to me, I know that I remained at home, and would not give you and
                        your gladiators power of renewing the massacre. After news was brought to me
                        that the Roman people had assembled at the Capitol, because of their fear
                        for, and difficulty of procuring corn, and that the ministers of your crimes
                        had been frightened and had fled, some having dropped their swords, and some
                        having had them taken from them, I came forward not only without any armed
                        band, but with only a very few friends. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                        Should I, when Publius Lentulus the consul, who had conferred the greatest
                        benefits on me and on the republic,&mdash;when Quintus Metellus, your
                        brother, O Metellus, who, though he had been my enemy, had still preferred
                        my safety and dignity to any desire to keep alive our quarrel, and to your
                        entreaties that he would do so, sent for me to the senate,&mdash;when
                        that great multitude of citizens, who had lately shown such zeal in my
                        behalf, entreated me by name to show my gratitude to them,&mdash;should
                        I, I say, have declined to come forward, especially when it was notorious
                        that you with your band of runaway slaves had already left the place? Have
                        you dared to call me&mdash;me, the guardian and defender of the Capitol
                        and of every temple&mdash;the enemy of the Capitol, because, when the
                        two consuls were holding the senate in the Capitol, I came thither? Is there
                        any time at which it can be discreditable to have attended the senate? or
                        was that business which was then being transacted of such a nature that I
                        was bound to repudiate the affair itself, and to condemn those who were
                        promoting it? <milestone n="4" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>First, I say that it is the duty of a virtuous senator at all times to attend
                        the senate; and I do not agree with those who determine that they themselves
                        will not come to the senate at unfavourable seasons, and who do not
                        understand that this excessive obstinacy of theirs is exceedingly pleasant
                        and acceptable to those men whose wishes they intend to counteract.
                        &ldquo;But some departed out of fear, because they thought that they
                        could not remain with safety in the senate.&rdquo; I do not name them,
                        nor do I ask whether they had any real reason for fearing anything. I
                        imagine that every one had a right to form his own opinion as to what
                        grounds he had for fear. Do you ask why I was not afraid? Why, because it
                        was known that you had gone away. Do you ask why, when some good men thought
                        that they could not remain with safety in the senate, I did not think so
                        too? or why, when I thought that it was impossible for me to remain in the
                        city at all with safety, they did not think so too? Are then others to be
                        allowed, and rightly enough, to have no fear for themselves at a time when I
                        am in danger; and yet am I bound to be afraid not only when I am myself in
                        peril, but when others are also? </p>
					<p><milestone n="9" unit="section"/>Or am I to be blamed because I did not
                        express an opinion condemnatory of both the consuls? Ought I then to condemn
                        those men, of all men in the world, by whose law it was brought about that
                        I, who had never been condemned and who had deserved well of the republic,
                        should be saved from enduring the punishment of condemned criminals? Was I,
                        of all men in the world, I who had been restored to my former dignity by
                        their means, to denounce by my expressed opinion the admirable sentiments of
                        those men, who, even if they had been in error, ought to have been borne
                        with by me and by all good men, on account of their exceeding good-will
                        displayed in ensuring my preservation? And what were the opinions which I
                        delivered? In the first place, that one which the common conversation of the
                        people had already previously fixed in our minds; in the second place, that
                        one which had been discussed in the senate on the preceding days; and
                        thirdly, that which the senate in a very full house adopted, expressing its
                        agreement with me; so that so sudden or novel proposition was brought
                        forward by me, and moreover, if there be any fault in the opinion, it is sot
                        more the fault of the individual who advanced it than of all those men who
                        approved of it. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>&ldquo;But the
                        decision of the senate was not free, because of the fear in which they
                        were.&rdquo; If you make out that they who left it were in fear, at
                        least grant that they who remained were not alarmed. But if no free decision
                        could be come to without the presence of those men who were absent at that
                        time, I say that the motion about framing a resolution of the senate began
                        to be made when every one was present; it was carried by acclamation by the
                        entire senate. <milestone n="5" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>But I ask, since I am the prime mover in and the chief cause of this vote,
                        what fault is found with the vote itself? Was there not good reason for
                        adopting an unprecedented plan? Was not I as much concerned as any one in
                        that matter? or, had we any other resource? What circumstances, what reasons
                        could there be of greater consequence than famine? than sedition? than the
                        designs of you and your partisans? who thought that, if an opportunity was
                        given them of inflaming the minds of the ignorant, you, under the pretence
                        afforded by the scarcity of provisions, would be able to renew your wicked
                        and fatal practices. </p>
					<p><milestone n="11" unit="section"/> As for corn, some of the countries which
                        usually supply it had not got it; some had sent it into other countries, I
                        imagine because of the great variety of sellers; and some were keeping it
                        back, shut up in their stores, in order suddenly to send it, so that the
                        supply might be more acceptable if they seemed to come to our aid when we
                        were in a state of actual famine. The matter was not one of uncertain
                        opinions, it was a case of actually existing danger, present to our eyes; it
                        was not one which we were looking forward to in conjecture, but one which we
                        were actually beholding by present experience. For when the scarcity was
                        getting more severe, so that it was actually want and famine that was
                        dreaded, and not mere dearness of price, there was a rush towards the Temple
                        of Concord, when the consul Metellus summoned the senate to meet in that
                        place. And if that was the genuine effect of the grief of men suffering
                        under famine, certainly the consuls had good reason to undertake the affair,
                        certainly the senate had good reason to adopt some determination or other. </p>
					<p>But if the scarcity was the pretext, and if you in reality were the exciter
                        and kindler of sedition, ought we not all to have striven to take away all
                        shadow of pretext for your madness?<milestone n="12" unit="section"/> What,
                        if both these causes existed,&mdash;if there was both famine to excite
                        men, and you too like a nail working into this ulcer? was there not all the
                        more need to apply some remedy, which might put an end to both the evil
                        caused by nature, and to the other mischief imported into the case? There
                        was then both present dearness and impending famine; that is not enough; men
                        were attacked with stones. If that arose from the indignation of the common
                        people, without any one having stirred them up, it is a great misfortune;
                        but if, it was caused by the instigation of Publius Clodius, it is only the
                        habitual wickedness of a wicked man: if both these causes
                        existed,&mdash;if there was both a fact sufficient of itself to excite
                        the feelings of the multitude, and if there were leaders of sedition ready
                        and forearmed; then, does it not seem natural for the republic to have had
                        recourse to the protection of the consul and the loyalty of the senate? But
                        it is quite plain that one of these causes did exist; that there was a
                        difficulty of obtaining provisions, and an extreme scarcity of corn, so that
                        men were afraid not only of a continuance of high prices, but of actual
                        famine. No one denies it. But I do not wish you, O priests, to suspect that
                        that enemy of all tranquillity and peace was likely to seize on this as a
                        pretext for conflagration, and massacre, and rapine, unless you see it
                        proved. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>Who are the men who were openly named in the senate by Quintus
                        Metellus,&mdash;your brother, O Metellus,&mdash;the consul, by whom
                        he said that he had been attacked with stones and actually hit? He named
                        Lucius Sergius and Marcus Lollius. Who is that Lollius? A man who is not
                        even at this moment by your side without his sword; who, while you were
                        tribune of the people, demanded (I will say nothing of his designs against
                        myself) to have the murder of Cnaeus Pompeius entrusted to him. Who is
                        Sergius? The armour-bearer of Catiline, your own body-guard, the
                        standard-bearer of sedition, the exciter of the shopkeepers, a man who has
                        been convicted of assault, an assassin, a stoner of men, a man who has
                        depopulated the forum, and blockaded the senate-house. With these leaders
                        and others like them, when you, at the time when provisions were dear, under
                        pretence of espousing the cause of the poor and ignorant, were preparing for
                        sudden attacks on the consuls, on the senate, on the property and fortunes
                        of the, rich; when it was impossible for you to find safety if affairs
                        remained in a tranquil state; when, the leaders being all desperate men, you
                        had your bands of profligates regularly enrolled and distributed into
                        decuries,&mdash;did it not behoove the senate to take good care that
                        that fatal firebrand did not fall upon these vast materials for sedition?
                            <milestone n="6" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="14" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>There was, therefore, good cause for adopting an unusual determination. See
                        now whether or not I was the person who had the principal share in it. Who
                        was it whom that friend of yours, Sergius, whom Lollius, whom the other
                        rascals named when they were throwing the stones? who was it that they said
                        ought to provide them with corn? was it not I? What was it that that
                        nocturnal mob of boys which had been trained by you kept demanding? They
                        were demanding corn of me; as if I superintended the corn-market; or as if I
                        were keeping back any corn in store; or as if, in fact, I had any management
                        of, or influence whatever in, any affairs of that class at all. But the
                        fellow who was thirsting for slaughter had published my name to the
                        artisans, and to the ignorant mob. When the senate, in a very full house
                        assembled in the temple of the all-good and all-powerful Jupiter, had passed
                        a decree touching my dignity with only one dissenting voice, on a sudden, on
                        that very day, a most unexpected cheapness followed a time when corn had
                        been excessively dear. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> Some said, (and I
                        myself am of that opinion,) that the immortal gods had shown their
                        approbation of my return by this exercise of their power. But some traced
                        that fact back, connecting it with this argument and
                        opinion,&mdash;that, as all hopes of tranquillity and concord appeared
                        to depend on my return, and as there was an incessant dread of sedition
                        connected with my absence, so now that all fear of contest was almost at an
                        end, they thought that the state of the corn-market was altered; and,
                        because it again had become more unmanageable after my return, then corn was
                        demanded of me, on whose arrival virtuous men were in the habit of saying
                        that there would be cheapness. <milestone n="7" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>Lastly, my name was pronounced not only by your band of partisans at your
                        instigation, but even after your forces had been routed and scattered, I was
                        summoned by name to the senate by the whole Roman people, who at that time
                        were assembled around the Capitol, though on that day I was far from well.
                            <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> Being expected, I came. After many
                        opinions had been already pronounced, I was asked mine. I delivered one very
                        advantageous to the republic, and at the same time necessary for my own
                        interests. Abundance of corn and cheapness of price was demanded of me; as
                        if I had any influence in producing such a state of things as that. Things
                        were in a very different condition. I was pressed by eager expostulation
                        from many good men. I was unable to support the abuse of the wicked. I
                        proposed to entrust the business to an influential friend, not in order to
                        impose a burden on one to whom I was under such heavy obligations, (for I
                        would rather have sunk under it myself, than done that,) but because I saw,
                        what every one else saw, that, whatever we promised in behalf of Cnaeus
                        Pompeius, he would most easily accomplish by his integrity, wisdom, virtue,
                        and authority, and by his invariable good-fortune. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> Therefore, whether the immortal gods give this to the
                        Roman people as the fruit of my return, that, as on my departure there
                        ensued a want of corn, and famine, and devastation, and bloodshed, and
                        conflagration, and pillage, and impunity for all crimes, and flight, and
                        terror, and discord, so my return is followed by fertility of the lands, by
                        abundant harvests, by hopes of tranquillity, by peaceful dispositions on the
                        part of the citizens, by a restoration of the courts of justice and of the
                        laws, while unanimity on the part of the people and the authority of the
                        senate seem to have been brought back in my company; or, if the fact is that
                        I, on my arrival, was bound, in return for <pb n="10"/> such kindness, to do
                        something for the Roman people by my prudence, authority and diligence; then
                        I do promise, and undertake, and pledge myself to do it. I say no more.
                        This, I say, which is sufficient for the present occasion, that the republic
                        shall not, on any pretence connected with the price of corn, fall into that
                        danger into which some people endeavoured to bring it. <milestone n="8" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="18" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>Are then my sentiments found fault with in this business which fell
                        especially to my share? I rescued affairs of the greatest consequence from
                        the mischief of the most imminent danger; and I saved not only it, but you
                        also, from massacre, and conflagration, and devastation. No one denies this;
                        as to the pretext of dearness there was added that spy of the general
                        misery, who always lit the firebrand of his guilt in the misfortunes of the
                        republic. </p>
					<p>He says that nothing ought to have been decreed irregularly to any one. I do
                        not at present make the same reply to you that I make to the
                        rest,&mdash;That many wars, and these wars of the greatest danger and of
                        the greatest importance, both by land and sea, have been entrusted to Cnaeus
                        Pompeius out of the regular order. And if any one repents of those measures,
                        he must also repent of the victory of the Roman people. <milestone n="19" unit="section"/> I do not deal with you in this manner. I can address
                        this argument to those men, who state that if any matter must be entrusted
                        to one individual, then they would rather entrust it to Cnaeus Pompeius than
                        to any one, but that they make a rule of never entrusting anything to any
                        one in an irregular manner; still, after it has been entrusted to Pompeius,
                        that they then vindicate and uphold the measure, as is due to the dignity of
                        the man. From praising the statements of these men I am hindered by the
                        triumphs of Cnaeus Pompeius, by which he (though it was quite out of the
                        regular order of things that he was summoned to defend his country)
                        increased the reputation of the Roman people, and crowned their empire with
                        honour. At the same time I praise their firmness, which is a virtue which I
                        have need to avail myself of, since it was on my proposition that he was
                        appointed, quite out of the regular routine, to conduct the war against
                        Mithridates and Tigranes. <milestone n="20" unit="section"/> But still there
                        are some points which I can argue with them; but still, how great is your
                        impudence, when you dare to say that nothing ought to be given to any one
                        out of the regular routine! You who, when, by an iniquitous law, for some
                        unknown cause you had confiscated the property of Ptolemy, King of
                            <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName>, the brother of the King
                        of Alexandria, who was reigning by the same right as he was, and had
                        involved the Roman people in the crime,&mdash;when you had sent a band
                        of robbers from this empire to ravage his kingdom, and goods, and property,
                        though there had been a long alliance and friendship between us and his
                        father, and grandfather, and still more remote
                        ancestors,&mdash;appointed Marcus Cato to superintend the carrying away
                        of his money, and the managing the war if any individual was found hardy
                        enough to defend his own property. <milestone n="21" unit="section"/> Will
                        you say, &ldquo;Yes, but what a man Cato was! A most religious, most
                        prudent, most gallant man; the firmest friend to the republic, a citizen of
                        a most marvellous and almost unique virtue, and wisdom, and purity of
                        life.&rdquo; Very fine, but what is all that to you, when you say that
                        it is untrue that any one ought to be appointed to any public duty out of
                        the regular course? <milestone n="9" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>And in this matter I am only convicting you of inconsistency; who in the case
                        of this very Cato, whom you did not so much promote out of regard for his
                        dignity, as get out of the way lest he might hinder your
                        wickedness,&mdash;whom you had exposed to your Sergii, and Lollii, and
                        Titii, and your other leaders in massacre and conflagration, whom you
                        yourself had called the executioner of the citizens, the chief murderer of
                        men who had never been condemned, the very fountain of
                        cruelty,&mdash;you still by your motion conferred this honour and
                        command on him out of the regular course, and behaved with such violence,
                        that you were wholly unable to disguise your object and, the system of
                        wickedness which you had laid down for yourself. <milestone n="22" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>You read letters in the assembly which you said had been sent to you by Caius
                        Caesar. &ldquo;Caesar to Pulcher.&rdquo; And when you proceeded to
                        argue that this was a proof of intimacy, because he only used the names of
                        himself and you, and did not add &ldquo;proconsul,&rdquo; or
                        &ldquo;tribune of the people,&rdquo; and then began to congratulate
                        you that you had got Marcus Cato out of the way of your tribuneship for the
                        remainder of the time, and that you had also taken away for the future the
                        power of giving extraordinary commissions;&mdash;letters which he never
                        sent to you at all, or which, if he did send them, he certainly never meant
                        to be read in the public assembly;&mdash;at all events, whether he sent
                        them or whether you forged them, your intention with respect to the honours
                        conferred upon Cato was revealed by the reading of those letters. <milestone n="23" unit="section"/> But, however, I will say no more about Cato,
                        whose eminent virtue, and dignity, and integrity, and moderation in that
                        business which he executed, appear like a screen to veil the iniquity of
                        your law and of your argument. What more need I say? Who was it who gave to
                        the most infamous man that has ever existed, to the most wicked and polluted
                        of all men, that rich and fertile <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>? Who gave him a war to carry on against nations who
                        were in a state of profound peace? Who gave him the money which was destined
                        for the purchase of lands and which had been taken by violence out of the
                        fruits of the achievements of Caesar? Who gave him an unlimited
                            command?<note anchored="yes">Gabinius is meant here; but Graevius thinks
                            that there is a good deal of corruption in this passage.</note> And,
                        indeed, when you had given him <placeName key="tgn,7002470">Cilicia</placeName>, you altered the terms of your bargain with him,
                        and you transferred <placeName key="tgn,7002470">Cilicia</placeName> to the
                        praetor, again quite out of the regular course. And then, when the bribe had
                        been increased, you gave <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName> to
                        Gabinius&mdash;expressly naming him. What more? Did you not, naming him
                        expressly, deliver over, bound and fettered, to Lucius Piso, the foulest,
                        the most cruel, the most treacherous of men, the most infamous of all men,
                        as stigmatised for every sort of wickedness and lust, free nations, who had
                        been declared free by numerous resolutions of the senate, and even by a
                        recent law of your own son-in-law? Did not you, after the recompense for
                        your service and the bribe of a province had been paid by him at my expense,
                        still divide the treasury with him? <milestone n="24" unit="section"/> Is it
                        so? Did you annul the arrangement of the consular provinces, which Caius
                        Gracchus, than whom there hardly ever lived a man more devoted to the
                        people, not only abstained from taking from the senate, but even passed a
                        solemn law to establish the principle that they were to be settled every
                        year by the senate;&mdash;did you, I say, disturb that arrangement, and
                        that too after it had been formally settled according to the Sempronian law?
                        You gave the provinces, in an irregular manner, without casting lots, not to
                        the consuls, but to the pests of the republic, expressly naming them. And
                        shall we be found fault with, because we have appointed a most illustrious
                        man, who has often been selected before on occasions of the greatest danger
                        to the republic, (expressly naming him,) to superintend a matter of the most
                        urgent importance, and which was previously in an almost desperate
                        condition? <milestone n="10" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>What more shall I say? If, then, amid the darkness and impenetrable clouds
                        and storms which were then lowering above the republic, when you had driven
                        the senate from the helm and turned the people out of the ship, and while
                        you yourself, like a captain of pirates, were hastening on with all your
                        sails set, with your most infamous band of robbers; if at that time you had
                        been able to carry the resolutions which you proposed, and punished, and
                        brought forward, and sold, what place in the whole world would have been
                        free from the extraordinary magistrates and commanders invested with their

					<p>But at last the indignation of Cnaeus Pompeius, (I will say, even in his

                        which he takes it,)&mdash;the indignation I say, of Cnaeus Pompeius,
                        which had been too long concealed and slumbering, being at last aroused,
                        came on a sudden to the aid of the republic, and raised the city crushed
                        with misfortunes, dumb, weakened, and broken spirited through fear to some
                        hope of recovering its liberty and former dignity. And was this man not to
                        be appointed to superintend the providing the city with corn? You, forsooth,
                        by your law abandoned all the corn, whether belonging to private individuals
                        or to the state, all the provinces which supply corn, and all the
                        contractors, and all the keys of the granaries, to that most impure of
                        gluttons, the taster of your lusts, to that most needy and most impious man,
                        Sextus Clodius, the companion of your family, who by his tongue alienated
                        even your sister from you. And it was by this action of yours that dearness
                        was first produced, and afterwards scarcity. Famine, conflagration,
                        bloodshed, and pillage were impending. Your insane frenzy was threatening
                        the fortunes and property of every man. <milestone n="26" unit="section"/>
                        That ill-omened pest of the state even complains that the corn should have
                        been taken out of the impure mouth of Sextus Clodius, and that the republic
                        in its extremest peril should have implored the aid of that man by whom it
                        recollected that it had often been preserved, and had its power <pb n="14"/>
                        extended. Clodius thinks that nothing ought to be done out of the regular
                        course. What! what sort of law is it that you say that you passed about me,
                        you parricide, you fratricide, you murderer of your sister; did you not pass
                        that out of the regular course? Was it lawful for you to pass, I will not
                        say a law, but a wicked private bill, concerning the ruin of a citizen, the
                        preserver of the republic, as all gods and men have long since agreed to
                        call him, and, as you yourself confess, when he was not only uncondemned but
                        even unimpeached, amid the mourning of the senate and the lamentation of all
                        good men, rejecting the prayers of all <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, while the republic lay oppressed and captive at your
                        feet? And was it not lawful for me, when the Roman people implored me, when
                        the senate requested me, when the critical state of the republic demanded it
                        of me, to deliver an opinion concerning the safety of the Roman people?
                            <milestone n="27" unit="section"/> And if that opinion the dignity of
                        Cnaeus Pompeius was increased, in connection with the common advantage,
                        certainly I ought to be praised if I seemed to have given my vote for honour
                        of that than who had brought his influence to aid in the ensuring of my
                        safety. <milestone n="11" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>Let men cease&mdash;cease, I say, from hoping that now that I have been
                        restored, I can be undermined by the same contrivances by which they
                        formerly smote me when I was flourishing. For what pair of men of consular
                        dignity were ever more united in friendship in this state than Cnaeus
                        Pompeius and I? Who has ever spoken more honourably or more repeatedly of
                        his dignity before the Roman people or to the senate than I have? What
                        labour was there so great, or what enmity so formidable, or what contest so
                        arduous, that I was unwilling to encounter it for the sake of his dignity?
                        and what honour that could be paid me by him, what panegyric of my glory,
                        what recompense for my goodwill was ever omitted by him? <milestone n="28" unit="section"/> This union of ours, this unanimity and concert in
                        managing the affairs of the republic successfully, this most delightful
                        agreement in life and all its duties, certain men, by false reports of
                        conversations and false accusations, broke, interrupted; going to him, and
                        warning him to be afraid of me, to guard against me, and at the same time
                        telling me that he was hostile to me above all men: so that I had net
                        sufficient confidence to ask of him what it was desirable for me to ask, nor
                        did he, having been made sore by the jealousies and wickedness of certain
                        individuals, promise me with sufficient freedom what my necessities
                        required. <milestone n="29" unit="section"/> A great price has been paid for
                        my error, O priests, so that I am not only grieved for my folly, but ashamed
                        of it too; since, though it was not some sudden and accidental occasion, but
                        many labors of long standing, encountered and undertaken long before, which
                        had united me with a most gallant and most illustrious man, I still suffered
                        myself to be led away to abandon such a friendship, and did not perceive who
                        they were whom it became me either to oppose as open enemies, or to distrust
                        as treacherous friends. Let them now at length cease to try and excite me
                        with the same language as before: &ldquo;What is that man about? Does
                        not he know how great his influence is, what great achievements be has
                        performed with what great honour he has been restored? Why does he do honour
                        to the man by whom he was deserted?&rdquo; <milestone n="30" unit="section"/> But I neither think that I was deserted at that time,
                        but rather surrendered; nor do I think it needful for me to explain what at
                        the time of that unhappiness to the republic was done against me nor how,
                        nor by whose instrumentality it was done. If it was beneficial to the
                        republic that that alone, as the victim offered for the general safety,
                        should quaff that most unworthy cup of calamity, it may be useful also for
                        me to conceal and be silent respecting the men by whose wickedness it was
                        brought about. But yet it is the part of an ungrateful man to be silent.
                        Therefore I will most willingly proclaim that Cnaeus Pompeius laboured with
                        all his zeal and influence as much as any one of you, and with all his
                        means, and labour, and by entreaty, and even at his own personal risk, to
                        promote my safety. <milestone n="12" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>This man, O Publius Lentulus, was present at all your counsels, while you
                        were thinking of nothing day and night except my safety. He cooperated with
                        you as a most influential adviser in planning the conduct to be pursued, as
                        a most faithful ally in preparing for it, and as a most fearless assistant
                        in executing it. It was he who visited all the municipalities and colonies;
                        it was he who implored the assistance of all <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, which was eager to afford it; it was he who in the
                        senate was the first person to deliver his opinion, and when he had
                        delivered it there, he then also entreated the Roman people to preserve me.
                            <milestone n="31" unit="section"/> Wherefore, you may desist from that
                        language which you have been using, namely, that the dispositions of the
                        priests were changed after my delivering the opinion which I did about the
                        corn. As if they had any different opinion from what I myself had about
                        Cnaeus Pompeius, or as if they were ignorant what I ought to do either with
                        regard to the expectation of the Roman people, or to the services which I
                        have received from Cnaeus Pompeius, or to my own circumstances and
                        condition; or as if even, if my sentiments had perchance been offensive to
                        any one of the priests, though I know for a certainty that the contrary was
                        the case, any priest was on that account going to decide about religion, or
                        any citizen about the republic, in any other manner than the laws respecting
                        religious ceremonies compelled the one, or the interests and safety of the
                        republic compelled the other. </p>
					<p><milestone n="32" unit="section"/> I am aware, O priests, that I have said
                        more things which are foreign to this cause, than either your opinion is
                        likely to approve of, or than my own inclination prompted. But I was anxious
                        to be acquitted in your eyes; and, further, your kindness in listening to me
                        with attention carried me on to say more than I had intended. But I will
                        make amends for this by the brevity of that part of the speech which relates
                        to the actual matter now brought under your examination; and as the affair
                        is divided into two heads,&mdash;one relating to the laws of religion,
                        and the other to the laws of the state, &mdash;I will pass over the
                        question of religion, which would take a longer time to discuss, and speak

                        has found anything of consequence in your books, to take up time in
                        detailing it to you; or so superfluous, as to seek to acquire learning on

					<p>I say that it was not possible, according to our common rights, and according

                        to such disaster as mine without a formal trial. I say that this was the law
                        in this state even at the time when the kings existed; I say that this was
                        the principle handed down to us from our ancestors; I say, moreover, that
                        this is the inalienable characteristic of a free state,&mdash;that no
                        infringement on the liberties or property of a citizen can take place
                        without the formal decision of the senate, or of the people, or of those
                        persons who have been appointed as judges in each separate matter.
                            <milestone n="34" unit="section"/> Do you not see that I am destroying
                        all your proceedings by the roots? that I am arguing, what is manifest, that
                        you did nothing whatever according to law,&mdash;that you were not a
                        tribune of the people at all? I say this, that you are a patrician. I say so
                        before the priests; the augurs are present. I take my stand on the common
                        public law. What, O priests is the law concerning adoption? Why that he may
                        adopt children who is no longer able to have children himself, and who
                        failed in having them when he was of an age to expect it. What reason, then,
                        any one has for adopting children, what considerations of family or dignity
                        are involved what principles of religion are concerned, are questions which
                        are accustomed to be put to the college of priests. What if all these
                        circumstances are found to exist in that adoption? The person who adopts him
                        is twenty years old; a minor adopts a senator. Does he do so for the sake of
                        having children? He is of an age to have them of his own. He has a wife; he
                        has actually got children of his own. The father, then, will be
                        disinheriting his own son. <milestone n="35" unit="section"/> What? why
                        should all the sacred rites of the Clodian family perish, as far as it
                        depends on you? And that must have been the idea of all the priests when you
                        were adopted. Unless, perchance, the question was put to you in this
                        way,&mdash;whether you were intending to disturb the republic by
                        seditions, and whether you wished to be adopted with that object, not in
                        order to become that man's son, but only in order to be made a tribune of
                        the people, and by that means utterly to overthrow the state? You answered,
                        I presume, that your object was only to be made a tribune. That appeared to
                        the priests to be a sufficient reason. They approved of it. No questions
                        were asked about the age of the man who was adopting you; as was done in the
                        case of Cnaeus Aufidius and Marcus Pupius, each of whom, within our
                        recollection, when extremely old, adopted as sons, the one Orestes, and the
                        other Piso. And these adoptions, like others, more than I can count, were
                        followed by the inheritance of the name and <pb n="18"/> property and sacred
                        rites of the family. You are not Fonteius, as you ought to be, nor the heir
                        of your new father; nor, though you have lost your right to the sacred
                        ceremonies of your own family, have you availed yourself of those which
                        belong to you by adoption. And so, having thrown the ceremonies of religion
                        into confusion,&mdash;having polluted both families, both the one which
                        you have abandoned and the one which you have entered,&mdash;having
                        violated the legitimate practices of the Romans with respect to
                        guardianships and inheritances, you have been made, contrary to all the
                        requirements of religion, the son of that man of whom you were old enough to
                        be the father. <milestone n="14" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="36" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>I am speaking before the priests; I say that that adoption did not take place
                        according to the sacerdotal law. In the first place, because your respective
                        ages are such that the man who has adopted you as your father might, as far
                        as his age went, have been your son; in the second place, because a question
                        is usually put as to the reason for the adoption, in order that the adopter
                        may be a person who is seeking by regular and sacerdotal law that which by
                        the ordinary process of nature he is no longer able to obtain; and that he
                        may adopt a son in such a manner, as to in nowise impair the dignity of the
                        families or the reverence belonging to their sacred ceremonies; and, above
                        all things, that no false pretence, or fraud, or trickery, may creep in; so
                        that this fictitious adoption of a son may appear to imitate as far as
                        possible the real case of children being born to a man. <milestone n="37" unit="section"/> But what greater false pretence can there be than for a
                        beardless young man, a vigorous man and a husband, to come forward, and to
                        say that he wishes to adopt as his own son a senator of the Roman people,
                        and for all men to know and see that this senator is adopted, not in order
                        to become really the son of the plebeian, but merely in order that he may
                        quit the patrician body, and be made a tribune of the people? And all that
                        without any disguise. For in this case the adopted son was immediately
                        emancipated, lest he should really have become the son of him who adopted
                        him. Why then is he adopted at all? Only approve of this sort of adoption,
                        and in a moment the sacred ceremonies of every family, of which you ought to
                        be the guardians, will be abolished, and not one patrician will be left. For
                        why should any one be willing to be incapable of being made a tribune of the
                        people? to have his power of standing for the consulship narrowed? and,
                        while he might arrive at the priesthood, not to arrive at it because there
                        is not a vacancy at the moment for a patrician?<note anchored="yes">When the

					<p>I come now to the augurs and if they have any secret books I do not inquire
                        into them; I am not very curious about inquiring into the principles of the
                        augurs. I know, what I have learnt in common with all the people, what
                        answers they have frequently given in the public assemblies. They say that
                        it is contrary to divine law for any public business to be brought before
                        the people when any proper officers observing the heavens. Will you venture
                        to deny that, on the day when the <foreign lang="la">Lex

                            the form of adoption called <foreign lang="la">arrogatio</foreign>. When
                            the question to be proposed had relation to sacred things, the <foreign lang="la">pontifices</foreign> presided in them.</note> concerning
                        you is said to have been passed, the magistrates were observing the heavens?
                        A man is here present in court, of the most eminent wisdom, and dignity, and
                        authority, Marcus Bibulus. I assert that on that very day he, as consul, was
                        observing the heavens. &ldquo;What then,&rdquo; you will say,
                        &ldquo;are then the acts of Caius Caesar, that most admirable citizen,
                        invalid in your opinion?&rdquo; By no means; for there is not one of
                        them which concerns me in the least, nor anything else except these weapons
                        which by that man's proceedings are hurled at me. <milestone n="40" unit="section"/> But the matter of the <foreign lang="la">auspices</foreign>, which I am now touching on with extreme brevity,
                        has been handled in this manner by you. You, when your tribuneship was in
                        danger and was falling to pieces as it were, all of a sudden came forward as
                        a patron of the <foreign lang="la">auspices</foreign>; you brought forward
                        Marcus Bibulus and the augurs into the assembly; you questioned the augurs,
                        and they replied that when any magistrates was observing the heavens, no
                        business could be transacted in the assembly of the people. You questioned
                        Marcus Bibulus, and he told you in reply that he had been observing the
                        heavens; and he also said in the public assembly, when he was brought
                        forward there by your brother Appius, that you were no tribune of the people
                        at all, because you had been adopted contrary to the <foreign lang="la">auspices</foreign>. In the succeeding months your language constantly
                        was, that everything which Caius Caesar had done ought to be rescinded by
                        the senate, because they had been done in disregard of the <foreign lang="la">auspices</foreign>; and if they were rescinded, you said that
                        you would bring me back on your own shoulders into the city as the guardian
                        of the city. See now, O priests, the insanity of the man when by means of
                        his tribuneship he was connected to such an extent with the acts of Caesar.

					<p>It was perhaps about the sixth hour when I complained in the court of justice
                        (when I was defending Caius Antonius, my colleague,) of some things in the
                        republic which appeared to me to relate to the cause of that unhappy man.
                        What I said was reported by some wicked men to some very eminent citizens in
                        language very different from that which I had employed. At the ninth hour on
                        that very same day you were adopted. If, while in all other laws there ought
                        to be an interval of three days, it is sufficient in a law respecting an
                        adoption that there should be one of three hours, I have nothing to object
                        to. But if the same forms are to be observed,&mdash;if the senate
                        decreed that the people was not bound by the laws of Marcus Drusus, which

                        motion, still that that burial, miserable and bitter as it was, was all
                        according to law: they said that in carrying such a motion as you had
                        carried concerning me a citizen, and one who had deserved well of the
                        republic, you had inflicted a deadly wound on the republic; but, inasmuch as
                        you had carried it with all due reverence for the <foreign lang="la">auspices</foreign>, they said that you had acted legally. Wherefore we,
                        I imagine, may be allowed to abstain from attacking those actions by which
                        they were induced to approve of the establishment of your tribuneship.

					<p>Suppose, however, that you were as rightly and legally tribune as Rullus
                        himself, who is here present, a man most illustrious and honourable on every

                        custom, did you pass a law affecting, by name, the civil rights of a citizen
                        who had not been condemned? <milestone n="17" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>The sacred laws,&mdash;the laws of the Twelve Tables, forbid bills to be
                        brought in affecting individuals only; for such a bill is a <foreign lang="la">privilegium</foreign>. No one has ever carried such a bill.
                        There is nothing more cruel, nothing more mischievous, nothing which this
                        city can less tolerate. What was it in that miserable proscription, and all
                        the other miseries of Sulla's time, which was the most remarkable thing
                        which will prevent the cruelties then practised from being ever forgotten? I
                        imagine it was the fact that punishments were at that time proclaimed on
                        Roman citizens by name without any trial. <milestone n="44" unit="section"/>
                        Will you, then, O priests, by this decision, and by your authority, give a
                        tribune of the people power to proscribe whomsoever he chooses? For I ask
                        what else proscribing is, excepting proposing such a law as this,
                        &ldquo;That you will decide and order that Marcus Tullius shall no
                        longer be in the city, and that his property may become mine?&rdquo; For
                        this is the effect of what he carried, though the language is somewhat
                        different. Is this a resolution of the people? Is this a law? Is this a
                        motion? Can you endure this? Can the city endure that a single citizen
                        should be removed out of the city by a single line? I, indeed, have now
                        endured my share. I have no more violence to fear. I am in dread of no
                        further attacks. I have satisfied the hostility of those who envied me; I
                        have appeased the hatred of wicked men; I have satiated even the treachery
                        and wickedness of traitors; and, what is more, by this time every city, all
                        ranks of men, all gods and men have expressed their opinion on my case,
                        which appeared to those profligate men to be exposed above all others as a
                        mark for unpopularity. <milestone n="45" unit="section"/> You now, O

                        hearing, before the magistrate can inflict any fine or give any decision;
                        and when there is a fourth hearing for the accusation appointed after

                        prosecutor, or of exciting pity; and besides this the people is a people
                        inclined to listen to entreaties, and very apt to give their votes for a
                        defendant's safety; and, beyond all this, if anything prevents the cause
                        from being proceeded with on that day, either because of the <foreign lang="la">auspices</foreign>, or on any other plea or excuse, then there

					<p>As these things then are so where is the accusation, where is the prosecutor?
                        where are the witnesses? What is more scandalous, than when a man has

                        life is removed from popular honours and from all that renown which gives
                        influence, and whose riches are so great that too many men, needy,
                        extravagant, and even of noble birth, covet them? <milestone n="47" unit="section"/> Grant this licence to a tribune of the people, and then

                        will be found, by Jove! whole colleges of tribunes of the people, if this

					<p>But what vote is it that this skillful and experienced law-giver has carried?
                        &ldquo;May you be willing and may you command that Marcus Tullius be

                        words, or to be confirmed by any votes, making that to have been done which

                        the public, with the man who drew this law for your adviser, and counselor,
                        and minister, a fellow more impure, not only than any biped, but even than
                        any quadruped? And you were not so foolish or so mad as to be ignorant that
                        this man who violated the laws was Clodius; but that there were other men
                        who were accustomed to frame laws: but you had not the least power over any
                        one of them, or over any one else who had any character to lose; nor could
                        you employ the same framers of laws, or the same architect for your works,
                        as the others; nor could you obtain the aid of any priest you chose. Lastly,
                        you were not able to discover, not even when you were dividing your plunder,
                        any purchaser, or any one to share your plunder with you, out of your own
                        band of gladiators, nor any one to support that proscription of yours with

                        expressed his opinion of him by that action, said that he desired to have a
                        legal investigation into the circumstances of his death, and accused Sextus
                        Propertius as accessory to it. He did not venture to accuse his partners of
                        a crime in which they had no concern, and to endeavour to procure their
                        condemnation, lest he himself should have been convicted of bringing false
                        accusations. <milestone n="50" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>We are speaking, then, of this law which appears to have been legally brought
                        forward, while yet every one that has had anything to do with any part of

                        has been, has come off rejected and convicted. </p>
					<p>What shall we say if the proscription is framed in such terms that it repels
                        itself? For it is, &ldquo;Because Marcus Tullius has forged a decree of
                        the senate.&rdquo; If, then, he did forge a decree of the senate, the
                        law was proposed; but if he did not forge one, no proposition has been made
                        at all. Does it or does it not appear sufficiently decided by the senate
                        that I did not falsely allege the authority of that order, but that I, of
                        all the men that have ever lived since the foundation of the city, have been
                        the most diligent in my obedience to the senate? In how many ways do I not

                        you brought many different matters before the people at one and the same

                        at that time preparing for violence? When by your edicts, you ordered all
                        the shops to be shut, were you aiming not at the violence of the mob, but at
                        a modest and prudent gathering of honourable men? When you were having arms
                        collected and carried to the temple of Castor, had you no other object
                        beyond preventing others from being able to effect anything by violence? But
                        when you tore up and removed the steps of the temple of Castor, did you
                        then, in order to be able to act in a moderate manner, repel audacious men
                        from the approaches and ascents leading to the temple? When you ordered
                        those persons who, in an assembly of virtuous men, had spoken in defence of,
                        my safety, to come forward, and had driven away their companions and
                        seconders by blows and arms and stones; then, no doubt, you showed that
                        violence was excessively disagreeable to you. <milestone n="55" unit="section"/> Oh, but this frantic violence of a demented tribune of
                        the people could easily be crushed and put down by the virtue and superior
                        numbers of the good citizens. What? when <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName> was given to Gabinius, <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> to Piso, boundless authority and vast sums of
                        money to both of them, to induce them to place everything in your power, to
                        assist you, to supply you which followers, and troops, and their own
                        prepared centurions, and money, and bands of slaves; to all you with their
                        infamous assemblies, to deride the authority of the senate, to threaten the
                        Roman knights with death and proscription, to terrify me with threats, to
                        threaten me with contests and murder, to fill my house with their friends,
                        which had heretofore been full of virtuous men; through fear of
                        proscription; to deprive me of the crowds of good men who used to associate
                        with me, to strip me of their protection; to forbid the senate, that most
                        illustrious body, not only to fight for me, but even to implore men, and to
                        entreat them in my behalf, and, changing their garments, to lament my
                        danger,&mdash;was not even this violence? <milestone n="22" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="56" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>Why then did I depart, or what fear was there? I will not say in me. Allow
                        that I am timid by nature; what are we to say of so many thousands of the
                        bravest men? what did our Roman knights think? what did the senate? what, in
                        short, did all good men think? If there was no violence, why did they escort
                        me out of the city with tears, instead of reproving and detaining me, or
                        being indignant with me and leaving me? Or was I afraid that I could not,
                        while present, resist their accusations if they proceeded against me
                        according to the usages and principles of our ancestors? <milestone n="57" unit="section"/> If a day had been appointed for my trial, must I have
                        dreaded the investigation? or must I have feared a private bill being
                        introduced against me without any trial? A trial in so shameful a cause I
                        suppose I am a man who, if the cause were not understood, could not speak so
                        as to explain it at all, or could I not make people approve of my cause,
                        when its excellence is such that of its own merits it made people approve
                        not only of itself while it was before them, but of me also though I was
                        absent? Was the senate, were all ranks of the people, were those men who
                        flew hither from all <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> to
                        cooperate in my recall, likely to be more indifferent, while I was present,
                        about retaining and preserving me, in that cause which even that parricide
                        says was such, that he complains that I was sought out and recalled to my
                        previous honours by the whole people? <milestone n="58" unit="section"/> Was
                        there then no danger to me whatever in a court of justice; but was I to fear
                        a private bill, and that if a penalty were sought to be recovered from me
                        while I was present, no one would interpose a veto? Was I so destitute of
                        friends, or was the republic so entirely without magistrates? What?
                        supposing the tribes had been convoked, would they have approved of a
                        proscription, I will not say against me who had deserved so well of them by
                        my efforts for their safety, but would they have approved of it in the case
                        of any citizen whatever? Or, if I had been present, would those veteran
                        troops of conspirators, and those profligate and needy soldiers of yours,
                        and that new force of two most impious consuls, have spared my person, when,
                        after that I had, by departing, succumbed to their inhumanity and
                        wickedness, I could not though absent satisfy their hostility to me by my
                        misfortunes? <milestone n="23" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="59" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>For what injury had my unhappy wife done to you? whom you harassed and
                        plundered and ill-treated with every description of cruelty. What harm had
                        my daughter done to you? whose incessant weeping and mourning and misery
                        were so agreeable to you, though they moved the eyes and feelings of every
                        one else. What had my little son done? whom no one ever saw all the time
                        that I was away, that he was not weeping and lamenting; what, I say, had he
                        done that you should so often try to murder him by stratagem? What had my
                        brother done? who, when, some time after my departure, he arrived from his
                        province and thought that it was not worth his while to live unless I were
                        restored to him, when his chief and excessive and unprecedented mourning
                        seemed to render him an object of pity to every one, was constantly attacked
                        by you with arms and violence, he escaped with difficulty out of your hands.
                            <milestone n="60" unit="section"/> But why need I dilate upon your
                        cruelty which you have displayed towards me and mine? when you have waged a
                        horrible and nefarious war, dyed with every description of hatred against my
                        walls, my roofs, my pillars and door-posts. For I do not think that you,
                        when, after my departure, you in the covetousness of your hopes had devoured
                        the fortunes of all the rich men, the produce of all the provinces, the
                        property of tetrarchs and of kings, were blinded by the desire of my plate
                        and furniture. I do not think that that Campanian consul with his dancing
                        colleague, after you had sacrificed to the one all <placeName key="tgn,7002733">Achaia</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName>,

                        barbarians, and the property of the Roman citizens in those countries, and
                        when you had delivered up to the other Sulla, <placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName>, and the Persians those hitherto uninjured and
                        peaceful nations, to plunder, I do not think, I say, that they were covetous
                        of my thresholds and pillars and folding doors. <milestone n="61" unit="section"/> Nor, indeed, did the bands and forces of Catiline think
                        that they could appease their hunger with the tiles and mortar of my roofs.
                        But as, without being influenced by the idea of booty, still out of hatred
                        we are accustomed to destroy the cities of enemies;&mdash;not of all
                        enemies indeed, but of those with whom we have waged any bitter and
                        intestine war; because when our minds have been inflamed against any people
                        by reason of their cruelty, there always appears to be some war still
                        lingering in their abodes and habitations,<gap desc="* * *"/>

					<p>No law had been passed respecting me. I had not been ordered to appear in
                        court; I had not been summoned. I was absent. I was even in your own opinion
                        a citizen with all my rights as such unimpaired, when my house on the
                            <placeName key="tgn,3000935">Palatine</placeName> hill, and my villa in
                        the district of <placeName key="perseus,Tusculum">Tusculum</placeName>, were
                        transferred one a-piece to each of the consuls; decrees of the senate were
                        flying about; marble columns from my house were carried off to the
                        father-in-law of the consul in the sight of the Roman people; and the consul
                        who was my neighbour at my villa had not only my stock and the decorations
                        of my villa, but even my trees transferred to his farm; while the villa
                        itself was utterly destroyed, not from a desire of plunder, (for what
                        plunder could there be there?) but out of hatred and cruelty. My house on
                        the <placeName key="tgn,3000935">Palatine</placeName> hill was burnt, not by
                        accident, but having been set on fire on purpose. The consuls were feasting
                        and reveling amid the congratulations of the conspirators, while the one
                        boasted that he had been the favourite of Catiline, and the other that he
                        was the cousin of Cethegus. <milestone n="63" unit="section"/> This
                        violence, O priests, this wickedness, this frenzy, I, opposing my single
                        person to the storm, warded off from the necks of all good men, and I
                        received on my body all the attacks of disaffection, all the long-collected
                        violence of the wicked, which, having been long coming to a head, with
                        silent and repressed hatred, was at last breaking out now that it had got
                        such audacious leaders. Against me alone were directed the consular
                        firebrands hurled from the hands of the tribunes; all the impious arrows of
                        the conspiracy, which I had once before blunted, now stuck in me. But if, as
                        was the advice of many most gallant men, I had determined to contend with
                        violence and arms against violence, I should either have gained the day with
                        a great slaughter of wicked men, who notwithstanding were citizens, or else
                        all the good men would have been slain, to the great joy of the wicked, and
                        I too should have perished together with the republic. <milestone n="64" unit="section"/> I saw, that if the senate and people of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> existed, I should have a speedy
                        return with the greatest dignity, and I did not think it possible that such
                        a state of affairs should longer continue to exist, as for me not to be
                        allowed to live in that republic which I myself had saved. And if I were not
                        allowed to live there, I had heard and read that some of the most
                        illustrious men of our country had rushed into the middle of the enemy to
                        manifest death for the sake of the safety of their army. And could I doubt
                        that if I were to sacrifice myself for the safety of the entire republic, I
                        should in this point be better off than the Decii, because they could not
                        even hear of their glory, while I should be able to be even a spectator of
                        my own renown? <milestone n="25" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>Therefore your frenzy, being disconcerted, kept making vain attacks. For the
                        bitterness of my fortune had exhausted all the violence of all the wicked
                        citizens. In such terrible disaster and such wide-spread ruin, there was no
                        room for any new cruelty. <milestone n="65" unit="section"/> Cato was next
                        to me. Was there nothing which you could do beyond making him who had been
                        my leader and guide in all my conduct a partner also in my misfortune? What?
                        Could you banish him? What then? You could send him away for the money of
                            <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName>. One booty may have been
                        lost; another will be sure to be found; only let this man be got out of the
                        way. Accordingly, the hated Marcus Cato is commissioned to go to <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName>, as if it was a kindness that was
                        being conferred on him. Two men are removed, whom the wicked men could not
                        bear the sight of; one by the most discreditable sort of honour, the other
                        by the most honourable possible calamity. <milestone n="66" unit="section"/>
                        And that you may be aware that that man had been an enemy not to their
                        persons, but to their virtues, after I was driven out, and Cato despatched
                        on his commission, he turns himself against that very man by whose advice
                        and by whose assistance he was in the habit of saying in the assemblies that
                        he had done and continued to do what he was then doing and everything which
                        he had hitherto done. He thought that Cnaeus Pompeius, who he saw was in
                        every one's opinion by far the first man in the city, would not much longer
                        tolerate his frenzy. After he had filched out of his custody by treachery
                        the son of a king who was our friend,&mdash;himself being an enemy and a
                        prisoner,&mdash;and having provoked that most gallant man by this
                        injury, he thought that he could contend with him by the aid of those troops
                        against whom I had been willing to struggle at the risk of the destruction
                        of all virtuous citizens, especially as at first he had the consuls to help
                        him. But after a time Gabinius broke his agreement with him; but Piso
                        continued faithful to him. <milestone n="67" unit="section"/> You saw what
                        massacres that man then committed, what men he stoned, what numbers he made
                        to flee; how easily by means of his armed bands and his daily plots did he
                        compel Cnaeus Pompeius to absent himself from the forum and the
                        senate-house, and to confine himself to his own house, even after he had
                        been already deserted by the best part of his forces. And from this you may
                        judge how great that violence was at its first rise, and when first
                        collected together, when even after it was scattered and almost extinct it
                        alarmed Cnaeus Pompeius in this way. <milestone n="26" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="68" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>That most prudent man, Lucius Cotta, a man most deeply attached to the
                        republic and to me, and above all to truth, saw this when he delivered his
                        opinion on the first of January. He then considered it unnecessary that any
                        law should be passed for my return. He said that I had consulted the
                        interests of the republic; that I had yielded to the tempest; that I had
                        been more friendly to you and to the rest of the citizens than to myself and
                        to my own relations; that I had been driven away by the disturbances of a
                        body of men banded together for purposes of bloodshed, and by an
                        unprecedented exercise of power; that no law could possibly have been passed
                        affecting my status as a citizen; that no law had been drawn up in writing,
                        that none could have any validity; that everything had been done in
                        disregard of the laws and of the usages of our ancestors, in a rash and
                        turbulent manner, by violence and frenzy. But if that were a law, then it
                        was not lawful for the consuls to refer the matter to the senate,<note anchored="yes">Because a <foreign lang="la">lex</foreign>, properly so
                            called, was only passed in the <foreign lang="la">comitia

                        upon it in the senate. And as both these things were being done, it was not
                        right that it should be decreed that a law should be passed concerning me,
                        lest that which was no law at all, should be in consequence decided to be a
                        law. No opinion could be truer, sounder, more expedient, or better for the
                        republic. For the wickedness and frenzy of the man being stigmatized by it,
                        all danger of similar disgrace to the republic for the future was removed.
                            <milestone n="69" unit="section"/> Nor did Cnaeus Pompeius, who
                        delivered a most elaborate opinion and most honourable to me, nor did you, O
                        priests, who defended me by your decision and authority, fail to see that
                        that was no law at all, and that it was rather the heat of the times, an
                        interdict of wickedness, a voice of frenzy. But you were anxious to guard
                        against any popular odium being excited against you; if we appeared to have
                        been restored without any decision of the people. And with the same idea the
                        senate adopted the opinion of Marcus Bibulus, a most fearless man, that you
                        should decide the question relating to my house: not that he doubted that
                        nothing had been done by Clodius with due regard either to the laws, or to
                        the requirements of religion, or to the rights of the citizens; but that, as
                        wicked men were so numerous, no one should at any time arise and say that
                        there was anything holy about my house. For as often as the senate has
                        expressed any opinion at all in my case, so often has it decided that that
                        was no law at all, since indeed, according to that writing which that fellow
                        drew up, it was forbidden to express any opinion at all. <milestone n="70" unit="section"/> And that kindred pair, Piso and Gabinius, saw this.
                        Those men, so obedient to the laws and courts of justice, when the senate in
                        very full houses kept constantly entreating them to make a motion respecting
                        me,&mdash;said that they did not disapprove of the object, but that they
                        were hindered by that fellow's law. And this was true; but it was law which
                        he had passed about giving them <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>. <milestone n="27" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>But you, O Publius Lentulus, neither as a private individual nor as consul
                        ever thought that it was a law. For when the tribunes of the people made a
                        motion, you as consul elect often delivered your opinion concerning my
                        affairs; and from the first of January to the time that the whole affair was
                        completed, you persevered in making motions respecting me, you proposed a
                        law, you passed it; none of which things could legally have been done by you
                        if that thing of Clodius's had been a law. But Quintus Metellus your
                        colleague, a most illustrious man, even though he was a brother of Clodius,
                        when he joined you in making a motion in the senate respecting my affairs,
                        expressed his opinion that that was no law at <pb n="34"/> all which men
                        utterly unconnected with Clodius,&mdash;namely Piso and Gabinius,
                        considered was a law. <milestone n="71" unit="section"/> But how did those
                        men who had such respect for Clodius's laws observe the rest of the laws?
                        The senate indeed, whose authority is of the very greatest weight on all
                        questions affecting the power of the laws, as often as it has been consulted
                        in my case, has decided that that was no law at all. And you, O Lentulus,
                        showed that you were aware of its not being one in that law which you
                        carried concerning me. For that law was not framed in such terms as that I
                        might be allowed to come to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>,
                        but that I should come to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.
                        For you did not wish to propose to make that lawful for me to do, which was
                        lawful already; but you wished me to be in the republic, appearing to have
                        been sent for by the command of the Roman people, rather than to have been
                        restored for the purpose of aiding in the management of the republic.

					<p>Did you then, O you most monstrous pest, dare to call that man an exile, when
                        you yourself were branded with such wickedness and such crimes that you made
                        every place which you approached very like a place of banishment? For what
                        is an exile? The name itself is an indication of misfortune, not of
                        disgrace. When, then, is it disgraceful? In reality when it is the
                        punishment of guilt; but in the opinion of men, when it is the punishment of
                        a condemned person. Is it then owing to any crime of mine that I hear the

                        Even you, whom those satellites of yours call the prosperous Catiline, do

                        venture to say so now. There is not only no one so ignorant now as to say
                        that those actions which I did in my consulship were errors; but no one is
                        such an enemy to his country as not to confess that the country was

                        people, and of all peoples, and nations, and kings, is the senate. That
                        decreed that all men who desired the safety of the republic should come
                        forward to defend me alone, and showed its opinion that the republic could
                        not have been saved if I had <pb n="35"/> not existed, and could not last if
                        I did not return. <milestone n="74" unit="section"/> The next in rank to
                        this dignified body is the equestrian order. All the companies of public
                        contractors passed most favourable and honourable decrees respecting my
                        consulship and my actions. The scriveners, who are much connected with us in
                        matters relating to public registers and monuments, took good care that
                        their sentiments and resolutions respecting my services to the republic
                        should not be left in doubt. There is no corporation in all this city, no

                        have places of meeting and some sort of deliberative assemblies,) which has
                        not passed most honourable resolutions, not merely respecting my safety, but
                        relating also to my dignity. <milestone n="75" unit="section"/> For why need
                        I mention those divine and immortal decrees of the municipal towns, and of
                        the colonies, and of all <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, by
                        which, as by a flight of steps, I seem not only to have returned to my
                        country, but to have mounted up to heaven? And what a day was that when the
                        Roman people beheld you, O Publius Lentulus, passing a law respecting me,
                        and felt how great a man and how worthy a citizen you were. For it is well
                        known that the <placeName key="tgn,7006964">Campus Martius</placeName> had
                        never on any <foreign lang="la">comitia</foreign> seen so vast a crowd, or
                        such a splendid assembly of men of every class, age, and order. I say
                        nothing of the unanimous judgment and unanimous agreement of the cities,
                        nations, provinces, kings,&mdash;of the whole world, in

                        race. But what an arrival at and entry into the city was mine! Did my
                        country receive me as it ought to receive light and safety when brought back
                        and restored to it, or as a cruel tyrant, as you, you herd of Catiline, were
                        accustomed to call me? <milestone n="76" unit="section"/> Therefore that one
                        day on which the Roman people honoured me by escorting me with immense
                        numbers and loud demonstrations of joy from the gate to the Capitol, and
                        from the Capitol home, was so delightful to me, that that wicked violence of
                        yours which had driven me away appeared not to <pb n="36"/> be a thing from
                        which I ought to have been defended, but one which it was worth my while
                        even to purchase. Wherefore that calamity, if it deserves to be called a
                        calamity, has put an end to the whole previous system of abuse, and has
                        prevented any one for the future from daring to find fault with my
                        consulship, which has now been approved of by such numerous, and such
                        important, and such dignified decisions, and testimonies, and authorities.

					<p>And if, in all that abuse of yours, you not only impute no disgraceful
                        conduct to me, but even add more lustre on my credit, what can exist or be
                        imagined more senseless than you? For by one piece of abuse you admit that
                        my country was twice saved by me; once when I performed that action which
                        every one avows ought to be remembered for ever if it be possible, you
                        thought that I ought to be punished and put to death; a second time, when I
                        bore in my own person your own violence and that of the numbers who through
                        your agency were inflamed against all virtuous men, in order to avoid taking
                        arms, and in that condition bringing into danger that state which I had
                        saved when without arms. </p>
					<p>Be it so then. <milestone n="77" unit="section"/> There was not in my case
                        any punishment imposed for any offence. Still there was punishment imposed
                        on me by a judicial decision. By what decision? Who ever examined me as a
                        defendant under any law whatever? Who ever accused me? Who ever prosecuted
                        me? Can then a man who is uncondemned be made to bear the punishment of a
                        condemned man? Is this the act of a tribune of the people? Is this the act
                        of a friend of the people? Although, when is it that a man can call himself
                        a friend of the people, except when he has done something for the advantage
                        of the people? Forsooth, has not this principle been handed down to us from
                        our ancestors, that no Roman citizen can be deprived of his liberty, or of
                        his status as a citizen, unless he himself consents to such a thing, as you
                        yourself might learn in your own case? For, although in that adoption of
                        yours nothing was done in a legal manner, still I suppose that you were
                        asked, whether it was your object that Publius Fonteius should have the same
                        power of life and death over you that be would have over an actual son. I
                        ask, if you had either silenced it or had been silent, if, nevertheless, the
                        thirty curies <pb n="37"/> had passed a vote to this effect would that vote
                        have had the force off law? Certainly not. Why? Because the law was
                        established by our ancestors, who were not fictitiously and pretendedly
                        attached to the people, but were so in truth and wisdom, in such a manner
                        that no Roman citizen could be deprived of his liberty against his consent.
                            <milestone n="78" unit="section"/> Moreover, if the decemvirs had given
                        an unjust decision to the prejudice of any one's liberty, they established a
                        law that any one who chose might on this subject alone, make a motion
                        affecting a formal decision already pronounced. But no one will ever lose
                        his status as a citizen against his will by any vote of the people.

                        men who had been condemned on a capital charge, did not lose their rights as

                        city to which they had gone for the sake of changing their abode. Our
                        ancestors took care that they should do so, not by taking away their rights
                        of citizenship, but only their house, and by interdicting them from fire and
                        water within the city. <milestone n="79" unit="section"/> The Roman people
                        on the motion of Lucius Sulla, the dictator, in the <foreign lang="la">comitia centuriata</foreign>, took away the rights of citizenship from
                        the municipal towns, and at the same time took away their lands. The decree
                        about the lands was ratified, for that the people had power to pass; but
                        their decree concerning the rights of citizenship did not last even as long
                        as the disturbances of the time of Sulla. Shall we then say that Lucius
                        Sulla, victorious as he was, after he had been restored to the republic,
                        could not in the <foreign lang="la">comitia centuriata</foreign> take away
                        the rights of citizenship from the people of Volaterra, even though they

                        at a time when the republic was utterly overturned, could take away his
                        rights as a citizen from a man of consular rank, by summoning an assembly,
                        and hiring bands not only of needy citizens, but even of slaves, with
                        Sedulius as their imputed leader, though he declares that on that day he was

                        for want of a house, slept all night in the forum, why should he not swear

                        whole people of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, which in all
                        other affairs is most absolute, can undermine. <milestone n="81" unit="section"/> But you, also, you who take men's rights as citizens
                        from them, have also passed a law with respect to public injuries in favour
                        of some fellow of <placeName key="perseus,Anagnia">Anagnia</placeName>, of
                        the name of Maerula, and he on account of that law has erected a statue to
                        you in my house; so that the place itself, in hearing witness to your
                        prodigious injustice, might refute the law and inscription on your statue.
                        And that law was a much greater cause of grief to the citizens of <placeName key="perseus,Anagnia">Anagnia</placeName> than the crimes which that
                        gladiator had committed in that municipal town. <milestone n="31" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="82" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>What shall I say, if there is nothing said about the rights of citizenship
                        even in that very form of motion which Sedulius declares he never voted for?
                        Do you still cling to his authority in order to throw a lustre on the
                        exploits of your splendid tribuneship by the dignity of that man? </p>
					<p>But although you passed no law respecting me, to prevent my continuing not
                        only in the number of Roman citizens, but even in that rank in which the
                        honours conferred on me by the Roman people had placed me; will you still
                        raise your voice to attack him whom after the abominable wickedness of the
                        preceding consuls you see honoured by the decisions of the senate, of the
                        Roman people, and of all <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>?
                        whom even <pb n="39"/> at the time when I was departing you could not deny,
                        even by your own law, to be a senator. For, where was it that you passed the
                        law that I should be interdicted from fire and water? When Gracchus passed
                        such a decree respecting Publius Popillius, and Saturninus respecting
                        Metellus, and other most seditious men respecting other most virtuous and
                        gallant citizens, they did not pass a decree that they had been interdicted,
                        which could have been quite intolerable but that they should be interdicted.
                        When did you insert a clause that the censor should not enter me on the
                        rolls of the senate in my proper place? which is a clause in the law
                        concerning every one who has been condemned when the interdict is being
                        framed. <milestone n="83" unit="section"/> Ask this of Sextus Clodius the
                        framer of your laws. Bid him come forward; he is keeping out of the way; but
                        if you order him to be looked for they will find the man in your sister's
                        house hiding himself with his head down. But if no one in his senses ever
                        called your father a citizen&mdash;yes, by Jove, a good citizen, and one
                        very unlike you, if no one I say, ever called him an exile, who, when a
                        tribune of the people had proposed a bill against him, would not appear on
                        account of the iniquity of that period of Cinna's triumph, and who, on that
                        account had his command taken from him; if, I say, in his case, a punishment
                        inflicted by law carried no disgrace with it, on account of the violent
                        character of those times, could there, in my ease, be any penalty against me
                        as if I had been condemned when I never was tried when I never was accused
                        when I never was summoned by any tribune of the people, and, especially, a
                        penalty which was not mentioned not even in the proposed bill itself?

					<p>But just remark what the difference is between that most iniquitous
                        misfortune inflicted on your father and between my fortune and condition
                        which I am now discussing Lucius Philippus the censor, in reading the roll
                        of the senate, passed over his own uncle, your father, a most excellent
                        citizen; the son of a most illustrious man, himself a man of such severity
                        of character that if he were alive you would not have been suffered to live.
                        For he had no reason to allege why those acts should not be ratified which
                        had been done in that republic in which, at that very time, he had been
                        willing to take upon himself the office of censor. But as for me, Lucius
                        Cotta, a man of censorian rank, said in the senate, on his <pb n="40"/>
                        oath, that if he had been censor at the time that I left the city, he should
                        have retained me on the list as a senator in my proper place. <milestone n="85" unit="section"/> Who appointed any judge in my place? who of my
                        friends made a will at the time that I was absent, and did not give me the
                        same that he would have given me if I had been in the city? who was there, I
                        will not say only among the citizens, but even among the allies, who
                        hesitated to receive and assist me in defiance of your law? Lastly, the
                        whole senate, long before the law was passed respecting me,
                        &ldquo;Voted, that thanks should be given to all those cities by which
                        Marcus Tullius...&rdquo; Was that all? No&mdash;it went,
                        &ldquo;a citizen who had done the greatest services to the republic, had
                        been received:&rdquo; and do you, one single pernicious citizen, deny
                        that that citizen has been legally restored, whom the whole senate, even
                        while he was absent, considered not only a citizen, but has at all times
                        considered a most illustrious one? <milestone n="86" unit="section"/> But as
                        the annals of the Roman people and the records of antiquity relate, that
                        great man Caeso Quintius, and Marcus Furius Camillus, and Marcus Servilius
                        Ahala, though they had deserved exceedingly well of the republic, still had
                        to endure the violence and passion of an excited people; and after they had
                        been condemned by the <foreign lang="la">comitia centuriata</foreign> and
                        had gone into banishment, were again restored to their former dignity by the
                        same people in a more placable humour. But if, in the case of those men who
                        were thus condemned, their calamity not only did not diminish the glory of
                        their most illustrious names, but even added fresh lustre to it; (for,
                        although it is more desirable to finish the course of one's life without
                        pain and without injury, still it contributes more to the immortality of a
                        man's glory to have been universally regretted by his fellow-citizens: than
                        never to have been injured;) shall a similar misfortune have in my case the
                        force of a reproach or of an accusation, when I left the city without any
                        sentence of the people, and have been restored by most honourable
                        resolutions of every order of society? <milestone n="87" unit="section"/>
                        Publius Popillius was always a brave and wise citizen in every point of
                        view; yet in the whole of his life there is nothing which sheds a greater
                        lustre on his character than this very calamity. For who would have
                        recollected now that he conferred great benefits on the republic, if he had
                        not been expelled by the wicked and restored by the good? The conduct of
                        Quintus Metellus as a military commander was admirable, his censorship was
                        splendid, his whole life was full of wisdom and dignity; and yet it is his
                        calamity which has handed down his praises to everlasting recollection.

					<p>But if the injury inflicted on them by their enemies was not any disgrace to
                        those men who were expelled unjustly, but still who were restored according
                        to law, after their enemies had been slain, after the tribunes had brought
                        forward motions respecting them; not by the authority of the senate, not by

                        regret of the state; do you think that in my case, who departed uncondemned,
                        who departed at the same time as the republic, and returned with the
                        greatest dignity, while you were still alive, while one of your brothers was
                        one of the consuls who brought me back, and the other was the praetor who
                        demanded my recall, your wickedness ought to be any discredit to me? And if
                        the Roman people, being inflamed with passion or envy, had driven me out of
                        the city, and afterwards, remembering my services to the republic, had
                        recollected itself; and shown its repentance for its rashness and injustice
                        by restoring me; yet, in truth, no one would have been so senseless, as to
                        think that such conduct on the part of the people ought not rather to be
                        considered an honour to me than a disgrace. <milestone n="88" unit="section"/> But now, when of all the people no one has accused me, when it is
                        impossible for me to have been condemned, seeing that I have never been
                        accused, since I was not even expelled in such a way that I could not have
                        got the better of my adversaries if I had contested the point with them by
                        force; and when, on the other hand, I have at all times been defrauded and
                        praised and honoured by the Roman people; what pretence has any one for
                        thinking himself better off than I am, at all events as far as the people
                        are concerned? <milestone n="89" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>Do you think that the Roman people consists of these men who can be hired for

                        besiege the senate? to wish every day for bloodshed, conflagration and
                        plunder? people, indeed, whom you could not possibly collect together unless
                        you shut up all the taverns; a people to whom you gave the Lentidii, and
                        Lollii, and Plaguleii, and Sergii, for leaders. Oh for the splendour and
                        dignity of the Roman people, for kings, for foreign nations, for the most

                        That was the real beauty and splendour of the Roman people, which you beheld

                        all nations, which you, O wicked man, beheld in that most illustrious day
                        when all the chief men of the city, when all men of all ranks and ages
                        considered themselves as giving their votes, not about the safety of a
                        citizen, but about that of the state; when men arrive into the Campus, the

					<p>By the aid of this people, if there had then been real consuls in the
                        republic, or if there had been no consuls at all, I should without any
                        difficulty have resisted your headlong frenzy and impious wickedness. But I
                        was unwilling to take up the public cause against armed violence, without
                        the protection of the people. Not that I disapproved of the late rigour of
                        Publius Scipio, that bravest of men, when he was only a private individual;
                        but Publius Mucius the consul, who was considered somewhat remiss in
                        defending the republic, immediately defended, and, more than that, extolled
                        the action of Scipio in many resolutions passed by the senate. But, in my
                        case, I, if you were slain, would have had to contend by force of arms
                        against the consuls, or if you were alive, against both you and them
                        together. <milestone n="92" unit="section"/> There were many other
                        circumstances also to be feared at that time. The contest, would, in truth,
                        have reached the slaves. So great a hatred of all good men had still got
                        possession of the minds of impious citizens, being burnt as it were into
                        their wicked minds by that ancient conspiracy. </p>
					<p>Here, too, you warn me not to boast. You say that those things are
                        intolerable which I am accustomed to assert concerning myself; and being a
                        witty man, you put on quite a polite and elegant sort of language. You say
                        that I am accustomed to say that I am <persName><surname>Jupiter</surname></persName>; and also to make a frequent boast that Minerva is
                        my sister. I will not so much defend myself from the charge of insolence in
                        calling myself <persName><surname>Jupiter</surname></persName>, as from
                        that of ignorance in thinking Minerva the sister of <persName><surname>Jupiter</surname></persName>. But even if I do say so, I at all
                        events claim a virgin for my sister; but you would not allow your sister to
                        remain a virgin. Consider rather whether you have not a right to call
                        yourself <persName><surname>Jupiter</surname></persName>, because you have
                        established a right to call the same woman both sister and wife. <milestone n="35" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="93" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>And since you find fault with me for this, that you assert that I am
                        accustomed to speak too boastfully of myself; I ask, who ever heard me speak
                        in this way, or speak of myself at all, except when I was compelled, and was
                        doing so of necessity? For if, when robberies, and bribery, and lust are
                        imputed to me, I am accustomed to reply that the country was saved by my
                        prudence, and labour, and personal danger, I ought not to be considered as
                        boasting of my own exploits, so much as refusing to confess what is imputed
                        to me. But if, before these most miserable periods of the republic, nothing
                        else was ever imputed to me, except the cruelty of my conduct at that time
                        when I warded off destruction from the republic, what will you say? Ought I
                        when accused in this manner, not to have replied at all, or to have replied
                        in an abject tone? <milestone n="94" unit="section"/> But I have always
                        thought it for the interest of even the republic itself, that I should
                        uphold by my language the propriety and glory of that most noble exploit
                        which I performed by the authority of the senate, with the consent of all
                        virtuous men, for the safety of my country; especially when I am the only
                        person in this republic who have been able to say on oath, in the hearing of
                        the Roman people, that this city and this republic had been saved by my
                        exertions. That accusation of cruelty has long since been extinguished,
                        because men see that I was regretted, and demanded and sent for back by the
                        wishes of all the citizens, not as a cruel tyrant, but as a most merciful
                        parent. Another charge has risen up. <milestone n="95" unit="section"/> That
                        departure of mine from the city is attacked, which accusation I cannot reply
                        to without the greatest credit to myself. For what, O priests, ought I to
                        say? That I lied from a consciousness of guilt? But that which was imputed
                        to me as a crime, not only was not a crime, but was the most glorious action
                        ever performed since the birth of man. That I feared the sentence of the
                        people? But not only was there no trial at any time before the people, but
                        if there had been, I should have departed with redoubled glory. That the
                        protection of the good was wanting to me? <pb n="44"/> It is false. That I
                        was afraid of death? That is an assertion disgraceful to those who make it.
                            <milestone n="36" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="96" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>I am therefore compelled to say that which I would not say if I were not
                        compelled. (For I have never said anything at all in the way of extolling
                        myself for the sake of gaining praise, but only with a view to repel an
                        accusation.) I say, therefore, and I say it with the loudest voice I can
                        command, when the inflamed violence of all the profligate citizens and
                        conspirators, a tribune of the people being the leader, the consuls being
                        their instigators, the senate being beaten down, the Roman knights being
                        terrified, the whole city being in suspense and anxiety, was making an
                        attack, not so much on me as, through me, on all good men&mdash;I say
                        that I then saw that if I conquered, there would be but little of the
                        republic left, and if I were conquered, none at all. And when I had decided
                        that this would be the case, I lamented indeed my separation from my unhappy
                        wife, the desolate state of my most beloved children, the distress of my
                        most affectionate and excellent brother, who was away, and the sudden ruin
                        of a family which had seemed so thoroughly established; but still I
                        preferred to all these considerations the safety of my fellow-citizens, and
                        I preferred that the republic should rather fall, if fall it must through
                        the departure of one man, than through the slaughter of every one. I hoped
                        (as indeed happened) that I, though overthrown, might be raised again by
                        gallant men who were still alive; but I expected that if I perished,
                        involving all virtuous men in my fall, I could not by any possibility be
                        recovered. <milestone n="97" unit="section"/> I felt indeed, O priests, a
                        great and incredible pain; I do not deny it; nor do I pretend to that wisdom
                        which some expected of me, who said that I was too much dispirited and cast
                        down. Could I, when I was torn from such a number and variety of enjoyments,
                        (which I pass over, because even now I cannot speak of them without tears,)
                        deny that I was a human being, and repudiate the common feelings of our
                        nature? But in that case I should neither call that action of mine
                        praise-worthy, nor should I say that any service had been done to the
                        republic by me, if I had only given up, for the sake of the republic, those
                        things which I could bear the loss of with calmness; and that firmness of
                        the mind, resembling that hardness of body, which, even when it is burnt,<pb n="45"/> does not feel it, I should consider insensibility rather than
                        virtue. <milestone n="37" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="98" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>To encounter voluntarily such great grief of mind, and by oneself to endure,
                        while the city is standing, those things which, when a city is taken, befall
                        the conquered citizens; to see oneself torn from the embrace of one's
                        friends, one's houses destroyed, one's property plundered; above all for the
                        sake of one's country, to lose one's country itself to be stripped of the
                        most honourable favours of the Roman people, to be precipitated from the
                        highest rank of dignity, to see one's enemies in their robes of office
                        demanding to conduct one's funeral before one's death has been properly
                        mourned;&mdash;to undergo all these troubles for the sake of saving
                        one's fellow-citizens, and this with such feelings that you are miserable
                        while absent, not being as wise as those philosophers who care for nothing,
                        but being as attached to one's relations and to oneself as the common
                        feelings and rights of men require,&mdash;that is illustrious and
                        godlike glory. For he who with a calm spirit for the sake of the republic
                        abandons those things which he has never considered dear or delightful is
                        not showing any remarkable good will towards the republic but he who
                        abandons those things for the sake of the republic from which he is not torn
                        without the greatest agony, his country is dear to that man and he prefers
                        her safety to his affection for his own relations. <milestone n="99" unit="section"/> Wherefore that fury may burst itself; and it must hear
                        me say these things since it has provoked me&mdash;I have twice saved
                        the republic both when as consul in the garb of peace I subdued armed
                        enemies, and when as a private individual I yielded to the consuls in arms.
                        Of each piece of conduct I have reaped the greatest reward&mdash;I
                        reaped the reward of my first achievement when I saw the senate and all
                        virtuous men, in pursuance of a resolution of the senate, change their
                        garments for the sake of my safety; and that of my subsequent conduct, when
                        the senate, and the Roman people, and all men, whether in a public or a
                        private capacity, decided that without my return the republic would not be
                        safe. <milestone n="100" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>But this return of mine, O priests, depends now on your decision. For if you
                        place me in my house, then I do plainly see and feel that I am restored,
                        which is what all through my cause you have been always labouring to effect
                        by your displays of zeal, by your counsels, and influence, and resolutions;
                            <pb n="46"/> but if, my house is not only not restored to me, but is
                        even allowed to continue to furnish my enemy with a memorial of my distress,
                        of his own wicked triumph, of the public calamity, who is there who will
                        consider this a restoration, and not rather an eternal punishment? Moreover,
                        my house, O priests, is in the sight of the whole city; and if there remains
                        in it that (I will not call it monument of the city, but that) tomb
                        inscribed with the name of my enemy, I had better migrate to some other
                        spot, rather than dwell in that city in which I am to see trophies erected
                        as tokens of victory over me and over the republic. <milestone n="38" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="101" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>Could I have such hardness of mind or such shamelessness of eye, as to be
                        able in that city, the preserver of which the senate has so often
                        unanimously decided that I am, to behold my house thrown down, not by my own
                        private enemy, but by the common foe, and then again built up and placed in
                        the sight of the whole city, that the weeping of the virtuous citizens might
                        know no cessation? The house of Spurius Maelius, who aimed at the kingdom,
                        was razed. What else ensued? The Roman people by the very name of
                        Aequimaelium, which they gave the place, decided that what had happened to
                        Maelius was deserved; the punishment inflicted on his folly was approved.
                        The house of Spurius Cassius was destroyed for the same reason; and on the
                        same spot was built the temple of Tellus. The house of Marcus Vaccus<note anchored="yes">Vitruvius Vaccus (as Livy calls him) was the leader of
                            the Fundani in the war between <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Privernum">Privernum</placeName>. He was taken prisoner in <placeName key="perseus,Privernum">Privernum</placeName>, and put to death. See

                        Vaccus's meadows, which was confiscated and destroyed in order that his
                        crime might be kept alive in people's recollection by the name of the place.
                        Marcus Manlius, when he had beaten back the attack of the Gauls from the
                        Capitoline steep, was not content with the renown of his good deed; he was
                        adjudged to have aimed at regal power, and on that account you see that his
                        house was pulled down and the place covered with two groves. That therefore
                        which our ancestors considered the greatest penalty which could be inflicted
                        on wicked and infamous citizens, am I to undergo and to endure, so as to
                        appear to posterity not to have been the extinguisher of conspiracy and
                        wickedness, but its author and leader? <milestone n="102" unit="section"/>
                        And will the dignity of the Roman people, O priests, be able to support this
                        stain of infamy and inconsistency, while the senate live, while you are the
                        chief man of the public council, if the house of Marcus Tullius Cicero
                        appears joined with the house of Fulvius Flaccus by the memory of a
                        punishment publicly inflicted? Marcus Flaccus because he had acted with
                        Caius Gracchus in a manner opposed to the safety of the republic, was put to
                        death by the sentence of the senate, and his house was destroyed and
                        confiscated, and on the spot Quintus Catulus some time after erected a
                        portico out of the spoils of the Cimbri. But that firebrand and fury of his
                        country, when, under those great generals Piso and Gabinius, he had taken
                        the city, and occupied, and was in entire possession of it, destroyed the
                        memorials of a most illustrious man who was dead, and united my house with
                        the house of Marcus Flaccus, in order that he, after he had crushed the
                        senate, might inflict on him whom the conscript fathers had pronounced to be
                        the saviour of his country, the same punishment which the senate had
                        inflicted on the destroyer of the constitution. <milestone n="39" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="103" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>But will you allow this portico to stand on the <placeName key="tgn,3000935">Palatine Hill</placeName>, and on the most beautiful spot in the whole
                        city, erected as an everlasting token to keep alive the recollection of all
                        nations and of all foes of the frenzy of the tribunes, of the wickedness of
                        the consuls of the cruelty of the conspirators, of the calamity of the

                        introduced it into mine? Do you, you who are the ministers of the religious

                        of public religion? O ye immortal gods! (for I wish you to hear these
                        things), does Publius Clodius have the management of your sacred rites? Does
                        he feel a reverent awe of your divine power? Is he a man who thinks that all
                        human affairs are regulated by your providence? Is he not mocking the

                        your authority, O priests? Can any expression of religion escape or fall
                        from that mouth? of religion, which with that same mouth you have most
                        foully and shamefully violated, by accusing the senate of passing severe
                        degrees about religion. <milestone n="40" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="105" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>Behold, behold, O priests, this religious man, and if it seems good to you,
                        (and it is only the duty of virtuous priests,) warn him that there are some
                        fixed limits to religion that a man ought not to be too superstitious. Why
                        was it necessary for you, O fanatical man, with an old woman's superstition,
                        to go to see a sacred ceremony which was being performed at another person's
                        house? And how was it that you were possessed with such weakness of mind as
                        to think it not possible for the gods to be sufficiently propitiated, unless
                        you intruded yourself into the religious ceremonies of women? Whom of your
                        ancestors did you ever hear of, of those men who were attentive to their
                        private religious duties, and who presided over the public priesthoods, who
                        were present when a sacrifice was being offered to the Bona Dea? No one; not
                        even that great man who became blind: from which it may be easily seen that
                        in this life men form many erroneous opinions; when he, who had not
                        knowingly seen anything which it was impious to see, lost his eye-sight; but
                        in the case of that fellow, who has polluted the ceremonies, not only by his
                        presence, but also by his incestuous guilt and, adultery, all the punishment
                        due to his eyes has fallen on the blindness of his mind. Can you, O priests,
                        avoid being influenced by the authority of this man, so chaste, so
                        religious, so holy, so pious a man, when he says that he, with his own
                        hands, pulled down the house of a most virtuous citizen, and with the same
                        hands consecrated it to the gods? <milestone n="106" unit="section"/>

                        was anything contrary to what was right in the bill, it should be invalid?
                        Will you then, O priests, by your decision, establish the point that it is
                        right that the home of every one of you, and your altars, and your hearths,
                        and your household gods, should be at the mercy of the caprice of the
                        tribunes? that it is right for any one, not only to throw down the house of
                        that man whom he may have chosen to attack with a body of excited men, and
                        may have driven away by violence,&mdash;which is an act of present
                        insanity, like the effect of a sudden terror,&mdash;but for him to bind
                        that man and property for all future time by the everlasting obligation of

					<p>I indeed, O priests, have always understood that in undertaking religious

                        honourable opinion of their divine power and intentions, while you suppose
                        that nothing is required by them which is unjust or dishonourable. That
                        disgrace to the city could not find one single man, not even when he had
                        everything in his power, to whom he could adjudge, or deliver, or make a
                        present of my house; though he himself was inflamed with a great desire for
                        that spot and for the house, and though, on that account alone, that
                        excellent man had brought in that exceedingly just bill of his to make
                        himself master of my property, yet even in the height of his madness he did
                        not dare to take possession of my house, with the desire of which he had
                        been so excited. Do you think that the immortal gods were willing to remove
                        into the house of that man to whose labour and prudence it was owing that
                        they still retained possession of their own temples, dismantled and ruined

                        placed on her tomb. A certain man of noble birth, not altogether unconnected
                        with this holy priest of Liberty, carried off this statue to decorate his
                        aedileship. He had in truth cherished the idea of surpassing all his
                        predecessors in the splendour of his appointments. Therefore he brought away
                        to his own house, like a prudent man as he was, all the statues and
                        pictures, all the decorations of any sort, that remained in the temples and

					<p>O Quintus Catulus! (Shall I appeal rather to the father, or to the son? The
                        memory of the son is fresher, and more closely connected with my exploits.)
                        How greatly were you mistaken when you thought that I should find the
                        greatest possible reward&mdash;a reward, too, becoming every day greater
                        in this republic when you said that it was impossible for there to be at the
                        same time in this city two consuls hostile to the republic. Two have been
                        found who gave over the senate bound hand and foot to a frantic tribune;
                        who, by edicts and positive commands, prohibited the conscript fathers from
                        entreating the people and coming to it as suppliants on my behalf; who
                        looked on while my house was being sacked and plundered; who ordered the
                        damaged relics of my property to be carried off to their own houses.
                            <milestone n="114" unit="section"/> I come now to the father. You, O
                        Quintus Catulus, chose the house of Marcus Fulvius, though he was the
                        father-in-law of your own brother, to be the monument of your victories, in
                        order that every recollection of that man who had embraced designs
                        destructive of the republic should be entirely removed from the eyes and
                        eradicated from the minds of men if, when you were building that portico,
                        any one had said to you that the time would come when that tribune of the
                        people, who had despised the authority of the senate and the opinion of all
                        virtuous men, should injure and overthrow your monument, while the consuls
                        were not looking on only, but even assisting in the work, and should join it
                        to the house of that citizen who as consul had defended the republic in
                        obedience to the authority of the senate; would you not have answered that
                        that could not possibly happen, unless the republic itself was previously
                        overthrown? <milestone n="44" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="115" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>But remark the intolerable audacity of the man, and at the same time his
                        headlong and unbridled covetousness. That fellow never thought of any
                        monument, or any religion; he wished to dwell splendidly and magnificently,
                        and to unite two large and noble houses. At the same moment that my
                        departure deprived him of all pretence for bloodshed, he was begging Quintus
                        Seius to sell him his house; and when he refused to do so, he threatened
                        that he would block up all his lights. Postumus declared that as long as he
                        was alive that house should never belong to Clodius. That acute young man
                        took the hint from his own mouth, as to what was best for him to do; and in
                        the most open manner he took the man off by poison. He bought the house,
                        after wearying out all the other bidders, for almost half as much again as
                        he thought it really worth. What is my object in making this statement.
                            <milestone n="116" unit="section"/> That house of mine is almost
                        entirely empty; scarcely one-tenth part of my house has been added to
                        Catulus's portico. The pretence was a promenade, and a monument, and that
                        Tanagran lady Liberty, (all Roman liberty having been entirely put down). He
                        had set his heart upon a portico with private chambers, paved to the
                        distance of three hundred feet, with a fine court surrounded by a colonnade,
                        on the <placeName key="tgn,3000935">Palatine Hill</placeName>, commanding a
                        superb view, and everything else in character, so as far to surpass all
                        other houses in luxury and splendour. And that scrupulous man, while he was
                        both buying and selling my house at the same moment, still, even in a time
                        of such darkness as that, did not venture to give in his own name as the
                        purchaser. He put up that fellow Scato, a man whose virtue it was, no doubt,
                        that had made him poor; so poor that among the Marsi, where he was born, he
                        had no house in which he could take refuge from the rain and yet he said now
                        that he had purchased the finest house on the <placeName key="tgn,3000935">Palatine</placeName> hill. The lower part of the house he assigned not
                        to his own Fonteian family, but to the Clodian family which he had quitted;
                        but of all the numerous family of Clodius, no one applied for any share in
                        his liberality except those who were utterly destitute from indigence and
                        wickedness. <milestone n="45" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="117" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>Will you, O priests, sanction this universal and unprecedented tyranny of
                        every sort, this impudence and audacity and covetousness?
                        &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;a priest was
                        present.&rdquo; Are you not ashamed, when the matter is being discussed
                        before the priests, to say that a priest was present, not the college of
                        priests? especially when, as tribune of the people, you had power to summon
                        them and even to compel their attendance. Be it so. You did not call in the
                        whole college. Well. Which of the college was it who was present? For he had
                        vested that authority in one individual which belongs to all of them;
                        however, the age and rank of the man invest him with additional dignity.
                        There was need also of knowledge and although they were all of them learned
                        men, still no doubt age gives them still more experience. <milestone n="118" unit="section"/> Who then was it who was present? &ldquo;The
                        brother,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;of my wife.&rdquo; If we ask
                        what was his authority, although he is of such an age that he cannot as yet
                        have much, still even such authority as a young man can have is to be
                        considered as diminished in his case, by reason of his near connection with
                        and relationship to you. But if we ask what knowledge he has, who could have
                        less than he who had only come into the college a few days before? And he
                        was the more bound to you by your recent kindness to him, inasmuch as he had
                        seen himself, the brother of your wife, preferred by you to your own
                        brother. Although in that matter you took care that your brother should not
                        be able to accuse you. </p>
					<p>Do you then call that a dedication, to which you were not able to invite the
                        college of pontiffs, or any single priest distinguished by honours conferred
                        on him by the Roman people nor even any other young man, though you had some
                        most intimate friends in the college? He only was present, if indeed he was
                        present, whom you yourself instigated, whom his sister entreated, and whom
                        his mother compelled to be so. <milestone n="119" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>Take care now, O priests, what decision you give in this cause of mine,
                        concerning the fortunes of all the citizens. Do you think that the house of
                        every single citizen can be consecrated by the word of a priest, if he takes
                        hold of a door-post and says something or other? But those dedications, and
                        those religious ceremonies respecting temples and shrines, were instituted
                        by our ancestors to do honour to the immortal gods, without inflicting any
                        misfortune on their fellow-citizens. A tribune of the people has been found,
                        who, assisted by the forces of the consuls, has rushed with all the violence
                        of insanity on that citizen, whom, after he had been beaten down, the
                        republic itself raised up again with its own hands. <milestone n="46" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="120" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>What next? Suppose any one like that fellow,&mdash;for there will not be
                        wanting men who will be willing to imitate him,&mdash;should by violence
                        oppress some one who does not resemble me, to whom the republic does not owe
                        as much as it does to me, and should dedicate his house by the agency of one
                        priest; will you determine by your authority that a deed done in that manner
                        ought to stand? Will you say, &ldquo;What priest will such a man be able
                        to find?&rdquo; What? Cannot a tribune of the people be himself a priest
                        also at the same time? Marcus Drusus, that most illustrious tribune of the
                        people, was a priest also. Therefore, if he had taken hold of a door-post of
                        the house of Quintus Caepio his enemy, and had uttered a few words, would
                        the house of Caepio have been dedicated to the gods? I say nothing here
                        about the privileges of the priesthood, nor about the language of the
                        dedication itself; <milestone n="121" unit="section"/>I say nothing about
                        religion, or religious ceremonies; I do not deny that I am ignorant of those
                        matters, of which I should conceal my knowledge, even if I were acquainted
                        with them, that I might not appear troublesome to others, and over curious
                        to you; although many particulars of your usages do escape, and often reach
                        the ears of the laity. I think, for instance, that I have heard that at the
                        dedication of a temple, a door-post must be taken hold of. For the door-post
                        is there where the entrance to the temple and its folding-door are. But no
                        one ever took hold of the posts of a promenade in dedicating that; but if
                        you have dedicated a statue or an altar, that cannot be moved from its place
                        afterwards without impiety. But you will not be able now to allege this,
                        since you have said that the priest did lay hands on the post. </p>
					<p>Although, why do I say anything about the dedication? or why do I discuss
                        your right and the religious features of the case, contrary to my original
                        intention? <milestone n="47" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="122" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>But, even if I were to allow that everything had been done with the
                        regularities of expression, according to ancient and established usages, I
                        should still defend myself by the common law of the republic. When, after
                        the departure of that citizen, to whose single exertions the senate and all
                        good men had so often decided that the safety of the state was owing, you,
                        with the aid of two most wicked consuls, were keeping down the republic
                        which was groaning under the oppression of your most shameful robberies;
                        when you had dedicated, with the countenance of some obscure priest, the
                        house of that man who was unwilling that the country which had been
                        preserved by him should perish on any pretence connected with him; could the
                        republic when it had recovered itself endure that? <milestone n="123" unit="section"/> Once, O priests, give an opening for such religious
                        acts as this, and you will very soon find no escape at all for any one's
                        property. If a priest has laid his hand on a door-post, and has transferred
                        expressions intended for the honour of the immortal gods to the injury of
                        the citizens, will the holy name of religion avail to procure the
                        ratification of such an injury, and yet will it not avail if a tribune of
                        the people consecrates the goods of any citizen with a form of words no less
                        ancient and almost equally solemn? But Caius Atinius, within the
                        recollection of our fathers, consecrated the property of Quintus Metellus,
                        who, as censor, had expelled him from the senate (your grandfather, O
                        Quintus Metellus, and yours, O Publius Servilius, and your
                        great-grandfather, O Publius Scipio;) placing a little brazier on the
                            <foreign lang="la">rostra</foreign> and summoning a flute-player to
                        assist him. What then? Did that frenzy of a tribune of the people, derived
                        from some precedents of extreme antiquity, do any injury to Quintus
                        Metellus, that great and most illustrious man? <milestone n="124" unit="section"/> Certainly not. We have seen a tribune of the people do
                        the same thing to Cnaeus Lentulus the censor. Did he then at all bind the
                        property of Lentulus to any peculiar sanctity? </p>
					<p>But why should I speak of other men? You yourself; I say, with your head
                        veiled, having summoned an assembly, having placed a brazier on the spot,
                        consecrated the property of your dear friend Gabinius, to whom you had given
                        all the kingdoms of the Syrians, and Arabians, and Persians. But if nothing
                        was really effected at that time, why should my property be affected by the
                        same measures? if, on the other hand, that consecration was valid, why did
                        that abyss of a man, who had swallowed up with you all the blood of the
                        republic, raise a villa as high as the heavens on my Tusculan estate, out of
                        the funds of the public treasury? And why have I not been allowed to look
                        upon the ruins of my property,&mdash;I, who am the only person who
                        prevented the whole city from being in a similar condition? <milestone n="48" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="125" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>I say nothing about Gabinius. Why? Did not Lucius Munius,<note anchored="yes">Some editions read Mummius.</note> the most fearless and most excellent
                        of all men, consecrate your property by your own precedent? And if, because
                        you yourself are concerned, you say that that action ought not to be
                        ratified, did you in that splendid tribuneship of yours establish laws
                        which, the moment that they were turned against yourself, you repudiated,
                        though you made use of them to ruin other people? If that consecration be
                        legal, then what is there in your property which can be applied to other
                        than holy uses? Or has a consecration no power, while a dedication draws
                        with it the sanctions of religion? What then was the meaning of your
                        summoning that flute-player to be a witness? What was the object of your
                        brazier? What became of your prayers? What was the meaning of all your
                        old-fashioned expressions? Did you wish to lie, to deceive, to abuse the
                        divine reverence due to the immortal gods, in order to strike terror into
                        men? For if that act is once ratified&mdash;I say nothing about
                        Gabinius,&mdash;most certainly your house and whatever else you have is
                        consecrated to <persName><surname>Ceres</surname></persName>. But if that
                        was a joke of yours, what can be more impure than you who have polluted
                        every sort of religion by lies and adulteries? <milestone n="126" unit="section"/> &ldquo;Well, I confess,&rdquo; says he,
                        &ldquo;that in the case of Gabinius I did behave wickedly.&rdquo;
                        You see now that the punishment which was established by you with reference
                        to another has been turned against yourself. But, O man, O you who are the
                        very model of every possible crime and wickedness, do you deny with respect
                        to me that which you admit in the case of Gabinius,&mdash;a man the
                        immodesty of whose childhood, the lust of whose youth, the disgrace and
                        indigence of whose subsequent life, the open robberies of whose consulship,
                        we have seen,&mdash;a man to whom even calamity itself could not happen
                        undeservedly? Did do you? that that was a more solemn act which you
                        performed with one young man alone for your witness, than it would have been
                        if you had had the whole assembly in that character?
                        &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;a dedication is an act which
                        carries the greatest possible quantity of sanctity with it.&rdquo;

					<p>Does not Numa Pompilius appear to be speaking to you? Learn his speech by
                        heart, O priests, and flamens. Do you too, O king of the sacrifices, learn
                        of the man of your own family; although, indeed, he has quitted that family;
                        but still learn from a man entirely devoted to religious observances, and
                        just, and deeply skilled in all questions of religion. What? in the case of
                        a dedication do not people inquire who says such and such a thing, and what
                        he says, and how? Do you so confuse and mix up these matters, that whoever
                        chooses can dedicate whatever he chooses, and in whatever manner he chooses?
                        Who were you who performed the dedication? By what right did you do so? By
                        what law? According to what precedent? By what power? When and where had the
                        Roman people appointed you to manage that business? For I see that there is
                        an old tribunitian law, which forbids any one to consecrate any house, land,
                        or altar, without the order of the Roman people. Quintus Papirius, who
                        proposed this law, did not perceive nor suspect that there would be danger
                        lest hereafter the houses or possessions of citizens who had not been
                        condemned might be consecrated. For that could not lawfully be done; nor had
                        any one ever done such a thing; nor was there any reason why a prohibition
                        should be issued, the effect of which appeared likely to be not so much to
                        deter people from an action as to remind them of it. <milestone n="128" unit="section"/> But because buildings were consecrated,&mdash;I do
                        not mean the licenses of private persons, but those which are called sacred
                        buildings,&mdash;and because lands were consecrated, <pb n="58"/> not in
                        such a way that any one who chose might consecrate our farms, but that a
                        general might consecrate lands taken from the enemy; and because altars were
                        erected, which carried with them a degree of sanctity to the place in which
                        they were consecrated; he forbade all these things to be done unless the
                        people ordered them. And if your interpretation of these edicts be that they
                        were framed with reference to our houses and lands, I make no objection. But
                        I ask, what law was passed that you should consecrate my house? where this
                        power was given to you? and by what right you did it? And I am not now
                        arguing about religion, but about the property of all of us; nor about the
                        sacerdotal law, but about the common law. <milestone n="50" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>The Papirian law forbids any building to be consecrated without the command
                        of the people. Grant that that law refers to our houses, and not to the
                        public temples. Show me one word of consecration in that law of
                        yours&mdash;if it is a law, and not merely an expression of your
                        wickedness and cruelty. <milestone n="129" unit="section"/> But if then, at
                        the time of that shipwreck of the republic, everything necessary had
                        occurred to you, or if the man who drew that law for you at the time of that
                        general conflagration of the state had not been making contracts with the
                        Byzantine exiles and with the royal ambassadors, but had his mind at leisure
                        to attend to (what I will not call the ordinances, but) the monstrous papers
                        which he was drawing, then you would have done what you wanted, if not in
                        fact at all events as far as regular legal language went. But at one and the
                        same time bonds for money were being drawn, treaties with provinces were
                        being entered into, titles of kings were being put up for sale, the
                        numbering of all the slaves was going on over the whole city street by
                        street enemies were being reconciled, new commands were being given to the
                        Roman youth, poison was being prepared for that unhappy Quintus Seius,
                        designs were being formed for assassinating Cnaeus Pompeius, the bulwark and
                        protector of the empire, and to prevent the senate from having any power,
                        and to cause the good to mourn for ever, and to reduce the captive republic,
                        by the treachery of the consuls, to a state of subjection to the violence of
                        the tribunes. When such numerous and such important designs were all on
                        foot, it is no wonder, especially while you were both in such a state of
                        frenzy and <pb n="59"/> blindness, that many things escaped both his notice
                        and yours. <milestone n="130" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>But take notice now, what the effect of this Papirian law is in such a case
                        as this; not such a case as you bring forward, full of wickedness and
                        frenzy. Quintus Marcius the censor had made a statue of Concord, and had
                        erected it in a public place. When Caius Cassius the censor had transported
                        it into the senate-house, he consulted your college, and asked whether there
                        was any reason why he should not dedicate that statue and the senate-house
                        to Concord. <milestone n="51" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>I beseech you, O priests, compare man with man, the one time with the other,
                        this case with that case. The one man was a censor of the greatest
                        moderation and of the highest character; the other was a tribune of the
                        people, of preeminent wickedness and audacity. That period was one of
                        tranquillity, when the people enjoyed a full measure of liberty, and the
                        senate all its legitimate authority; but your time was a time when the
                        liberty of the Roman people was oppressed, and when the authority of the
                        senate was destroyed. <milestone n="131" unit="section"/> The proposed
                        measure was one full of justice, wisdom, and dignity. For the censor, to
                        whose power (though you have abolished that) our ancestors chose to commit
                        the decision respecting the dignity of each member of the senate, wished the
                        statue of Concord to be in the senate-house, and wished also to dedicate the
                        senate-house to that goddess. It was a noble intention, and one worthy of
                        all praise. For he thought that by that measure he was enjoining that
                        opinions should be delivered without party spirit or dissension, if he bound
                        the place itself and the temple of public counsel by the religions reverence
                        due to the goddess Concord. You, when you were keeping down the enslaved and
                        oppressed city by the sword, by fear, by edicts, by privileges, by bands of
                        abandoned men constantly present, and by the fear of the army which was
                        absent and by threats of bringing it up, and by the assistance of the
                        consuls, and by your nefarious agreement with them, erected a statue of
                        Liberty in a mocking and shameless spirit, rather than with even any
                        pretence to religion. He was dedicating a thing in the senate-house, which
                        he was able to dedicate without any inconvenience to any one. You have
                        erected an image not of public Liberty, but of licentiousness, on what I may
                        call the blood and bones of that citizen <pb n="60"/> who of all others has
                        deserved best of the republic. <milestone n="132" unit="section"/> And
                        moreover he referred his design to the sacred college: to whom did you refer
                        yours? If you deliberated at all, if you had anything which you wished to
                        expiate, or any domestic sacrifice which you desired to institute, still
                        according to the ancient practice of other men you should have referred the
                        matter to the priests. When you were beginning a new temple in the most
                        beautiful spot in the city, with some wicked and unheard of object, did you
                        not think that you ought to refer the matter to the public priests? But if
                        you did not think it desirable to consult the whole college of priests, was
                        there no single one of them who seemed to you a suitable man (of those who
                        are eminent among all the citizens for age and honour and authority) for you
                        to communicate your intention about the dedication to him? The truth was,
                        not that you despised, but that you were afraid of their dignity. <milestone n="52" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>Could you have dared to ask Publius Servilius or Marcus Lucullus, (men by the

                        out of your hands, out of your jaws,) with what words or with what ceremony
                        you could consecrate the house of a citizen? (that is my first point;) and
                        in the next place, of that citizen, to whom the chief of the senate, to whom
                        all ranks of men, to whom all <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, to whom every nation upon earth, bore testimony that he

                        impudence, but still your eyes, and countenance, and voice would have failed
                        you while those men who, by their dignity, upheld the character of the Roman
                        people and the authority of the empire, were striking terror into you by
                        their dignified language, and saying that it would be impious for them to be
                        present at your frantic deeds, and at such wicked and parricidal attacks on
                        the country. <milestone n="134" unit="section"/> And when you saw this, then

                        he,&mdash;if he is really descended from those men who, it is
                        traditionally reported, learnt their sacred ceremonies from Hercules
                        himself; <pb n="61"/> after he had completed his labours,&mdash;would
                        not have been so cruel with respect to the distress of a brave man, as with
                        his own hands to place a tomb on the head of a man still living and
                        breathing; as he either actually said and did nothing at all, and bore this
                        as a punishment for the rashness of his mother, that he lent his presence
                        though mute, and his name to this sin; or, if he did say anything in a few
                        faltering words, and if he did touch the door-post with trembling hand, at
                        all events he did nothing regularly or solemnly, nothing according to proper
                        usages or established forms. He had seen Murena, his stepfather, the consul
                        elect in company with the Allobroges, bring to me when I was consul the
                        proofs of the conspiracy for the general destruction. He had heard from him
                        that he had twice received safety from me, once as an individual, and a
                        second time in common with the whole body of citizens. <milestone n="135" unit="section"/> Who is there, then, who can think that this new priest,
                        performing this his first religious ceremony, and uttering these his first
                        official words since his admission to the priesthood, would not have felt
                        his tongue grow mute, and his hand grow torpid, and his mind become weakened
                        and fail through fear; especially when out of all that numerous college he
                        saw neither king, nor flamen, nor priest and was compelled against his will
                        to become a partner in another's wickedness, and was enduring the most
                        terrible punishment of his most disgraceful relationship? <milestone n="53" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="136" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>But to return to the question of the vindication of the public rights, which
                        the priests themselves have always adapted not only to their own ceremonies,
                        but also to the commands of the people. You have a statement in your
                        records, that Caius Cassius the censor consulted the pontifical college
                        about dedicating the statue of Concord, and that Marcus Aemilius, the
                        Pontifex Maximus, answered him on behalf of the college, that unless the
                        Roman people had appointed him by name to superintend that business, it did
                        not appear to them that the statue could properly be consecrated. What more?
                        When Licinia,&mdash;a vestal virgin, a woman of the highest rank, and
                        invested with the most holy of all priesthoods,&mdash;in the consulship
                        of Titus Flamininus and Quintus Metellus, had dedicated an altar, and a
                        little chapel, and a cushion at the foot of the sacred rock; did not Sextus
                        Julius the praetor refer that matter to this college, in <pb n="62"/>
                        obedience to the authority of the senate? when Publius Scaevola, the
                        Pontifex Maximus, answered on behalf of the college, &ldquo;that what
                        Licinia, the daughter of Caius, had dedicated in a public place without the
                        authority of the people, did not appear to be holy.&rdquo; And with what
                        impartiality and with what diligence the senate annulled that act, you will
                        easily see from the words of the resolution of the senate. Read the
                        resolution of the senate. [The resolution of the senate is read.] <milestone n="137" unit="section"/> Do not you see that a commission is given to
                        the praetor of the city, to take care that that which she had consecrated
                        should not be accounted holy? and that, if any letters had been engraved or
                        inscribed upon it, they should be removed? Shame on the times, and on their
                        principles! Then the priests forbade the censor, a most holy man, to
                        dedicate it statue to Concord in a temple which had not been duly
                        consecrated. And after that the senate voted that that altar, which had been
                        consecrated on a most venerable spot, should be taken down in obedience to
                        the authority of the priests, and did not permit any memorial of writing to
                        exist as a relic of that dedication. You, O storm ravaging your
                        country,&mdash;you whirlwind and tempest dispelling peace and
                        tranquillity,&mdash;did you hope that the republic would endure what you
                        (in the shipwreck of the state, when darkness was spread over the republic,
                        when the Roman people was overwhelmed, when the senate was overturned and
                        expelled,) pulled down and built up? what you, after having violated every
                        feeling of religion, still polluted under the name of religion? that it
                        would endure the monument of the destruction of the republic which you
                        erected in the house of this citizen who is now speaking, and in the city
                        which he had preserved by his own exertions and dangers, to the disgrace of
                        the knights and the grief of all virtuous men; that it would endure the
                        inscription which you had placed there after having erased the name of
                        Quintus Catulus, one moment longer than the time that it was absent from
                        these walls, from which it had been driven at the same time that I myself
                        was? </p>
					<p>But if, O priests, you decide that no man who had a right to do so by law
                        performed this dedication, and that nothing was dedicated which lawfully
                        might be; then why need I prove that third point which I originally proposed
                        to <pb n="63"/> establish; namely, that he did not dedicate it with those
                        forms and words which such ceremonies require? <milestone n="54" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="138" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>I said at the beginning, that I was not going to say anything about your
                        peculiar science; nor about the sacrifices, nor about the recondite laws of
                        the priests. The arguments which I have hitherto advanced about the right of
                        dedication, have not been drawn from any secret description of books, but
                        are taken from common sources, from things openly done by the magistrates
                        and referred to the sacred college, from resolutions of the senate, and from
                        the law. Those inner mysteries, what ought to be said, or enjoined, or
                        touched, or taken hold of are still your own. <milestone n="139" unit="section"/> But if it were proved that all these things had been
                        done in a manner equal to the knowledge of Coruncanius, who is said to have
                        been the most experienced of priests; or if that great man Marcus Horatius
                        Pulvillus, who when many men out of envy endeavoured to hinder his
                        dedication by false pretences about religion, resisted them, and with the
                        greatest firmness dedicated the Capitol, had himself presided at such a
                        dedication as this, still I say that accuracy of religious observance would
                        not hallow a wicked act; much less can that act have any validity which an
                        unskillful young man, a new priest, influenced by the prayers of his sister
                        and the threats of his mother, ignorant and unwilling, without colleagues,
                        without books, without any adviser or assistant,<note anchored="yes">&ldquo;The Latin word <foreign lang="la">fictor</foreign>, and the

                            living animals, to make sham figures in flour and paste, or wax: they
                            also made the cakes which were

                        by stealth, with trembling heart and faltering tongue; especially when that

                        right or holy had often been as a woman among men, and a man among women,
                        completed the business in so hurried and disorderly a manner, that neither
                        his senses, nor his voice, nor his language, had any consistency in them.
                            <milestone n="55" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="140" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>It was then reported to you, O priests, and after that it became a common
                        topic of conversation, how he, with preposterous language with ill-omened
                            <foreign lang="la">auspices</foreign>, at times interrupting himself,
                        doubting, fearing, hesitating, pronounced and <pb n="64"/> did everything in
                        a manner wholly different from that which you have recorded as proper in
                        your books. It is, indeed, not very strange that in doing an act of such
                        wickedness and such insanity, even his audacity could not wholly repress his
                        fear. In truth, if no robber was ever so savage and inhuman, as, when he had
                        plundered temples, and then, having been excited by dreams or some
                        superstitious feelings, consecrated some altar on a desert shore, not to
                        shudder in his mind when compelled to propitiate with his prayers the deity
                        whom he has insulted by his wickedness; what do you suppose must have been
                        the agitation of mind of that plunderer of every temple, and of every house,
                        and of the whole city, when he was consecrating one single altar to avert
                        the vengeance due to his numberless acts of wickedness? <milestone n="141" unit="section"/> He could not possibly (although the insolence of power
                        had elated his mind, and although he was armed by nature with incredible
                        audacity) fail to blunder in his proceedings, or to keep constantly making
                        mistakes, especially when he had a priest and teacher who was compelled to
                        teach before he had learnt himself. There is great power, not only in the
                        divinity of the immortal gods, but also in the republic itself. When the
                        immortal gods saw the guardian and protector of their temples driven away in
                        a most wicked manner, they were unwilling to quit their temples and to
                        remove into his house. Therefore they alarmed the mind of that most
                        insensible man with fear and anxiety. But the republic, although that was
                        banished at the same time with myself, was still constantly present to the
                        eyes of its destroyer, and from his excited and kindled frenzy was
                        constantly demanding my restoration and its own. What marvel then is it, if
                        he, urged on by the insanity of fear and drawn on headlong by wickedness,
                        was neither able properly to perform the ceremonies which he had begun, nor
                        to utter one single word in due order with proper solemnity? <milestone n="56" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="142" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>And as this is the case, O priests, recall now your attention from this
                        subtle argument of ours to the general state and interests of the republic,
                        which you have before now had many gallant men to assist you in supporting,
                        but which in this cause you are upholding on your own shoulders alone. To
                        you the whole future authority of the senate, which you yourselves always
                        led in a most admirable manner during the discussion of my case; to you that

                        towns; to you the <placeName key="tgn,7006964">Campus Martius</placeName>,
                        and the unanimous voice of all the centuries, of which you were the chiefs
                        and leaders; to you every company in the city every rank of men all men who
                        have any property or any hopes, think that all their zeal for my dignity,
                        all their decisions in my favour are not only entrusted, but put wholly
                        under your protection. <milestone n="143" unit="section"/> Lastly the
                        immortal gods themselves, who protect this city and empire, appear to me to
                        have claimed the credit of my return and of the happiness which it has
                        diffused as due to the power and judicial sentence of their priests in order
                        to make it evident to all nations and to all posterity that I had been
                        restored to the republic by divine agency. For this return of mine, O
                        priests and this restoration consists in recovering my house, my
                        possessions, my altars, my hearths, and my household gods. And if that
                        fellow with his most wicked hands tears up their dwellings and abodes and
                        with the consuls for his leaders, as if the city were taken, has thought it
                        becoming to destroy this house alone, as if it were the house of its most
                        active defender, still those household gods, those deities of my family,
                        will be by you replaced in my house at the same time as myself. <milestone n="57" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="144" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>Wherefore, O I pray and entreat you, O thou great God of the Capitol, thee
                        whom the Roman people has styled, on account of your kindnesses to us, All
                        Good, and, on account of your might All Powerful; and you, O royal Juno; and
                        you, O guardian of the city, O Minerva, you who have at all times been my

                        rage and frenzy and wickedness of men whose renowned and eternal fire I
                        could not suffer either to be extinguished in the blood of the citizens or
                        to be confused with the conflagration of the whole city, I entreat you all
                            that,&mdash;<milestone n="145" unit="section"/>if at that almost <pb n="66"/> fatal crisis of the republic I exposed my life, in defence of
                        your ceremonies and temples, to the rage and arms of abandoned citizens; and
                        it at a subsequent time, when the destruction of all good men was aimed at
                        through my ruin, I invoked your aid, I recommended myself and my family to
                        your protection, I devoted myself and my life, on condition that it both at

                        advantage, all my own interests, and all reward for my exertions, I strove
                        with all my anxiety and thoughts and vigilance for nothing but the safety of
                        my fellow-citizens, I might be allowed some day or other to enjoy my country
                        restored to me; but if my counsels had been of no service to my country,
                        then, that I might endure everlasting misery, separated from all my
                        friends;&mdash;I may be allowed to think this devotion of my life
                        accepted and approved by the gods, when I am by your favour restored to my
                        home. <milestone n="146" unit="section"/> For at present, O priests, I am
                        not only deprived of my house, which you are at present inquiring into, but
                        of the whole city, to which I appear to be restored. In the most frequented
                        and finest part of the city, look to that (I will not say monument, but)
                        wound of the country. And as you must see that that sight is to me one which
                        is more to be detested and avoided than death itself; do not, I entreat you,
                        allow that man by whose return you have thought that the republic too would
                        be restored, to be deprived not only of the ornaments suited to his dignity,
                        but even of his part in the city. <milestone n="58" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>I am not moved by the plundering of my property, nor by the razing of my
                        houses, nor by the devastation of my farms, nor by the booty most cruelly
                        taken by the consuls out of my possessions. I have always considered these
                        as perishable and fleeting gifts of fortune and of the times, and not as
                        proofs of virtue or genius; and they are things, too, of which I have never
                        thought it becoming to wish for plenty and abundance, so much as for
                        moderation in enjoying them, and patience if deprived of them. <milestone n="147" unit="section"/> In truth, the moderate amount of my family
                        property very nearly corresponds to my necessities; and I shall leave a
                        sufficiently ample patrimony to my children in the name and memory of their
                        father. But I cannot without great discredit to the republic, and great <pb n="67"/> shame and misery to myself, continue deprived of my house,
                        which has been taken from me by wickedness, and, under pretence of religion,
                        built up again with even more impiety than it was pulled down. </p>
					<p>Wherefore, if you consider that my return is pleasing and acceptable to the
                        immortal gods, to the senate, to the Roman people, to all <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, to the provinces, to foreign
                        nations, and to yourselves who have always taken the lead in and exercised a
                        principal influence over all measures connected with my safety, I beg and
                        entreat you, O priests, now, since it is the will of the senate that you
                        should do so, to place me, whom you have restored by your authority and zeal
                        and votes to my country, with your own hands in my house. </p>

					<head>THE SPEECH OF M. T. CICERO RESPECTING THE ANSWERS OF THE SOOTHSAYERS. ADDRESSED TO THE SENATE.</head>
					<argument>
						<head>THE ARGUMENT.</head>
						<p>This speech was spoken towards the close of the year after the last
                            speech, but it follows it in nearly all editions, as it relates in some
                            degree to the same subject. In the early part of the summer many
                            prodigies were reported to have happened in the neighborhood of
                                <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>. And the senate
                            consulted the soothsayers as to the cause of them, and as to the means
                            of averting their consequences. The soothsayers made answer, that the
                            solemn shows and plays had been negligently exhibited; that sacred
                            places had been treated as profane; that ambassadors had been
                            ill-treated and slain; that good faith and oaths had been disregarded,
                            and ancient and secret sacrifices neglected and profaned. That these
                            prodigies had been sent as warnings by the gods, lest the Romans should
                            bring evil on themselves and on their country by continuing their
                            disorderly conduct and dissensions. That therefore the evils must be
                            amended, or removed as far as possible, and supplications made to
                            <persName><surname>Jupiter</surname></persName>, <persName><surname>Saturn</surname></persName>, <persName><surname>Neptune</surname></persName>, and the other gods. </p>
						<p>After this answer had been received, Clodius, who was now aedile, called
                            the people together, and made them a speech to prove that the evils
                            which had especially offended the gods were the tyrannical conduct of
                            Cicero, and the restoration of his house, after it had been consecrated
                            to the service of religion. Cicero replied to this harangue the next day
                            in the senate, arguing that all the offenses which could have excited
                            the displeasure of the gods were much more fairly imputable to Clodius
                            than to him; and after exculpating himself, and dwelling on the outrages
                            of which Clodius had notoriously been guilty, he exhorted all citizens
                            of all classes to lay aside their mutual animosities, as the only way of
                            regaining the favour of the gods and their former prosperity.</p>

					<p>Yesterday, O conscript fathers, when I was greatly moved by the thoughts of
                        your dignity, and of the great attendance of the Roman knights to whom a
                        senate was given, I thought myself bound to check the shameless impudence of
                        Publius Clodius, when he was hindering the cause of the publicans from being
                        proceeded with by the most foolish possible <pb n="69"/> questions, and was
                        studying to save Publius Tullio the Syrian and was, even before your eyes
                        selling himself to him to whom, indeed, he had already been entirely sold.
                        Therefore I checked the man in his frenzy and exultation, the very moment
                        that I gave him a hint of the danger of a public trial; and by two
                        half-uttered words I bridled all the violence and ferocity of that
                        gladiator. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>But he, ignorant what sort of men the consuls were, pale and fuming with me
                        burst on a sudden out of the senate house, with some broken and empty
                        threats and with those denunciations with which he used to terrify us in the
                        time of <persName><surname>Piso</surname></persName> and Gabinius. And when
                        I began to press upon him, as he was departing, I received the greatest
                        reward of my exertions by all of you rising up at the same time with me, and
                        by all the publicans thronging round me to escort me. But that senseless man
                        stopped on a sudden out of countenance, colourless, and voiceless; then he
                        looked back; and, as soon as he beheld Cnaeus Lentulus<note anchored="yes">This is not the same Lentulus as had been consul the preceding year.
                            This was Cnaeus Cornelius Lentulus Marcellinus; the former consul was
                            Publius Cornelius Lentulus Spinther.</note> the consul, he fell down
                        almost on the threshold of the senate house from the recollection, I
                        imagine, of his dear friend Gabinius and from regret for <persName><surname>Piso</surname></persName>. And why need I speak at all of his
                        unbridled and headlong fury? He cannot be wounded by me with more severe
                        language than he was on the instant being crushed and overwhelmed at the
                        very moment of his acting in that manner by Publius Servilius. And even if I
                        were able to equal the extraordinary and almost divine energy and dignity of
                        that man, still I cannot doubt that those weapons which out enemy hurled at
                        him would appear less powerful and less sharp than those which the colleague
                        of his father aimed at him. <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>But still I wish to explain the principles of my conduct to those men who
                        thought that I was carried away yesterday by my indignation, and that, out
                        of passion, I made a wider digression than the deliberate calmness of a
                        philosopher allowed. I did nothing in anger nothing from not being able to
                        restrain my temper nothing which I had not maturely considered and
                        determined on a long time before. For I, O conscript fathers, have always
                        professed myself an enemy to those two men who were bound to have defended
                        and were <pb n="70"/> able to have preserved both me and the republic; and
                        who though they were called to the performance of their duty as consuls by
                        the very ensigns of their office, and to the preservation of my safety, not
                        only by your authority but even by your prayers, first of all deserted, then
                        betrayed, and last of all opposed me; and, having received the rewards of
                        their nefarious covenant, wished utterly to overwhelm and destroy me
                        together with the republic; and who, during the time of their magistracy and
                        command, bloody and fatal that it was, were neither able to defend the walls
                        of our allies from chastisement, nor to inflict chastisement on the cities
                        of the enemy; but who bore along into all my houses and lands, razing, and
                        conflagration, and destruction, and depopulation, and devastation, to the
                        great enriching of themselves with my plunder. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>Against these furies and firebrands, with these destructive monsters and
                        pests, which have been (I may almost say) desolating this empire, I do say
                        that I have undertaken inexpiable war; and yet, even that is not as great as
                        my sufferings and those of my relations require, though it may be enough to
                        satisfy your indignation and that of all virtuous men. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>But my hatred towards Clodius is not greater this day than it was then, when
                        I knew that he was scorched, as it were, by those most holy fires, and that
                        he had escaped in female attire from the house of the Pontifex Maximus,
                        after attempting an act of most atrocious licentiousness. Then, I say, then
                        I perceived, and foresaw long beforehand, how great a tempest was being
                        raised, how great a storm was threatening the republic. I saw that that
                        ill-omened wickedness, that that intolerable audacity of a young man, mad,
                        nobly born, and disgraced as he was, could not be hindered from breaking
                        through the bounds of tranquillity; that that evil would certainly break out
                        some day or other to the destruction of the state, if it were allowed to
                        remain unpunished. There has not been much since to add to my detestation of
                        that man. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> For he has not done anything
                        against me out of hatred to me, but out of hatred to strictness, out of
                        hatred to dignity, out of hatred to the republic. He has not insulted me
                        more than he has the senate, or the Roman knights, or all good men, or the
                        whole of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>. Lastly, he has not
                        behaved more wickedly towards me than he has towards the immortal gods. In
                        truth, he has polluted those gods with his <pb n="71"/> impiety whom no one
                        before ever did. Towards me his disposition has been the same as that of his
                        dear friend Catiline would have been, if he had been victorious. Therefore,
                        I never thought it necessary for me to prosecute him, any more than that
                        blockhead, whose very nation we should be ignorant of if he did not himself
                        say that he was a Ligurian. For why should I pursue this animal, this beast,
                        bribed by the food and acorns thrown him by my enemy? a fellow, who, if he
                        had only sense to know to what wickedness he has bound himself, would be, I
                        doubt not, most wretched; but if he is not aware of it there is some danger
                        lest he may save himself by the excuse of stupidity. </p>
					<p><milestone n="6" unit="section"/> There is also this consideration which
                        weighs with me that, according to universal expectation, that man seems
                        devoted and marked out as the victim of that most gallant and most
                        illustrious man Titus Annius; from whom it would be a scandalous thing for
                        me to snatch the credit which is destined for, and already openly promised
                        to him, when it is owing to his exertions that I myself have recovered my
                        own dignity and safety. <milestone n="4" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>In truth, as that great man, Publius Scipio, appears to me to have been born
                        for the overthrow and destruction of <placeName key="tgn,7016143">Carthage</placeName>, he being the only man who, at last, as it were,
                        by a special decree of destiny, did overthrow it after it had been besieged,
                        attacked, undermined, and almost taken by many generals; so Titus Annius
                        appears to have been born, and to have been given to the republic, by a sort
                        of divine munificence as it were for the express purpose of repressing and
                        extinguishing and utterly destroying that pest of the state. He alone has
                        discovered the way not only of defeating but also of fettering an armed
                        citizen who was driving the citizens away, some by the sword, some by
                        stones, was confining others to their houses and alarming the whole city,
                        the senate house, the forum, and all the temples with bloodshed and
                        conflagration. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> I will never, with my own
                        free will, take out of the hands of this man, being so good a man as one who
                        has deserved so well of me and of his country, that criminal of all men in
                        the world, whose enmity be has not only encountered, but has even sought for
                        out of a regard for my safety. But if, even now that he is entangled in all
                        the dangers of the laws, surrounded by the hatred of all virtuous men, and
                            <pb n="72"/> hemmed in on all sides by the expectation or punishment
                        which cannot be long delayed, still, hesitating and hampered as he is, he
                        persists in rushing on, and making attacks upon me, I will resist him, and
                        gaining the consent, or, perhaps, the assistance of <persName><surname>Milo</surname></persName>, I will frustrate his endeavours; as
                        I did yesterday, when, while he was threatening me in dumb show, as I was
                        standing near him, I just said one word about the beginning of legal
                        proceedings and a trial. He sat down. He did not say a word. Suppose he had
                        brought a charge against me, as he had threatened, I should have instantly
                        taken steps to have him summoned to appear before the praetor in three days.
                        And let him restrain himself with the idea that if he is content with those
                        acts of wickedness which he has already committed, he is already dedicated
                        to <persName><surname>Milo</surname></persName>; but if he aims any dart
                        against me, that then I shall immediately employ all the weapons of the
                        courts of justice and of the laws. </p>
					<p><milestone n="8" unit="section"/> And a little time ago, O conscript fathers,
                        he held an assembly, and made a speech which was directed wholly against me.
                        And I will tell you the argument and sentiment which ran through the whole
                        of his speech. And when you have been sufficiently amused at the fellow's
                        impudence, I will give you the details of everything that then took place.
                            <milestone n="5" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>Publius Clodius, O conscript fathers, made a long speech about religious
                        observances, and sacrifices, and ceremonies. Publius Clodius, I say,
                        complained that the sacrifices and religious rites were neglected, profaned,
                        and polluted. It is no wonder if this seems to you an absurdity. Indeed the
                        very assembly which he himself had convened laughed at the idea of a man,
                        who has been pierced, as be himself is in the habit of boasting, with two
                        hundred resolutions of the senate against him, every one of which was passed
                        against him because of matters connected with religion,&mdash;of that
                        fellow who carried his adulteries to the shrine of the Good Goddess herself;
                        and who profaned those sacred rites which may not be seen without impiety by
                        the eyes of a man even unintentionally, not only by the view of a man, but
                        by lust and wickedness, complaining in a public assembly about the neglect
                        of religion. Therefore they are now expecting another speech from him on the
                        subject of chastity. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> For what difference
                        does it make whether, when just driven from the most holy of altars, he
                        makes complaints of the state of the sacrifices and religious observances;
                            <pb n="73"/> or whether, having just left his sister's bed-chamber, he
                        speaks in defence of modesty and chastity? In his harangue he recited the
                        lately received answer of the soothsayers about the noises which have been
                        heard; in which among many other things it is stated, (as you have heard
                        yourselves,) that holy and sacred places had been treated as common. Under
                        that head he said that my house was intended, which had been consecrated by
                        that holiest of pontiffs, Publius Clodius. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> I am delighted at not only having a reasonable pretext for, but being
                        even under an absolute necessity of speaking about this prodigy, which I am
                        not sure that I may not call the most important one that has for many years
                        been reported to this body. For you find that by every part of this prodigy
                        and of this answer, we have been warned, I may almost say by the voice of
                        the all-good and all-powerful <persName><surname>Jupiter</surname></persName> himself, of the wickedness and frenzy of that man,
                        and of the immense dangers which are impending over the state. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> But first of all I will clear up the objections
                        made on the score of religion in the case of my own house, if I am able to
                        do so truly, and without leaving the least doubt in any one's mind; but if
                        the very slightest scruple on the subject exists in any one's mind, I will
                        obey the prodigies sent by the immortal gods, and comply with what is
                        required by the reverence due to them not only with a patient but even with
                        a willing mind. <milestone n="6" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>But what house is there in the whole city so clear and free from all
                        suspicion of being a consecrated building as this? Although your houses, O
                        conscript fathers, and those of all the other citizens, are, for much the
                        greater part of them, free from all religious obligation, yet my house is
                        the only one in the whole city which has been pronounced to be so by the
                        decision of all the tribunals. For I appeal to you, O Lentulus and to you, O
                        Philippus. After this reply was received from the soothsayers, the senate
                        decreed that you should refer the question of hallowed and consecrated spots
                        to this order of the senate. Can you put any question to them concerning my
                        house? which (as I have said) is the only one in the whole of the city which
                        has been pronounced by every tribunal in it to be free from every sort of
                        religious obligation; which at first my enemy himself; even in the time of
                        that storm and nocturnal darkness which was overwhelming the republic, when
                        he had set down all his other wicked actions with that <pb n="74"/> foul pen
                        of his dipped in the mouth of Sextus Clodius, did not mark with one single
                        letter indicating any religions liability. And in the second place, the
                        Roman people, whose power is supreme in all matters in the <foreign lang="la">comitia centuriata</foreign>, and by the suffrage of every age
                        and every rank of men, ordered it to remain in the same condition in which
                        it had previously been. </p>
					<p><milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Afterwards, O conscript fathers, not
                        because the matter was doubtful, but in order to cut off every argument from
                        this furious man, if he chose to remain any longer in this city which he was
                        anxious to destroy, you passed a decree that a reference should be made to
                        the college of pontiffs as to the religious liability of my house. What
                        obligation can there possibly be from our greatest doubts and most serious
                        religious apprehensions, as to which we may not be relieved by the answer
                        and dictum of Publius Servilius or Marcus Lucullus alone? In all matters
                        concerning the public sacrifices, or the great games, or the ceremonies of
                        the household gods, and of Vesta, the mother of the city, or even concerning
                        that great sacrifice itself which is performed for the safety of the Roman
                        people, and which since the first foundation of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> has never been profaned except by
                        the wickedness of this single holy guardian of religion, whatever three
                        pontiffs have decided, has at all times appeared to the Roman people, and to
                        the senate, and to the immortal gods themselves, sufficiently holy,
                        sufficiently august, sufficiently religious. But Publius Lentulus being both

                            to the secretaries of the pontiffs when the real pontiffs had begun to
                            neglect their duties, and to leave the greater part of them to be
                            performed by their secretaries. <foreign lang="la">Vide</foreign> Smith,

					<p>I say that so numerous a meeting of the college has never decided on any
                        subject, not even concerning the rights or life of a vestal virgin, ever
                        since the establishment of sacred ceremonies, though their antiquity is the
                        same as that of the city itself; although when an investigation into any
                        crime is taking place it is of consequence that as many as possible should
                        be present. For the interpretation of a law given by the priests is on such
                        a footing that it has the same force as a decision of the judges. An
                        explanation of what is required by religion can be properly given by one
                        single experienced priest; but in a case of a trial for life, such a
                        proceeding would be harsh and unjust. Nevertheless, you will find this to be
                        the case, that a greater number of pontiffs were assembled when they decided
                        on the question concerning my house, than had ever met on any question
                        concerning the ceremonies of the vestal virgins. The next day the senate in
                        a very full house, when you, O Lentulus, being the consul elect, made the
                        motion, and Publius Lentulus and Quintus Metellus, the consuls, put it to
                        the senate, when all the pontiffs who belonged to this order were present
                        and when those who had precedence, from the distinctions which had been
                        conferred on them by the Roman people, had made many speeches concerning the
                        decision of the college, and when all of them had assisted in drawing up the
                        decree,&mdash;the senate, I say, voted that my house appeared, according
                        to the decision of the pontiffs, to be free from all religious
                            liability.<milestone n="14" unit="section"/> Is this then the place
                        which of all others the soothsayers appear to intend to speak of as sacred,
                        which is the only one of all private buildings in the whole city which has
                        this argument to advance in support of its rights, that it has been adjudged
                        not to be sacred by those very men who preside over all sacred things?</p>
					<p>However, refer the matter to them, as you are bound to do <pb n="76"/>
                        according to the resolution of the senate. Either the investigation will be
                        allotted to you who were the first to pronounce an opinion respecting this
                        house, and who have pronounced it free from all religious liability; or the
                        senate itself will decide, which has already decided in the fullest possible
                        house, that one single priest alone dissenting; or else, what will certainly
                        be done, it will be referred back to the pontiffs, to whose authority,
                        integrity, and prudence our ancestors entrusted all sacred and religious
                        observances, whether private or public. What then can these men decide
                        different from what they have already decided? There are many houses in this
                        city, O conscript fathers; I do not know whether they are not nearly all
                        held by thoroughly good titles, but still they are only private titles,
                        titles derived from inheritance, from prescription, from purchase, or from
                        mortgage. But I assert that there is no other house whatever equally fenced
                        round by private title and incontestable rights, and at the same time by
                        every sort of public law of the highest authority, both human and divine.
                            <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> For in the first place it was built
                        by the authority of the senate, with the public money; and in the second
                        place it has been fenced round and fortified against the impious violence of
                        this gladiator by numerous resolutions of the senate. <milestone n="8" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>At first a commission was given to those same magistrates in the preceding
                        year, to whom at times of the greatest peril the whole republic is usually
                        recommended, to take care that I was to be allowed to proceed in building
                        without any hindrance from violence. Afterwards, when that fellow had
                        brought devastation on my estate with stones, and fire, and sword, the
                        senate voted that those who had acted in that manner were liable to be
                        proceeded against by the laws concerning violence which are in force against
                        those who have attacked the whole republic. But when you put the question, O
                        you best and bravest of consuls within the memory of man, the same senate in
                        a very full house decreed, that whoever injured my house would be acting
                        against the interests of the republic. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> I
                        say that there never were so many resolutions of the senate passed about any
                        public work, monument or temple, as about my house, the only house since the
                        first foundation of the city which the senate has thought ought to be built
                        at the public expense, released from all religious <pb n="77"/> obligation
                        by the pontiffs, defended by the magistrates, and put under the protection
                        of the judges who were to punish all who injured it. On account of his
                        immense services to the republic, a house at <placeName key="perseus,Velia">Velia</placeName> was given by a public vote to Publius Valerius. But
                        my house was restored to me on the <placeName key="tgn,3000935">Palatine
                            Hill</placeName>. He had a spot of ground given him. I had walls also
                        and a roof. He had a house given to him which he was to defend by his rights
                        as a private citizen; but I had one which all the magistrates were ordered
                        to protect with the public force of the city. And if I had all this owing to
                        my own exertions, or if I had received it from any other persons except you,
                        I would not mention it before you, lest I might appear to be boasting too
                        much. But as all these things have been given me by you, and as they are now
                        being attacked by the tongue of that man by whose hand they were formerly
                        overthrown, when you restored them with your own hands to me and to my
                        children, I am not speaking of my own actions but of yours; nor am I afraid
                        lest this public mention of all your kindness to me should appear to be not
                        so much grateful as arrogant. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>Although, if indeed a certain indignation which I cannot help feeling were to
                        lead me who have exerted myself so much in the cause of the public safety at
                        times to speaking some what boastfully when refuting the aspersions of
                        wicked men who would not excuse me for so doing? For I did see yesterday
                        someone murmuring: and people said that he declared that he could not endure
                        me because when I was asked by that foul traitor to his country to what city
                        I belonged, I answered, with the approval of you and of the Roman knights
                        also, that I belonged to a city which could not do without me. He, I
                        imagine, groaned at this. What then was I to answer? (I ask that very man
                        who cannot endure me.) That I was a Roman citizen? It would have been a
                        truly learned answer. Should I have held my tongue? That would have been a
                        betrayal of my own cause. Can any man when it is attempted to excite odium
                        against him with respect to important affairs, reply with sufficient dignity
                        to the abuse of his enemy without some praise of himself? But no doubt he
                        himself, when he is attacked, not only answers as well as he can, but is
                        even glad to be prompted by his friends and to have an answer suggested to
                        him. <pb n="78"/>

					<p>But since I have now said enough respecting my own case, let us see now what
                        it is that the soothsayers say. For I confess that I have been greatly moved
                        both by the magnitude of the prodigies, and by the solemnity of the answer,
                        and by the unanimous and consistent language of the soothsayers. Nor am I a
                        man who,&mdash;though I may perhaps appear to some men to be more
                        addicted to the study of literature than the rest of those are who are
                        occupied about state affairs as much as myself&mdash;at all incline to
                        derive delight from or to pursue those branches of learning which have a
                        tendency to divert and deter our minds from the study of religion. But in
                        the first place, I have our ancestors as my leaders and tutors in paying
                        proper respect to religion,&mdash;men whose wisdom appears to me to have
                        been so great, that those men are sufficiently, and more than sufficiently
                        prudent, who are able&mdash;I will not say to equal their prudence, but
                        to be thoroughly aware how great it was; who thought that the stated and
                        regular ceremonies were provided for by the establishment of the
                        Pontificate, that due authority for the performance of all actions was to he
                        derived from the <foreign lang="la">auspices</foreign>, that the ancient
                        prophecies of our destinies were contained in the books of the prophets of
                        Apollo, and the explanations of prodigies in the system of the Etrurians;
                        and this last is of such weight that within our own recollection they have
                        predicted to us in no obscure language, first of all those fatal beginnings
                        of the Italian war, and after that the imminent danger and almost
                        destruction of the time of Sulla and Cinna, and very lately this recent
                        conspiracy for burning the city and destroying the empire. <milestone n="19" unit="section"/> In the next place, I knew that the most learned and the
                        wisest men have both said many things and have left behind them many written
                        books concerning the divine power of the immortal gods. And although I see
                        that those books are written with a godlike eloquence, still they are such
                        that our ancestors appear to have taught those things to the writers, and
                        not to have learnt of them. In truth, who is there so senseless as either,
                        when he looks up to heaven, not to feel that there are gods, or to think
                        that those things are done by chance which are done with such wisdom, that
                        scarcely any one by any amount of skill can comprehend their order and
                        necessary dependence on each other? or, when he has arrived at the knowledge
                        that there are gods, not to understand that all this <pb n="79"/> mighty
                        empire has been originated, and increased, and preserved by their divine
                        authority? Let us, O conscript fathers, think as highly of ourselves as we
                        please; and yet it is not in numbers that we are superior to the Spaniards,
                        nor in personal strength to the Gauls, nor in cunning to the Carthaginians,
                        nor in arts to the Greeks, nor in the natural acuteness which seems to be
                        implanted in the people of this land and country, to the Italian and Latin
                        tribes; but it is in and by means of piety and religion, and this especial
                        wisdom of perceiving that all things are governed and managed by the divine
                        power of the immortal gods, that we have been and are superior to all other

					<p>Wherefore, not to say any more about a doubtful matter, give, I pray you,

                        nothing of that ancient system, given, as men report, to Etruria by the
                        immortal gods themselves; but cannot we ourselves be soothsayers here?
                        &ldquo;A certain obscure noise, and a horrible rattling of arms, has
                        been heard in a neighbouring and suburban district.&rdquo; Who is there
                        of all those giants, whom the poets relate to have waged war against the
                        immortal gods, so impious as not to confess that by this novel and mighty
                        commotion the gods are foreshowing and predicting something important to the
                        Roman people? Concerning that matter it is written down that entreaties are
                        to be addressed to <persName><surname>Jupiter</surname></persName>, Saturn,

                        Well, I hear what gods have been offended and to whom atonement is due; but
                        I want to know on account of what offences committed by men they have been
                        offended. &ldquo;On account of the games having been carelessly
                        exhibited and polluted.&rdquo; What games? I appeal to you, O Lentulus;
                        for the sacred cars and chariots, the singing, the sports, the libations,
                        and feasts of the public games belong to your priesthood; and I appeal to
                        you, O pontiffs, to whom those who prepare the banquet for the all-good and
                        all-powerful <persName><surname>Jupiter</surname></persName> report it if
                        anything has been neglected or done improperly, and if you give sentence
                        that it shall be so, those ceremonies are celebrated anew and repeated over
                        again. What games are they which have been exhibited without due diligence?
                        By what wickedness, by what sort of <pb n="80"/> crime have they been
                        polluted? You will answer on behalf of yourself; and of your colleagues, and
                        of the college of pontiffs, that none of these things have been treated
                        contemptuously through the carelessness of anyone, or polluted by any
                        wickedness, but that all the solemnities and practices of the games have
                        been attended to with a proper observance of all necessary things, and with
                        the strictest performance of all the usual ceremonies. <milestone n="11" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="22" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>What games, then, are they which the soothsayers say have not been performed
                        with due diligence, and have been polluted? Those of which the immortal gods
                        themselves and the blessed mother Cybele chose you&mdash;you, O Cnaeus
                        Lentulus, by the hands of whose ancestor she was originally
                        received&mdash;to be a spectator. And unless you had chosen to be a
                        spectator of the Megalesia on that day, I do not know whether we should have
                        been allowed to be give and to complain of these things. For an enormous
                        multitude of slaves in a state of great excitement, collected out of all the
                        streets by this religious aedile, burst in on a sudden upon the stage from
                        all the arch-ways and doors at a given signal. Your virtue,&mdash;yours,
                        I say, O Cnaeus Lentulus,&mdash;was at that crisis shown to be equal to
                        that formerly displayed by your ancestor as a private individual. The senate
                        standing up, and the Roman knights and all virtuous men, followed you, and
                        your name and your command, and your voice, aspect, and authority, when he

                        violated and polluted, and turned almost to a massacre and to the

					<p>She, then, she it is, who has displayed to the Roman people these tokens of
                        wickedness, and revealed to them these indications of danger. For why should
                        I speak of those games which our ancestors ordered to be performed and
                        celebrated on the <placeName key="tgn,3000935">Palatine Hill</placeName>, in
                        front of the temple, in the very sight of the mighty Mother, on the day of
                        the Megalesia?<note anchored="yes">The Megalesia were the great festivals in
                            honour of Cybele, celebrated in April, on the anniversary of the day
                            when her statue was brought from Pessenus. They lasted six days, and
                            were among the most important of all the festivities of the sort which
                            were held at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. <foreign lang="la">Vide</foreign> Smith, Dict. Ant. v. <foreign lang="la">Megalesia</foreign>.</note> which are in their institution and in
                        the manner in which they are celebrated, above all other games chaste,
                        solemn, and holy; in which games that great man Publius Africanus the elder,
                        in his second consulship, gave for the first time the senate a place in
                        front of the seats belonging to the people. Why need I tell how that foul
                        pestilence polluted these games when if any freeman came near them either as
                        a spectator or from some motive of religion, he was driven back by force and
                        no matron approached them because of the number and violence of the slaves?
                        And so these games&mdash;the reverence paid to which is so great that
                        the goddess did not come to this city without having been sent for from the
                        most distant countries,&mdash;which are the only games which have not
                        even a Latin name, so that by their very name the religion is declared to
                        have been a foreign one and imported hither and to have been undertaken in
                        the name of the mighty Mother,&mdash;these games, I say, were celebrated
                        by slaves, and had slaves alone for the spectators, and in every part, in
                        this man's aedileship, were the Megalesia of slaves. <milestone n="25" unit="section"/> O ye immortal gods! How could you speak more plainly to
                        us if you were living <pb n="82"/> among and associating with us? You show
                        us and plainly tell us that those games were profaned. What can be mentioned
                        more deformed, polluted, altered and perverted, than for the whole body of
                        slaves, as if they had been liberated by the permission of the magistrates,
                        to be turned loose into one theatre, and set as guards over another, so that
                        one body of spectators might be exposed to the power of slaves, and that the
                        other might consist entirely of slaves? If during the games a swarm of bees
                        had come on the stage, we should think it necessary to send for the
                        soothsayers out of Etruria; and shall we all see on a sudden such vast
                        swarms of slaves let loose upon the Roman people, blocked up and shut in,
                        and not be moved by that? And perhaps, in the case of a swarm of bees, the
                        soothsayers would warn us from the written books of the Etruscans to guard
                        against the slaves. <milestone n="26" unit="section"/> That then which we
                        should guard against, if indicated by some disjointed prodigy admitting of
                        divers interpretations, shall we not be afraid of when it is its own
                        prodigy, and when the danger is in that very thing from which danger is
                        dreaded? Were such the Megalesia which your father celebrated? Did your
                        uncle celebrate them in such a manner as this? And then he makes mention to
                        me of his family, when he would rather celebrate the games after the fashion
                        of Athenio or Spartacus, than like Caius or Appius Claudius. When these
                        great men were celebrating games, they ordered all the slaves to depart from
                        the theatre. But you turned slaves into one, and turned free men out of the
                        other. Therefore they, who formerly used to be separated from free men by
                        the voice of the herald, now, at your games, separated free men from
                        themselves not by their voice, but by force. <milestone n="13" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>Did not even this occur to you, being a priest so well acquainted with the
                        Sibylline oracles, that our ancestors derived these games from the Sibylline
                        books? if those books are yours, which you consult with imperious
                        intentions, and read with profane eyes, and handle with polluted hands.

                        all these religious observances were established, nor the curule aedileship,
                        which above all things is accustomed to uphold this worship, influence you
                        to abstain from polluting those most holy games with every sort of crime,

                        important and most perilous wars used to offer their vows to this goddess,
                        and to pay them in <placeName key="tgn,6004655">Pessinus</placeName> itself,
                        at that identical principal altar and on that spot and in that temple. </p>
					<p><milestone n="29" unit="section"/> And when Deiotarus was protecting this
                        temple in the most holy manner with the deepest feelings of
                        religion&mdash;Deiotarus, of all allies the most faithful to this empire
                        and the most devoted to our name&mdash;you gave it to Brogitarus as I
                        have said before, having sold it to him for a sum of money. And yet you
                        order this Deiotarus who has been repeatedly declared by the senate worthy
                        of the name of king and adorned with the testimony of many most illustrious
                        generals in his favour, to be styled king together with Brogitarus. But one
                        of them has been called king by the decision of the senate through my
                        instrumentality. Brogitarus has been called king by you for money. And I
                        will think him a king, indeed, if he has any means of paying you what you
                            <pb n="84"/> have trusted him with on his note of hand. For there are
                        many royal qualities in Deiotarus; this was the most royal of all, that he
                        gave you no money; that he did not repudiate that portion of your law which
                        agreed with the decision of the senate, namely that he was a king; that he
                        recovered <placeName key="tgn,6004655">Pessinus</placeName>, which had been
                        impiously violated by you and stripped of its priest and its sacrifices, in
                        order to maintain it in its accustomed religion; that he does not suffer the
                        ceremonies which have been received as handed down from the most remote
                        antiquity, to be polluted by Brogitarus; and that he prefers to let his
                        son-in-law be deprived of your liberality, rather than to allow that temple
                        to lose the ancient reverence due to its religious character. </p>
					<p>But to return to these answers of the soothsayers, the first of which is that
                        respecting these games; who is there who does not confess that the whole of
                        that answer and prophecy was delivered with reference to that fellow's
                        games? <milestone n="14" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="30" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>The answer about sacred and holy places comes next. Oh, the marvellous
                        impudence of the man! do you dare to make mention of my house? Entrust your
                        own to the consuls, or the senate, or the college of pontiffs; and mine, as
                        I have said before, has been declared by all these three decisions to be
                        free from all religions liability. But in that house which you keep
                        possession of after having slain Quintus Seius, a Roman knight and most
                        excellent man, in the most open manner, I say that there was a shrine and
                        altars. I will prove and establish this fact by the registers of the
                        censors, and by the recollection of many individuals. Only let this question
                        be discussed, (and it must be referred to you by virtue of that resolution
                        of the senate which has lately been passed,) and I have plenty to say on the
                        subject of religious places. <milestone n="31" unit="section"/> When I have
                        spoken of your house,&mdash;in which, however, a chapel has been put up

                        down,&mdash;then I will see whether it is necessary for me to speak also
                        of other places. For some people think that it belongs to me to open the
                        armoury of the temple of Tellus. They say that it is not long ago that it
                        was open, and I recollect it myself. Now they say that the most holy part of
                        it, and the place entitled to the greatest reverence, is occupied by a
                        private vestibule. There are many considerations which influence
                            me,&mdash;<pb n="85"/>namely, this, that the temple of Tellus is put
                        particularly under my care; and that he who took away that armoury said that
                        my house, which was declared free by the decision of the pontiffs, had been
                        adjudged to his brother. I am influenced also at this time of dearness of
                        provisions, of barrenness of the lands, and of scarcity of the crops, by the
                        reverence due to Tellus; and all the more, because, on account of this same
                        prodigy, an atonement is said to be due to Tellus. <milestone n="32" unit="section"/> Perhaps we are speaking of old stones; although, if
                        this is not laid down in the civil law, still by the law of nature and the
                        common rights of nations the principle has been established, that mortals
                        cannot acquire a prescriptive right to anything as against the immortal
                        gods. <milestone n="15" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>But we will pass over all things of old date. Shall we also pass over those
                        things which are done at the present time; which we see ourselves? Who knows
                        not that Lucius Piso at this very time has been removing a great and most
                        holy chapel of Diana on the Coeliculan hill? Men who live close to that spot
                        are in court. There are many even belonging to this body who once a year
                        have regularly performed the sacrifices of their family in that very chapel
                        in their appointed place. And do we ask what places the immortal gods are
                        regretting, what it is they are meaning, of what it is that they are
                        speaking? Are we ignorant that some most holy chapels were undermined,
                        blocked up, knocked down, and defiled in the most unseemly possible
                            manner?<milestone n="33" unit="section"/> Were you able to render my

                        voice? With that with which you ordered it to be set on fire. By what law?
                        By one which you did not venture to propose even at the time when you were
                        doing everything with impunity. With what cushion? That which you polluted
                        with your adulteries. With what image? That which you took off from a
                        harlot's tomb and placed on the monument of a general. What has my house
                        which is connected with anything religious except that it touches the wall
                        of an impious and sacrilegious man? Therefore that none of my people may be
                        able unintentionally to look into your house I will raise the roof higher
                        not in order that I may look down upon you, but that you may not be able to

					<p>But let us now examine the rest of the clauses of the answers of the
                        soothsayers.&mdash;&ldquo;That ambassadors have been slain contrary
                        to all divine and human law.&rdquo; What is this? I see here a mention
                        of the deputies from <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName>; and I cannot refute it. For my feelings are,
                        that the privileges of ambassadors are not only fenced round by human
                        protection, but are also guarded by divine laws. But I ask of that man, who,
                        as tribune, filled the forum with judges whom he took out of the
                        prisons,&mdash;by whose will every dagger is now guided and every cup of
                        poison dispensed,&mdash;who has made a regular bargain with Hermarchus
                        of <placeName key="tgn,7002670">Chios</placeName>,&mdash;whether he is
                        at all aware that one most active adversary of Hermarchus, of the name of
                        Theodosius, having been sent as ambassador to the senate from a free city,
                        was assassinated with a dagger? and I know to a certainty that that cannot
                        have appeared less scandalous to the immortal gods than the case of the
                        Alexandrians. <milestone n="35" unit="section"/> Nor am I now attributing
                        every action of this sort to you alone. There would be greater hope of
                        safety if there were no other wicked man but you; but there are more, and on
                        this account you feel more confidence, and we almost distrust the protection
                        of the law. Who is there who is not aware that Plato, a man of high
                        character and high rank in his own country, came from Orestis, which is a
                        free part of <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, to
                            <placeName key="tgn,7011182">Thessalonica</placeName>, as an ambassador
                        to our general, as he called himself? and this great general of ours, being
                        angry at not being able to extort money from him, threw him into prison, and
                        sent his own physician to him, who in a most infamous and barbarous manner
                        cut the veins of an ambassador, an ally, a friend, and a freeman. He did not
                        wish his own forces to be made bloody by crime; but he polluted the name of
                        the Roman people with such guilt that it cannot be expiated by any means but
                        his own punishment. What sort of executioner must we think that this man has
                        in his train, when he uses even his physicians not to procure health but to
                        inflict death? <milestone n="17" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="36" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>But let us read what follows. &ldquo;That good faith and oaths have been
                        disregarded.&rdquo; What this means by itself, I cannot easily explain;
                        but from that which follows, I suspect that it refers to the manifest
                        perjury of your judges, from whom, some time ago, the money which they had
                        received would have been taken away, if they had not entreated the
                        protection of the senate. And this is the reason why I <pb n="87"/> imagine
                        that they are the persons alluded to, because I lay it down as a fact that
                        that is the most remarkable and notorious perjury ever committed in this
                        city and yet that you yourself are not threatened with the punishment of
                        perjury by those men with whom you conspired. <milestone n="37" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>And I see that in the answers of the soothsayers this is added:
                        &ldquo;But the ancient and secret sacrifices have been performed with
                        less than due diligence and have been polluted.&rdquo; Are they the
                        soothsayers who say this or the gods of our country and our household gods?
                        I suppose there are many persons to whom a suspicion of this guilt
                        attaches;&mdash;who but this one man? Is it mentioned obscurely what
                        sacrifices have been polluted? What can be expressed in a plainer, more
                        dignified or more solemn manner? &ldquo;Ancient and secret.&rdquo; I
                        say that Lentulus, a dignified and eloquent orator, did not when he was
                        accusing you, make use of any expressions more frequently than these which
                        now are extracted from the Etruscan books and turned against and applied to
                        you. In truth what sacrifice is there so ancient as this, which we have
                        received from the kings and which is contemporary with the city itself? But
                        what is so secret as that which excludes not only all curious eyes but even
                        all accidental ones? Which not only no wickedness, but which even no
                        unintentional chance can penetrate? That sacrifice no one, ever since the
                        world began, has ever profaned, no one has ever approached no one has ever
                        disregarded no man has ever thought of beholding without horror before
                        Publius Clodius. It is performed by the vestal virgins; it is performed on
                        behalf of the Roman people; it is performed in the house of a supreme
                        magistrate; it is performed with incredible solemnity; it is performed to
                        that goddess whose very name it is not lawful for men to know, and whom that
                        fellow calls Good, because she has pardoned him such enormous wickedness
                            <milestone n="18" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>She has not pardoned you, believe me. No; unless, perchance, you think
                        yourself pardoned because the judges dismissed you after they had squeezed
                        and drained everything out of you, acquitted by their decision, condemned by
                        all the rest of the citizens; or because you have not been deprived of your
                        eyes, as is, according to the common belief the consequence of such impiety.
                            <milestone n="38" unit="section"/> For what man ever intentionally <pb n="88"/> beheld those sacred rites before you, so as to enable any one
                        to know what punishment followed that guilt? Could the blindness of your
                        eyes be a greater injury to you than that blindness of your lust? Do not
                        even you feel that those winking eyes of your ancestor<note anchored="yes">Appius Claudius, surnamed Caecus, or the Blind.</note> were more
                        desirable for you than these glowing eyes of your sister? But, if you
                        observe carefully, you will see that though you have as yet escaped the
                        punishment of men, you have not escaped that of the gods. Men have defended
                        you in a most shameful affair; men have praised you though most infamous and
                        most guilty; men, for a bribe, have acquitted you by their decision, though
                        you all but confessed your guilt; men have felt no indignation at the
                        injuries inflicted on themselves by your lust; men have supplied you with
                        arms, some wishing them to be used against me, and others afterwards
                        intending them to he employed against that invincible citizen. I will quite
                        admit all the kindnesses which men have shown you, and that you need not
                        wish for greater. <milestone n="39" unit="section"/> But what greater
                        punishment can be inflicted on man by the immortal gods than frenzy and
                        madness? unless, perhaps, you think that those persons, whom in tragedies
                        you see tortured and destroyed by wounds and agony of body, are enduring a
                        more terrible form of the wrath of the immortal gods than those who are
                        brought on the stage in a state of insanity. Those howlings and groans of
                        Philoctetes are not so pitiable (sad though they be) as that exultation of
                        Athamas, or that dream of those who have slain their mother. You, when you
                        are uttering your frantic speeches to the assembly&mdash;when you are
                        destroying the houses of the citizens&mdash;when you are driving
                        virtuous men from the forum with stones&mdash;when you are hurling
                        burning firebrands at your neighbours' houses&mdash;when you are setting
                        fire to holy temples &mdash;when you are stirring up the

                        confusion&mdash;when you see no difference between your wife and your
                        sister&mdash;when you do not perceive whose bed it is that you
                        enter&mdash;when you go ranting and raging about&mdash;you are then
                        suffering that punishment which is the only one appointed by the immortal
                        gods for the wickedness of men. For the infirmity of our bodies is of itself
                        liable to many accidents; moreover, the body itself is often destroyed by
                        some very trivial cause; and <pb n="89"/> the darts of the gods are fixed in
                        the minds of impious men. Wherefore you are more miserable while you are
                        hurried into every sort of wickedness by your eyes, than you would be if you
                        had no eyes at all. <milestone n="19" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="40" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>But since enough has been said of all these offences which the soothsayers
                        say have been committed, let us see now what these same soothsayers say that
                        we are being warned of at this time by the immortal gods. They warn us
                        &ldquo;to take care that bloodshed and danger be not brought upon the
                        senators and chief men of the state, through the discord and dissension of
                        the nobles; and that our senators do not become disheartened from being
                        deprived of support by which the provinces may fall under the power of a
                        single master, and our armies be defeated, and a great loss of power
                        ensue.&rdquo; All these are the words of the soothsayers, I am not
                        adding any thing of my own. Who then of the nobles is it who is causing this
                        discord? The same man and that not by any force of his own genius or wisdom
                        but by some blundering of ours which he&mdash;for it was not very much
                        concealed&mdash;easily perceived. For this consideration makes the
                        present distress of the republic the more shameful, that even by him it is
                        not afflicted in such a way that it may seem to fall like a brave man in
                        battle, having received honourable wounds in front from a gallant foe. </p>
					<p><milestone n="41" unit="section"/> Tiberius Gracchus overturned the
                        constitution of the state, a man of such great force of character, and
                        eloquence, and dignity, that he fell short in no respect of the surpassing
                        and eminent virtue of his father, and of his grandfather, Africanus, except
                        in the fact of his revolting from the senate. Caius Gracchus followed in his
                        steps. How great was his genius! how great his energy! how impetuous his
                        eloquence! so that all men grieved that all those good qualities and
                        accomplishments were not joined to a better disposition and to better
                        intentions. Lucius Saturninus himself was so furious and almost insane a
                        man, that he was an admirable leader,&mdash;perfect in exciting and
                        inflaming the minds of the ignorant. For why should I speak of Publius
                        Sulpicius? whose dignity, and sweetness, and emphatic conciseness in
                        speaking was so great that he was able by his oratory to lead even wise men
                        into error, and virtuous men into pernicious sentiments. To be battling with
                        these men, and to be duly struggling with them <pb n="90"/> for the safety
                        of the country, was a very annoying thing to those men who were at that time
                        the governors of the republic, but still that annoyance had a certain sort
                        of dignity in it. <milestone n="20" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="42" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>But as for this man, about whom I am now saying so much, O ye immortal gods!
                        what is he? what is his influence? what is there about him to give so great
                        a city, if it does fall, (may the gods avert the omen!) the comfort of at
                        least seeming to have been overthrown by a man? a fellow who, from the
                        moment of his father's death, made his tender age subservient to the lusts
                        of wealthy buffoons; when he had satiated their licentiousness, then he
                        turned to the domestic seduction of his own sister; then, when he had become
                        a man, he devoted himself to the concerns of a province, and to military
                        affairs, and suffered insults from the pirates; he satisfied the lusts even
                        of Cilicians and barbarians: afterwards, having in a most wicked manner
                        tampered with the army of Lucius Lucullus, he fled from thence, and at

                        people, murdered wards, and made bargains and partnerships or wickedness

                        abundant source of gain which is derived from the <placeName key="tgn,7006964">Campus Martius</placeName>, in such a manner that he
                        (a man wholly devoted to the people!) cheated the people in a most
                        scandalous manner, and also (merciful man that he is!) put the canvassers of
                        the different tribes to death at his own house in the most cruel manner.
                        Then came his quaestorship, so fatal to the republic, to our sacrifices, to
                        our religions observances, to your authority, and to the public courts of
                        justice; in which he insulted gods and men, virtue, modesty, the authority
                        of the senate, every right both human and divine, and the laws and the
                        tribunals of the country. <milestone n="43" unit="section"/> And this was
                        his first step; this (alas for the miserable times and for our senseless
                        discords!) was the first step of Publius Clodius towards the conduct of the
                        affairs of the republic; this was the path by which he first began to
                        approach and mount up to his present boast of being a friend of the people.
                        For <pb n="91"/> the unpopularity arising from the treaty at <placeName key="tgn,7017511">Numantia</placeName>, at the making of which he had
                        been present as quaestor to Caius Mancinus the consul, and the severity
                        displayed by the senate in repudiating that treaty, were a constant source
                        of grief and fear to Tiberius Gracchus; and that circumstance alienated him,
                        a brave and illustrious man, from the wisdom of the senators. And Caius
                        Gracchus was excited by the death of his brother, by affection for him, by
                        indignation, and by the greatness of his own mind, to seek to exact
                        vengeance for the slaughter of a member of his family. We know that
                        Saturninus was led to confess himself a friend of the people out of
                        indignation, because at a time of great dearness of provisions, the senate
                        removed him while he was quaestor from the superintendence of the corn
                        market which belonged to him by virtue of his office, and appointed Marcus
                        Scaurus to manage that business. And it was the breeze of popularity which
                        carried Sulpicius further than he intended, after he had set out in a good
                        cause, and had resisted Caius Julius when seeking to obtain the consulship
                        contrary to the laws. <milestone n="21" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="44" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>All these men had a reason,&mdash;not an adequate one, indeed, (for no
                        one can have an adequate reason for proving a bad citizen to the republic,)
                        but still they had a serious reason, and one connected with some indignation
                        of mind not unbecoming to a man. Publius Clodius came out as a popular
                        character from saffron gowns and turbans, and woman's slippers, and purple
                        bands, and stomachers, and singing, and iniquity, and adultery. If the women
                        had not caught him in this dress, if he had not been allowed to escape by
                        the indulgence of the maid servants, from a place which it was impious for
                        him to enter, the Roman people would have lost their devoted friend, the
                        republic would have been deprived of so energetic a citizen. It is in
                        consequence of this insane conduct, amid our dissensions, for which we are
                        by these recent prodigies admonished by the immortal gods, that one of the
                        patricians has been taken from their number to be made a tribune of the
                        people, in direct violation of the laws. <milestone n="45" unit="section"/>
                        That which, the year before, his brother Metellus and the senate, which even
                        then was unanimous, had refused, and in the most rigorous manner rejected
                        with one voice and one mind, Cnaeus Pompeius being the first to declare his
                        opinion; (so greatly, after the dissensions of the nobles of which we are
                        now <pb n="92"/> reminded, were circumstances disturbed and altered;) that
                        which his brother when consul opposed being done,&mdash;which his
                        kinsman and companion, a most illustrious man, who had refused to speak in
                        his favour when he was accused, had utterly prevented,&mdash;was now
                        effected for him, owing to the dissensions of the nobles, by that man as
                        consul, who, of all others, was bound to be his greatest enemy; and he said
                        that he had done it by the advice of that man whose authority no one could
                        repent having followed. A most shameful and grievous firebrand was thrown
                        into the republic. Your authority was aimed at; and the dignity of the most
                        honourable orders in the city, and the unanimity of all virtuous men, and in
                        short, the entire constitution of the state. For these things were certainly
                        attacked when that flame kindled at that time was directed against me, who
                        had been the principal investigator of these matters. I bore the brunt of
                        the attack, and I alone suffered on behalf of my country; but still I bore
                        it so that you, while you were surrounded by the same flames, saw me wounded
                        first and burning, as it were, in your defence. <milestone n="22" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="46" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>The dissensions were not appeased; but the unpopularity of those men, by whom
                        we thought that our cause was espoused, even increased. So, after a time,
                        the very same men being the movers, and Pompeius the chief man, who roused
                            <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> willing to be roused, and
                        the Roman people which regretted me, and you who demanded me back, to take
                        measures for my safety, employing not only his authority but even his
                        prayers, I was restored. Let there be an end of discord, let us at last find
                        rest from our long dissensions. No, that pest will not allow it; he summons
                        these assemblies, he throws everything into confusion and disorder, selling
                        himself sometimes to one party, sometimes to another; and yet not in such a
                        manner that any one thinks himself the more praiseworthy for being praised
                        by him; though at the same time they are glad that those whom they do not
                        like, are abused by him. And I do not marvel at this fellow; for what else
                        can he do? I do marvel at those wise and respectable men; in the first
                        place, that they so easily allow any illustrious man who has deserved well
                        of the republic to be attacked by the voice of a most profligate man; in the
                        second place, that they think, (it would be a most disastrous thing for
                        themselves if the fact <pb n="93"/> were so,) that the real glory and
                        dignity of any one can be impaired by the abuse of an abandoned and
                        worthless man; and lastly, that they do not see, what however, they do seem
                        to me to have some suspicion of, that those frantic and desultory attacks of
                        his may some day or other be turned against themselves. <milestone n="47" unit="section"/> And it is owing to this undue alienation of some
                        persons from others that those arrows now stick in the republic which, as
                        long as they stuck in me alone, I bore,&mdash;with pain, indeed, but
                        still not as thinking them of any great importance. Could that fellow, if he
                        had not first given himself up to those men whose minds he thought were
                        alienated from your authority,&mdash;if he had not, admirable authority
                        that he is! extolled them to the skies with his panegyric,&mdash;if he
                        had not threatened that he would let loose the army of Caius Caesar (though
                        in that he spoke falsely, but no one contradicted him,) that he would, I say
                        set on that army with hostile standards against the senate-house if he had
                        not cried out that he was doing what he was by the assistance of Cnaeus
                        Pompeius, and at the instigation of Marcus Crassus,&mdash;if he had not
                        declared (the only word of truth that he spoke) that the consuls had united
                        their cause with him;&mdash;could he, I say, ever have been so cruel an
                        enemy to me or so wicked a disturber of the republic? <milestone n="23" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="48" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>After that, when he saw you recovering your breath after your fear of
                        bloodshed, when he saw your authority rising again above the waves of that
                        slavery, and the recollection of, and regret for me, getting more vivid,
                        then he began on a sudden to sell himself to you, though with the most
                        treacherous design. Then he began to say, both here in this house and in the
                        assemblies of the people, that the Sullan laws had been passed in opposition
                        to the <foreign lang="la">auspices</foreign>; among which laws was that
                            <foreign lang="la">lex curiata</foreign> on which the whole of his
                        tribuneship depended, though he was too frantic to see that. He brought
                        forward that most fearless man Marcus Bibulus. He asked him whether he had
                        not always been observing the heavens when Caius Caesar was carrying those
                        laws? He replied, that he always had been observing them at that time. He
                        asked the augurs whether laws which had been passed under these
                        circumstances had been duly passed? They said, such a proceeding was
                        irregular. Some people, virtuous men, and men who had done great service to
                        me, began to extol him; utterly ignorant I imagine, of the lengths to which
                        his <pb n="94"/> madness could carry him. He proceeded further. He began to
                        inveigh against Cnaeus Pompeius, the originator, as he was accustomed to
                        boast, of all his designs. He gained great popularity in the people's eyes.
                            <milestone n="49" unit="section"/> But then, when he had become elated
                        by the hope that he might be able&mdash;as he had by his abominable
                        wickedness crushed, as he fancied him who, though in the garb of peace, had
                        proved the suppressor of domestic war&mdash;to put down also that great
                        man who had been the conqueror of our foreign wars and foreign enemies, then
                        was seized in the temple of Castor that wicked dagger which was nearly the
                        destroyer of this empire. Then he, against whom no enemy's city had ever
                        long continued shut&mdash;he, who had always broken through all straits,
                        trampled on all heights, crushed, by his energy and valour, the opposing
                        weapons of every foe, was himself besieged at home; and, by the counsels
                        which he adopted, relieved me from the reproaches cast on my timidity by
                        some ignorant people. For if it was miserable rather than disgraceful to
                        Cnaeus Pompeius, that bravest of all men who have ever been born, not to be
                        able to go abroad in the sight of men, and to be secluded from all public
                        places, as long as that fellow was tribune of the people, and to put up with
                        his threats, when he said in the public assembly that he wished to build a
                        second piazza in Carinae,<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="la">Carinae</foreign> was the name of one of the finest streets in
                                <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. It is mentioned as
                            such by Virgil, (<bibl n="Verg. A. 8.361"><title>Aen.</title> viii.

                        certainly, for me to leave my house was grievous as far as my own private
                        grief was concerned, but glorious if you look only at the interests of the
                        republic. <milestone n="24" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="50" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>You see, then, that this fellow, when, as far as his own efforts went, he had
                        been long since overthrown and crushed, was aroused again by the mischievous
                        discords of the nobles; and the first beginnings of his fury were upheld by
                        those who at that time appeared alienated from you. It is by these
                        detractors and enemies that the remainder of the acts of his tribuneship
                        have been defended, even since that tribuneship was over. They are the men
                        who resisted that pest <pb n="95"/> being removed from the republic; they
                        prevented his being prosecuted; they resisted his being reduced to the
                        condition of a private citizen. Is it possible that any virtuous men could
                        have cherished in their bosom and have taken pleasure in, that poisonous and
                        deadly viper? By what bribe were they cajoled? I wish, say they, that there
                        should be some one in the assembly to disparage Pompeius. Can he disparage
                        him by his abuse? I wish that that great man, who has contributed so greatly
                        to my safety, may receive what I say in the same spirit as I say it. At all
                        events, I will say what I feel. I declare to God, that there was no time
                        that fellow appeared to be detracting so much from his exceeding dignity as
                        when he was extolling him with the most extravagant praises. <milestone n="51" unit="section"/> Was Caius Marius, I pray you, more illustrious
                        when Caius Glaucia was praising him, or when he became angry afterwards and
                        abused him? Or, was this madman, who has been so long rushing headlong on
                        punishment and destruction, more foul-mouthed and shameless when accusing
                        Pompeius than he had been when reviling the whole senate? But I do marvel
                        that though the former conduct may have been pleasing to angry men, the
                        other course should not have been odious to such good citizens. But, lest
                        this should any longer please excellent men, let them just read this
                        harangue of his, of which I speak: in which, shall I say, he extols, or
                        rather debases Pompeius? Undoubtedly he extols him, and says, that he is the
                        only man in the city worthy of the glory of this empire; and hints that he
                        is an exceedingly great friend of his, and that they are entirely
                        reconciled. <milestone n="52" unit="section"/> And although I do not exactly
                        know what he means yet I am sure that, if he were a friend to Pompeius, he
                        would not praise him. For, if he were his greatest enemy, what could he do
                        more to diminish his credit? Let those, who were glad that he was an enemy
                        to Cnaeus Pompeius, and who, on that account winked at his numerous and
                        enormous crimes, and who sometimes even accompanied his unbridled and
                        furious acts of frenzy with their applause, observe how quickly he has
                        turned round. For now he is praising him; he is inveighing against those men
                        to whom he previously sold himself. What do you suppose he will do if a door
                        to reconciliation with him should become really open to him, when he is so
                        eager to spread a belief in such a reconciliation? <pb n="96"/>

					<p>What other dissensions among the nobles can I suppose are pointed out by the
                        immortal gods? For by this expression Publius Clodius is surely not meant
                        nor any one of his gang or of his counselors. The Etruscan books have
                        certain names which may fit some of that class of citizens.
                        &ldquo;Worthless men, rejected candidates,&rdquo; as you shall

                        utterly alienated from the general welfare. Wherefore when the immortal gods
                        warn us of the discords of the nobles, they speak of the dissensions between
                        illustrious citizens who have deserved well of the republic. When they
                        predict danger and slaughter to the chief men, they leave Clodius safe
                        enough, a man who is as far from the chief men as he is from virtuous or
                        holy men. It is for you and for your safety, O most illustrious and most
                        virtuous citizens, that they see that it behoves them to consult and to
                        provide. <milestone n="54" unit="section"/> Slaughter of the chief men is
                        indicated; that is added which must inevitably follow the death of the
                        nobles. We are warned to take care that the republic does not fall under the
                        absolute dominion of a single individual. And even if we were not led to
                        this fear by the warning of the gods, still we ourselves, of our own accord,
                        by our own senses and conjectures, should he forced to entertain it. For
                        there is not usually any other termination to dissensions between eminent
                        and powerful men, except either universal destruction, or the domination of
                        the victorious party, or regal power. Lucius Sulla, a most noble and gallant
                        consul, quarreled with Caius Marius, a most illustrious citizen. Each of
                        these men, when defeated, fell so completely that the conqueror became a
                        king. Cinna quarreled with his colleague Octavius. To each of these men
                        prosperity gave kingly power, and adversity brought death. The same Sulla
                        became victorious a second time. <milestone n="55" unit="section"/> And that
                        time, beyond all question, he exercised regal power, though he
                        re-established the republic. There is at this moment a hatred not concealed
                        but implanted deeply, and burnt as it were into their minds, subsisting
                        between men of the very highest rank. The chief men of the state are at
                        variance. Every occasion is eagerly caught at. That party which is not so
                        powerful as the other is nevertheless waiting for some change of fortune and
                        for some favourable opportunity. That party which without dispute is the
                        more powerful, is still perhaps at times afraid of the <pb n="97"/> designs
                        and opinions of its enemies. Let this discord be which are foreshown by
                        these prodigies will be banished from the state. In a moment that serpent
                        which is at present lurking about here will emerge and be brought to light,
                        and will be strangled, and crushed, and die. <milestone n="26" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>For the soothsayers warn us to take care that the republic is not injured by
                        secret designs. What designs are more secret than those of that man who
                        dared to say in the public assembly that a suspension of the courts of
                        justice ought to be proclaimed; that the jurisdiction of the judges ought to
                        be interrupted, and the treasury shut and all trials put an end to? Unless
                        perhaps you think that all this confusion and overthrow of the constitution
                        could occur to him all on a sudden, while in the rostrum, and that he was
                        not speaking after mature deliberation. The man is full of wine, lust, and
                        sleep, full of the most inconsiderate and insane rashness; but still it was
                        in his nocturnal vigils, and in a numerous company, that that suspension of
                        justice was planned and concocted. Remember, O conscript fathers, that your
                        ears were being experimented on by that expression, and that a most
                        mischievous road was being made to them by accustoming you to hear it.

					<p>These words follow: &ldquo;That more honour must not he given to

                        that man above all other who is beyond all question the most worthless of
                        all mortals. Who then, are the rejected candidates? Not, I imagine, they who
                        some time or other have failed to attain some honour more by the fault of
                        the city than by their own. For that is a thing which has frequently
                        happened to many most excellent citizens and most honourable men. Those are
                        the rejected candidates meant, whom, when they were proceeding to the most
                        violent measures, when they were preparing exhibitions of gladiators
                        contrary to the laws, when they were bribing in the most open manner, not
                        only strangers, but even their own relations, their neighbours, the men of
                        their own tribe, towns-people and countrymen, all rejected. We are warned
                        not to confer any additional honours on these men. It ought to be <pb n="98"/> a very acceptable admonition that they give us; but still the Roman
                        people itself, of its own accord, without any warning on the part of the

                        collected from all quarters, he would not, I pledge myself, be able to
                        discover one disgraceful quality which did not exist in this man, and he
                        would pass over many which are deeply implanted and firmly rooted in him.

					<p>Why should I mention his country? when in the first place by violence and
                        arms, and dread of personal danger, he drove away from the city and from all
                        the protection afforded him by his country that citizen whom you had decided
                        over and over again to have been the saviour of his country. In the second

                        but its leader as he used to call him, he by violence, bloodshed, and
                        conflagration, threw into confusion the senate itself, the mainstay of the
                        general safety and of the public good sense; he abolished two laws, the
                        Aelian and Fufian laws, which were of especial advantage to the state; he
                        extinguished the censorship; he took away the power of intercession; he
                        abolished the <foreign lang="la">auspices</foreign>; he armed <pb n="99"/>
                        the consuls, the companions of his wickedness, with the treasury, and
                        provinces, and an army; he sold the kings who were in existence, and he
                        called men kings who were not so; he drove Cnaeus Pompeius to his house with
                        violence and arms; he overthrew the monuments of our generals; he threw down
                        the houses of his enemies; he inscribed his own name on your monuments. The
                        wicked deeds which have been done by him to the injury of his country are
                        innumerable. Why need I tell what he has done to individual citizens, whom
                        he has slain? Why need I count up the allies whom he has plundered? or the

					<p>Wherefore, and that is the last sentence in the answers of the soothsayers,

                        up on all sides, that the constitution, already undermined and resting on
                        all our shoulders, will be able to be kept together. <milestone n="28" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>This state was once so firm and so vigorous that it could withstand the
                        indifference of the senate, or even the assaults of the citizens. Now it
                        cannot. There is no treasury. Those who have contracted for the revenues do
                        not enjoy them; the authority of the chief men has fallen; the agreement
                        between the different orders of the state is torn asunder; the courts of
                        justice are destroyed; the votes are all arranged and divided so as to be
                        under the power of a few; the courage of the virtuous citizens, formerly
                        ready at a <pb n="100"/> nod from our order, exists no longer. <milestone n="61" unit="section"/> Henceforth in vain will you look for a citizen
                        who will expose himself to unpopularity for the welfare of his country. We
                        can then preserve even this state of things which now exists, such as it is,
                        by no other means than by unanimity; for although we may become better off,
                        that cannot even be hoped for as long as he is unpunished. And if we are to
                        be worse off than we are, there is but one step slower, that of death or
                        slavery. And the immortal gods themselves warn us against allowing ourselves
                        to be thrust down into that abyss, since all human counsels have long since
                        failed. </p>
					<p>And I, O conscript fathers, should not have undertaken this speech, so
                        melancholy and so serious; not but that owing to the honours conferred on me
                        by the Roman people, and to the numberless distinctions which you have
                        heaped upon me, I am both bound and able to support this character and to
                        play this part; but still, when every one else was silent, I should
                        willingly have remained silent too. All this speech which I have made has
                        not proceeded from my authority, but from my regard for the general
                        religion. My words have, perhaps, been too many, but the whole sentiment has
                        proceeded from the soothsayers. And either you ought never to have referred
                        the prodigies which have been reported to you to them at all, or else you
                        must be influenced by their answers. <milestone n="62" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>But if other more ordinary and more trifling occurrences have often
                        influenced us, shall not the express voice of the immortal gods influence
                        every one's mind? Do not think that really possible, which you often see in
                        plays, that some god descending from heaven can approach the assemblies of
                        men, and abide on earth, and converse with men. Consider the description of
                        noise which the Latins have reported. Remember that prodigy also, which has
                        not as yet been formally reported, that at almost the same time a terrible
                        earthquake is said to have taken place in the Picenian district, at

                        truth, this ought almost to be considered as the voice and speech of the
                        immortal gods, when the world itself and the air and the earth tremble with
                        a certain unusual agitation, and prophecy to us with an unprecedented and
                        incredible sound. <pb n="101"/> On this emergency we must appoint atonements
                        and prayers as we are ordered; but it is easy to address prayers to those
                        beings who of their own accord point out to us the path of safety. Our own

					<p>When, O judges, I saw that on account of the eminent and singular good faith
                        of Cnaeus Plancius, shown in taking care of my safety, so many excellent men
                        were favourers of his cause, I felt no ordinary pleasure, because I saw that
                        the recollection of what happened at the time of my necessities was pleading
                        for him whose kindness had been my preservation. But when I heard that men,
                        some of whom were my enemies, and some of whom were envious of me, favoured
                        this accusation and that the very same thing was now adverse to the
                        interests of Cnaeus Plancius in this trial which had been advantageous to
                        him in his canvass, I was grieved, O judges, and was very indignant at the
                        idea of his safety being endangered for the sole reason that he, by his
                        benevolence, and energy, and vigilance had protected my safety and my life.
                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> But now, O judges, the sight of you,
                        and the fact of such men as you being the judges, strengthens and refreshes

                        number I see no one to whom my safety has not been dear, no one who has not

                        am not under eternal obligations from the recollection of their services.
                        Therefore I do not fear that the care shown by Cnaeus Plancius for my safety
                        will be any injury to him with those men who themselves have wished above
                        all things to see me in safety; and, O judges, it has more frequently come

                        out this man of all the world to institute a prosecution against, than that
                        I have any ground to fear lest he should appear to you to have had good
                        reason for doing so. </p>
					<p><milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Although I do not assume so much, or claim
                        so much importance for myself, O judges, as to think that Cnaeus Plancius is
                        entitled to impunity on account of his kindness towards me. If I do not
                        display to you that his life is most upright, his habits most virtuous, his
                        good faith unimpeachable,&mdash;if I do not prove him to be a man of
                        perfect temperance, piety, and innocence, I will not object to your
                        punishing him; but if I establish that he has every quality which may be
                        expected in the character of a virtuous man, then I will beg of you, O
                        judges, to grant, at my entreaty, your pity to that man, through whose pity
                        it is that I myself have been preserved in safety. In truth, in addition to
                        the labour which I am devoting to this cause, in a greater degree than I
                        think necessary in other trials. I have this anxiety also, that I have not
                        only to speak on behalf of Cnaeus Plancius, whose safety I am bound to
                        defend equally with my own, but on behalf of myself also, since the
                        prosecutors have said almost more about me than they have about the merits
                        of the case, and about the real defendant. <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>Although, O judges, if they have found any fault in me which is not connected
                        with the case of my present client, I am not much disturbed about that; for
                        I am not afraid that, because it is a very rare thing to meet with grateful
                        men, on that account it can really be considered as a charge against me when
                        those men say that I am too grateful. But as for the points that have been
                        urged by them, when they have said either that the services done me by
                        Cnaeus Plancius were of less importance than I make them out to be; or that
                        if they were ever so great, still they ought not to have that weight with
                        you which I considered them entitled to; these <pb n="103"/> points, O
                        judges, must be touched on by me with moderation, indeed, lest I should give
                        any offence myself; and not until I have fully replied to the accusations
                        brought against him, lest my client should seem to have been defended not so
                        much by his own innocence, as by the recollection of his conduct at the time
                        of my necessity. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>But, considering how plain and simple my case is, O judges, the line to be
                        taken by me in defending it is exceedingly difficult and slippery. For if it
                        were merely necessary for me to argue against Laterensis, yet even this
                        would be a very vexatious thing, considering our great friendship and
                        intimacy; for it is an old principle of genuine and real friendship, such as
                        subsists between him and me, that friends should always have the same
                        wishes; nor is there any surer bond of friendship than an agreement in and
                        community of designs and wishes. But the most annoying circumstance to me in
                        the case is, not that I have merely to argue against him, but much more,
                        that I have to argue against him in a cause in which it seems impossible to
                        avoid drawing some comparison between the parties themselves. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> For Laterensis asks, and presses this point above
                        all others, in what virtue, in what sort of renown or worth Plancius is
                        superior to himself. And so, if I admit his high
                        qualifications,&mdash;and he has plenty of them, and important ones
                        too&mdash;I must not only run the risk of Plancius losing this dignity
                        which he has obtained, but he must submit also to the suspicion of bribery.
                        If I speak of my client as superior to him, then my speech will be
                        considered insulting, and I shall be supposed to say, (as he puts the
                        question himself,) that Laterensis was surpassed by Plancius in real worth.
                        And so I must either hurt the feelings of a man who is a great friend of
                        mine, if I follow the line taken by the prosecutor, or else I must abandon
                        the safety of one who has behaved to me with the greatest kindness.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>But I, O Laterensis, will confess that I should be conducting this cause in
                        the most blind and headlong manner, if I were to say that you could be
                        surpassed in worth by either Plancius, or any one else. Therefore I will
                        discard that comparison to which you invite me and will proceed to those
                        arguments to which the cause itself naturally conducts me. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> What? Do you think that the people is judge of a man's
                        worth? Perhaps it is sometimes. I wish indeed it were so <pb n="104"/>
                        always. But it is very seldom the case, and if it ever is, it is so when the
                        question is concerning the election of those magistrates to whom it
                        considers that its own safety is entrusted. At the less important <foreign lang="la">comitia</foreign>, honours are gained by the diligence and
                        influence of the candidates, and not by those high qualities which we see
                        exist in you. For, as to what concerns the people, that man must always be
                        an incompetent judge of worth who either envies any one or favours any one,
                        although you cannot, O Laterensis, point to any good quality in yourself, as
                        peculiarly entitled to praise, which Plancius has not in common with you. </p>
					<p><milestone n="8" unit="section"/> But all this shall be discussed presently.
                        At present I am only arguing about the right of the people, which both can
                        and sometimes does pass over worthy men; and it does not follow because a
                        man has been passed over by the people who ought not to have been, that he
                        who has not been passed over is to be condemned by the judges. For if that
                        were the case, the judges would have that power which the senate itself
                        could not maintain in the times of our ancestors,&mdash;namely, that of
                        being correctors of the <foreign lang="la">comitia</foreign>: or a power
                        which is even more intolerable than that; for at that time a man who had
                        been elected did not enter upon the duties of his office if the senators had
                        not approved of his election; but now it is required of you to correct the
                        judgment of the Roman people by the banishment of the man who has been
                        elected by them. Therefore, although I have entered upon the cause by a door
                        which I did not wish to open, still I seem to hope, O Laterensis, that my
                        speech will be so far removed from all suspicion of being intended to give
                        you offence, that I may rather reprove you for bringing your own dignity
                        into an unreasonable contest, than attempt myself to disparage it by any
                        injurious expressions on my part. <milestone n="4" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="9" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>Do you think your temperance, your industry, your attachment to the republic,
                        your virtue, your innocence, your integrity, and your exertions disregarded
                        and despised and trampled on, just because you have not been made aedile?
                        See, O Laterensis, how greatly I differ from you in opinion. If, I declare
                        to God, there were only ten virtuous, and wise, and just, and worthy men in
                        this state who had pronounced you unworthy of the aedileship, I should think
                        that decision a much more unfavourable one to you than this has been, on
                        account <pb n="105"/> of which you fear that this may seem to be the opinion
                        of the people. For in the <foreign lang="la">comitia</foreign> the people
                        does not invariably act in obedience to its judgment; but it is usually
                        influenced by interest, or it yields to entreaties and it elects those by
                        whom it has been canvassed with the greatest assiduity. And lastly if it
                        does proceed according to its judgment, still it is not led to form that
                        judgment by any careful selection, or by wisdom, but more frequently by
                        impulse and what I may even call a sort of precipitation. For there is no
                        wisdom in the common people, no method, no discrimination, no diligence, and
                        wise men have at all times considered the things which the people may have
                        done necessary to be endured, but not at all invariably necessary to be
                        praised. So that when you say that you ought to have been elected aedile, it
                        is the people you are finding fault with, and not your competitor.
                            <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Allow that you were more worthy than
                        Plancius (though that point I will contest with you presently, though
                        without at all disparaging your pretensions or character,) still allow that
                        you were more worthy, yet it is not your competitor by whom you have been
                        defeated, but the people by whom you have been passed over, that is in
                        fault. </p>
					<p>And in this affair you ought to recollect that at all <foreign lang="la">comitia</foreign>, and especially at those held for the election of
                        aediles, it is the party spirit of the people, and not their deliberate
                        judgment which bears sway, that their votes are coaxed out of them not
                        extorted by merit, that the voters are more apt to consider what obligations
                        they themselves are under to each individual, than what benefits the
                        republic has received at his hands. But if you insist on it that it is their
                        deliberate judgment, then you must not annul it but bear it. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> The people has decided wrongly. Still it has
                        decided. It ought not to have decided so. Still it had the power. I will not
                        bear it. But many most illustrious and wise citizens have borne it. For this
                        is the inalienable privilege of a free people, and especially of this the
                        chief people of the world, the lord and conqueror of all nations, to be able
                        by their votes to give or to take away what they please to or from any one.
                        And it is our duty,&mdash;ours, I say, who are driven about by the winds
                        and waves of this people, to hear the whims of the people with moderation,
                        to strive to win over their affections when alienated from us, to retain
                        them when we have won them, <pb n="106"/> to tranquilize them when in a
                        state of agitation. If we do not think honours of any great consequence, we
                        are not bound to be subservient to the people; if we do strive for them,
                        then we must be unwearied in soliciting them. <milestone n="5" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="12" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>I proceed now to take on myself the part of the people, so as to argue with
                        you in their language rather than in my own. If the people then could meet
                        you, and speak with one voice, it would say this-&mdash;&ldquo;I, O
                        Laterensis, have not preferred Plancius to you; but, as you were both
                        equally virtuous men, I have conferred my favours on him who entreated me
                        for them, rather than on him who had not solicited me with any great
                        humility.&rdquo; You will reply, I suppose, that you relied on your high
                        character, and the antiquity of your family, and did not think it necessary
                        to canvass very laboriously. But the people will remind you of its own
                        established principles, and of the precedents of its ancestors. It will say
                        that it has always chosen to be asked for these honours, and to be solicited
                        eagerly. It will tell you that it preferred Marcus Seius, a man who was
                        unable to keep even his dignity as a knight undamaged by an adverse decision
                        in a court of justice, to a man of the highest rank, most unimpeachable, and
                        most eloquent Marcus Piso. It will tell you that it preferred to Quintus
                        Catulus, a man of the most illustrious family, a most wise and admirable
                        man, I will not say Caius Seranus a most foolish man, for nevertheless he
                        was a noble; nor Caius Fimbria, a new man, for he was a magnanimous man and
                        a wise counselor; but Cnaeus Mallius, a man not only of no rank or family at
                        all, but utterly destitute of virtue and ability, and of contemptible and
                        sordid habits of life. &mdash;<milestone n="13" unit="section"/>&ldquo;My eyes,&rdquo; says the people, &ldquo;looked in vain
                        for you when you were at <placeName key="tgn,7000639">Cyrene</placeName>;
                        for I should have preferred reaping the benefit of your virtue myself to
                        letting your companions have it all to themselves; and the more it was an
                        object to me to do so, the more did you keep aloof from me. At all events, I
                        did not see you. Then you deserted and abandoned me, though thirsting for
                        your virtue; for you had begun to offer yourself as a candidate for the
                        tribuneship of the people at a time which was especially in need of your
                        eloquence and virtue; and when you abandoned your canvass for that office,
                        if you intimated by so doing that in such a stormy time you could not take
                        the helm, I had reason to doubt your courage; <pb n="107"/> but if you did
                        so because you did not then choose to assume so much responsibility, then I
                        had grounds for questioning your attachment to me. But if the truth was, as
                        I rather believe, that you reserved yourself for other times, I
                        too,&rdquo; the Roman people will say, &ldquo;have now recalled you
                        to the time for which you had of your own accord reserved yourself. Offer
                        yourself, then, now for that magistracy in which you can be of great use to
                        me. Whoever the aediles are, I shall have the same games prepared for me;
                        but it is of the greatest consequence who are the tribunes of the people.
                        Either, then, give me those exertions of yours which you encouraged me to
                        hope for, or, if your heart is most set on what is of the least consequence
                        to me, how can you expect that I will give you the aedileship, especially
                        when you ask for it with such indifference? But if you wish to gain the most
                        distinguished honours, as most suited to your worth, then learn, I pray you,
                        to solicit them of me with a little more earnestness.&rdquo; <milestone n="6" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="14" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>This is what the people says to you. But what I say to you, O Laterensis, is
                        this: that the judge has nothing to do with inquiring why you were defeated,
                        as long as you were not defeated through bribery. For it as often as any man
                        is passed over who ought not to have been passed over, the man who has been
                        elected is to be condemned, there will no longer be any reason for
                        canvassing the people at all. There will be no reason in waiting for the
                        polling or for addressing entreaties to the magistrates or for the final
                        declaration of the state of the poll; the moment that I see who are standing
                        I shall say&mdash;&ldquo;This man is of a consular family that man
                        is of a praetorian one; <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> I see that all

                        virtuous and upright men but it is necessary that the distinctions of rank
                        should be observed that the praetorian family should yield to the consular,
                        and that the equestrian body should not contend with a praetorian
                        house.&rdquo; There is an end to all eagerness for any candidate, an end
                        to all voting; there are no longer any contests; the people has no longer
                        any liberty of choice in electing magistrates; there is no anxiety to see
                        how the votes will be given; nothing will ever happen, (as is so often the
                        case,) contrary to the general expectation; there will be for the future no
                        variety in the <foreign lang="la">comitia</foreign>. But if it is constantly
                        happening that we marvel why some men have been <pb n="108"/> elected, and
                        why some men have not; if the <placeName key="tgn,7006964">Campus
                            Martius</placeName> and those waves of the <foreign lang="la">comitia</foreign>, like a deep and wide sea, swell in such a manner, as
                        if through some tide or other, that they approach one party and recede from
                        another; why, when the impulse of party spirit is so great and when so much
                        is done with precipitation, are we to seek for any rational explanation, any
                        deliberate intention or any system in such a case? </p>
					<p><milestone n="16" unit="section"/> Do not then, O Laterensis, insist on my
                        drawing any comparison between you. In truth, if the voting tablet is dear
                        to the people, which shows the countenances of men, while it conceals their
                        intentions, and which gives them the liberty of doing whatever they please,
                        while they can promise whatever they are asked, why do you require that to
                        be done in a court of justice which is not done in the <placeName key="tgn,7006964">Campus Martius</placeName>?&mdash;This man is more
                        worthy than that man. It is a very grave assertion to make. What then is it
                        more reasonable to say? Say this, (and this is the question, this is
                        sufficient for the judge)&mdash;This is the man who has been elected.
                        Why should he have been elected rather than I? Either I do not know, or I do
                        not choose to say, or lastly, (which, however, would be a very vexatious
                        thing to me to say, and yet I ought to be able to say with impunity), he
                        ought not to have been. For what would you gain if I were to have recourse
                        to this last defence, that the people had done what it chose, and not what
                        it ought to have done? <milestone n="7" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="17" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>What will you say, if, besides, I defend the act of the people, O Laterensis,
                        and prove that Cnaeus Plancius did not creep by underhand means to that
                        honour, but that he arrived at it by the regular course which has at all
                        times been open to men born in this equestrian rank of ours; can I, by this
                        argument expunge from your speech the comparison between you two, which
                        cannot be handled without an appearance of insult, and can I thus bring you
                        at last to the merits of the case itself and of your accusation? If, because
                        he is the son of a Roman knight he ought to have been inferior to you, all
                        the rest who were candidates at the same time with you were the sons of
                        Roman knights. I say no more: but this I do wonder at, why you should be
                        angry with this man above all the rest who was the furthest removed from
                        you. In truth, if, at any time, as is sometimes the case, I am pushed about
                        in the crowd, I do not find fault with <pb n="109"/> that man who is on the
                        very crown of the Via Sacra, when I am pushed up against the arch of Fabius;
                        but with him who was against me and pushes me. But you are not angry with
                        Quintus Pedius, a very gallant man; nor with Aulus Plotius,<note anchored="yes">Aulus Plotius was, however, the other aedile elect, as
                            Plancius's colleague.</note> whom I see here, a most accomplished
                        citizen, and my own intimate friend; but you think yourself defeated by him
                        who has also defeated them, rather than by those who were nearest yourself
                        in the number of votes, and who therefore pressed more immediately on you.

					<p>But, nevertheless, you compare yourself with Plancius, in the first place as
                        to your race and family, in which he is beaten by you. For why should not I
                        confess what cannot he denied? But he is not more inferior to you in this
                        respect than I was to my competitors, both on other occasions, and when I
                        was a candidate for the consulship. But beware lest these very particulars
                        for which you look down upon him may have told in his favour. For let us
                        make the comparison in this way&mdash;You are descended from a consular
                        family on both sides. Have you any doubt then that all those who favour the
                        nobility of birth, who think that the finest of all things, who are
                        influenced by the images and great names of your ancestors, all voted for
                        you as aedile. I myself have not a doubt of it. But if the number of those
                        who are thus devoted to high birth is not very large, is that our fault? In
                        truth, let us go back to the head and origin of each of your families.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="19" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>You are of that most ancient municipal town of <placeName key="perseus,Tusculum">Tusculum</placeName>, from which many of our
                        consular families are derived, among which is also the Juventian family;
                        there have not so many families of that rank proceeded from all the other
                        municipal towns put together. Plancius comes from the prefecture of
                            <placeName key="tgn,7006695">Atina</placeName>; certainly a less ancient
                        and distinguished abode, and not so near to the city. How much difference do
                        you think this ought to make in standing for an office? In the first place,
                        which people do you suppose are most eager to support their own
                        fellow-citizens; the people of <placeName key="tgn,7006695">Atina</placeName>, or those of <placeName key="perseus,Tusculum">Tusculum</placeName>? The one, (for this is a matter with which I may
                        easily be well acquainted, on account of my neighbourhood to them,) when
                        they saw the <pb n="110"/> father of this most accomplished and excellent
                        man, Cnaeus Saturninus, elected aedile, and afterwards, when they saw him
                        elected praetor, were delighted in a most extraordinary manner, because he
                        was the first man who had ever brought a curule honour, not only into that
                        family, but even into that prefecture. But I never understood that the
                        others (I suppose because that municipality is crammed full of consuls, for
                        I know to a certainty that they are not an ill-natured people) were
                        particularly delighted at any honour obtained by their fellow-citizens. This
                        is our feeling, and it is the feeling of our municipal towns. <milestone n="20" unit="section"/> Why should I speak of myself; or of my brother?
                        The very fields&mdash;I might almost say, the very hills
                        themselves,&mdash;supported us in the pursuit of our honours. Do you
                        ever see any man of <placeName key="perseus,Tusculum">Tusculum</placeName>
                        boast of that great man, Marcus Cato, the first man in every sort of virtue,
                        or of Tiberius Coruncanius, though a citizen of their own municipal town, or
                        of all the Fulvii? No one ever mentions them. But if ever you fall in with a
                        citizen of <placeName key="perseus,Arpinum">Arpinum</placeName>, you are
                        forced, whether you will or no, perhaps, to hear something about us, but at
                        all events something about Caius Marius. In the first place, then, Plancius
                        had the ardent zeal of his fellow-citizens in his favour; you had no more
                        than was likely to exist among men who are by this time surfeited with
                        honours. <milestone n="21" unit="section"/> In the next place, your
                        fellow-citizens are indeed most admirable men, but still they are very few
                        in number if they are compared with the people of <placeName key="tgn,7006695">Atina</placeName>. The prefecture to which Plancius
                        belongs is so full of the bravest men, that no city in all <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> can be pronounced more populous. And
                        that multitude you now behold, O judges, in mourning attire and in distress
                        addressing its supplications to you. All these Roman knights whom you see
                        here, all these aerarian tribunes, (for we have sent the common people away
                        from this court, though they were all present at the <foreign lang="la">comitia</foreign>,)&mdash;how much strength, how much dignity did
                        they not add to my client's demand of the aedileship? They did not give him
                        only the aid of the Terentian tribe, of which I will speak hereafter, but
                        they added dignity to him, they kept their eyes fixed upon him, they
                        attended him with a solid, and vigorous, and unceasing escort; and even now
                        my own municipal town is greatly interested in his cause, from the sort of
                        connection which the fact of their being neighbours to him engenders. <pb n="111"/>
                        <milestone n="9" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="22" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>Everything which I am saying about Plancius, I say having experienced the
                        truth of it in my own case. For we of <placeName key="perseus,Arpinum">Arpinum</placeName> are near neighbours of the people of <placeName key="tgn,7006695">Atina</placeName>. It is a neighbourhood to be
                        praised, and even to be loved, retaining the old-fashioned habits of
                        kindness for one another: one not tainted with ill-nature, nor accustomed to
                        falsehood, not insincere, nor treacherous, nor learned in the suburban, or
                        shall I say, the city artifices of dissimulation. There was not one citizen
                        of Arpinum who was not anxious for Plancius, not one citizen of <placeName key="perseus,Sora">Sora</placeName>, or of <placeName key="perseus,Casinum">Casinum</placeName>, or of <placeName key="perseus,Aquinum">Aquinum</placeName>. The whole of that most
                        celebrated district, the territory of <placeName key="perseus,Venafrum">Venafrum</placeName>, and <placeName key="perseus,Allifae">Allifae</placeName>, in short, the whole of that rugged mountainous
                        faithful simple district, a district cherishing its own native citizens,
                        thought that it was honoured itself in his honour, that its own consequence
                        was increased by his dignity. And from those same municipalities Roman
                        knights are now present here, having been sent by the public authority,
                        commissioned to bear evidence in his favour; nor is their anxiety in his
                        behalf now inferior to the zeal which they displayed then. For, in truth, it
                        is a more terrible thing to be stripped of one's goods than not to attain a
                        dignity. </p>
					<p><milestone n="23" unit="section"/> Therefore, although the other
                        qualifications, O Laterensis, those which your ancestors bequeathed to you,
                        were more conspicuous in you than in him; yet, on the other hand, Plancius
                        had an advantage over you not only in the zeal of his municipality, but in
                        that of his whole neighbourhood. Unless, indeed, the neighbourhood of
                            <placeName key="perseus,Tusculum">Tusculum</placeName> to Lavicum, or
                            <placeName key="perseus,Gabii">Gabii</placeName>, or Bovillae was any
                        use to you; municipal towns in which you can now hardly find a single
                        citizen to bear a part in the Latin holidays. I will add, if you like, that
                        which you consider is even an objection to him, that his father is a farmer
                        of the revenues. And who is there who does not know what a great assistance
                        that body of men is to any one in seeking for any honour? For the flower of
                        the Roman knights, the ornament of the state, the great bulwark of the
                        republic is all comprehended in that body. <milestone n="24" unit="section"/> Who is there, then, who can deny that that body showed extraordinary zeal
                        in aiding Plancius in his contest for honour? And it was very natural that
                        they should, because his father is a man who has for a long time been the
                        head of the company of farmers; and because he was exceedingly beloved by
                        his fellows of that <pb n="112"/> company; and because he canvassed them
                        with the greatest diligence; and because he was entreating them in favour of
                        his son; and because it was notorious that Plancius himself had both in his
                        quaestorship and tribuneship done many kindnesses to that body; and because
                        in promoting him they thought that they were promoting themselves, and
                        consulting the welfare and dignity of their children. <milestone n="10" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>Something, moreover, (I say it timidly, but still I must say
                        it)&mdash;something we ourselves contributed to his success; not,
                        indeed, by our riches, not by any invidious exertion of influence, not by
                        any scarcely endurable stretch of power, but by the mention of his kindness
                        to ourselves, by our pity for him, and by our prayers in his behalf. I
                        appealed to the people; I went round the tribes, and besought them; I
                        entreated even those who, of their own accord, offered themselves to me, who
                        volunteered their promises. He prevailed, owing to the motive which I had
                        for soliciting them, not owing to my interest. <milestone n="25" unit="section"/> Nor, if a most honourable man, to whom there is nothing
                        which may not deservedly be granted at his entreaty, failed, as you say, in
                        obtaining something which he desired, am I arrogant if I say that I did
                        prevail? For, to say nothing of the fact that I was exerting myself in
                        behalf of a man who had great influence himself, that solicitation is always
                        the most agreeable which is the most closely connected with previous
                        obligations and friendship. Nor, indeed, did I ask for him in such a manner
                        as to seem to request it because he was my intimate friend, because he was
                        my neighbour, because I had always been on terms of the greatest intimacy
                        with his father; but I asked as if I were soliciting on behalf of one who
                        was as it were my parent, and the guardian of my safety. It was not my
                        interest but the cause which prompted my requests, which was so influential.
                        No one rejoiced at my restoration, no one grieved at my injury, to whom the
                        pity shown me by this man was not acceptable. <milestone n="26" unit="section"/> In truth, if before my return, good men in numbers, of
                        their own accord, offered their services to Cnaeus Plancius when he was a
                        candidate for the tribuneship, do not you suppose that, if my name, while I
                        was absent was a credit to him, my entreaties, when I was present, must have
                        been serviceable to him? Are the colonists of <placeName key="perseus,Minturnae">Minturnae</placeName> held in everlasting honour
                        because they saved Caius Marius from the sword of civil war and from the
                        hands of wicked men, because <pb n="113"/> they received him in their
                        houses, because they enabled him to recruit his strength when exhausted with
                        fighting and with tossing on the waves, because they furnished him with
                        means for his journey, and gave him a vessel and when he was leaving that
                        land which he had saved, followed him with tears and prayers, and every good
                        wish? And do you wonder that his good faith and merciful and courageous
                        disposition was a credit to Cnaeus Plancius, who, whether I was expelled by
                        violence, or yielded from a deliberate plan or conduct, received me,
                        assisted me, protected me, and preserved me for these citizens, and for the
                        senate and people of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, that
                        they might be able at a subsequent time to restore me? <milestone n="11" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="27" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>These circumstances which I have been mentioning might in truth have been
                        sufficient to throw a veil over the vices of Cnaeus Plancius. Do not then
                        wonder that in such a life as I am proceeding to describe, they should have
                        been such numerous and great helps to him in the attainment of honour; for
                        this is he, who, when quite a young man, having gone with Aulus Torquatus
                        into <placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName> was beloved by that
                        most dignified and holy man, so worthy of every description of praise and
                        honour, to as great a degree as the intimacy engendered by being messmates,
                        and the modesty of a most pure minded youth allowed. And if he were present
                        he would affirm it no less zealously than his cousin who is here present and
                        his father-in-law, Titus Torquatus, his equal in every sort of glory and
                        virtue, who is indeed connected with him in the closest bonds of
                        relationship and connection, but these obligations of affection are so
                        strong that those other reasons for intimacy drawn from relationship appear
                        insignificant. He was in <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>
                        afterwards as the comrade of Saturninus, his relation as a soldier of
                        Quintus Metellus, who is here present, and as he was most highly approved of
                        by them and is so to this day, he has a right to hope that he will be
                        approved of by every one. In that province Caius Sacerdos was the
                        lieutenant,&mdash;how virtuous, how consistent a man and Lucius
                        Flaccus,&mdash;what a man, what a citizen was he! and they by their zeal
                        in his behalf, and by their evidence, declare what sort of man they think
                        Plancius. <milestone n="28" unit="section"/> In <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> he was a military tribune. In that same province
                        he was afterwards quaestor. In the first place, <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> is so attached to him as these men, the chief men
                        of their respective cities, state <pb n="114"/> it to be; who, though they
                        were sent with another object, still, being moved by his unexpected danger,
                        give him their countenance, sitting here by his side, and put forth all
                        their exertions in his behalf; if they stand by him, they think that they
                        shall be doing what is more acceptable to their fellow-citizens, than if
                        they attend strictly and solely to their embassy, and to the commission that
                        was entrusted to them. But Lucius Appuleius considers him so excellent a
                        man, that by his attentions and kindness to him, he has gone beyond that
                        principle of our ancestors which enjoins that praetors ought to consider
                        themselves as standing in the light of parents to their quaestors. He was a
                        tribune of the people, not perhaps as violent as those men whom you
                        naturally extol, but certainly such a one, that if all had at all times been
                        like him, a violent tribune would never have been wished for or regretted.

					<p>I say nothing of those things which if they are less brought on the stage
                        than others, still at all events are always praised when they do come to
                        light; for instance, how he lives among his own relations; in the first
                        place with his father, (for in my opinion filial affection is the foundation
                        of all the virtues,) whom he venerates as a god, (and indeed a parent does
                        not stand in a very different relation to his children,) but loves as a
                        companion, as a brother, as a friend of his own age. Why should I speak of
                        his conduct to his uncle? to his connections? to his relations? to this
                        Cnaeus Saturninus whom you see in court, a most gallant man? And you may
                        judge how desirous this man was of his attaining honour, when you see how he
                        partakes of his grief. Why should I speak of myself? for I seem to myself,
                        now that he is in danger, to be put on my own defence too. Why should I
                        speak of all these virtuous men whom you see in court, with their garments
                        changed for mourning robes? But these are all solid and well marked proofs,
                        O judges; these are evidences of integrity, not coloured by forensic
                        artifice, but deeply dyed with the indelible marks of truth. All that
                        running about and caressing of the people is very easy work; it is looked at
                        at a distance, not taken into the hand and examined; it makes a fine show if
                        you do not get too near and shake it. </p>
					<p><milestone n="30" unit="section"/> I say, then, that this man is adorned with
                        every high quality, both such as are eminent abroad and amiable at <pb n="115"/> home. I admit that he was inferior to you in some points, such
                        as those of name and family; but in others I assert that he was superior to
                        every one within the recollection of the present generation, in the zeal of
                        his fellow-citizens, and neighbours, and of the companies of farmers in his
                        behalf; equal to any one in virtue, integrity, and modesty; and yet do you
                        wonder at his being elected aedile? </p>
					<p>Do you try to defile the brilliancy of such a life as this with those
                        imputations? You impute adulteries to him which no one can recognise, not
                        only by having ever heard any one's name mentioned, but even by having heard
                        a suspicion breathed against him. You call him twice-married, in order to
                        invent new words, and not only new accusations. You say that some one was
                        taken by him into his province to gratify his lust; but that is not an
                        accusation, but a random lie, ventured on from the expectation of impunity.
                        You say that an actress was ravished by him. And this is said to have
                        happened at <placeName key="tgn,7006695">Atina</placeName>, while he was
                        quite young, by a sort of established licence of proceeding towards
                        theatrical people, well known in all towns. <milestone n="31" unit="section"/> O how elegantly must his youth have been passed, when the only thing
                        which is imputed to him is one that there was not much harm in, and when
                        even that is found to be false. He released some one from prison illegally.
                        The man you allude to was discharged out of ignorance&mdash;discharged,
                        as you know, at the request of an intimate friend and a most virtuous young
                        man; and the same man was arrested subsequently again. And these, and no
                        others, are all the faults which you can discover to attribute to him
                        throughout the whole of his life, while at the same time you affect to doubt
                        his virtue, and religion, and integrity. <milestone n="13" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>&ldquo;But his father,&rdquo; says the prosecutor, &ldquo;ought

                        capital trial, that in a contest where all his fortunes are at stake, a
                        father ought to be an objection to his son in the eyes of such men as these
                        judges! when even if he were ever so mean, or ever so sordid, still, by the
                        mere name of father, he would have weight with mild and merciful judges;
                        would have weight I say, because of the common feelings of all men, and
                        through the sweet recommendation of nature. <milestone n="32" unit="section"/> But as that Cnaeus Plancius is a Roman knight, whose rank <pb n="116"/>

					<p>Granius, the crier, replied to the consul Publius Nasica in the middle of the
                        forum, when he, after a suspension of all judicial proceedings had been
                        proclaimed, as he was returning home, had asked Granius &ldquo;why he
                        was sad; was it because all the auctions were postponed?&rdquo;
                        &ldquo;Rather,&rdquo; said he, <pb n="117"/> &ldquo;because they
                        have sent back the ambassadors.&rdquo; The same man made this answer to
                        a tribune of the people, Marcus Drusus, a most influential man, but one who
                        was causing great disturbances in the republic. When Drusus had saluted him,
                        as is the fashion, and had said, &ldquo;How do you do, O
                        Granius?&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I should rather ask, O Drusus,
                        what are you doing?&rdquo; And he often reproved with impunity the
                        designs of Lucius Crassus and Marcus Antonius, with still harsher
                        witticisms. At present the state is to such a degree oppressed by your
                        arrogance, that the freedom of laughing in which a crier used to be
                        indulged, is more than is now allowed to a Roman knight in making
                        lamentations. <milestone n="34" unit="section"/> For what expression was
                        ever used by Plancius which was not dictated by grief rather than by insult?
                        And what did he ever complain of, except at times when he was protecting his
                        companions or himself from injury? When the senate was hindered from making
                        a reply to a representation of the Roman knights,&mdash;a thing which
                        was invariably given even to enemies,&mdash;that injury was a great
                        grief to all the farmers of the revenue and that indignation this man did
                        not care to conceal. Their common feelings may perhaps have been disguised
                        by others, but the sentiments which my client shared with the rest he
                        revealed more plainly than the rest both by his countenance and by his
                        language. </p>
					<p><milestone n="35" unit="section"/> Although, O judges, (for thus much I know
                        of my own knowledge,) many things are attributed to Plancius which were
                        never said by him. In my own case, because I sometimes say something, not
                        from any deliberate intention, but either in the heat of speaking, or
                        because I have been provoked; and because as is natural, among the many
                        things which I say in this manner something comes out at times if not
                        excessively witty, still perhaps not altogether stupid, the consequence is
                        that, whatever anyone else says people say that I have said. But I, if it is
                        anything clever and worthy of a well-educated and learned man have no great
                        objection but I am very angry when the sayings of other men are attributed
                        to me, which are utterly unworthy of me. For, because he was the first
                        person to give his vote for the law concerning the farmers, at the time when
                        that most illustrious man the consul gave that privilege to that order of
                        men by a vote of the people, which if he had have done it, he would have
                        given them by a vote of the senate, if it be a crime in him <pb n="118"/> to
                        have given his vote for it, I ask what farmer was there who did not vote for
                        it? If the charge be that he was the first to vote, is that the fault of
                        chance, or of the man who proposed the law? If it was the effect of chance,
                        then there can be no crime in what happened by chance. If it was by the
                        choice of the consul, then it adds to the renown of Plancius that he was
                        considered the chief man of his order by so illustrious a man. <milestone n="15" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="36" unit="section"/></p>

                        And if this sort of tribunal is an equitable one in any other case except
                        that of bribing the tribes, I do not understand why, in this one description
                        of prosecution alone, the senate has allowed the tribes from which the
                        judges are taken to be selected by the prosecutor, and has not given the
                        same power of selection in other cases also. In actual prosecutions for
                        bribery, it has directed the tribunal to be formed by each party striking
                        off judges alternately; and though it omitted no other species of severity
                        to the defendant, still it thought it ought to omit this. <milestone n="37" unit="section"/> What? Is the reason of this conduct still obscure? was

                        This, then, was our opinion, that if he had bribed any tribe by means of
                        this hospitality&mdash;which the treating would be called by people more
                        solicitous to give it a respectable name than a true one;&mdash;if he
                        had, I say, corrupted any tribe by disgraceful bribery, he must be known to
                        have done so by the men who belonged to that tribe above all others.
                        Accordingly, the senate thought that when those tribes were selected is the
                        judges of the accused person, which he was said to have corrupted by
                        bribery, they would serve both as witnesses of the truth and as judges. It
                        is altogether a very severe sort <pb n="119"/> of tribunal; but still, if
                        either his own tribe, or one with which he was especially connected, was
                        proposed to a man as that which was to judge him, it could hardly be
                        refused. <milestone n="16" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="38" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>But in this case, O Laterensis, what tribes did you select? The Terentian
                        tribe, I suppose. That certainly was an equitable proceeding, and certainly
                        one that was expected, and it was quite worthy of your wisdom and firmness.
                        The tribe of which you keep crying out that Plancius had been the seller,
                        and corrupter, and briber; that tribe, especially since it consists, as it
                        does, of most virtuous and highly respectable men, you ought to have chosen.
                        Did you choose the Voltinian tribe? for you have taken it into your head to
                        connect some charge or other with that tribe. Why, then, did you not select
                        that tribe? What had Plancius to do with the Lemonian tribe? What had he to
                        do with the Ufentian? or with the Crustumine? for as for the Maecian tribe,
                        you selected that to be one, not to judge, but to be rejected. <milestone n="39" unit="section"/> Have you any doubt, then, O judges, that Marcus
                        Laterensis selected you on his own judgment having regard not to the spirit
                        of the law, but to some hope which he had himself formed with reference to
                        the state? Have you any doubt that when he avoided selecting those tribes
                        among which Plancius had extensive connections, the reason was that he
                        judged that they had been won over by legitimate attention and kindness, not
                        corrupted by bribery? For what reason can he allege why that power of
                        selection given to the prosecutor is not a measure of great severity towards
                        the defendant, if it is adopted without the consideration which determined
                        us to pass such a law? <milestone n="40" unit="section"/> Are you to choose
                        out of all the people either those who are personal friends of your own, or
                        personal enemies to me, or men whom you consider inexorable, inhuman and
                        cruel? Are you, without my knowing, or suspecting, or dreaming of such a
                        step, to choose your own connections and those of your friends, personal
                        enemies to me and to my counsel? And are you to add to them those whom you
                        think by nature harsh and unfriendly to all the world? And are you then to
                        produce them all of a sudden, so that I see the bench of judges who are to
                        try me before I can form the least idea who they are going to be? And are
                        you to compel me to plead my cause, one in which all my fortunes are at
                        stake, before those men, without having the power of rejecting even five,
                        which was <pb n="120"/> a privilege allowed to the last man who was put on
                        his trial by the decision of the judges themselves? <milestone n="41" unit="section"/> For it does not follow because Plancius has lived in
                        such a manner as never willfully to offend any one, or because you have made
                        such a mistake as unintentionally to select such men that we find we are
                        come before judges, and not before executioners, that on that account that
                        selection, if looked at by itself, is not a severe measure. <milestone n="17" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>Was it not lately the case that some most illustrious citizens would not
                        endure the idea of a judge selected by the prosecutor, (when, out of a
                        hundred and twenty-five judges, the chief men of the equestrian order, the
                        defendant rejected seventy-five, and retained fifty,) and preferred throwing
                        the whole business into confusion, to obeying that law and complying with
                        those terms? And shall we put up with judges chosen not out of the select
                        body of judges, but out of the whole people, and not proposed to us with a
                        power of striking off the obnoxious ones, but appointed by the prosecutor in
                        such a way that we have no power to object to a single one? </p>
					<p><milestone n="42" unit="section"/> I am not now complaining of the injustice
                        of the law, but I am showing that your conduct is at variance with the
                        spirit of the law; and I not only should not complain of the severity of
                        that proceeding, if you had acted as the senate intended and as the people
                        decreed, and had proposed to him as judges his own tribe, and those which he
                        had paid attentions to; but, if you had given him those men as judges who
                        ought also to have served as witnesses, I should think him acquitted at
                        once. And even now my opinion is not very different. For when you proposed
                        these tribes, you showed plainly that you preferred having judges who were
                        unknown rather than such as were known; you evaded the intention of the law;
                        you discarded every principle of justice; you preferred enveloping the case
                        in obscurity to throwing light upon it. &ldquo;The Voltinian tribe was
                        corrupted by him.&rdquo; &ldquo;He had bought the Terentian
                        tribe.&rdquo; <milestone n="43" unit="section"/> What could he say then
                        before men of the Voltinian tribe, or before his own tribesmen, if they were
                        his judges? Yes, what rather could you say yourself? What judge of all the
                        number could you find who might be a silent witness of those matters, or
                        which of them could you summon as such? In truth, if the defendant himself
                        were to propose the tribes which were to furnish his judges, Plancius
                        perhaps <pb n="121"/> would have proposed the Voltinian tribe on account of
                        his neighbourhood to and connection with it; but most unquestionably he
                        would have proposed his own. And if he had had to propose the president of
                        the court whom would he have been more likely to propose than this very
                        Caius Alfius, who is the president to whom he ought to be thoroughly
                        well-known, his own neighbour, a man of his own tribe, a most respectable
                        and upright man? Whose impartiality and desire for the safety of Cnaeus
                        Plancius which, without the least suspicion of being influenced by any
                        covetous motives he makes no concealment of, declares plainly enough that my
                        client had no reason to avoid having men of his own tribe for judges, when
                        you see that a man of his own tribe for president was a most desirable thing
                        for him. <milestone n="18" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="44" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>Nor am I now finding fault with your prudence in not giving him those tribes
                        to which he was best known, but I am proving that the intention of the
                        senate was disregarded by you. In truth which of all these men would listen
                        to you? Or what could you say? Could you say that Plancius was guilty of the
                        depository of the money to be used in bribery? Men's ears would reject the
                        assertion. No one would endure it. All would turn away from it. That he was
                        a very acceptable man to the tribes? They would hear that willingly. We
                        ourselves should not be afraid to allow that. For do not think, O
                        Laterensis, that the effect of those laws which the senate has thought fit
                        to establish concerning bribery has been to put an end to the recommendation
                        of candidates to attentions being paid to electors, or to personal
                        influence. There have always been virtuous men who have been anxious to have
                        influence among the men of their own tribe. <milestone n="45" unit="section"/> Nor, indeed, has our order ever been so harsh towards the common people,
                        as to be unwilling to have it courted by moderate liberality on our part.
                        Nor are our children to be forbidden to pay attention to the men of their
                        own tribe or to show regard for them or to canvass them on behalf of their
                        friends, or to expect a similar service from them when they are themselves
                        candidates for any office. For all these things are only acts of mutual
                        kindness and politeness, and are sanctioned by ancient customs and
                        precedent. That was on our conduct when the occasions of our ambition
                        required it; and such we have seen to be the course of most illustrious men;
                        and even <pb n="122"/> at the present day we see many men alive to the
                        necessity of keeping up their interests. It was the dividing the men of a
                        tribe into decuries, the classification of the whole people, and the attempt
                        to bind men's votes by bribes, that provoked the severity of the senate, and
                        the energetic indignation of all good men. Allege this, prove this, direct
                        your attention to this point, O Laterensis, that Plancius divided the tribes
                        into decuries, that he classified the people, that he was an agent with whom
                        money was deposited, that he promised money, that he distributed it; and
                        then I shall wonder at your not having chosen to use the weapons which the
                        law has armed you with. For with judges taken from the men of our own tribe,
                        I need not say we could not if those things were true, bear their severity,
                        but we could not even look them in the face. <milestone n="46" unit="section"/> But, after having avoided this line of conduct, and
                        declined having those men for judges, who, as they must have had the most
                        certain knowledge of such conduct, were bound to feel the greatest
                        indignation at it what will you say before those men who silently ask of you
                        why you have imposed this burden upon them; why you have chosen them above
                        all men; why you prefer having them to proceed by guesswork, rather than
                        those men to decide who had means of knowing the truth? <milestone n="19" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>I, O Laterensis, say that Plancius himself is a popular man, and that he had
                        to assist him in his canvass many men eager in his cause, who were also
                        popular men. And if you call them agents to treat people, you are polluting
                        a kind and zealous friendship, by a very insidious name. But if, because
                        they are popular, you think them on that account objects for prosecution,
                        then do not wonder that you yourself, after repudiating the friendship of
                        popular men, failed in attaining what your real worth demanded for you. </p>
					<p><milestone n="47" unit="section"/> But now, as I prove that Plancius was a
                        popular man in his tribe, because he has been kind to many of them, because
                        he has been security for many of them, because he has procured employment
                        for many of them by means of the authority and interest of his father, and
                        because he has bound the whole prefecture of <placeName key="tgn,7006695">Atina</placeName> to himself by all the kindness displayed by himself,
                        by his father, and by his ancestors; I call on you to prove in an equally
                        convincing manner, that he was an agent for receiving money to be spent in
                        bribery; that he <pb n="123"/> was himself a briber; that he classified the
                        people; that he divided the tribes into decuries. And if you cannot, do not
                        deny our order the exercise of a legitimate liberality; do not think that
                        popularity is a crime; do not enact a punishment to be inflicted for
                        courteous attentions. </p>
					<p>And accordingly, as you were forced to hesitate about this charge of
                        corrupting a tribe by means of treating, you had recourse to a general
                        accusation of bribery. And in examining this, let us, if you please, cease
                        awhile to contend in vulgar and random declamation. <milestone n="48" unit="section"/> For I will argue with you in this way. Do you choose
                        any one tribe you please, and prove, as you are bound to do, what agent
                        received the money for corrupting it, and who distributed the money among
                        the men of the tribe. And if you cannot do that, which in my opinion you
                        will not even begin to attempt, I will show you the means to which he owes
                        his success. Is not this a fair challenge? Do not you like to proceed in
                        this manner? Can I come to closer quarters, as they say, or can I meet you
                        on a fairer field? Why are you silent? Why do you conceal your intentions?
                        Why do you seek to shirk off? Again and again I press upon you, and keep
                        close to you; I pursue you, I ask for, I even demand some definite
                        accusation. Whatever tribe, I say, you select, whose votes Plancius
                        received, you show, if you can, any flaw in that one instance. I will then
                        show you by what means he really did gain its vote, and the principle shall
                        be exactly the same in his case, and, O Laterensis, in yours. For as you, if
                        I were to ask you, may be able to explain to me through whose influence it
                        was that you gained the affection of these tribes who voted for you, so do I
                        assert that I will explain to you, our adversary, the means by which we
                        gained the vote of any tribe you choose to inquire about. <milestone n="20" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="49" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>But why do I argue in this manner? Just as if Plancius had not already been
                        elected aedile in the former <foreign lang="la">comitia</foreign>. Which
                            <foreign lang="la">comitia</foreign> were begun to be held by the
                        consul, a man in every respect of the very highest authority, and the author
                        of those very laws concerning bribery. And besides, he began to hold them
                        very suddenly, contrary to any one's expectation; so that, even if any one
                        had formed the design of committing bribery, he would never have had time to
                        manage it. The tribes were summoned; the votes were <pb n="124"/> given;
                        counted up, declared. Plancius was by far the highest of all on the
                            poll.<note anchored="yes">Cicero, in his oration against Rullus, shows
                            that the votes were given twice over at elections for magistrates, the
                                <foreign lang="la">comitia tributa</foreign> being twice held for
                            that object.</note> There neither was nor could there be any suspicion
                        of bribery. Is it not the case that the one prerogative century carries such
                        weight with it that no one has ever gained the vote of that, but what he has
                        been declared consul either at that very <foreign lang="la">comitia</foreign>, or at all events consul for the year? And yet do you
                        wonder that Plancius was elected aedile when it was not a small portion of
                        the people, but the whole people that had declared their good-will towards
                        him? when it was not a portion of one tribe, but the whole <foreign lang="la">comitia</foreign> which were prerogative <foreign lang="la">comitia</foreign> in his behalf? <milestone n="50" unit="section"/> And
                        at that time if you, O Laterensis, had been inclined, or if you had thought
                        it consistent with your gravity to do what many men of high birth have often
                        done, who, having gained a great many fewer votes than they had expected,
                        afterwards, when the <foreign lang="la">comitia</foreign> had been
                        adjourned, have prostrated themselves, and, with broken spirits and in a
                        humble tone, had addressed supplications to the Roman people, I do not
                        question but that the whole multitude would have turned towards you. For
                        nobility, especially when upright and innocent has never, when appearing as
                        a suppliant, been rejected by the Roman people. But if your personal dignity
                        and character for magnanimity was, as it ought to have been, of more
                        importance to you than the aedileship, then, since you have that which you
                        preferred, do not regret that which you thought of less consequence. I
                        myself, in truth, have always striven most zealously, in the first place, to
                        be worthy of honour; in the second place, to be considered so. The third
                        consideration with me, though with most men it is the first, has been the
                        honour itself; but that is a thing which ought to be acceptable to those men
                        in whose case the Roman people has conferred it on them as a testimony to
                        their worth, and not as a favour granted to their assiduity in canvassing
                        for it. <milestone n="21" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="51" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>You ask also, O Laterensis, what answer you can make to the images of your
                        ancestors; how you are to excuse yourself to that most accomplished and
                        excellent man your <pb n="125"/> deceased father? Never think about those
                        things. Take care rather lest that querulousness and excessive grief of
                        yours be reproved by those men of consummate wisdom. For your father saw
                        that Appius Claudius a most noble man, even in the lifetime of his own
                        father a most influential and most illustrious citizen, Caius Claudius,
                        failed in his endeavour to obtain the aedileship, and yet that he was
                        afterwards elected consul without a repulse. He saw that a man most closely
                        connected with himself a most illustrious citizen, Lucius Volcatius, and he
                        saw that Marcus Piso too, having both sustained a slight defeat in the
                        matter of the aedileship, received afterwards the very highest honours from
                        the Roman people. But your grandfather could tell you also of the rejection
                        of Publius Nasica, when he stood for the aedileship, though I am sure that a
                        greater citizen has never existed in this republic, and of Caius Marius too,
                        who was twice rejected when a candidate for the aedileship, and yet was
                        seven times made consul, and of Lucius Caesar and of Cnaeus Octavius and of
                        Marcus Tullius, every one of whom we know were beaten for the aedileship,
                        and were elected consul afterwards. <milestone n="52" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>But why am I hunting up instances of men having failed as candidates for the
                        aedileship, when it is an office which has often been discharged in such a
                        way that the people appeared to have been doing a kindness to the men who
                        had been passed over. Lucius Philippus, a man of the highest truth and most
                        distinguished eloquence failed in his election to military tribune. Caius
                        Caelius, a most illustrious and admirable young man, was beaten for the
                        quaestorship. Publius Rutilius Rufus, Caius Fimbria, Caius Cassius, Cnaeus
                        Orestes all stood in vain for the tribuneship of the people. And yet we know
                        that every one of these men were afterwards made consuls. And your father
                        and your ancestors will of their own accord tell you this not with the
                        object of comforting you, nor to excuse you from any fault which you fear
                        that you must seem to have been guilty of, but with a view of encouraging
                        you to persevere in that course which you have followed from your earliest
                        youth. No credit believe me, O Laterensis, has been lost by you. Lost, do I
                        say? I declare solemnly, if you were to come to a right appreciation of what
                        has happened, an especial testimony has been borne to your virtue. <pb n="126"/>

					<p>For think not that there was not a great impression made by the circumstances
                        of your offering yourself as a candidate for that office from all
                        competition for which you subsequently withdrew, rather than swear to a
                        particular thing. You then, being quite a young man, declared plainly what
                        were your sentiments about public affairs: speaking more boldly, indeed,
                        than some men who had already attained the honours of the state, and more
                        undisguisedly than regard to your ambition, or to your age, required.
                            <milestone n="53" unit="section"/> And, therefore, among the people so
                        disparaged your pretensions, you must not think that there were none who had
                        taken offence at the intrepid spirit which you then displayed; who were
                        able, perhaps, to keep you, incautious as you were, from arriving at that
                        rank, but will never be able to move you when you are on your guard and
                        watchful against them. </p>
					<p>Have these arguments had any influence with you? &ldquo;Have you any
                        doubt,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;that a coalition was entered into
                        against me, when you see that Plancius and Plotius gained the votes of the

                        the tribes did not give their votes in concert? But some of the tribes gave
                        almost the very same number of votes for each of them. Yes, when at the
                        preceding <foreign lang="la">comitia</foreign> those two had been already
                        almost elected and declared. Although even that fact would not necessarily
                        involve any suspicion of a coalition. For our ancestors would never have
                        established a rule of casting lots for the aedileship, if they had not seen
                        that it was possible that the competitors should have had an equal number of
                        votes. <milestone n="54" unit="section"/> And you say that at the preceding
                            <foreign lang="la">comitia</foreign> the tribe of the Anio was given up
                        by Plotius to Pedius, and the Terentian tribe by Plancius to you; but now,
                        that they are taken away from both Pedius and you, lest they should run the
                        contest too fine. What a probable story it is, that before the inclination
                        of the people was ascertained, those men, who you say had already joined
                        their forces, should have thrown away their own tribes in order to assist
                        you, and that the same men should afterwards have been close and stingy,
                        when they had tried and found out how strong they were. They were afraid, I
                        suppose, of a close contest. As if the matter could come to a close point,
                        or as if there could be any danger. But nevertheless, do you bring the same
                        charge against Aulus Plotius, a most <pb n="127"/> accomplished man? or do
                        you admit that you have only attacked the man who never requested you to
                        spare him?<note anchored="yes">Orellius and all editors consider this

                        the Voltinian tribe, than you had received votes in that tribe, you show by
                        that, either that you are bringing forward those men as witnesses who passed
                        you over because they had taken a bribe, or else that you could not get

					<p>But as for that charge about the money which you say was seized in the
                        Flaminian Circus, it made a great noise while the matter was recent, but now
                        it has got quite cold. For you have never explained what money that was, nor
                        what were the tribes which were to receive it, nor who was to distribute it
                        to them. And he, indeed, who was then impeached on this account, being
                        brought before the consuls complained that he had been shamefully treated by
                        your partisans. For if he acted as the distributor of the money particularly
                        for that man whom you were prosecuting, why was he also not prosecuted by
                        you? Why did you get some appearance of a decision having been already come
                        to in this cause by his conviction? But the fact is that you have no proofs
                        to advance, nor do you place the slightest reliance on any. It is quite
                        another motive and another consideration which has induced you to cherish
                        the hope of crushing this man. You have great resources; very extensive
                        influence many friends; many eager partisans; many favourers of your credit:
                        many are envious of my client, to many too his father a most excellent man,
                        appears to be too great a stickler for the freedom and privileges of the
                        equestrian order. Many too are the common enemies of every defendant, men
                        who always give their evidence on trials for bribery and corruption in such
                        a way as if they could influence the minds of the judges by their evidence,
                        or as if it were pleasing to the Roman people, and as if, on that account,
                        they would the more easily attain that dignity which they are desirous of.

                        contending with those men in my former fashion; not because it is right for

                        is neither necessary, that I should follow up that argument with my voice,
                            <pb n="128"/> which you already see with your mind; and because those
                        very men whom I see already as witnesses, have deserved so well of me, that
                        you ought to take upon your own prudence the task of reproving them, and to
                        excuse my modesty from that task. </p>
					<p>This one thing I beg and entreat of you, O judges, both for the sake of this

                        reports which people falsely pretend that they have heard, or of vague and
                        uncertain conversation. <milestone n="57" unit="section"/> Many friends of
                        the prosecutor, some men, too, who are personal enemies of ours, many
                        general and universal calumniators, and men who envy everybody, have
                        invented heaps of things. But there is nothing which travels so fast as
                        slander; nothing is more easily sent abroad, nothing is received more
                        rapidly, nothing is spread more extensively. Nor will I, if you can ever
                        trace the origin of a calumny, ever require you to disregard it or conceal
                        it. But if anything gets abroad without a head, or if there be any report of
                        such a nature that no author of it can be found; if he who has heard it
                        appears to you either so careless as to have forgotten where he heard it; or
                        if he knows his authority to be so insignificant that he is ashamed to
                        confess that he recollects who he is,&mdash;then I do beg of you not to

					<p>But I come now to Lucius Cassius, my own intimate friend, and I have not as
                        yet made any complaint about that Juventius whom that young man,
                        accomplished in every virtue and in every branch of polite learning,
                        mentions in his speech, and says that he was the first man of the common
                        people who was ever made a curule aedile. And with reference to that case,
                        if, O Cassius, I were to reply to you that the Roman people knew nothing of
                        that fact and that there is no one who can tell us anything about him,
                        especially now that Longinus is dead, you would not wonder, I imagine, when
                        I myself, who am not at all inclined to neglect the study of antiquity,
                        confess that I first heard of this fact in this place, from your mouth. And
                        since your oration was very elegant and very ingenious; worthy both of the
                        learning and modesty of a Roman knight, and since you were listened to by

                        abilities and to your character as a gentleman and a scholar, I will reply
                        now to what you said, of which the greater part concerned me myself, and in
                        which the very stings, if you did put out any in your reproof of me, were
                        still not disagreeable to me. <milestone n="59" unit="section"/>

					<p>You asked me whether I thought that the road to the attainment of honours had
                        been easier to me the son of a Roman knight, than it would be to my son, who
                        was now of a consular family. But although I would rather that all good
                        fortune fell to his lot than to my own, still I have never wished for him
                        that the road to honour might be more easy to him than I have found it
                        myself. Moreover, lest he should by chance think that I have procured him

                        would not be so much envied. In truth the degrees of honour are equal in the
                        case of the highest and the lowest citizens, but the glory of arriving at
                        them is unequal. <milestone n="25" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>Who of us would call himself equal to Manius Curius, or to Caius Fabricius or

                        Cnaeus and Publius Scipio or for Africanus, Marcellus or Maximus? And yet we
                        have arrived at the same degree of rank that they <pb n="130"/> did. In
                        truth, in virtue there are many steps; so that he is the most eminent in
                        renown, who is the superior in virtue. The summit of the honours conferred
                        by the people is the consulship. And by this time nearly eight hundred men
                        have obtained that. And of this eight hundred, if you examine carefully, you
                        will find hardly one tenth of the number worthy of such a preeminence. But
                        yet no one ever went on as you do. &ldquo;Why is that man made consul?
                        What could he have got more if he had been Lucius Brutus, who delivered the

                        rank certainly, but he would have much more glory. And in the same manner,
                        therefore, Plancius has been made quaestor, and tribune of the people, and
                        aedile, just as much as if he had been a man of the highest rank by birth;
                        but a countless number of other men, born in the same rank as he, have also
                        attained these honours. <milestone n="61" unit="section"/> You speak of the
                        triumphs of Titus Didius, and Caius Marius; and ask what there is like these
                        exploits in Plancius. As if those men whom you are speaking of obtained
                        their magistracies because they had triumphed, and did not on the contrary
                        triumph after having performed great achievements, because those
                        magistracies were entrusted to them. You ask what campaigns he has served;
                        when he was a soldier in <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>,
                        while Metellus, who is here in court, was commander-in-chief, and military
                        tribune in <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>; and when he
                        was quaestor he only abstracted just so much time from his attention to his
                        military duties as he thought it better to devote to protecting me. </p>
					<p><milestone n="62" unit="section"/> You ask whether he is an eloquent man. At
                        all events, what is the next best thing to being so, he does not think
                        himself one. &ldquo;Is he a lawyer?&rdquo; As if there were any one
                        who complains that he has given him a false answer in a point of law. For
                        all such acts as that are open to criticism in the case of men who, after
                        they have professed an acquaintance with them, are unable to satisfy
                        people's expectations; not in the case of men who confess that they have
                        never paid any attention to those pursuits. What is usually required in a
                        candidate is virtue, and honesty, and integrity, not volubility of tongue,
                        or an acquaintance with any particular art or science. As we, when we are
                        procuring slaves, are annoyed if we have bought a man as a smith or a
                        plasterer, and find, <pb n="131"/> however good a man he may be, that he
                        knows nothing of those trades which we had in view in buying him; but if we
                        have bought a man to give him charge of our property as steward, or to
                        employ him to look after our stock, then we do not care for any other
                        qualities in him except frugality, industry, and vigilance; so the Roman
                        people elects magistrates to be as it were stewards of the republic, and if
                        they are masters of some accomplishment besides, the people have no
                        objection, but if not, they are content with their virtue and innocence. For
                        how few men are eloquent; how few are skillful lawyers, even if you include
                        all those in your calculation who wish to be so! But if no one else is
                        worthy of honour, what on earth is to become of so many most virtuous and
                        most accomplished citizens? <milestone n="26" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="63" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>You request Plancius to mention any faults of Laterensis. He cannot mention
                        any, unless he thinks him too ill-tempered towards himself. At the same time
                        you extol Laterensis highly yourself. I have no particular objection to your
                        spending a number of words on what has nothing to do with the trial, and to
                        your occupying so much time, while conducting the prosecution, in saying
                        what I, who am the counsel for the defence can admit without any danger. And
                        I do not only admit that every sort of high quality is to be found in
                        Laterensis, but I even find fault with you, for not enumerating his chief
                        excellences, but descending to look for trifling and insignificant subjects
                        for panegyric. You say &ldquo;That he celebrated games at <placeName key="perseus,Praeneste">Praeneste</placeName>.&rdquo; Well; have not
                        other quaestors done the same? &ldquo;That at <placeName key="tgn,7000639">Cyrene</placeName> he was liberal towards the farmers
                        of the revenue, and just towards the allies.&rdquo; Who denies it? but
                        so many important transactions take place at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, that it is difficult for those things which are done
                        in the provinces to get heard of. <milestone n="64" unit="section"/> I have
                        no fear, O judges, of appearing to assume too much credit to myself, if I
                        speak of my own quaestorship. For although I got great credit in it, still I
                        consider that I have been employed since that in the highest offices of the
                        state, so that I have no need to seek for much glory from the credit I
                        gained in my quaestorship; but still I do not fear that any one will venture
                        to say that anybody's quaestorship in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> has been either more acceptable to the people, or
                        has gained a higher reputation for the quaestor. Indeed, I can say this with
                        truth, <pb n="132"/> I, too, at that time thought that men at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> were talking of nothing else except
                        my quaestorship. At a time of great dearness, I had sent an immense quantity
                        of corn to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. I had been
                        affable to the traders, just to the merchants, liberal to the citizens of
                        the municipal towns, moderate as regards the allies, and in every respect I
                        appeared to have been most diligent in the discharge of every part of my
                        duty. Some perfectly unheard-of honours were contrived for me by the
                        Sicilians. <milestone n="65" unit="section"/> Therefore I left my province
                        with the hope that the Roman people would come forward of its own accord to
                        pay me every sort of honour. But when one day by chance at that time, I, on
                        my road from the province, had arrived in the course of my journey at
                            <placeName key="perseus,Puteoli">Puteoli</placeName>, at a time which
                        great numbers of the wealthiest men are accustomed to spend in that
                        district, I almost dropped with vexation when some one asked me what day I
                        had left <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and whether there
                        was any news there. And when I had replied that I was on my road from my
                        province, &ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;from <placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>, I suppose.&rdquo; <milestone n="27" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>On this, I, angry and disgusted, said, &ldquo;No; from <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>.&rdquo; And then, some one
                        else, with the air of a man who knew everything, said, &ldquo;What! do
                        not you know that Cicero has been quaestor at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>?&rdquo; I need not make
                        a long story of it; I gave over being angry, and was content to be
                        considered one of those who had come to <placeName key="perseus,Puteoli">Puteoli</placeName> for the waters. <milestone n="66" unit="section"/>
                        But I do not know, O judges, whether what happened then did not do me more
                        good than if every one had congratulated me. For after I learnt from this
                        that the people of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> had deaf
                        ears, but very sharp and active eyes, I gave up thinking what men would have
                        said of me; but took care that they should every day see me in their
                        presence: I lived in their sight; I stuck to the forum; neither my porter
                        nor even sleep was allowed to prevent any one from having access to me. Need
                        I say anything about my time which was devoted to business, when even my
                        leisure time was never my own? For the very orations which you say, O
                        Cassius, that you are in the habit of reading when you are at leisure, I
                        wrote on days of festival and on holidays, so that I never was at leisure at
                        all. In truth, I have always thought that saying of Marcus Cato, which he
                        put at the head of his <title>Origines</title>, a splendid and admirable
                        one: &ldquo;That eminent and great men ought to lay down a regular plan
                        for their leisure <pb n="133"/> as well as for their business.&rdquo;
                        And, therefore, if I have any credit, I hardly know how much I have; it has
                        all been acquired at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> and
                        earned in the forum. And public events have sanctioned my private counsels
                        in such a way that even at home I have had to attend to the general
                        interests of the republic, and to preserve the city while in the city. The
                        same road, O Cassius, is open to Laterensis, the same path by virtue to
                        glory. <milestone n="67" unit="section"/> And it will be the easier to him
                        perhaps on this account that I have mounted up hither without having any
                        family interest to push me on and relying solely on my self; but his
                        admirable virtues will be assisted by the recommendation which the virtues
                        of his ancestors supply him with. </p>
					<p>However, to return to Plancius, he has never been absent from the city unless
                        any lot which he may have drawn or some law, or some necessity compelled him
                        to be so. He did not excel in those things in which some men perhaps do but
                        he did excel in diligence, he did excel in paying attention to his friends,
                        he did excel in liberality. He kept himself before men's eyes; he stood for
                        offices; he has followed at all times that course of life by which, while
                        there is less danger that way of incurring unpopularity, the greatest number
                        of new men have attained the same honours which he has. <milestone n="28" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="68" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>For as to what you say, O Cassius&mdash;that I am not under greater
                        obligations to Plancius than I am to all good men, because my safety was
                        equally dear to all of them,&mdash;I confess that I am under obligations
                        to all good men. But even those men to whom I am under obligations, good men
                        and virtuous citizens, said at the <foreign lang="la">comitia</foreign> for
                        the election of the aediles, that they themselves were under some
                        obligations to Plancius on my account. However grant that I am under
                        obligations to many people and among others to Plancius, ought it therefore
                        to make me bankrupt; ought I not rather, when each man's turn comes, to pay
                        them all this debt which I acknowledge, whenever it is demanded? Although,
                        being in debt for money and for kindness are two different things. For the
                        man who pays money, the moment he does so, no longer has that which he has
                        paid, and he who owes is in debt. But the man who shows his gratitude by
                        requiting a kindness, still preserves the feeling; and he who feels it,
                        requites the kindness by the mere fact of his feeling it. Nor shall I cease
                        to be under obligations to Plancius even if I requite his service <pb n="134"/> to me now;<milestone n="69" unit="section"/> nor should I have
                        been less grateful to him as far as my inclination went, if this trouble had
                        not befallen him. You ask of me, O Cassius, what I could do more for my own
                        brother, who is most dear to me,&mdash;what I could do more for my own
                        children, than whom nothing can be more delightful to me, than I am doing
                        for Plancius? And you do not see that the very affection which I feel for
                        them, stimulates and excites me to defend the safety of Plancius, too. For
                        they have nothing more at heart than the safety of the man by whom they know
                        that my safety was ensured; and I myself never look on them without
                        recollecting that it is by his means that I was preserved to them, and
                        remembering his great services done to me. </p>
					<p>You relate that Opimius was condemned, though he himself had been the saviour
                        of the republic. You add to him Calidius, by whose law Quintus Metellus was
                        restored to the state; and you find fault with my prayers on behalf of
                        Cnaeus Plancius, because Opimius was not released on account of his
                        services, nor Calidius on account of those of Quintus Metellus. <milestone n="29" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>As for Calidius, I will only state this in answer to you, which I saw myself.
                        That Quintus Metellus Pius, when consul, at the <foreign lang="la">comitia</foreign> for the election of praetors, for which office
                        Quintus Calidius was standing, addressed supplications to the Roman people,
                        and did not hesitate&mdash;though he was consul at the time, and a man
                        of the very highest rank&mdash;to call him his patron and the patron of
                        his most noble family. <milestone n="70" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>And now I ask of you whether you think that, if Calidius had been on his
                        trial, Metellus Pius, if he had been able to be at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, or his father, if he had been
                        alive, would have done for him what I am doing on the trial of Cnaeus
                        Plancius? I wish, indeed, that the misfortune of Opimius could be eradicated
                        from men's memories. But it is to be considered as a wound inflicted on the
                        republic, as a disgrace to this empire, as the infamy of the Roman people,
                        and not as a judicial verdict. For what more terrible blow could those
                        judges&mdash;if indeed they deserve to be called judges, and not
                        parricides of their country&mdash;inflict on the republic, than they did
                        when they drove that man out of the state, who as praetor had delivered the
                        republic from a war waged against it by its neighbours, and as consul, from
                        one carried on against it by its own citizens? <pb n="134"/>
                    </p>
					<p><milestone n="71" unit="section"/> But you say that I make out the kindness
                        done me by Plancius to have been greater than it really was, and as you say,
                        I exaggerate it in speaking of it as if I were bound to regulate my
                        gratitude by your estimate and not by my own. &ldquo;What great service
                        was it after all that he did you? Was it that he did not put you to
                        death?&rdquo; Say rather that he prevented me from being put to death.
                        And, while speaking on this point, O Cassius, you even acquitted my enemies
                        and said that no plots had been laid by them against my life. And Laterensis
                        advanced the same assertion. Wherefore I will presently say a little more on
                        that head. At present I only ask of you whether you think it was but a
                        slight hatred which my enemies had conceived against me? Did any barbarians
                        ever entertain such savage and cruel feelings against an open enemy? Or do
                        you suppose that there was in those men any regard for fame or any fear of
                        punishment when you saw them during the whole of that year brandishing their
                        swords in the forum, menacing the temples with conflagration, and disturbing
                        the whole city with their violence? Unless, perhaps, you think that they
                        spared my life because they had no apprehension of my return. Do you think
                        that there was any one so wholly destitute of sense as not to think that if
                        these men were permitted to live, and if the city and the senate-house were
                        allowed to remain standing, I also ought certainly to be restored if I too
                        remained alive? Wherefore you, being such a man and such a citizen as you
                        are, ought not to say that my enemies were too moderate to attack my life,
                        when the fact is that it was preserved by the fidelity of my friends.

					<p>I will now reply to you, O Laterensis, perhaps less vigorously than I have
                        been attacked by you and certainly in a manner not more destitute of
                        consideration for, or of friendly feeling towards you than your manner was
                        towards me. For in the first place that was rather a harsh thing for you to
                        say, that in what I was saying about Plancius I was speaking falsely, and
                        inventing statements to suit the emergency. I suppose, forsooth, I, like a
                        wise man, planned how I might appear bound to another by the greatest bonds
                        of kindness and gratitude when I was in reality a free man and under no
                        obligation at all. Why need I have done so? Had I not plenty of reasons
                        besides for defending Plancius? were <pb n="136"/> not my own intimacy with
                        him, my neighbourhood to him, and my friendship for his father, sufficiently
                        cogent motives? And even if they had not existed, I had reason to fear, I
                        suppose, lest I should be doing a discreditable thing in defending a man of
                        his high respectability and worth. It must have been a very clever idea of
                        mine to pretend that I owed everything to that man who was about to owe
                        everything to me! But this is a thing which even common soldiers do against
                        their will, and they are reluctant to give a civic crown to a citizen, and
                        to confess that they have been saved by any one; not because it is
                        discreditable to have been protected in battle, or to be saved out of the
                        hands of the enemy, (for in truth that is a thing which can only happen to a
                        brave man, and to one fighting hand to hand with the enemy,) but they dread
                        the burden of the obligation, because it is an enormous thing to be under
                        the same obligation to a stranger that one is to a parent. <milestone n="73" unit="section"/> But because others deny kindnesses which they have
                        received, even when they are of less importance, in order not to appear
                        under any obligation, am I on that account speaking falsely, when I say that
                        I am bound to a man by his previous services done to me, for which it is
                        quite impossible for me to make any adequate return? Are you ignorant of
                        this, O Laterensis?&mdash;you who being, as you were, a great friend of
                        mine, and willing to share with me even the danger with which my life was at
                        that time threatened,&mdash;when you had escorted me in that hope of my
                        sad and bitter agony and departure from the city not only with your tears,
                        but also with your courage and your person, and with all your
                        resources,&mdash;when you had in my absence defended with all your
                        means, and all your power of protection, my children and my wife, were
                        always pressing this statement upon me, that you willingly allowed and
                        granted that I should employ all my zeal in contributing to the honour of
                        Cnaeus Plancius because you said that the services which he had done me were
                        acceptable to you yourself also. <milestone n="74" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>And is not even that oration, which is the first which I made in the senate
                        after my return, a proof that I am saying nothing new now,&mdash;nothing
                        just to meet the emergency? For as in that I returned thanks to very few by
                        name, because it was quite impossible to enumerate all those who had served
                        me, (and it would have been a crime to press over any <pb n="137"/> one,)
                        and because I had therefore laid down a rule for myself to name those men
                        only who had been the leaders and standard-bearers as it were in our cause;
                        still among them I returned thanks to Plancius by name. Let the oration be
                        read&mdash;which, on account of the importance of the business was
                        pronounced from a written paper, in which I, cunning fellow that I must have
                        been, gave myself up to a man to whom I was under no very great obligation
                        and bound myself to the slavery of this duty which I am now discharging by
                        this undying testimony against myself. I do not wish to recite the other
                        things which I committed to writing. I pass them over, that I may not seem
                        to bring them up now on this emergency, or to avail myself of that
                        description of learning which appears to be more suitable to my private

					<p>And you keep crying out, O Laterensis, &ldquo;How long are you going to
                        keep on saying this? You did no good in the case of Cispius; people have got
                        tired of your entreaties.&rdquo; Will you object to me what I did in the
                        case of Cispius, who had indeed deserved well of me, but whom I defended,
                        having you for a witness in his favour, and at your especial request? And
                        will you say &ldquo;How long&rdquo; to a man who you say was unable
                        to obtain what he begged on behalf of Cispius? For to say &ldquo;How
                        long&rdquo; to a man who exerted himself for one friend alone and who
                        did not succeed in his object is rather like laughing at a person than
                        reproving him, unless perhaps, I, above all other men, have behaved in such
                        a manner in the courts of justice, have lived in such a manner with those
                        men who are the judges and among them&mdash;unless I am such an advocate
                        of defendants on their trial and unless I am, and always have been, such a
                        citizen in the republic, as to deserve to he held up by you as the only
                        person who never ought to obtain anything from the judges by my

                    </p>
					<p>And then you object to me a tear which I shed at the trial of Cispius. For
                        this is what you said &ldquo;I saw your tear.&rdquo; See now how I
                        repent of having given you cause to say so. You might have seen not only a
                        tear but many tears, and weeping and sobbing. Was I to abstain from showing
                        my grief at the danger of a man who was so far moved by the tears of my
                        family in my absence that he laid aside the enmity which he had conceived
                        against me, and was not only <pb n="138"/>no opposer of my safety, (as my
                        enemies had expected that he would have been,) but was even a great defender
                        of it? <milestone n="77" unit="section"/> And you, O Laterensis, who then
                        said that my tears were a grateful sight, now wish to found an accusation
                        against me on them. <milestone n="32" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>You say that the tribuneship of Plancius did not bring any assistance to my
                        dignity. And in this place, (as you can do with the greatest truth,) you
                        enumerate the godlike services done to me by Lucius Racilius, a most gallant
                        and sensible man. And I never have concealed, and I shall at all times
                        openly assert, that I am under the very greatest obligations to him, as I am
                        to Cnaeus Plancius; for he never thought any contest, or any enmity, or any
                        danger even of his life too great for him to encounter for the sake of my
                        welfare, or of that of the republic. And I wish that the Roman people were
                        not prevented by the violence and injustice of wicked men from proving to
                        him their gratitude by their acts, and measuring it by the extent of my own.
                        But if Plancius did not make the same exertions in my favour when he was
                        tribune, you ought to think, not that his inclination was wanting, but that
                        I, being already under such vast obligations to Plancius, was now content
                        with the services of Racilius. <milestone n="78" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>Do you think that the judges will be the less inclined to do anything for my
                        sake, because you accuse me of gratitude? Or, when the senators themselves,
                        in that resolution of the senate which was passed in the monument of
                            Marius,<note anchored="yes">The decree for Cicero's return was passed in
                            a temple built by Marius, and called on that account Marius' monument,
                            and this was a circumstance that had specially delighted Cicero, as
                            being in accordance with a dream of his when he first left <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, in which he fancied that Marius
                            had appeared to him, and had ordered his lictor to conduct him to his
                            monument, telling him that he should find safety there. <foreign lang="la">Vide</foreign>

                        returned thanks to Plancius alone, (for he was the only defender of my
                        safety, of all the magistrates or vice-magistrates, to whom the senate
                        thought it proper to return thanks on my behalf,) shall I think that I
                        myself am not bound to show my gratitude to him? And when you see all these
                        things, what do you suppose must be my feelings towards you, O Laterensis?
                        Do you think that there is any danger, or any labour, or any <pb n="139"/>
                        contest of so arduous a nature that I would shun it if it could advance not
                        only your safety, but even your dignity? And I am so much the more, I will
                        not say miserable, (for that is an expression which is inconsistent with the
                        character of a virtuous man) but severely tried not because I am under
                        obligations to many people, (for gratitude for kindness received is a very
                        light burden) but because circumstances often happen, on account of the
                        quarrels of some men who have deserved well of me with one another which
                        make me fear that it is impossible for me to appear grateful to them all at
                        the same time. <milestone n="79" unit="section"/> But I must weigh in my own
                        scales not only what I owe to each individual, but also of what importance
                        the case is to each person, and what the necessities of each require of me
                        at the particular moment. <milestone n="33" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>What is at stake now on your part is this,&mdash;your eager wishes, or
                        even, if you like, your reputation and the glory of the aedileship. But on
                        the side of Cnaeus Plancius, it is his safety, his rights as a Roman and a
                        citizen which are in peril. You wished me to be safe; he even ensured every
                        safety by his actions. Yet I am torn asunder and rent in pieces by
                        grief&mdash;I do grieve that in a contest where the stakes are so
                        unequal, you should be offended by my conduct, but, I declare most solemnly,
                        I would much rather endanger my own safety on your behalf than abandon the
                        safety of Cnaeus Plancius to your hostility in this contest. <milestone n="80" unit="section"/> In truth, O judges, while I wish to be adorned
                        with every virtue, yet there is nothing which I can esteem more highly than
                        the being and appearing grateful. For this one virtue is not only the
                        greatest, but is also the parent of all the other virtues. What is filial
                        affection, but a grateful inclination towards one's parents?&mdash;who
                        are good citizens, who are they who deserve well of their country both in
                        war and at home but they who recollect the kindness which they have received
                        from their country?&mdash;who are pious men who are men attentive to
                        religious obligations, but they who with proper honours and with a grateful
                        memory acquit themselves to the immortal gods of the gratitude which they
                        owe to them?&mdash;what pleasure can there be in life, if friendships be
                        taken away?&mdash;and, moreover, what friendship can exist between
                        ungrateful people?&mdash;<milestone n="81" unit="section"/>Who of us has
                        been liberally educated, by whom his bringers up, and his teachers, and his

                        been brought up and taught, are not preserved in his mind with a grateful
                        recollection?&mdash;who ever can have, or who ever had such resources in
                        himself as to be able to stand without many acts of kindness on the part of
                        many friends?&mdash;and yet no such acts can possibly exist, if you take
                        away memory and gratitude. I, in truth, think nothing so much the peculiar
                        property of man, as the quality of being bound, not only by a kindness
                        received, but by even the intimation of good-will towards one; and I think
                        nothing so inconsistent with one's idea of a man&mdash;nothing so
                        barbarous or so brutal&mdash;as to appear, I will not say unworthy of,
                        but surpassed by kindness. </p>
					<p><milestone n="82" unit="section"/> And as this is the case, I will succumb, O
                        Laterensis, to your accusation; and in that very particular in which there
                        cannot by any possibility be any excess,&mdash;namely, in gratitude, I
                        will confess that I have gone to excess, since you insist upon it that it is
                        so. And I will entreat you, O judges, to bind that man to you by a kindness,
                        in whom the only fault that those who blame him find with him is that they
                        accuse him of being immoderately grateful. And that ought not to prevail
                        with you so as to make you think lightly of my gratitude, when he said that
                        you were neither guilty men nor litigious men, so that there was the less
                        reason for your allowing me any great influence over you: as if in my
                        intercourse with my friends I did not always prefer that these abilities of
                        mine (if indeed I have any abilities) should be at the service of my
                        friends, rather than they should become necessary to them. In truth, I do
                        venture to say this of myself, that my friendship has been a pleasure to
                        more men than those to whom it has been a protection; and I should greatly
                        repent of my past life; if there was no room in my friendship for any one
                        who was not either a litigious person or a guilty one. <milestone n="34" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="83" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>But somehow or other you have repeated over and over again, and have dwelt
                        upon the assertion, that you did not choose to connect this case with the
                        games, lest I, according to my usual custom, should say something about the
                        sacred cars, for the sake of exciting pity; as I had done before in the case
                        of other aediles. No doubt you got something by this; for you deprived me of
                        an embellishment of my speech. I shall be laughed at now if I make any
                        mention <pb n="141"/> of the sacred cars, after you have predicted that I
                        should do so. And without the sacred cars what can I find to say? And here
                        you added, too, that this was the reason why I by my law had established the
                        penalty of banishment in cases of bribery, that I might be able to sum up my
                        orations in ways more calculated to excite pity. Does he not, when he says
                        all this, seem to you to be arguing against some teacher of declamation, and
                        not with one who is a pupil, as I may say, of the real toils of the forum?

                        with one, I know not why you should think <placeName key="perseus,Nicaea">Nicaea</placeName> stricter than <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName> if we are to examine into the cause, then you were
                        in <placeName key="tgn,7016608">Bithynia</placeName> with the greatest
                        credit, and I was at <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName> with no
                        less. For as to the point on which you found fault with me, namely, that I
                        had defended too many people, I wish that you who are able to do it and
                        others too, who shirk it, were willing to relieve me of this labour. But the
                        effect of your diligence, who weigh causes so carefully that you reject
                        almost all of them, is that nearly all causes come to me who am not able to
                        deny anything to men who are in misery and distress. <milestone n="85" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>You reminded me also, since you had been in <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> that something might have been said against your
                        offering yourself as a candidate, and that I let that opportunity slip.
                        Which of us, then, is more covetous of a smart saying? I, who did not say
                        what might have been said, or you, who said it even against yourself? You
                        were fond of saying that you had sent home no letters with accounts of your
                        exploits, because mine, which I had sent to some one or other, had injured
                        me. But I am not aware that they did injure me I am quite sure that they
                        might have been of service to the republic. <milestone n="35" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="86" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>These things are, however, of but little importance; but those points are
                        serious and weighty, that you wish now to find fault with, and in an
                        underhand manner, to accuse my departure from the city, which you had often
                        wept over. For you have said that assistance was not wanting to me, but that
                        I was wanting to those who were willing to assist me. But I confess that,
                        because I saw that aid was not wanting to me, I did on that account spare
                        that aid; for who is there who does not know what was the state of things at
                        that time.&mdash;what danger and what a storm there was in the republic?
                        Was it fear of the tribunes, or was it the frenzy of the consuls which
                        influenced me? Was it a very formidable thing for me to fight with the sword
                        with the relics of those men, whom, when they were flourishing with their
                        strength unimpaired, I had defeated without the sword? The basest and most
                        infamous consuls in the memory of man,&mdash;as both the beginning of
                        their conduct and as their recent termination of those affairs, show them to
                        have been, (one of whom lost his army, and the other sold
                        it,)&mdash;having bought their provinces, had deserted the senate, and
                        the republic, and all good men. When no one knew what were the feelings of
                        those men who by means of their armies, and their arms, and their riches,
                        were the most powerful men in the state, then that voice, rendered insane by
                        its infamous debaucheries, made effeminate by its attendance on holy altars,
                        kept crying out in a most ferocious manner that both these men and the
                        consuls were acting in concert with him. </p>
					<p>Needy men were armed against the rich, abandoned men against the good, slaves
                        against their masters. <milestone n="87" unit="section"/> The senate was
                        with me, even changing its garments in token of the danger; a measure which
                        was adopted by public resolution for no one else except myself in the memory
                        of man. But recollect who were then our enemies with the name of consuls.
                        The only men since the city was built who ever prevented the senate from
                        complying with a resolution of the senate, and who by their edict took away,
                        not indeed grief, from the conscript fathers, but the power of deciding on
                        the reasons for their grief. The whole equestrian order was with me; whom,
                        indeed, that dancing consul of Catiline's used to frighten in the assemblies
                        of the people with menaces of proscription. All <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> was assembled, and terrified with fear of civil war
                        and devastation. <milestone n="36" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>I admit, O Laterensis, that I might have availed myself of these assistants,
                        zealous in my behalf, and in a state of great excitement as they were. But
                        the contest must have been decided not by right, nor by the laws, nor by
                        argument; <pb n="143"/> for, in truth, that assistance of my own, which has
                        often been placed so readily at the disposal of others, would not especially
                        in so good a cause have been wanting to me myself. We must have fought with
                        arms&mdash;yes, with arms I say; and it would have been destruction to
                        the republic for arms to have been employed by slaves and leaders of slaves
                        for the slaughter of the senate and of the virtuous citizens. <milestone n="88" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>I confess that it would have been a fine thing for the wicked to have been
                        conquered by the good, if I could have seen the end of the victory (which,
                        in truth I could not). For where should I have found to stand by me so brave
                        a consul as Lucius Opimius or as Caius Marius or as Lucius Flaccus? under
                        whom, as her leaders, the republic did put down wicked men with armed
                        citizens, or if I could not get men as fearless as those, yet where could I
                        find men as just as Publius Mucius, who, after Tiberius Gracchus had been
                        slain, defended Publius Scipio and asserted that the aims which he as a
                        private individual had taken up, had been taken up in strict accordance with
                        the law? We, then, should have had to fight with the consuls. I say no more,
                        except this one thing; I saw that there were formidable adversaries ready to
                        dispute the victory with us, and no one who would avenge us if we fell.
                            <milestone n="89" unit="section"/> If, then, I was wanting to these aids
                        to the cause of my safety, because I was unwilling to do battle for it, I
                        will then confess, as you say, that assistance was not wanting to me, but
                        that I myself was wanting to the assistance which I had. But if, the greater
                        I saw the zeal of good men in my behalf, the more I thought it my duty to
                        consult their interests and to spare them, do you find fault with me for the
                        same conduct which was considered a credit to Quintus Metellus and which is
                        to this day, and always will be, his greatest glory? for it is well
                        known&mdash;as you may hear from many who were present at the
                        time&mdash;that he departed greatly against the will of all good men;
                        and there is not the slightest doubt that he would have had the best of it
                        if they had come to a struggle and a trial of arms. Therefore, though he was
                        defending his own actions, and not those of the senate, though it was his
                        own opinion that he was resolutely upholding and not the welfare of the
                        republic,&mdash;still when he endured that voluntary wound he surpassed
                        in glory and credit the justest and most illustrious triumphs of all the
                        Metelli; because he would not be the <pb n="144"/> cause of even those
                        wickedest of citizens being slain, and because he provided against the
                        danger of any good man being involved in their slaughter. And should
                        I,&mdash;seeing such great danger before us, as, if I were defeated, the
                        total destruction of the republic must ensue, and if I got the better, an
                        endless contest would follow, should I, I say, give any one reason to style
                        me the destroyer of the republic, after having been its saviour? <milestone n="37" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="90" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>You say that I was afraid of death. But I should think it wrong to accept
                        even immortality at the expense of the welfare of the republic; much less
                        should I be willing to die, if by that means I was to damage the
                        commonwealth. For as for those men who have given up their lives for the
                        sake of the state, (although you may say that I am talking foolishly,) I
                        have never considered that they had met with death so much as with
                        immortality. But if I had at that time fallen by the weapons and hands of
                        wicked men, the republic would for ever have lost the civil guardian of its
                        safety. Moreover, if any violence of disease, or if nature itself had
                        carried me off, still the resources of posterity would have been diminished,
                        because by my death the opportunity would have been lost of showing what
                        great zeal of the senate and people of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> was to be exerted in retaining me. Should I, if I had
                        ever had any extravagant fondness for life, have challenged the weapons of
                        all those parricides in the month of December of the year of my consulship,
                        when, if I had remained quiet for twenty days longer, they would all have
                        fallen on the vigilance of other consuls? Wherefore, if fondness for life
                        when contrary to the interests of the republic is shameful, at all events a
                        desire for death in my case, which must have been accompanied with injury to
                        the state, would have been more shameful still. </p>
					<p><milestone n="91" unit="section"/> For as for your boasting that you were a
                        free man in the republic, I confess that you are, and I rejoice at it, and I
                        also congratulate you on that account; but as for your denying that I am
                        free also, as to that particular I will neither allow you nor any one else
                        to continue in your mistake any longer. <milestone n="38" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>For if any one thinks that my independence has suffered any diminution,
                        because I do not now differ in opinion with all those same men with whom I
                        was formerly accustomed to differ; in the first place, if I show myself
                        grateful <pb n="145"/> to those who have deserved well of me, I do not cease
                        to be attacked with the accusation of being a man of too good a memory, and
                        too grateful. But if, without any injury to the republic, I sometimes show a
                        regard to my own safety and that of my family, at all events I not only do
                        not deserve to be blamed for this, but, even if I were to wish myself to run
                        on ruin, there are good men who would entreat me not to do so. </p>
					<p><milestone n="92" unit="section"/> But the republic itself, if it were able
                        to speak, would plead with me, that as I had always served her interests,
                        and never my own, and as I had received a reward from her not such as I
                        ought, rich and abundant, but mingled with exceeding bitterness, now at
                        length to serve myself, and to consult the interests of my family; and would
                        urge not only that she herself had received enough from me, but that she
                        even feared that she had made me but an inadequate return for all the
                        services which I had rendered her. </p>
					<p><milestone n="93" unit="section"/> But what will you say if I think nothing
                        of all these things, and if I persevere in the same course in the republic
                        which I have always pursued? will you still ask what is become of my
                        independence? which you make to consist in the fact of our struggling for
                        ever with any one with whom we have at any time had a contest. But this is
                        all nonsense; for we ought at all times to act as if we were standing in
                        some revolving orb of the republic, and as that turns round we ought to
                        choose that part to which the advantage and safety of the republic direct
                        us. <milestone n="39" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>But I do not call Cnaeus Pompeius the author, and prime cause, and defender
                        of my safety, (for these things demand perhaps a recollection of the
                        kindness and gratitude for it from a man in his private capacity,) but I say
                        this, which has reference to the common welfare of the republic; should not
                        I defend that man whom every one admits to be the first man in the republic?
                        should I be wanting to the praises of Caius Caesar, when I see them
                        celebrated first of all by numerous and most honourable decisions of the
                        Roman people, and now too by those of the senate, to which body I have
                        always devoted myself? In that case, in truth, I should confess that I had
                        never formed any opinion with reference to the welfare of the republic, but
                        that I was guided solely by my friendship for or enmity towards particular

					<p>When I see a ship holding on its course with favourable winds, if it does not
                        proceed towards that port which I at one time thought best, but to some
                        other no less safe and tranquil than that, shall I rather strive with the
                        tempest even at the risk of danger, instead of yielding to it and being
                        guided by it, especially when there is a hope of safety in such a line of
                        conduct? But I have learnt these principles, I have seen and read them in
                        books, written records have handed down to us these memorials of wise and
                        most illustrious men, both in this republic and in other cities, and show
                        that the same opinions have not at all times been upheld by the same men,
                        but that they have adopted whatever sentiments the constitution of the
                        republic, the state of affairs at the time, and the considerations of peace
                        and concord pointed out as desirable. And this is what I am doing, O
                        Laterensis, and what I always shall do; and the independence which you
                        profess to look for in me, and which I have never lost, I never will lose,
                        and yet on the other hand I will not believe it to consist in obstinacy, but
                        in moderation. <milestone n="40" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="95" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>Now I come to your last assertion, when you said that, while I was extolling
                        so highly the services which Plancius had done me, I was making a castle out
                        of a sewer, and worshipping a stone taken from a sepulchre as a god; and
                        that I had never been in the least danger of any one forming plots against
                        me, or of death. And therefore I will in a few words, and not reluctantly,
                        explain the circumstances of that time. For there is nothing that has
                        happened during my lifetime which has got abroad less, or which has been
                        seldomer talked about by me, or which has been less heard of and which is
                        less commonly known by men in general. For I, O Laterensis,&mdash;on
                        departing from that general conflagration of laws and justice, and the
                        senate, and all good men, at a time when my house threatened while burning
                        itself to set fire to the city and to all <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, if I did not remain perfectly

                        family in my favour, and which was at that time governed by Caius Virgilius,
                        with whom I was most intimately connected both by the long duration of our
                        acquaintance, and by friendship, and by his belonging to some of the same
                        guilds as my brother, and by our common attachment to the republic.

                        harassed as he was by the harangues and attacks of that same tribune of the
                        people, on account of his attachment to the republic, would not consent (I
                        will not use a stronger term) to my coming to <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>. What shall I say? Shall I say that Caius Virgilius,
                        that that excellent citizen and man had forgotten his regard for me, the
                        recollection of the days of our companionship, and all regard for piety,
                        humanity, and good faith? Nothing of the sort, O judges, was the case; he
                        was only afraid that he might not be able by his own unassisted strength to
                        make a stand against that tempest which we even, when supported by you, had
                        been unable to encounter. Then, my plans being thus suddenly changed, I
                        determined to proceed by land from Vibo to <placeName key="perseus,Brundusium">Brundusium</placeName>, for the severity of the
                        weather prevented any attempt at proceeding by sea. <milestone n="41" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="97" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>As all those municipal towns which are between Vibo and <placeName key="perseus,Brundusium">Brundusium</placeName> were in my interest, O
                        judges, they, though many people threatened me, and though they were in
                        great alarm themselves, rendered my journey safe to me. I arrived at
                            <placeName key="perseus,Brundusium">Brundusium</placeName>, or, I should
                        rather say, I arrived outside the walls. I avoided entering the city which
                        was of all others the most friendly to me and which would have allowed
                        itself to be destroyed before it would have permitted me to be torn from its
                        embrace. I went to the villa of Marcus Laenius Flaccus; and though he had
                        every sort of fear before his eyes,&mdash;though he was threatened with
                        confiscation of his property, and exile and death, yet he chose to encounter
                        all these things, if they were to happen rather than abandon the design of
                        protecting my life. I, placed by his hands and by those of his father, a
                        most sensible and virtuous man, and by those of his brother and both his
                        sons in a safe and trustworthy ship, and being escorted by their prayers and
                        vows for my return, departed thence to go to <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Dyrrachium</placeName>, which was devoted to my interests. <milestone n="98" unit="section"/> And when I had come thither, I
                        ascertained&mdash;as indeed I had heard before&mdash;that <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> was full of wicked and abandoned
                        men, whose impious weapons and destructive firebrands my consulship had
                        wrested from their hands. And before they could hear that I had arrived in
                        those districts, and although they were many days' journey from them, I
                        proceeded into <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> to
                        Plancius. But as <pb n="148"/> soon as ever Plancius heard that I had
                        crossed the sea.&mdash;(listen, listen, I say, and take notice, O
                        Laterensis, that you may know how much I owe to Plancius, and that you may
                        confess at last that what I am doing I am doing out of proper gratitude and
                        piously; and that the trouble which he took for my safety, if it is not to
                        do him any good, ought at all events not to be any injury to
                        him,)&mdash;as soon, I say, as he heard that I had arrived at <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Dyrrachium</placeName>, he immediately came to me
                        himself, without his lictors, without any of the insignia of his office, and
                        with his robe changed for one of morning. <milestone n="99" unit="section"/>

					<p>Oh, how bitter to me, O judges, is the recollection of that time and place,
                        when he fell on my neck, when he embraced me, and bedewed me with his tears,
                        and was unable to speak for grief! O circumstance cruel to be heard of, and
                        impious to be beheld! O all the remainder of those days and nights during
                        which he never left me, until he had conducted me to <placeName key="tgn,7011182">Thessalonica</placeName>, and to his official house as
                        quaestor! Here I will say nothing at present about the praetor of <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, beyond this, that he was always
                        a most excellent citizen, and a friend to me; but that he felt the same fear
                        that the rest did; and that Cnaeus Plancius was the only man&mdash;I
                        will not say, who had no such fear&mdash;but who, even if those things
                        were to happen which were dreaded, was willing to encounter and endure them
                        in my company and for my sake. <milestone n="100" unit="section"/> For even
                        when Lucius Tubero, my intimate friend, who had been lieutenant to my
                        brother, had come to me on his return from <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, and had revealed to me in the most friendly spirit
                        the treacherous designs which he heard were formed against me by the
                        banished conspirators, and when I was preparing therefore to go into
                            <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> on account of the
                        connection subsisting between that province and my brother and myself, he
                        would not allow me to depart. He, Plancius, I say, detained me by force and
                        by a close embrace, and for many months never departed from me, discarding
                        his character as a quaestor and assuming that of my companion. <milestone n="42" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="101" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>O what miserable nights of watching did you pass, O Cnaeus Plancius! O what
                        tearful vigils! O what bitter nights! O what a miserable task was that which
                        you undertook of protecting my life! if I, now that I am alive, am unable to
                        be of any service to you, though perhaps I might have been of some if I had
                        been dead. For I recollect, I <pb n="149"/> well recollect, and I never
                        shall forget, that night when I, miserable man that I was, and led on by
                        ungrounded hopes, made you who were watching over me, and sitting by me, and
                        lamenting, some vain and empty promises. I promised that, if I were restored
                        to my country, then I would in person show my gratitude; but, if chance
                        deprived me of life, or if any greater violence prevented my return, then I
                        undertook that these men, these whom we see here, (for what others could I
                        then be thinking of?) would make you a fitting return on my behalf, for all
                        your exertions. Why do you fix your eyes upon me now? Why do you claim the
                        performance of my promise? Why do you implore my observance of good faith? I
                        was not promising you at that time anything from my own resources, but from
                        the good-will of these men towards me. I saw that these men were mourning
                        for me; that they were groaning for me; that they were willing to do battle
                        in defence of my rights and safety, even at the hazard of their own
                        lives&mdash;I, as well as you, was hearing every day of the regret, and
                        grief, and complaints of these men; and now I fear that I may be able to
                        make you no other return beyond tears, of which you yourself shed plenty for
                        my distresses. <milestone n="102" unit="section"/> For what can I do more
                        than grieve? more than weep? more than consider your safety bound up with my
                        own? The same men who gave me safety are the only men who have the power to
                        give it to you. But I (rise up and stand forward, I beg you,) will cling to
                        you and embrace you; and I will profess myself, not only one who prays to
                        the judges to protect your fortunes, but one who will be your companion and
                        partner in them. And, as I hope, no one will be of so cruel and inhuman a
                        disposition, nor so unmindful&mdash;I will not say of the services which
                        I have done the good, but of the services which the good have done
                        me&mdash;as to tear away and separate the saviour of my very existence
                        as a citizen from me. I beg of you, O judges, to save a man who has been,
                        not loaded with kindnesses by me, but the guardian of my safety. I am not
                        striving in his behalf with wealth, and authority, and influence; but with
                        prayers, and tears, and appeals to your mercy. And his unhappy and most
                        virtuous father, whom you see before you, joins his entreaties to mine; we,
                        being as it were two parents of his, pray your mercy for our one son.

					<head>THE SPEECH OF M. T. CICERO IN DEFENCE OF PUBLIUS SESTIUS.</head>
					<argument>
						<head>THE ARGUMENT.</head>
						<p>Publius Sestius, when tribune of the people, had been one of those who
                            had exerted themselves most strenuously to promote Cicero's recall, and
                            had shown himself most devoted to his interest, though some coolness had
                            sprung up between them afterwards owing to Sestius's thinking that
                            Cicero was not sufficiently sensible of his obligations to him. Having,
                            however, become very obnoxious to all the friends of Catiline's party,
                            Clodius instigated Marcus Tullius Albonovanus to prosecute him on an
                            accusation of having been guilty of violence and breaches of the peace
                            during his tribunate and they both expected that Cicero would be neutral
                            in the cause, but he went of his own accord to Sestius, and offered to
                            undertake his defence. Pompeius attended this trial as a friend to
                            Sestius, but Caesar sent his friend Vatinius to give evidence against
                            him. (See the next speech.) </p>
						<p>This speech was delivered A. U. C. 698. </p>

					<p>If any one in times past, O judges, was used to wonder what was the reason
                        why in a republic of such power, and in an empire of such dignity, there
                        were not found any great number of citizens endowed with so fearless and
                        magnanimous a spirit as to dare to expose themselves and their personal
                        safety to danger on behalf of the constitution of the state and of the
                        general liberty; from henceforward he must wonder if he ever sees any
                        virtuous or intrepid citizens, rather than if he occasionally finds one
                        timid, and caring more for his own interests than for those of the republic.
                        For without calling to mind and considering the case of each separate
                        individual, you can see at one survey those men who joined the senate and
                        all virtuous citizens in raising up our afflicted country, and delivering it
                        from a horde of domestic robbers, now with sad countenances and mourning
                        garments struggling as defendants for their freedom, for their characters,
                        for their rights as citizens, for their fortunes, and for their children;
                        and those who have polluted, and attacked, and thrown into confusion, <pb n="152"/> and overturned all divine and human laws, going about the city
                        merry and joyful, and, while they are without any provocation, contriving
                        danger for the bravest and best of the citizens, in no fear whatever for
                        themselves. </p>
					<p><milestone n="2" unit="section"/> And though there is much that is scandalous
                        in such a state of things, yet is there nothing more intolerable than that
                        they now seek to employ not their bands of robbers, not men desperate
                        through want and wickedness, but you yourselves, the best men in the city,
                        for the purpose of bringing us and other most virtuous men into danger. And
                        they now think that, as they were unable to destroy them by stones, and
                        swords, and firebrands, by violence, and personal force, and armed bands,
                        they will be able to effect their purpose through the instrumentality of
                        your authority, your integrity, and your judicial decisions. </p>
					<p>But, O judges, since I am compelled now to exert that voice in order to ward
                        off danger from them, which I had hoped to be able to devote to returning
                        thanks to, and to commemorating the kindness of those men who have conferred
                        the greatest services on me, I entreat you to allow that voice to be useful
                        to them to whose exertions it is owing that it has been restored at all to
                        myself, and to you and to the Roman people. <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>And although the case of Publius Sestius has been summed up by Quintus
                        Hortensius, that most illustrious and most eloquent man; and though nothing
                        has been omitted by him which he could possibly urge either in the way of
                        complaint over the condition of the republic, or of argument for the
                        defendant; still I will come forward also to speak for him, lest my
                        exertions in defence should appear to be wanting to that man to whom it is
                        owing that they are not wanting to every one of the citizens. And I
                        consider, O judges, that in this case, and now speaking as I am at the close
                        of it, the part which belongs to me is to argue the matter on grounds of
                        affection, rather than to defend my client by an appeal to the strict law;
                        to employ complaints rather than eloquence, and to display my grief rather
                        than my ability. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> And, therefore, if I
                        plead with more vehemence or more freedom than those who have spoken before
                        me, I beg of you to listen to my speech with much indulgence, and to make
                        all the allowance for it that you think is due to pious grief and just <pb n="153"/> indignation. For no man's grief can be more intimately
                        connected with his duty than this present grief of mine, being caused as it
                        is by the peril of a man who has done me the greatest possible services. Nor
                        is any indignation more praiseworthy than that with which I am inflamed by
                        the wickedness of those men, who have thought it their business to declare
                        war against all the defenders of my safety. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> But since his other counsel have spoken of each separate charge, I will
                        speak of the entire state of the case as affecting Publius Sestius of his
                        conduct throughout his life of his natural disposition, of his habits, of
                        his incredible affection for all good men, of his zeal for the preservation
                        of the general safety and tranquillity; and I will endeavour&mdash;if it
                        be only possible for me to succeed&mdash;to prevent anything, in all
                        this miscellaneous and general defence, from appearing omitted by me which
                        has any connection either with this investigation before you, or with the
                        defendant, or with the republic. </p>
					<p>And since the tribuneship of Publius Sestius was placed by fortune itself in
                        the most critical period of the state, and amid the ruins of the overthrown
                        and prostrate republic, I will not approach those most important and serious
                        topics before I have first shown you by what beginnings, and on what
                        foundations, the great glory was built up which he gained under the most
                        trying circumstances. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>Publius Sestius, O judges, was born (as most of you know) of a wise and
                        conscientious and strict father, who, after he had been appointed as the
                        first tribune of the people among a number of most noble men and in a
                        prosperous time of the republic, was not so eager to obtain the other
                        honours of the state as to seem worthy of them. By the advice of that
                        father, he married the daughter of a most honourable and thoroughly tried
                        man Caius Albinus by whom he had this boy whom you see here, and a daughter
                        who is now married. My client was so highly esteemed by these two men of the
                        highest class of old-fashioned virtue, that he was beyond all things beloved
                        by and agreeable to both of them. The death of his daughter took away from
                        Albinus the name of his father-in-law, but it did not take away the
                        affection and good-will engendered by that connection. And to this very day
                        he is very fond of him, as you may judge by his constant attendance here,
                        and by his anxiety for him, and by his <pb n="154"/> frequent solicitations
                        to you on his behalf. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> He married a second
                        wife, while his father was still alive, the daughter of a most virtuous but
                        most unfortunate man, Caius<note anchored="yes">Caius Scipio, surnamed
                            Asiaticus, was proscribed by Sulla, and compelled to retire to
                                <placeName key="tgn,7008781">Marseilles</placeName> for
                            safety.</note> Scipio. And with respect to this man, the piety of
                        Publius was shown in a most remarkable way, and one acceptable to all men,
                        for he immediately went to <placeName key="tgn,7008781">Massilia</placeName><note anchored="yes">Now <placeName key="tgn,7008781">Marseilles</placeName>.</note> to see and comfort
                        his father-in-law, cast out as he was by the waves of the republic, lying in
                        a foreign land, a man who ought to have stood in the footsteps of his
                        ancestors. And he conducted his daughter to him, in order to induce him, by
                        that unexpected sight and embrace, to lay aside, if not all, at least some
                        part of his sorrow; and as long as he lived he supported with the most
                        unceasing attentions the sorrow of the father and the desolate condition of
                        his daughter. </p>
					<p>I might here say a great deal about his liberality, his attention to his
                        domestic duties, his conduct as military tribune, and his great moderation
                        in his province in the discharge of the duty of that magistracy; but I keep
                        always in my view the dignity of the republic, which summons me to the
                        consideration of herself, and exhorts me to pass over these minor points. </p>
					<p><milestone n="8" unit="section"/> My client, O judges, was indeed, by lot the
                        quaestor of Caius Antonius, my colleague, but by his sharing in all my
                        counsels he was in effect mine. I am prevented by scruples concerning the
                        pledge of confidence, as I interpret it, under which such duties are
                        performed, from explaining to you how much information he brought to me, and
                        what great foresight he displayed. And of Antonius I will only say this one
                        thing; that in that time of exceeding fear and danger to the state, he never
                        once attempted either to remove by any denial or to allay by any concealment
                        the general apprehensions of all men, or the especial suspicion conceived by
                        some persons with respect to himself. And if you were accustomed with truth,
                        while I was occupied in supporting and restraining that colleague of mine,
                        to praise my indulgence to him, united as it was with the greatest
                        watchfulness over the interests of the republic, almost equal praise ought
                        to be given to Publius Sestius, who kept such a watch on his own consul that
                        he <pb n="155"/> seemed to him to be a good quaestor, and to all of you to
                        be a most excellent citizen. <milestone n="4" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="9" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>Moreover, when that conspiracy had burst forth from its hiding place and from
                        darkness, and stalked about in arms through the city, he came with the army
                        to <placeName key="perseus,Capua">Capua</placeName>; which city we
                        suspected, on account of its exceeding resources and advantages in time of
                        war, was likely to have attempts made on it by that impious and wicked band.
                        And he drove Marcus Aulanus, a military tribune devoted to Antonius,
                        headlong out of <placeName key="perseus,Capua">Capua</placeName>; a
                        profligate man, and one who without much disguise had mixed in the intrigues
                        of the conspiracy at <placeName key="perseus,Pisaurum">Pisaurum</placeName>,
                        and in other parts of the Gallic territory. He also took care to get rid of
                        Caius Marcellus out of that city, after he had not only come to <placeName key="perseus,Capua">Capua</placeName>, but, as if from a fondness for
                        warlike arms, had frequently visited a very numerous troop of gladiators. On
                        which account that illustrious body of Roman settlers which is at <placeName key="perseus,Capua">Capua</placeName>, which, on account of the way in

                        me as their only patron, returned the greatest thanks to this Publius
                        Sestius, when he was at my house; and at this very time those same men,
                        changing only their name, and appearing as colonists, and
                        decurions,&mdash;most gallant and virtuous men that they
                        are!&mdash;come forward to give evidence, and to declare the services
                        done to them by Publius Sestius, and to inform you of their public vote
                        according to which they entreat you to protect him from danger. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>Read, I beg, O Publius Sestius, what the decurions<note anchored="yes">It has
                            been said before that <foreign lang="la">decuriones</foreign> was the

                        appears likely to be able to do when it has acquired strength. [The decree
                        of the decurions is read.] I am not having a decree read which has been
                        dictated by any obligations of neighbourhood, or clientship, or relation of
                        public hospitality, or which was passed because of a canvass for it, or
                        because of the recommendation of some powerful man. I am reciting to you the
                        expression of a recollection of dangers which have been passed through, the
                        declaration of a most honourable service done to a people, a present return
                        of <pb n="156"/> kindness, and a testimony of past events. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> And at that very time when Sestius had released
                            <placeName key="perseus,Capua">Capua</placeName> from fear, and the
                        senate and all good men, by the detection and crushing of all domestic
                        enemies, had, under my guidance, delivered the city from the greatest
                        dangers, I sent letters to summon him from <placeName key="perseus,Capua">Capua</placeName> with that army which he had at that time with him.
                        And the moment he had read the letters, he flew to the city with
                        inconceivable rapidity. And in order that you may thoroughly call to mind
                        the atrocity of those times, listen to the letters, and stir up your
                        memories to a contemplation of the time that is gone by. [The letters of

					<p>By this arrival of Publius Sestius, the attacks and attempts of the new
                        tribunes of the people, who then, in the last days of my consulship, were
                        endeavouring to give me trouble on account of the deeds which I had
                        performed, and all the over violent designs of the conspiracy, were checked.
                            <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> And after it was perceived that while
                        Cato, as tribune of the people, a most fearless and excellent citizen,
                        defended the republic, the senate and the Roman people by themselves,
                        without any assistance from the military, could easily uphold both their own
                        majesty and the dignity of those men who had defended the general safety at
                        their own personal risk, Sestius with that army of his followed Antonius
                        with the greatest possible rapidity. Here why need I mention by what conduct
                        he stirred up the consul to act with energy? or how many motives for
                        exertion he suggested to that man, desirous, perhaps, of victory, but still
                        too much afraid of the common dangers and chances of warfare and of battle?
                        That would be a very long story; but thus much I will say briefly. If the
                        courage of Marcus Petreius had not been most admirable; if his virtue in
                        state affairs had not been faultless; if his influence among the soldiers
                        had not been overpowering; if his experience in military affairs had not
                        been most surprising; and if, above all, Publius Sestius had not cooperated
                        with him in exciting, encouraging, reproving, and spurring on
                        Antonius,&mdash;winter would have overtaken them before the end of that
                        war, and Catiline, when he had emerged from those frosts and snows of the
                            <placeName key="tgn,7008531">Apennines</placeName>, and, having the
                        whole summer before him, had begun to plunder the roads of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> and the folds of the shepherds,
                        would never have been <pb n="157"/> destroyed without enormous bloodshed,
                        and most miserable devastation extending over the whole of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>These then were the feelings which Publius Sestius brought to his tribuneship
                        that I may forbear to speak of his quaestorship,&mdash;and come at last
                        to things nearer to ourselves. Although I must not omit to speak of that
                        singular integrity of his in the province of which I lately saw traces in
                            <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, not lightly
                        imprinted to celebrate something for a short time, but fixed in the
                        everlasting recollection of that province. But, however, we will pass over
                        all these things, though not with out turning back and fixing one last look
                        upon them. <milestone n="6" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>Let us come with eager zeal and rapid course to his tribuneship, since that
                        has been for some time inviting us to contemplate it, and since it occupies
                        a large portion of my speech. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> And that
                        tribuneship has already been spoken of by Quintus Hortensius in such a way
                        that his speech not only appears to contain a complete defence to every
                        count of the accusation, but would even be worth recollecting as laying down
                        admirable rules for the principles and system on which a man ought to
                        proceed in discharging the duties of a public office. But still since the
                        entire tribuneship of Publius Sestius did nothing but uphold my name and my
                        cause, I think it necessary for me, O judges, if not to discuss the whole
                        matter with precision at all events to speak of it in a tone of lamentation. </p>
					<p>And if while speaking on this subject I were inclined to inveigh against some
                        men with something like severity, who would not make allowance for my
                        attacking those men with some freedom of expression by whose wickedness and
                        frenzy I had myself been injured? But I will proceed with moderation, and I
                        will be guided rather by what is suitable to the present time than to my
                        indignation. If there be any people who secretly are vexed at my safety, let
                        them conceal themselves; if there be any who have at any time done anything
                        against me and who now are silent and quiet, let us also forget it; if there
                        be any who are puffed up to behave insolently, and who still wish to attack
                        me, we will bear with them as far as they can be borne with, nor shall my
                        language offend any one except those who so put themselves in my way that I
                        shall appear not to have attacked them, but to have run accidentally against
                        them. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/>

                    </p>
					<p>But it is necessary, before I begin to speak of the tribuneship of Publius
                        Sestius, to lay before you all the circumstances of the shipwreck of the
                        republic the preceding year; to the repairing which, and to the restoration
                        of the general safety all the words, and actions, and thoughts of Publius
                        Sestius will be found to have been devoted. <milestone n="7" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>That year, the whole republic being in a state of great commotion, and many
                        people being in just fear, had been like a bow bent against me alone, as men
                        ignorant of state affairs used commonly to say; but in reality against the
                        whole republic, by the transference to the common people of a furious and
                        profligate man, angry with me, but a far more zealous enemy to tranquillity
                        and the general safety. This man, that most illustrious of citizens, and,
                        though many tried to alienate him from me, most friendly to me, Cnaeus
                        Pompeius, had bound by every sort of security, and promise, and oath to do
                        nothing during his tribuneship contrary to my interest. But that wicked man,
                        sprung as it were from the very dregs of every sort of wickedness, thought
                        that he should not be doing enough in the way of violating his engagements,
                        unless he terrified the man who was so eager to guard against danger for
                        another, by personal danger to himself. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/>This foul and savage brute, hampered as he was by the <foreign lang="la">auspices</foreign>, tied down by the precedents of our ancestors,
                        fettered by the bonds of holy laws, was on a sudden released by the
                            consul,<note anchored="yes">There is great reason to think that there is
                            some corruption here.</note> who, as I imagine, was either won over by
                        entreaties, or, as many people thought, influenced by hostility to me, and
                        to at all events was ignorant and unsuspicious of the impending crimes and
                        misfortunes. And that tribune of the people, if he was successful in his
                        design of throwing the republic into confusion, did not owe it to any energy
                        of his own. For what energy could there be in the life of a man maddened by
                        the infamy of his brother, by his own adultery with his sister, and by every
                        sort of unheard-of licentiousness? <milestone n="17" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>But that, forsooth, did seem like a fortune appointed for the republic by
                        fate itself, that that blind and senseless tribune of the people should find
                        two&mdash;must I call them consuls? must I honour by this name the
                        overthrowers of this empire, the betrayers of your dignity, the enemies of

                        crushing the equestrian order, and extinguishing all the rights and
                        established principles of our ancestors. And, I beg you in the name of the
                        immortal gods, if you do not yet wish to recall their wickedness and the
                        wounds which they have burnt into the republic, still turn your recollection
                        to their countenances and their gait. Their actions will more easily present
                        themselves to your minds if you bring their faces before your eyes.

                        such great gravity was in his eye, such a contraction was there of his
                        forehead, that the whole republic appeared to be resting on that brow, as
                        the heavens do on Atlas. <milestone n="20" unit="section"/> This was the
                        common conversation of every one: &ldquo;He is, however, a great and
                        firm support to the republic; we have some one to oppose to that pollution,
                        to that mud; I declare solemnly by his mere look he will check the
                        licentiousness and levity of his colleague; the senate will have some one
                        this year whom it can follow; good men will not be in want of an adviser and
                        a leader this year.&rdquo; And men congratulated me most especially,
                        because I was likely to have not only a friend and connection, but also a
                        fearless and dignified consul as an ally against a frantic and audacious
                        tribune of the people. <milestone n="9" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>And as to one of them, no one was mistaken in him; for who could suppose it
                        possible for a man rising suddenly from the long darkness of brothels and
                        scenes of debauchery in which he had lain, to hold the helm of so vast an
                        empire, and to undertake the guidance of the republic in so important a
                        voyage, amid such threatening waves?&mdash;a man worn out with wine and
                        gluttony, and lewdness and adultery?&mdash;a man who, beyond his hopes,
                        had been placed in the highest rank through the influence of others, when
                        his drunken eyes were unable not merely to gaze on the impending storm, but
                        even to stand any unusual glare of light? <milestone n="21" unit="section"/>
                        But the other did deceive many men in every point; for he was recommended to
                        men's favourable opinion by the fact of his high birth, which is of itself a
                        very powerful recommendation, for all virtuous men naturally look with
                        favour on noble birth, both because it is advantageous for the republic that
                        nobly born men should be worthy of their ancestors, and because the
                        recollection of men who are illustrious, and who have deserved well of the
                        republic, has its influence over us even after they are dead. And because
                        men saw him always morose, always taciturn, always neglectful of his
                        appearance and coarse-looking, and because his name was such that frugality
                        appeared a quality innate in his family, they favoured him, and rejoiced,
                        and in their hopes called him a man fashioned after the model of the
                        integrity of his ancestors, forgetting the family of his mother. <milestone n="22" unit="section"/> But I, (I will tell the plain truth, O
                        judges,)&mdash;I myself never thought that there could be so much
                        wickedness, audacity, <pb n="161"/> and cruelty in any man as, to my own
                        cost and that of the republic, I have experienced that there was in him. I
                        knew the man was worthless inconsistent and that it was a pure mistake that
                        made men think well of him deceived by the appearance of his youth. His
                        disposition, in truth, was concealed by his countenance, and his vices
                        within walls, but this sort of disguise is never continued, nor so well
                        maintained that it cannot be seen through by inquisitive eyes. <milestone n="10" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>We saw the course of his life his indolence and sloth; those who were in the
                        least acquainted with him saw his secret licentiousness. Moreover, he gave
                        us, by his conversation, plenty of handles to enable us to grasp and
                        comprehend his inmost feelings. <milestone n="23" unit="section"/> Being a
                        very learned man, he used to praise philosophers,&mdash;I don't know
                        which, and indeed he could not tell their names himself;&mdash;but still
                        he used to praise those above all others who were said to be beyond all the
                        rest the admirers and panegyrists of pleasures: of what sort of
                        pleasure,&mdash;of pleasure enjoyed at what times and in what manner he
                        never inquired but the name itself he devoured with all the energy of his
                        mind and body. And he used to say that those same philosophers were right
                        when they said that wise men do everything for the sake of themselves, that
                        no man in his senses has any business to trouble himself about the
                        government of the republic; that nothing is better than a life of ease, full
                        of, and loaded with, all sorts of pleasures and he used to say that those
                        men who said that men ought to regard their own dignity, and to consult the
                        interests of the republic, and to have a regard in every action of life to
                        duty and not to advantage, that men ought to undergo dangers on behalf of
                        their country, and to encounter wounds and to seek even death for its sake,
                        were crazy and mad. <milestone n="24" unit="section"/> And from these
                        incessant and daily conversations of his, and because I saw who the men were
                        with whom he lived in the more retired part of his house, and because his
                        house itself (as I may say) smoked so as to emit a steam from his discourse,
                        and to show what he was about, I made up my mind that nothing good was to be
                        looked for from such a trifler; but at the same time certainly that no evil
                        need be feared. But the fact is, O judges, that, if you give a sword to a
                        little child, or to a powerless and decrepit old man, he himself by his own
                        violence cannot injure any one, but still if the sword touches the <pb n="162"/> naked body of even the strongest man, it is possible that he
                        may be wounded by the mere sharpness and power of the weapon; in like
                        manner, when the consulship had been given as a sword to enervated and
                        worn-out men, who, of their own strength, would never be able to wound any
                        one, they, armed with the name of supreme command, murdered the republic.
                        They openly made a treaty with the tribune of the people, to receive from
                        him whatever provinces they chose, and an army, and as much money as they
                        chose, on this condition,&mdash;that they themselves were the first to
                        hand over the afflicted republic in fetters to the tribune. And they thought
                        that that treaty could be ratified in my blood. <milestone n="25" unit="section"/> And when this matter was divulged, (for such enormous
                        wickedness could not be dissembled or hidden for any length of time,)
                        motions are proposed at one and the same time by the same tribune,
                        concerning my destruction and concerning the provinces of the consuls,
                        allotting them to each of them by name. <milestone n="11" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>On this, the senate being anxious, you knights being in a state of great
                        excitement, all <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> being
                        agitated,&mdash;in short, all citizens of every sort and of every rank,
                        thought that they must seek help for the republic from the consuls and from
                        the supreme power, while they were the only men, besides that frantic
                        tribune,&mdash;those two whirlwinds (so to say) of the
                        republic,&mdash;who not only did not come to the assistance of their
                        falling country, but who even grieved that it was falling so slowly. They
                        were every day solicited both by the complaints of all good men, and by the
                        direct entreaties of the senate, to undertake my cause, to act on my behalf,
                        and to bring some proposition before the senate. They attacked all the most
                        eminent men of that body, not only refusing their request but even laughing
                        at it. <milestone n="26" unit="section"/> But when on a sudden an incredible
                        multitude from the whole city, and from all <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, had assembled at the Capitol, they all decided that
                        they should put on mourning garments and defend me in every possible way by
                        their private resources, since the republic was destitute for the time of
                        its public leaders. At the same time the senate was assembled in the temple
                        of Concord, a temple which of itself recalled the recollection of my
                        consulship, when the whole body in tears addressed this curled consul with
                        entreaties; for the other rough and fierce-looking one was keeping himself
                        at home on purpose. With what haughtiness did <pb n="163"/> that filthy
                        fellow, that pest of the republic, reject the prayers of that most
                        honourable body, and the tears of the most illustrious citizens. How did
                        that glutton and devourer of his country scorn me! For why should I say
                        devourer of his patrimony, which he lost while engaged in some sort of
                        trade? You, I say,&mdash;you, O Roman knights,&mdash;you and all
                        virtuous men changed your garments, and in the cause of my safety threw
                        yourselves at the feet of that most profligate debauchee. You and your
                        prayers were alike trampled on by that robber. A man of extraordinary
                        integrity, magnanimity, wisdom, and firmness, Lucius Ninnius made a motion
                        to the senate concerning the republic and the senate in a full house passed
                        a resolution that they should change their garments for my safety.

					<p>Alas for that day, O judges, fatal to the senate and to all good men!
                        grievous to the republic! bitter for me as far as my domestic grief was
                        concerned, but glorious as relates to my fame in the eyes of posterity. For
                        what since the first beginning of human memory, can any one produce more
                        splendid than for all good men by their own tacit agreement as individuals
                        and for the whole senate by public resolution to have changed their garments
                        and put on mourning for the sake of a single citizen? And that change of
                        dress was not adopted at that time for the sake of averting a calamity from
                        me by entreaty, but to show their grief at that which had befallen me. For
                        to whom could they address their entreaties, when all were in mourning
                        alike, and when the fact of a man's not having changed his dress was a
                        sufficient proof of his being an ill-disposed person? After this change of
                        garments had taken place, and while the city was in such grief, I say
                        nothing of what that tribune, that plunderer of all things both human and
                        divine, proceeded to do; a fellow who ordered all the most noble youths, and
                        the most honourable Roman knights who were eager to entreat him to ensure my
                        safety, to attend at his house, and who then exposed them to the swords and
                        stones of his troop of artisans. I am speaking now of the consuls, on whose
                        good faith the republic had a right to rely. <milestone n="28" unit="section"/> Frightened out of his wits, he flies from the senate
                        with a mind and countenance less agitated than it would have been a few
                        years before, if he had fallen in with a crowd of his creditors. He convenes
                        an assembly. He, the consul, addresses them in such a speech as even
                        Catiline himself, <pb n="164"/> if he had been victorious, would never have
                        delivered. He said &ldquo;that men were greatly mistaken if they thought
                        that the senate had any power in the republic; and that the Roman knights
                        should suffer severely for that day on which, in my consulship, they had

                        worthy of the last extremity of punishment; for a mischievous speech of a
                        consul can of itself undermine the republic. But see now what he did.
                            <milestone n="29" unit="section"/> In that assembly he banished Lucius
                        Lamia, who was exceedingly attached to me on account of the exceeding
                        intimacy which subsisted between me and his brother and his father, and who
                        was also willing to encounter even death itself for the sake of the
                        republic; and issued an edict that he should remove two hundred miles from
                        the city because he had dared to address solicitations to him on behalf of a
                        citizen,&mdash;of a citizen who had deserved well of the state, and who
                        was his own friend,&mdash;and on behalf of the republic. <milestone n="13" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>What can you do with this man? or for what punishment can you reserve this
                        profligate citizen,&mdash;I should rather say this impious enemy? who,
                        to pass over other particulars of his character, and other actions which
                        belong to him in common with his infamous and savage colleague, has this one
                        thing to boast of peculiar to himself, that he expelled from the city and
                        banished (I will not say a Roman knight, I will not say a most accomplished
                        and virtuous man, I will not say a citizen deeply attached to the republic,
                        I will not say a man who was only joining his own lamentations for the
                        calamity of his friend and of the republic to those of the senate and of all
                        good men; it is enough to say that)&mdash;he, the consul, banished a
                        Roman citizen without any trial, by his own simple edict. <milestone n="30" unit="section"/> The Latin allies had never anything worse to submit to
                        than (and it was a case of very rare occurrence) the being ordered by the
                        consul to depart from the city. And they had the power then of returning to
                        their own cities, to their own household gods; and in that general disaster
                        no peculiar ignominy was attached by name to any single individual. But what
                        is the case here? Is the consul to banish, by his edict, Roman citizens from
                        their household gods? is he to <pb n="165"/> expel them from their country?
                        is he to select whom he pleases? to condemn and banish men by name? If he
                        had supposed that you, who are now sitting here, would continue to exist in
                        the republic,&mdash;if he had supposed that any image of the courts of
                        justice would remain or that there would be the least vestige of the old
                        constitution left in the state would he even have dared to wipe the senate
                        out of the republic in this way? to reject the prayers of the Roman knights?
                        in short, to overturn the rights and liberties of all the citizens by new
                        and unheard of edicts? <milestone n="31" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>Although you are listening to me, O judges, with the greatest attention, and
                        with exceeding kindness, still I fear that some of you may, perchance,
                        marvel why I am so prolix, and what is my object in tracing things back so
                        far, or what connection the offences of those men who harassed the republic
                        before the tribuneship of Publius Sestius have with his cause now. But my
                        desire is to show that all the counsels of Publius Sestius, and the whole
                        object of his tribuneship, was to remedy the misfortunes of the afflicted
                        and ruined republic as far as was in his power. And pardon me, if in laying
                        open those wounds, I appear to say rather too much about myself; for you and
                        all good men decided that that disaster which befell me was the heaviest
                        possible blow to the republic. And Publius Sestius is now on his trial, not
                        on his own account, but on mine &mdash;for as he devoted all the powers
                        of his tribuneship to the promotion of my safety it is inevitable that I
                        should look upon my own cause in past time as united with the defence which
                        I am now making for him. <milestone n="14" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="32" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>The senate then was in grief, the city wore an appearance of mourning, its
                        garments having been changed in accordance with the public resolution of the
                        senate. There was no municipal town in all <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, no colony, no prefecture, no company of men
                        concerned in farming the public revenues, no guild or council,&mdash;no

                        most honourable resolutions concerning my safety, when all on a sudden the
                        two consuls issue an edict that the senators are to return to their former
                        dress. What consul ever prohibited the senate from obeying its own decrees?
                        What tyrant ever forbade men who were miserable to mourn? Is it a small
                        thing, O Piso,&mdash;for I will say nothing about Gabinius, that you
                        have deceived men to such a degree as to disregard the authority of the
                        senate? to <pb n="166"/> despise the advice of every virtuous man? to betray
                        the republic? to crush a citizen of consular rank? that you must dare also
                        to issue an edict that men are not to mourn for a disaster affecting me, and
                        themselves, and the republic, and are not to show their grief by changing
                        their garments? Whether that change of garment was assumed as a token of
                        grief, or as a form of solicitation, who ever was so cruel before as to
                        forbid any one mourning for himself, or entreating for others? <milestone n="33" unit="section"/> What? Are not men accustomed of their own accord
                        to change their garments on the occasion of danger to their friends? Is
                        there no one who will change it ever for you, O Piso? will not even those
                        men do so whom you have appointed as your lieutenants, not only without any
                        resolution of the senate to authorize such a step, but even in defiance of a
                        vote of that body? shall, then, whoever pleases mourn for the misfortune of
                        a desperate man, of a traitor to the commonwealth, and shall not the senate
                        be allowed to mourn for the danger of a citizen, strong above all men in the
                        good-will of all virtuous men, who has deserved admirably well of his
                        country, which he has saved, especially when with his danger is combined
                        danger to the whole state? </p>
					<p>Those same consuls, (if, indeed, it is proper to call those men consuls who,
                        every one thinks, deserve not only to be eradicated from men's memories, but
                        to have their names erased from the consular registers,) after the treaty
                        about the provinces had been ratified, being brought forward to the assembly
                        in the Flaminian Circus by that fury and pest of his country, amid universal

                        and Fufian laws should have no validity. And who is there who can fail to

                        destroyed? <milestone n="34" unit="section"/> In the presence and sight of
                        these same consuls, a levy of slaves was held before the tribunal of
                        Aurelius, under pretence of filling up the guilds, when men were enrolled
                        according to their streets, and divided into decuries, and stirred up to
                        violence, and battle, and slaughter, and plunder. It was while these same
                        men were consuls, that arms were openly carried into the temple of Castor,
                        and the steps of the temple were pulled up; armed men occupied the forum and
                        the assemblies of the people; slaughters and stonings of people took place;
                        there was no senate, no magistrates were left; one man by arms and piratical
                        violence seized on all the power of all the magistrates not by any power of
                        his own, but having bribed the two consuls to desert the republic by the
                        treaty respecting the provinces, he insulted every one, domineered over
                        every one, made promises to some held down many by terror and fear and
                        gained over more by hope and promises. </p>

                        away by terror and danger,&mdash;when the temples were full of arms and
                        the forum of armed men; and when those facts were not concealed by the
                        silence of the consuls, but were openly approved of by them by their
                        speeches and their formal decision,&mdash;when we all of us saw the city
                        not yet perhaps razed and destroyed, but at all events already stormed and
                        in the power of the enemy,&mdash;nevertheless relying on the exceeding
                        zeal of the virtuous part of the citizens, we would have resisted, O judges,
                        even these enormous evils. <milestone n="16" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="36" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>But there were other grounds for fear, and other reasons for anxiety and
                        suspicion, O judges, which influenced me at that time. For I will explain to
                        you this day, O judges, all the principles of my conduct and of my designs;
                        and I will not be wanting to your great desire of hearing the truth, nor to
                        this multitude, the greatest which within my recollection, has ever appeared
                        in any court of justice. For if I, in so good a cause, when supported so
                        zealously by the senate, and by such an inconceivable unanimity on the part
                        of all <pb n="168"/> virtuous men, ready to act in my behalf, and when all
                            <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> was stirred up and braced
                        for the contest,&mdash;yielded to the fury of a tribune of the people,
                        one of the most despicable of men; if I was afraid of the trifling but
                        audacious characters of those most contemptible consuls, then I should be
                        forced to confess that I was too timid, that I was a man of no courage, of
                        no decision, and of no wisdom. <milestone n="37" unit="section"/> For what
                        was there in the case of Quintus Metellus similar to mine? Although all good
                        men considered that he had right on his side, yet the senate did not espouse
                        his cause by any public resolution, nor did any separate body of men by any
                        private vote, nor had all <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>
                        undertaken the advocacy of his cause by their decrees. For he had shown
                        greater regard for some sort of private credit of his own, than for the
                        manifest welfare of the republic, when he alone had refused to swear to a
                        law which had been passed by means of violence; and lastly, his great
                        bravery appeared to be exercised with this qualification, that his own
                        credit for consistency was not to be sacrificed to his affection for his
                        country. But he had to contend against the invincible army of Caius Marius;
                        he had for an enemy Caius Marius, the preserver of his country, now for the
                        sixth time administering the affairs of the republic as consul. He had to
                        contend against Lucius Saturninus, now for a second time tribune of the
                        people; a vigilant man, and one who in a popular cause conducted himself, if
                        not with moderation, at all events with due regard to the prejudices of the
                        people, and in a very disinterested spirit. He yielded, lest, being
                        conquered by brave men, he should fall disgracefully, or lest, if conqueror
                        himself, he should deprive the republic of many gallant citizens. </p>
					<p><milestone n="38" unit="section"/> But my cause was embraced openly by the

                        by all good men with the greatest earnestness, as if it were their own
                        personal quarrel. I had performed achievements with regard to which I had
                        not been the sole originator of them, but the leader of the universal
                        inclination of all the citizens; and which were designed to promote not my

                        almost say of all nations. And I had performed them in such a manner that

                        <milestone n="17" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>And I had to contend not against a victorious army, but against a lot of
                        hired artisans, men excited with the hope of plundering the city. I had for
                        an enemy,&mdash;not Caius Marius, the terror of our enemies, the hope
                        and support of his country,&mdash;but two ill-omened monsters whom want
                        and the immensity of their debts and fickleness and a wicked disposition,
                        had delivered over to the tribune of the people as his slaves. <milestone n="39" unit="section"/> Nor had I to contend against Saturninus, who was
                        seeking to satisfy his own indignation with great earnestness of mind,
                        because he knew that the superintendence of the import of provisions had
                        been, as an intentional insult, transferred from him while he was quaestor
                        at <placeName key="perseus,Ostia">Ostia</placeName>, to the chief man both
                        of the senate and of the city, Marcus Scaurus. But I had to struggle with
                        the debauched favourite of wealthy buffoons, with the adulterer of his
                        sister, with the very high-priest of lewdness, with a poisoner, with a
                        forger of wills, with an assassin, with a robber; and if&mdash;as was
                        very easy to be done, as ought to have been done, and as many most virtuous
                        and brave citizens entreated me to do&mdash;I had overcome those men by
                        force and arms, I had no reason to fear that any one would reprove me for
                        having repelled force by force, or grieve for the death of those abandoned
                        citizens, or, as I should rather call them, domestic enemies. But these were
                        the things which had weight with me. That Fury was in the habit of crying
                        out in all the assemblies that all the things which he was doing to the
                        prejudice of my safety, he was doing with the approval of Cnaeus Pompeius a
                        most illustrious man, and both then and now a most intimate friend of mine
                        as far as he was able to show himself such. Marcus Crassus a most gallant
                        man with whom I had every imaginable intimacy of friendship, was announced
                        by that same pest to be most hostile to my fortunes. Caius Caesar, who had
                        no right to he alienated from me as far as any action of mine could have
                        deserved such feelings on his part, was constantly stated by the same man in
                        his daily harangues to be a most determined enemy to my safety. <milestone n="40" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>These three men he said he was going to avail himself of as his advisers in
                        forming all his plans, and as his assistants in all his actions: of whom he
                        said that one had the most numerous army in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>; and that the other two, who were private men at that
                        time, could easily get an army a-piece if <pb n="170"/> they chose, and that
                        they would do so. And while he menaced me, he threatened me, not with a
                        judicial decision of the people, nor with any legal or legitimate sort of
                        contest, nor with any discussion or regular trial of our dispute, but with
                        violence, and arms, and armies, and generals, and camps. <milestone n="18" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>What then? Did the harangue of an enemy, especially so foolish a one as that,
                        and aimed as it was so wickedly against the most illustrious men, move me?
                        No. It was not his speech, but the silence of those men against whom that
                        most infamous speech was directed that influenced me. For
                        they&mdash;although the real cause of their silence was quite a
                        different one&mdash;appeared, nevertheless, to men who were afraid of
                        everything, by their very silence to speak, and by their forbearing to deny
                        his assertions, to confess them. </p>
					<p><milestone n="41" unit="section"/> But they, being then under the influence
                        of excessive fear, because they thought that those actions and all the
                        events of the preceding year were being undermined by the praetors, and
                        annulled by the senate and by the chief men of the city, were unwilling to
                        alienate a popular tribune of the people from their interests, and were in
                        the habit of saying that their own dangers touched them more nearly than
                        mine. But still Crassus said that my cause ought to be undertaken by the
                        consuls, and Pompeius implored the aid of their good faith; and he said that
                        he, though a private individual, would not desert the cause which was taken
                        up by public authority. And as he was most anxious for my welfare, and eager
                        beyond measure for the preservation of the republic, certain men, trained
                        for that purpose, warned him to be more careful; and said that a plot was
                        laid against his life, to be carried into execution in my house; and they
                        kept this suspicion alive in him, some by letters, some by messengers, some
                        by coming and talking to him about it; so that he, though most certainly he
                        had no fear of me, yet thought it necessary to guard against them, lest they
                        should attempt anything against him and lay the blame on me. But Caesar
                        himself, who those men, ignorant of the truth, thought was angry with me
                        most especially, was at the gates, was in military command; his army was in
                            <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, and in that army he had
                        appointed to a command the brother of that very tribune of the people, my
                        enemy. <milestone n="19" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="42" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>When I saw all this (for there was no secret about it), that the senate,
                        without which the constitution could not <pb n="171"/> stand, was entirely
                        abolished out of the city; that the consuls whose duty it was to be the
                        leaders of the public counsels, had so managed matters that by their means
                        the great public council was entirely destroyed; that those men who had the
                        greatest influence were held up to every assembly, (falsely indeed, but
                        still in a way calculated to strike my friends with great fear,) as the
                        great approvers of my ruin; that assemblies were held every day in
                        opposition to me; that no one ever uttered a word in defence of me or of the
                        republic that the standards of the legions were believed to be unfurled
                        against your lives and properties, (falsely indeed, but still they were
                        believed to be so,) that the veteran troops of the conspirators, and that
                        ill-omened army of Catiline, once routed and defeated, was now recruited
                        under a new leader and under the existing unexpected chances of
                        circumstances;&mdash;when I saw all these things, what was I to do, O
                        judges? <milestone n="43" unit="section"/> For I know well that at that time
                        it was not your zeal that was wanting to me, but more nearly my energy that
                        was wanting to second your zeal. Was I, a private individual, to struggle in
                        arms against a tribune of the people? No doubt the good would have defeated
                        the wicked, the brave would have defeated the inactive; he would have been
                        slain who could by no other remedy be prevented from being the ruin of the
                        republic. What would have happened next? What would have become of the
                        remains of his party? What would have been the end? Was there any doubt that
                        the blood of the tribune especially when not shed in consequence of any
                        public resolution would have had the consuls for its avengers? especially
                        when we recollect that that fellow had said in the public assembly that I
                        must either perish once or be victorious twice. What was the meaning of my
                        having to conquer twice? Why no doubt that after I had struggled against
                        that most senseless tribune of the people, I should have to struggle with
                        the consuls and with all those who would avenge him. But for
                            myself,&mdash;<milestone n="44" unit="section"/>if I alone was to
                        have perished, and if that incurable and deadly wound would not also have
                        been inevitably inflicted on the republic, with which he threatened
                        it&mdash;I should have preferred at that time, O judges, to perish once
                        rather than conquer twice. For that second struggle would have been such,
                        that whether we were conquered or conquerors, we should have been alike
                        unable to preserve the republic. What would have <pb n="172"/> happened if
                        in the first struggle, being overcome by the violence of the tribune, I had
                        fallen in the forum, with many virtuous citizens? The consuls, I imagine,
                        would have convened the senate, which they had already expunged from the
                        state; they would summon men to arms who had decided that the republic
                        should not be upheld, no not even by a change of garments; they would, no
                        doubt, have been sure to revolt from the tribune of the people after my
                        death, who had intended the same hour to be that of my ruin and of their own
                        reward! <milestone n="20" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="45" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>That one thing remained for me which, perhaps, some men of bold, and
                        energetic, and magnanimous mind will say,&mdash;&ldquo;You should
                        have struggled, you should have resisted, you should have fought to the
                        death.&rdquo; With respect to which idea, I call you to witness, you my
                        country, and you, O household gods, and gods of my country, that it was for
                        the sake of your abodes and temples, that it was on account of the safety of
                        my own fellow-citizens, which has always been dearer to me than my own life,
                        that I avoided combat and bloodshed. In truth, O judges, if it had happened
                        to me when I was sailing in some ship with my friends, that many pirates
                        coming from many parts threatened to overwhelm that vessel with their
                        fleets, unless they surrendered me alone to them; if the crew had refused to
                        do so, and had preferred rather to perish with me than to surrender me to
                        the enemy, I should have thrown myself into the sea in order to save the
                        rest, rather than bring those who were so devoted to me, if not to certain
                        death, at all events into great danger of their lives. </p>
					<p><milestone n="46" unit="section"/> But when, after the helm had been wrested
                        from the senate, so many armed fleets appeared ready to attack the vessel of
                        the republic, tossed about on the deep by the tempests of sedition and
                        discord, unless I alone were surrendered; when proscription, and plunder,
                        and massacre were threatened; when some stood aloof from defending me from
                        suspicion that their doing so might bring themselves into danger, and some
                        were prompted by their long-standing hatred of all good men, and some envied
                        me, and some thought that I was in their way, and some wished to revenge
                        some grief or other which they had suffered, and some were influenced by
                        hatred of the republic itself, and of the present state and tranquillity of
                        good men, and on account of all these numerous and <pb n="175"/> various
                        causes were demanding me alone to be given up to them,&mdash;was I to
                        fight against them to the extreme, I will not say destruction, but danger at
                        all events, of you and your children, rather than by myself encounter and
                        endure on behalf of all that evil which was impending over all? <milestone n="21" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="47" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>No doubt the wicked would have been defeated. Still they would have been
                        citizens and they would have been defeated by that man as a private
                        individual, who as consul, without any appeal to arms, had preserved the
                        republic. But suppose the good men had been defeated, what would have
                        remained? Do not you see that the state would have fallen into the hands of
                        the slaves? Was even I myself as some people think to encounter death with
                        entire equanimity? What? Was I at that time seeking to avoid death? or was
                        there anything which I could think more desirable for myself, or at the very
                        time that I was accomplishing these great exploits amid that multitude of
                        wicked men, were not death and exile constantly present to my eyes? Were not
                        these very events, even at the moment of my performance of those exploits,
                        prophesied as it were by me as parts of my destiny? Or was life worth
                        preserving at a time when all my family and friends were in such grief when
                        there was such confusion such misery such destruction of everything which
                        either nature or fortune had given me? Was I so stupid? so ignorant of
                        affairs? so destitute of all sense and all ability? Had I heard nothing? Had
                        I seen nothing? Had I learnt nothing myself by reading or by inquiry? Was I
                        ignorant that the duration of life is brief, that of glory everlasting?
                        that, as death was appointed for all men, it was desirable that life, which
                        must some day or other be given up to necessity, should appear to have been
                        made a present of to one's country rather than reserved for the claim of
                        nature? Was I ignorant that there had been this dispute between the wisest
                        men? that some said that the souls and senses of men were extinguished by
                        death; but that others thought that the minds of wise and brave men were
                        then in the greatest degree sensible and vigorous when they had departed
                        from the body? And one of these alternatives would seem to show, that to be
                        deprived of feeling was not a thing to be avoided; the other alternative
                        must evidently be very desirable, to become possessed of a more perfect
                        sensation. <milestone n="48" unit="section"/>
                        <pb n="174"/>
                    </p>
					<p>Lastly, as I had always considered everything with reference to what was
                        becoming, and had never thought anything in life desirable if unaccompanied
                        by propriety, was I, a man of consular rank, who had performed such great
                        deeds, likely to be afraid of death, which even Athenian maidens, daughters
                        I fancy of king Erectheus, are said to have despised in the cause of their
                        country? Especially when I was a member of that city from which Mucius went
                        forth when he penetrated,&mdash;by himself, into the camp of king
                        Porsena, and endeavoured to slay him, at the imminent risk of his own life;
                        from which, in the first instance, Decius the father, and many years
                        afterwards his son, endowed with his father's virtue, went forth when, while
                        their armies were drawn up in battle array, they devoted themselves and
                        their own lives to ensure the safety and victory of the Roman army; from
                        which a countless host of others besides have gone forth, and with the
                        greatest equanimity have encountered death, some for the sake of gaining
                        glory, and some with the object of encountering disgrace; and while I,
                        myself, remember that in this city the father of this Marcus Crassus, a most
                        gallant man, put himself to death with that same hand with which he had
                        often scattered death among the enemy, that he might not live to see his
                        enemy victorious. <milestone n="22" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="49" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>Influenced by these and many other considerations, I saw that, if my death
                        were the destruction of the common cause of the state, no one would ever
                        live who would venture to undertake the defence of the safety of the
                        republic against wicked citizens. Therefore, I feared that the result would
                        be, not only if I were put to death by violence, but even if I died from
                        natural causes, that the example of a man labouring for the preservation of
                        the republic would perish with me. For if, while all good men were so eager
                        for it, I were not restored by the senate and people of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, (and most unquestionably that could
                        never have happened if I had been killed first,) who would ever dare
                        afterwards to encounter the very slightest unpopularity for the sake of
                        having anything to do with the affairs of the republic? I, therefore, saved
                        the republic, O judges, by my departure. At the expense of my own grief and
                        misery I averted slaughter, and devastation, and conflagration, and plunder,
                        from you and from your children. And I, by myself, twice saved the republic
                        once with glory, once <pb n="175"/> with misery. That I will never so far
                        deny that I have the feelings of a man as to boast that I felt no grief when
                        I was deprived of my most excellent brother, of my most beloved children, of
                        my most faithful wife, of the sight of you, my fellow-citizens, of my
                        country, and of my rank as a senator. If those had been my feelings, what
                        obligation would you be under to me, if for your sake I had only abandoned
                        those things which I considered of no value? This, in my opinion, ought to
                        be considered by you a most certain token of my exceeding devotion to my
                        country, that though I could not be absent from her without the deepest
                        grief, yet I preferred to endure this grief, rather than to allow her to be
                        destroyed by wicked citizens. <milestone n="50" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>I recollected, O judges, that that godlike man, sprung from the same district
                        as myself, for the preservation of this empire, Caius Marius, in extreme old
                        age, when he had escaped from violence little short of a pitched battle,
                        first of all hid his aged body up to his neck in the marshes and from thence
                        crossed over in a very little boat to the most desolate regions of
                            <placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>, avoiding all harbours
                        and all inhabited countries. And he preserved his own life, that he might
                        not fall unavenged, for the most uncertain hopes, but still for his country.
                        Should not I, who (as many men in the senate said during my absence) had the
                        safety of the republic bound up with my life, and who on that account was by
                        the public order of the senate, recommended by the letters of the consuls to
                        the protection of foreign nations,&mdash;should not I, I say, have been
                        betraying the republic if I had neglected the preservation of my own life?
                        In the city now since I have been restored there lives in my person an
                        example of the public good faith, an instance of its being worth men's while
                        to defend the republic. And if this example is preserved for ever who is
                        there who can fail to see that this city will be immortal? <milestone n="23" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="51" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>For the foreign wars waged against us by foreign kings, countries, and
                        nations, have long been so completely put down, that they are treating them,
                        to our own great credit, as people whom we can allow to remain at peace.
                        Moreover it has not been a common thing for unpopularity to attach itself to
                        any one of the citizens on account of any warlike triumphs. We often have to
                        resist domestic evils and the counsels of audacious citizens; and it is
                        indispensable to <pb n="176"/> retain in the republic a remedy for these
                        dangers; all which, O judges, you would have lost if the power of declaring
                        its grief at my position had been taken from the senate and people of
                            <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> by my death. Wherefore, I
                        warn you, O young men, and I enjoin you by the right which belongs to me to
                        do so, you who have a regard for propriety, for the republic, and for glory,
                        not to be slow, if at any time any necessity summons you to defend the
                        republic against worthless citizens, and not, from any recollection of what
                        has happened to me, to shun bold counsels. <milestone n="52" unit="section"/> In the first place, there is no danger of any one ever falling in with
                        such consuls as these, especially if these are requited as they deserve. In
                        the second place, there never will again, I hope, be an instance of any
                        wicked man saying that he is attacking the republic with the approval and
                        assistance of virtuous citizens, while they keep silence; nor of such a
                        man's threatening citizens in the garb of peace with the terrors of an armed
                        soldiery; nor will there be any excuse for a general stationed with his army
                        at the gates, allowing the terror of his name to be used as an instrument
                        for opposing and alarming the citizens. For the senate will never be so
                        oppressed as to have no power of even entreating or lamenting; the
                        equestrian order will never be bound hand and foot so completely as to allow
                        Roman knights to be banished by the consul. But yet even after all these
                        things had happened, and many other more important events also, which I pass
                        over designedly, still you see that, after a short interval of suffering, I
                        was recalled to the enjoyment of my former dignity by the voice of the
                        republic. <milestone n="24" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="53" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>But to return to that point which is the one which I have particularly
                        proposed to myself to establish in this speech; namely, that the republic
                        was afflicted and oppressed by every sort of calamity that year owing to the
                        wickedness of the consuls. First of all, on that very day which was fatal to
                        me and grievous to all good men, when I had torn myself from the embrace of
                        my country and from your sight, O fellow-citizens, and when from fear of
                        danger to you, not to myself, I had yielded to the frenzy, and wickedness,
                        and treachery, and arms, and threats of one man, and had abandoned my
                        country, which was the dearest of all things to me, out of affection for my
                        country herself; when not only men but the very houses and temples of the
                        city were lamenting <pb n="177"/> that misfortune which befell
                        me,&mdash;so horrible, so lamentable, and so sudden; when no one of you
                        could bear the sight of the forum, or of the senate house, or of the light
                        of day; on that very day, do I say? at that very hour, at that very same
                        moment, at that very instant of ruin to me and to the republic, their
                        provinces were decreed to Gabinius and to Piso. O ye immortal gods,
                        guardians and preservers of this city and empire, what monsters of
                        wickedness, what crimes have you beheld in the republic! That citizen was
                        expelled who, in compliance with the authority of the senate, had defended
                        the republic with the cooperation of all good men and he was expelled, not
                        because of any other charge being brought against him, but expressly because
                        he had done so. And he was expelled without any trial, by violence, by
                        stones, by arms, by bodies of slaves excited to sedition. A law was passed
                        after the forum had been desolated and abandoned, and given over to
                        assassins and to slaves; a law to prevent the passing of which the senate
                        had changed its dress and gone into mourning. <milestone n="54" unit="section"/> The city being in this state of confusion, the consuls
                        did not allow even one night to elapse between my misfortune and their
                        acquisition of plunder. Instantly, the moment that I was struck down, they
                        flew to drink my blood, and, while the republic was still breathing, to
                        carry off and divide my spoils. I say nothing of their mutual
                        congratulations, of their banquets, of their division of the treasury, of
                        their liberality, of their hopes, of their promises, of their booty of the
                        joy of a few amid the universal mourning. My wife was attacked, my children
                        sought for in order to be murdered, my son-in-law,&mdash;yes, my
                        son-in-law, Piso, was rejected as a suppliant by Piso the consul after he
                        had thrown himself at his feet; my property was plundered and carried off to
                        the houses of the consuls; my house was burnt on the <placeName key="tgn,3000935">Palatine Hill</placeName>; the consuls passed the time
                        in revels and joy. But even if they were rejoiced at my distress, they ought
                        to have been moved at the dangers of the city. <milestone n="25" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="55" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>But, however, to give up dwelling on my own case, recollect the rest of the
                        calamities of that year. For by that means you will most easily perceive
                        what a rigorous application of all sorts of remedies the republic required
                        from the next magistrates, and what a multitude of laws wanted remedying,
                        both such as had been passed, and such as had been <pb n="178"/> only
                        proposed. For some were passed while those consuls (shall I say, were silent
                        respecting them? Yes, rather while they) actually approved of them; laws,
                        that the notice of the censors and the most important decisions of the most
                        holy magistrates should be abolished; that not only those ancient guilds
                        which had existed before should be restored in defiance of the resolution of
                        the senate, but that innumerable new ones should be established by one
                        gladiator; that by abandoning the collection of the half as, and third of an
                        as, nearly one-fifth part of our revenues should be destroyed; that
                            <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName> should be given to
                        Gabinius instead of <placeName key="tgn,7002470">Cilicia</placeName>, which
                        he had bargained for, if he succeeded in betraying the republic; that one
                        glutton should have the power of deliberating twice over about the same
                        thing, and that he might propose a new law for the purpose of changing his
                        province, after one law had been actually passed on that subject. <milestone n="26" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="56" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>I say nothing about that law which at one swoop destroyed all religious
                        observances, all the privileges attached to the <foreign lang="la">auspices</foreign>, to the civil magistrates, and all the enactments
                        which refer to the common law, and to the time of proposing laws; I say
                        nothing about all the internal misfortunes which afflicted us; we saw even
                        foreign nations shaken by the insanity of that year. </p>
					<p>By a law proposed by a tribune of the people, the priest of the Mighty Mother
                        at <placeName key="tgn,6004655">Pessinus</placeName> was expelled and
                        stripped of his priesthood; and that shrine of the most holy and most
                        ancient of all religious ceremonies was sold for a large sum to Brogitarus,
                        a profligate man, and unworthy of any such sacred character; especially as
                        he had desired it not for the purpose of doing honour to the goddess, but
                        only of profaning her temple. People were styled kings by the people, who
                        would never have even asked for such a title from the senate: condemned
                        exiles were brought back to <placeName key="perseus,Byzantium">Byzantium</placeName> at the very time when citizens, who had not been
                        condemned, were being driven from the city. <milestone n="57" unit="section"/> King Ptolemaeus, who, if he had not as yet been himself styled an ally by
                        the senate, was at all events the brother of that king, who, while his cause
                        was identical with his, had long since received that honour from the senate;
                        and was of the same family, sprung from the same ancestors as his brother,
                        and had the same claims from the antiquity of his alliance; who, lastly, was
                        a king, and if <pb n="179"/> not yet an ally, still most certainly not an
                        enemy; was enjoying the kingdom which had belonged to his father and his
                        grandfather in peace and quiet, relying on the sovereign power of the Roman
                        people in a condition of royal ease and tranquillity. While he was never
                        thinking of any such thing, never suspecting any such thing, a motion was
                        made and put to the vote of the same troop of labourers and artisans that he
                        while sitting on his throne, with his purple and sceptre and all the other
                        ensigns of royal authority, should be placed at the mercy of a public
                        crier;&mdash;a motion was made, I say that the Roman people, which has
                        been in the habit of restoring their kingdoms even to those kings whom they
                        have subdued in war, should order that a king who was a friend of the
                        nation, who was not even said to have done them any injury, who had never
                        had any claim preferred against him or any demand for the restitution of
                        anything, should have all his property confiscated and sold with his own
                        person and liberty. <milestone n="27" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="58" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>That year was a year of many cruel, of many shameful, of many turbulent
                        proceedings, but I know not whether I ought not deservedly to call this the
                        nearest in iniquity to that crime which their wickedness committed against
                        me. Our ancestors determined that that celebrated Antiochus called the
                        Great, after he had been subdued in a long and arduous struggle by land and
                        seas, should be king over the districts within Mount Taurus. They gave
                            <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, of which they deprived
                        him, to Attalus, that he should be king over that district. With Tigranes,
                        king of the Armenians, we waged a serious war of very long duration; he
                        having, I may almost say, challenged us, by inflicting wanton injuries on
                        our allies. He was not truly a vigorous enemy on his own power and on his
                        own account, but he also defended with all his resources and protected in
                        his territory, that most active enemy of this empire, Mithridates, after he
                        had been driven from <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName>; and
                        after he had been defeated by Lucullus that most excellent man and most
                        consummate general, he still remained in his former mind, and kept up a
                        hostile feeling against us with the remainder of his army. And yet this man
                        did Cnaeus Pompeius&mdash;after he had seen him in his camp as a
                        suppliant and in an abject condition&mdash;raise up and placed on his
                        head again the royal crown which he himself had taken off, and, having
                        imposed certain conditions <pb n="180"/> on him, ordered to continue king.
                        And he thought it no less glorious for himself and for this empire, that the
                        king should be known to he restored by him, than if he had kept him in
                        bonds. <milestone n="59" unit="section"/> Therefore, Tigranes&mdash;who
                        was himself an enemy of the Roman people, and who received our most active
                        enemy in his territories, who struggled against us, who fought pitched
                        battles with us, and who compelled us to combat almost for our very
                        existence and supremacy&mdash;is a king to this day, and has obtained by
                        his entreaties the name of a friend and ally, which he had previously
                        forfeited by his hostile and warlike conduct. </p>
					<p>That unhappy king of <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName>&mdash;who was always our ally, always our friend,
                        concerning whom no single unfavourable suspicion was ever reported to the
                        senate or to our commanders in those parts&mdash;has now, as they say,
                        while alive and beholding the light, been seized and sold with all his means
                        of support, and all his royal apparel. Here is a good reason for other kings
                        thinking their own fortunes stable, when by this example, handed down to
                        recollection from that fatal year, they see that one tribune and six hundred
                        journeymen have power to despoil them of all their fortunes, and strip them
                        of their whole kingdom! <milestone n="28" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="60" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>But they even designed to stain the character of Marcus Cato by that
                        transaction; ignorant of the extent of such a man's wisdom, and integrity,
                        and magnanimity, and virtue; which is tranquil during a terrible tempest,
                        and shines amid the darkness, and, though driven from its proper
                            position,<note anchored="yes">Clodius had an old grudge against
                            Ptolemaeus king of Cyprus for refusing to ransom him once when be was
                            taken prisoner by pirates; and now, having proposed a law to reduce his
                            kingdom to the state of a province, and to confiscate all his property,
                            he got the execution of the decree given to Cato, partly to throw
                            discredit on Cato, and partly to oblige him to acknowledge the validity
                            of his acts by submitting to bear a part in them: and Cato was much
                            pleased at the commission. Ptolemaeus, as soon as he had heard of the
                            law and of Cato's approach, poisoned himself in despair.</note> still
                        remains, and clings to his country, and shines at all times by its own
                        unassisted light, and is never tarnished by the dirt or disgrace of others.
                        Their object was, not to do honour to Marcus Cato, but to banish him. They
                        did not think that they were entrusting that commission to him, but imposing
                        it on him; and said openly in the assembly, that <pb n="181"/> they had cut
                        Marcus Cato's tongue out, which had always spoken so freely against all
                        extraordinary commissions. They will feel, I trust, in a short time, that
                        that freedom of his still continues; and even if that be possible that it
                        exists in a still greater degree from this circumstance, that Marcus Cato,
                        even when he despaired of being any longer able to do any good by his
                        authority, still with his voice and with every expression of indignation
                        struggled against those consuls and, after my departure, weeping for my
                        misfortune and for that of the republic, attacked <persName><surname>Piso</surname></persName> in such language, that he made that

                        <milestone n="61" unit="section"/>Why, then, did he obey the

                        he considered to have been unjustly passed. He does not give in to such rash
                        counsels, as to think himself at liberty to deprive the republic of his
                        services as a citizen, when he can do no good to the republic. While I was
                        consul and when he was tribune of the people elect he voluntarily exposed
                        his own life to danger he delivered that opinion, the unpopularity of which
                        be saw would be so great as to imperil his life. He spoke with vehemence; he
                        acted with energy, what he felt he stated in the most open manner. He was
                        the lender and the adviser and main advocate of those
                        measures,&mdash;not that he did not see his own danger, but in such a
                        storm as that which was threatening to overwhelm the republic, he thought
                        that he ought not to think of anything but the dangers of his country.
                            <milestone n="29" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="62" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>His tribuneship followed. Why need I speak of his extraordinary magnanimity,
                        and of his incredible virtue? You remember that day on which, when the
                        temple was occupied by his colleague,<note anchored="yes">Metellus
                            Celer</note> and while we were all alarmed for the life of that good man
                        and that great citizen, he himself came most courageously into the temple,
                        stilled the clamours of the men by his authority and checked the violence of
                        the wicked by his intrepidity. Then, indeed, he encountered danger, but he
                        encountered it for an adequate reason and how great that motion was, it is
                        not necessary for me to say at present. But if he had not obeyed that most
                        wicked motion with respect to the affairs of <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName>, the same disgrace would nevertheless have attached
                        to the republic. For after the kingdom had been confiscated, the motion was
                        made about <persName><surname>Cato</surname></persName> mentioning <pb n="182"/> him expressly by name. And suppose he had refused to obey it,
                        can you doubt that violence would have been used towards him, since in that
                        case all the acts of that year would have seemed to be undermined by that
                        one man? <milestone n="63" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>And he saw this also: since the stain attached to the republic of having
                        confiscated that kingdom, a stain which no one could efface; he thought it
                        more advantageous, that whatever good could arise to the republic out of
                        those evils, should be secured by him rather than by others. And if, by any
                        means whatever, he had been expelled out of the city at that time, he would
                        have borne it easily. In truth, could he,&mdash;who in the former year
                        had absented himself from the senate, though, if he had come thither, he
                        would have been able to have me as the partner of all his counsels which
                        concerned the government of the state,&mdash;could he, I say, have
                        continued with equanimity in this city then, after I had been expelled, and
                        with me the whole senate too, and when his own opinions had been condemned?
                        But he yielded to the same time to which we did; to the same frenzy, to the
                        same consuls, to the same threats, and plots, and dangers that we did
                        ourselves. We, indeed, suffered the greatest misfortune of the two, but his
                        indignation and grief of mind was not less than our own. <milestone n="30" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="64" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>It is the consuls who ought to complain of these numerous and enormous
                        injuries done to our allies, and to kings, and to free states. Kings and
                        foreign nations have always been under the protection of that magistracy.
                        But have any words of the consuls been heard on the subject? Although,
                        indeed, who would listen to them if they wanted to complain ever so much?
                        Could they make any complaint about the king of Cyprus, who not only did not
                        defend me while I was still standing,&mdash;me, a fellow-citizen, who
                        had no charge brought against me, who was attacked only as a screen to
                        conceal the attacks intended for my country,&mdash;but who did not even
                        protect me after I had fallen? I had yielded, if you assert that the common
                        people was alienated from me, (which it was not) to unpopularity; if you
                        think that everything was thrown into confusion, to the times; if violence
                        was at the bottom of it, to arms; if there was a confederacy against me, to
                        a bargain made by the magistrates; if there was danger to all the citizens,
                        then I had yielded to the one great consideration, the safety of the
                        republic. <milestone n="65" unit="section"/>Why, when a motion was <pb n="183"/> brought forward concerning the status of a citizen, (I do not

                        enacted by the sacred laws and by the laws of the Twelve Tables that it was
                        not lawful to decree a <foreign lang="la">privilegium</foreign> against any
                        one nor to make any motion affecting a man's rights as a
                        citizen;&mdash;why, I say, was the voice of the consuls never heard? Why
                        was the rule established that year,&mdash;as far as those two pests of
                        this empire could effect its establishment,&mdash;that any citizen might
                        lawfully be driven out of the city by name by the mob of artisans in a state
                        of excitement, and by the contrivance of a tribune of the people? <milestone n="66" unit="section"/>But what measures were proposed that year? what
                        promises were made to many? what engagements were committed to writing? what
                        hopes were entertained? what designs formed?&mdash;What shall I say?
                        what spot on the whole surface of the globe was not allotted to some one or
                        other? what whole business was there, which could be thought of or wished
                        for or imagined of which the management was not already given and assigned
                        to somebody? what description of command, what province, what contrivance
                        for finding out or amassing money was overlooked? what district or territory
                        in the whole earth was there of any tolerable extent in which some kingdom
                        or other was not marked out for somebody? and what king was there who did
                        not think that year either that he could buy what he had not, or else that
                        he must ransom what he had? Who was there who asked for any province or for
                        any money or for any appointment as lieutenant or as ambassador from the
                        senate? If men had been condemned for acts of violence, restitution of their
                        fines was made to them; by every means the way to the consulship was
                        smoothed for that priest who was so devoted to the people. The good groaned
                        at these things; the wicked cherished hopes; the tribune of the people was
                        active; the consuls were assisting him. <milestone n="31" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="67" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>About this time a little later than he himself would approve, Cnaeus
                        Pompeius, greatly against the will of those men who by their own
                        contrivances and by false alarms had turned away the inclination of that
                        most virtuous and gallant man from the defence of my safety, awakened again
                        that habit which he had of devotion to the cause of the good government of
                        the republic, which had been, I will not say lulled asleep, but a little
                        checked and blasted by some sort of <pb n="184"/> suspicion. That man, who
                        by his virtuous valour had subdued the most wicked of citizens, and the most
                        active of foreign enemies, and the mightiest nations, and kings, and savage
                        and hitherto unheard-of tribes, and a countless host of pirates, and also
                        the slaves; who, having put a happy end to every war by land and sea, had
                        made the boundaries of the empire of the Roman people co-equal with the
                        extent of the world; would not allow that republic to be overturned by the
                        wickedness of a few men, which, he himself had repeatedly saved, not only by
                        his counsels, but even by his own blood; he came to the succour of the
                        public cause; he resisted the remainder of those men's measures by his
                        authority; he addressed to the authorities complaints as to what had already
                        happened. <milestone n="68" unit="section"/>Some inclination towards a
                        better state of things appeared to arise. The senate, in a full house,
                        passed a decree respecting my return, on the first of June, without a single
                        dissenting voice, on the motion of Lucius Ninnius, whose good faith and
                        virtue never wavered in my cause. Somebody of the name of Ligus, some
                        obscure fellow, some contemptible addition to my enemies, interposed his
                        veto. The affair and our cause were now in such a state that we seemed to
                        look up, and to be coming to life again. Whoever had had the slightest
                        participation in the wickedness of Clodius as connected with my sufferings,
                        wherever he came, or in whatever trial he appeared, was sure to be
                        condemned. Not a man was found who would admit that he had given a vote
                        against me. My brother had departed from <placeName key="tgn,2097781">Asia</placeName>, with every appearance of mourning, but with far
                        deeper grief at his heart. As he came towards the city, the whole city went
                        forth to meet him with tears and groans. The senate was speaking with
                        unusual freedom. The Roman knights were constantly meeting. That excellent
                        man <persName><surname>Piso</surname></persName>, my son-in-law,<note anchored="yes">He was dead.</note> who was not allowed time to receive
                        the reward of his affection, either from me or from the Roman people, kept
                        beseeching his relation to give him back his father-in-law. The senate
                        refused to entertain any proposition whatever till the consuls had made a
                        motion concerning me. <milestone n="32" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="69" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>And as the facts of the case were now notorious, and as the consuls, by their
                        bargain respecting the provinces, had parted with all their freedom of
                        action, and when they <pb n="185"/> were asked in the senate to deliver
                        their opinions respecting me as private men,<note anchored="yes">The text
                            here seems undoubtedly corrupt.</note> said that they were afraid of
                        that law of Clodius: as those men could not stand this state of things any
                        longer, they formed a plan to murder Cnaeus Pompeius and when that was
                        detected and when the assassins had been taken with the arms in their hands,
                        he remained shut up in his own house as long as my enemy continued tribune.
                        Eight tribunes supported a motion for my return, from which it was
                        understood that my friends had increased in my absence and that, too, while
                        I was in a situation in which some whom I had thought to be my friends were

                        inclination but not always the same freedom of action; for of the nine
                        tribunes who were at that time in my interest one, while I was absent,
                        dropped off from me, who took his surname from the images of the Aelii,
                        though he looks more as if he be longed to their nation than to their

					<p><milestone n="70" unit="section"/> Accordingly, in this year when the new
                        magistrates had been elected, when all good men turned their hopes towards
                        them and began to found expectations of a better state of things on their
                        honesty, Publius Lentulus, as the chief, took up my cause with his authority
                        and by the open declaration of his sentiments, in spite of the resistance of
                        <persName><surname>Piso</surname></persName> and Gabinius; and when
                        eight tribunes made a motion in my behalf, he spoke in favour of it in a
                        speech very honourable to me. And though he thought that it would redound
                        greatly to his glory, and would secure him gratitude as having performed a
                        most important service to the state, if that cause was not as yet proceeded
                        with, but was reserved entire for his consulship, still he preferred having
                        my business settled at once by others, to having it accomplished after delay
                        by himself. <milestone n="33" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="71" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>In the meantime Publius Sestius, O judges, the tribune elect, undertook a
                        journey to Caius Caesar, for the sake of my safety. What he effected, how
                        much real good he did, has nothing to do with the matter. I think indeed if
                        Caesar was, as I believe him to have been, well-inclined towards <pb n="186"/> us, that Sestius did me no good at all; if Caesar was a little angry with
                        me, he did not do much good; but still you see the unwearied activity and
                        loyalty of the man. </p>
					<p>I now come to the tribuneship of Sestius; for he undertook this journey for
                        the sake of the republic when he was only tribune elect. He thought that it
                        concerned the unanimity of the citizens, and the facility of accomplishing
                        what he had at heart, to show that Caesar's mind was not averse to the
                        business. </p>
					<p>That year passed away. Men seemed to breathe, not from having actually
                        attained their wishes, but from their hopes of recovering the republic. Two

					<p>The first of January arrives; you are better acquainted with what ensued than
                        I am; however, I say what I have heard. You know what a numerous attendance
                        of the senate there <pb n="187"/> was, what expectation of the people, what
                        a concourse of deputies from all <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>; how great too was the virtue and activity and
                        authority of Publius Lentulus, the consul; and also how very moderate
                        towards me was the behaviour of his colleague, who, though he said that he
                        had taken a dislike to me on account of a disagreement between us on the
                        affairs of the republic, still said that he would give it up to the
                        conscript fathers and to the critical times of the republic. <milestone n="34" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="73" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>Then Lucius Cotta, being asked his opinion first, said what was most worthy
                        of the republic,&mdash;that nothing had been done respecting me justly,
                        nothing according to the usages of our ancestors, nothing according to the
                        laws that no one could be removed out of the city without a regular trial,
                        that it not only was illegal for any law to be passed, but that no decision
                        even could be come to except at the <foreign lang="la">comitia
                            centuriata</foreign>, that that was all violence, a flame arising from
                        the confusion of the republic, and the agitated state of the times, when all
                        rights and all courts of justice were destroyed, that when a great
                        revolution was impending, I turned aside a little, and out of hope of future
                        tranquillity, had shunned the present waves and tempests. Wherefore, as I
                        had when absent delivered the republic from no less serious dangers than I
                        had previously when present, he said that it was fitting that I should not
                        only be restored, but also complimented by the senate. He also discussed
                        many other points with great wisdom, arguing that that most insane and
                        profligate enemy of modesty and chastity had framed the law which he had
                        enacted concerning me in such a manner, in such language and with such
                        statements of fact that even if it had been legally proposed and earned
                        still it could not have had any force. Wherefore he said, that as I was not
                        away because of any law, I ought to be recalled not by a law but by the
                        authority of the senate. </p>
					<p><milestone n="74" unit="section"/>There was no one who did not say that this
                        opinion was most sound. But Cnaeus Pompeius, who was asked his opinion after
                        him, having expressed his approval of the opinion of Cotta, and praised it,
                        said that he, for the sake of my tranquillity, in order that I might be in
                        no subsequent danger from any popular disturbance, voted that the kindness
                        of the Roman people should be added to the authority of the senate in my
                        behalf. When all had vied with one another, each one <pb n="188"/> speaking
                        about my safety in a more dignified and complimentary manner than the other,
                        and when in fact a unanimous vote was just taking place, up rose, as you
                        know, Atilius Gavianus; and he did not dare to interpose his veto, although
                        he had been bought for that purpose, but he asked a night to deliberate on
                        the matter. Then ensued a great outcry of the senate, and loud complaints
                        and entreaties: his father-in-law threw himself at his feet. He pledged
                        himself to cause no delay the next day. He was believed. The senate broke
                        up. In the meantime that deliberate gentleman, in the course of the long
                        night that intervened, got his wages doubled. Only a very few days followed
                        during the whole month of January on which it was lawful for a senate to be
                        held; but still nothing was discussed except my business. <milestone n="35" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="75" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>While the senate was being hindered by every sort of delay, and mockery, and
                        false pretence, there came at last the day appointed for the discussion of
                        my case, the twenty-fifth of January. The chief proposer of the motion, a
                        man most friendly to me, Quintus Fabricius, occupied the temple some time
                        before daybreak. On that day Sestius was quite quiet, the very man who is
                        now on his trial for violence. He, the advocate and defender of my cause,
                        takes no step at all, but waits to see the maneuvers of my enemies. What
                        next? How do these men conduct themselves by whose contrivance Publius
                        Sestius is now put upon his trial? As they had occupied the forum, and the
                        place for the <foreign lang="la">comitia</foreign>, and the senate-house, at
                        an early period of the night, with a number of armed men and slaves, they
                        fall on Fabricius, lay violent hands on him, slay some men, and wound many.
                            <milestone n="76" unit="section"/>They drive away by force Marcus
                        Cispius, a most gallant and virtuous man and a tribune of the people, as he
                        was coming into the forum; they make a great slaughter in the forum; and all
                        of them, with drawn and bloody swords, looked about with their eyes for, and
                        demanded with their cries, my brother, a most virtuous man, a most brave
                        one, and one most devoted to me. And he willingly, such was his grief, and
                        so great his regret for me, would have exposed his body to their weapons,
                        not with a view of resisting them, but with the object of meeting death, if
                        he had not preserved his life in the hope of my return. However, he endured
                        some violence from those wicked robbers; and as he had come down for the
                        purpose of begging <pb n="189"/> the safety of his brother from the Roman
                        people, having been driven from the <foreign lang="la">rostra</foreign>, he
                        lay down in the place of the <foreign lang="la">comitia</foreign>, and
                        covered himself with the corpses of slaves and freedmen, and defended his
                        life that day by the protection which night and flight afforded him, not by
                        that of the laws or courts of justice. <milestone n="77" unit="section"/>You
                        recollect, O judges, that on that day the <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName> was filled with the corpses of the citizens, that the
                        sewers were choked up; that blood was wiped up out of the forum with
                        sponges; so that all men thought that such a vast number and such a
                        magnificent show of gladiators could not have been provided by any private
                        individual, or plebeian, but must be the exhibition of some patrician and
                        man of praetorian rank. <milestone n="36" unit="chapter"/>Neither before
                        this time nor even on this most turbulent day itself was there any word of
                        accusation uttered against Sestius. But there was great violence used in the
                        forum. No doubt of that. When was there ever greater? We have often seen men
                        pelted with stones; not so often, but still too often have we seen swords
                        but such great slaughter as this,&mdash;such vast heaps of corpses piled
                        up who ever beheld in the forum, except perhaps on that miserable day of
                        Cinna and Octavius? With what animosity did the parties fight! For, indeed,
                        seditious disturbances often arise from the pertinacity or firmness with
                        which some magistrate has exercised his veto or from the fault and
                        wickedness of some proposer of a law having held out hopes of great
                        advantage or great bribes to the ignorant; they arise from the rivalry of
                        the magistrates; they arise gradually from clamour at first, and afterwards
                        from some division of the assembly it is unwillingly, and slowly, and seldom
                        that acts of violence are resorted to. But who ever heard before of a
                        sedition in the night, when not a word had been spoken, when no assembly had
                        been summoned and when no law had been read? <milestone n="78" unit="section"/>Is it probable that a Roman citizen, or that any free
                        man, should have descended with a sword into the forum before daybreak, in
                        order to prevent a law from being passed respecting me, unless he were one
                        of those men who have been fattened up this long time on the blood of the
                        republic by that destructive and wicked citizen? </p>
					<p>Here now I ask the prosecutor himself, who complains that Sestius used to
                        keep a great multitude and a large guard about him during his tribuneship,
                        whether he had them with <pb n="190"/> him on that day? Certainly, most
                        undeniably, he had not; and therefore the party of the republic was
                        defeated; and it was defeated, not by unfavourable <foreign lang="la">auspices</foreign>, not by any exercise of the veto, not by the
                        suffrages of any assembly, but by violence, by force of arms, by bloodshed.
                        For if the praetor had given notice to Fabricius, and had said that he was
                        observing the <foreign lang="la">auspices</foreign>, the republic would have
                        received a blow, but still one which it could have lamented. If his
                        colleague had interrupted Fabricius with his veto, he would have injured the
                        republic, but still he would have injured the republic in a legal and
                        regular manner. Are you to send raw gladiators, got together in expectation
                        of the aedileship, with a pack of assassins let loose out of the jails, into
                        the forum before dawn? Are you to drive the magistrates down from the
                        temple? Are you to cause a great massacre? to desolate the forum? and then,
                        when you have carried everything by violence and arms, to accuse a man who
                        has protected himself with a guard, not for the purpose of opposing you, but
                        of defending his own life? <milestone n="37" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="79" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>But not even since that time has Sestius endeavoured to take care to be able,
                        being defended by his people around him, to discharge the duties of his
                        magistracy in the forum, and to conduct the affairs of the republic in
                        safety. Therefore, relying on the sacred nature of his office as tribune, as
                        he considered that he was armed by sacred laws, not only against violence
                        and weapons, but also against words and interruption in speaking, he came
                        into the temple of Castor,&mdash;he gave notice to the consul that he
                        could not proceed because he was observing the <foreign lang="la">auspices</foreign>; when on a sudden that band of Clodius, which had
                        already been repeatedly victorious in the slaughter of citizens, raises an
                        outcry, hurries forward, attacks him. Some fall with their swords on the
                        tribune unarmed and unprovided, and some with pieces of fences and with
                        clubs; and he at length, having received many wounds, and been weakened and
                        disabled by the injuries which he had received from these men, fell down in
                        an almost lifeless state, and was only saved from actual death by their
                        believing that he was dead. For when they saw him lying on the ground with
                        numberless wounds and gashes, scarcely breathing, pale and exhausted, they
                        at last left off wounding him, more because they were tired, <pb n="191"/>
                        and because they were mistaken, thinking him dying than from any feelings of
                        pity or moderation. <milestone n="80" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>And now Sestius is on his trial for violence! Why is this? Because he is
                        alive. But that is no fault of his. One last blow was wanting; and if that
                        had been added he would have yielded up his last breath. Accuse Lentidius;
                        he did not wound him in the right place; accuse Sabinius that fellow from
                            <placeName key="perseus,Reate">Reate</placeName>, and ask why he was so
                        prompt to cry out that the man was dead. But why accuse Sestius himself? Was
                        not there enough of him for their swords? Did he resist? Did he not stand to
                        be killed as gladiators are often ordered to do? <milestone n="38" unit="chapter"/> Is this of itself a proof of violence not to be able to
                        die? Or this, that a tribune of the people profaned a temple with blood? Or
                        this, that when he had been carried away and had begun to come to himself,
                        he did not order himself to he carried back again? Where is the crime for
                        which you blame him? <milestone n="81" unit="section"/>Or this I ask, O
                        judges, if on that day that family of Clodius had done what it
                        wished,&mdash;if Publius Sestius, who was left for dead had really been
                        slain, would you have had recourse to arms? Would you have roused yourselves
                        up to the courage of your fathers and to the valour of your ancestors? Would
                        you at last have endeavoured to wrest the republic out of the hands of that
                        deadly robber? Or would you even then have remained quiet and dawdled, and
                        been afraid, when you saw the republic overwhelmed and taken possession of
                        by the most impious assassins and by slaves? If then you would have avenged
                        his death, if you had any idea of continuing free men, and of retaining the
                        constitution, do you think that you ought to hesitate as to what you ought
                        to say, and feel, and think, and decide as to his virtue now that he is
                        alive? <milestone n="82" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>But even those very parricides, whose unbridled frenzy is nourished by long
                        impunity, were thrown into such consternation by the violence of their deed,
                        that if the belief of the death of Sestius had lasted a little longer, they
                        would have done as they were thinking of, and have slain their own friend
                        Gracchus, for the sake of attributing the crime to us. That clown, however,
                        being rather wary, (for those wicked men could not conceal their design,)
                        perceived that his own blood was sought for for the purpose of extinguishing
                        the unpopularity of this atrocity of Clodius, and got hold of a <pb n="192"/> cloak belonging to a mule-driver, in which he had originally come to
                            <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> to the <foreign lang="la">comitia</foreign>, and put a mower's basket on his head, and when some
                        were asking for Numerius, and some for Quintius, he was saved by the mistake
                        of the double name.<note anchored="yes">The man's real name was Numerius
                            Quinctius, who had assumed the name of Gracchus, to which he had no
                            right, in order to make himself popular with the multitude; who,
                            perhaps, on that account elected him tribune.</note> And you are all
                        aware that he was in danger until it was ascertained that Sestius was alive;
                        and if that had not been discovered a little sooner than I could have
                        wished, they would not, indeed, have been able to transfer the odium of the
                        death of their hired tool to those on whom they expected to shift it; but
                        they would have diminished the infamy of their abominable wickedness by one
                        crime which every one would have been glad of. <milestone n="83" unit="section"/>And if Publius Sestius had then yielded up, in the
                        temple of Castor, that life which he hardly retained, I have no doubt that
                        if only the senate had continued to exist and if the majesty of the Roman
                        people had ever recovered, a statue would at some future time have been
                        erected to him in the forum, as to a man who had been slain in the cause of
                        the republic. </p>
					<p>Nor, indeed, would any one of those men to whom you see that statues after
                        their death have been erected by our ancestors in that place in the <foreign lang="la">rostra</foreign>, deserve to be thought more of than Publius
                        Sestius, either as respects the cruelty of their death, or their attachment
                        to the republic: if, when he had undertaken the cause of a citizen oppressed
                        by undeserved misfortune,&mdash;the cause of a friend,&mdash;the
                        cause of a man who had done great services to the republic,&mdash;the
                        cause of the senate, the cause of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, the cause of the republic; and when, in obedience to
                        the requirements of religion and to the <foreign lang="la">auspices</foreign>, he had given notice to the magistrates of what
                        omens he had observed, he had been slain by those impious pests of their
                        country in the light of day, openly, within the sight of gods and men, in a
                        most holy temple, in a most holy cause, and while invested with a most holy
                        magistracy. Will any one, then, say that the life of that man ought to be
                        stripped of its proper dignity and honour, when you would have thought his
                        death entitled to the honour of an everlasting monument?<pb n="193"/>

                        together a band of men.&rdquo; What was he going to do with them? To
                        besiege the senate? to expel citizens who had not been condemned? to plunder
                        men's property? to set fire to buildings? to plunder private houses? to him
                        the temples of the immortal gods? to expel the tribunes of the people from
                        the <foreign lang="la">rostra</foreign> by force of arms? to sell whatever
                        provinces he pleased to whomsoever he pleased? to give men the title of
                        king? to restore to free cities, by means of our lieutenants and
                        ambassadors, men who had been condemned for capital offences? to blockade
                        the chief man of the state in his house with armed bands? It was to effect
                        all these objects, I suppose, which could never possibly be attained unless
                        the republic were overwhelmed by armed men, that Publius Sestius got
                        together his multitude of men, and his troops, as you call them. But the
                        pear was not yet ripe. The circumstances of the case did not as yet invite
                        good men to have recourse to such means for their protection. We were
                        defeated not indeed by that body alone, but still not entirely without its
                        agency. You were all mourning in silence. <milestone n="85" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>The forum had been taken in the preceding year; the temple of Castor having
                        been occupied by runaway slaves, as if it had been a fortress! not a word
                        was said against such conduct. Everything was done by the clamour and
                        impetuosity, and violence, and assaults of men desperate through indigence
                        and through their natural audacity. And you endured that it should be so.
                        The magistrates were driven from the temples; others were altogether cut off
                        from all approach to them or to the forum. No one offered any resistance.
                        Gladiators were taken out of the praetor's train and introduced into the
                        senate and confessed that they had been thrown into prison by <persName><surname>Milo</surname></persName>, that they had been released by
                        Serranus. Yet no mention was made of these things. The forum was strewed
                        with the corpses of Roman citizens murdered in a nocturnal massacre. There
                        not only was no new sort of investigation into such events instituted, but
                        even the old courts of justice were abolished. You saw a tribune of the
                        people lying down stricken to the ground with more than twenty wounds and
                        almost dead; the house of another tribune of the people, a man of godlike
                        virtue (for I will say what I think myself, and what all men agree <pb n="194"/> with me in thinking,) a man of most eminent, unheard-of,
                        unprecedented greatness of mind, and wisdom, and integrity, was attacked
                        with fire and sword by the army of Clodius. <milestone n="40" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="86" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>And while speaking on this topic you praise <persName><surname>Milo</surname></persName>, and you praise him deservedly. For what man have we
                        ever seen of more admirable virtue? a man who, without any expectation of
                        reward beyond this, which is now thought an old-fashioned and contemptible
                        thing&mdash;namely, the esteem of the good, has voluntarily encountered
                        every sort of danger, and the most arduous labours, and the most severe
                        contests, and the most bitter enmities? who appears to me to be the only
                        citizen who has shown not only by words but by actions what ought to be
                        done, and what was necessary to be done, in the republic by the leading men;
                        that such men's duty was to resist the wickedness of audacious men, men who
                        would overturn the republic, by means of the laws, and of the courts of
                        justice; but that if the laws were inefficient, if there were no courts of
                        justice, if the republic was seized and held in subjection by the violence
                        and conspiracy and armed force of audacious men, then that it was absolutely
                        necessary for our lives and liberties to be defended by armed guards and by
                        troops. To think in this way is a sign of prudence; to act in accordance
                        with such sentiments is a proof of bravery; to think rightly, and to act
                        bravely at the same time, is a proof of perfect and consummate virtue. </p>
					<p><milestone n="87" unit="section"/><persName><surname>Milo</surname></persName>, as tribune of the people, entered on the
                        administration of the affairs of the republic: and I will dilate yet further
                        in his praise; not because he is more anxious to be praised than to be
                        respected, or because I have any particular wish to give him this reward of
                        praise in his presence, especially as I cannot find words equal to his
                        exploits; but because I think that if I prove that the conduct of <persName><surname>Milo</surname></persName> has been approved of by the voice of
                        the prosecutor, you will think with reference to this accusation, that the
                        cause of Sestius stands on the same ground. Titus Annius, then, entered on
                        the administration of the affairs of the republic with the feeling that he
                        wished to restore to his country a citizen who had been undeservedly driven
                        from it. The case was a plain one; his conduct was consistent supported by
                        the unanimous consent and concord of every one. He had his colleagues for
                        assistants, the greatest possible zeal in his favour of one of the <pb n="195"/> consuls, and the disposition of the other was nearly friendly.
                        Of the praetors, one was unfavourable; the enthusiasm of the senate in the
                        cause was extraordinary, the feelings of all the Roman knights were roused
                        to further it, <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> was on the
                        tiptoe of expectation. There were only two enemies who had been brought over
                        to create obstacles; and if those despicable and contemptible men could not
                        support the weight of so important a business, he saw that he should not be
                        able by any means to accomplish the object which he had undertaken to
                        effect. He laboured with all his influence, with all his
                        prudence,&mdash;he laboured by means of the cooperation of the highest
                        order in the state he laboured exciting others by the example of the
                        virtuous and brave citizens,&mdash;he meditated with incessant diligence
                        on what conduct was worthy of the republic and of himself, on his own
                        station and character, on what hopes he ought to entertain on what return he
                        ought to make to his ancestors for what he had received from them.

					<p>That gladiator saw that he could not be a match for such wisdom as that of
                        <persName><surname>Milo</surname></persName>, if he proceeded according
                        to ordinary usage. He resorted to arms, to firebrands, to daily slaughter,
                        to conflagration and plunder, with his army. He began to attack his house,
                        to meet him on his journeys, to provoke him by violence, to try and alarm
                        him. He had but little effect on a man of consummate wisdom and consummate
                        firmness; but although indignation of mind, and an innate love of liberty,
                        and prompt and excellent valour, encouraged that gallant man to break down
                        and repel violence by violence, especially now that violence was so
                        repeatedly offered, still so great was the moderation of the man, and so
                        excessive his prudence, that he restrained his indignation, and would not
                        avenge himself by the same conduct as that by which he had been provoked;
                        but he resolved rather to entangle in the toils of the law that fellow who
                        was exulting and dancing in triumph over all the murders which he had
                        committed in the republic. <milestone n="89" unit="section"/>He came down to
                        the court to accuse him. Who ever did so, so peculiarly for the sake of the
                        republic? having no private enmity of his own to urge him on, having no
                        reward in prospect being persuaded by no entreaty on the part of any one,
                        nor even by any general expectation that he was going to take such a step.
                        The fellow's courage was shaken. For when such a man as <persName><surname>Milo</surname></persName> was the prosecutor, he <pb n="196"/>
                        had no hope of such an infamous tribunal as his former one. See now the
                        praetor, the consul, and the tribune of the people, propose new edicts of a
                        new sort: &ldquo;That no one be brought before the court as a defendant;
                        that no one be summoned before the judges; that no investigations take
                        place; that no one be allowed to make any mention to any one, of judges, or
                        courts of justice.&rdquo; What was a man to do who was born for virtue,
                        and dignity, and glory, when the violence of wicked men was fortified in
                        this way, by the destruction of all laws and courts of justice? Was tribune
                        of the people to place his life at the mercy of a private individual? was a
                        most virtuous man to hold his life at the will of a most thoroughly wicked
                        one? or, was he to abandon the cause which he had undertaken? was he to keep
                        at home? He thought it would be a base thing to be defeated, or to be
                        frightened from his purpose. In truth, he thought it for the advantage of
                        the republic, since he was not able to employ the laws against him, that he
                        should not show any fear of his violence, with respect either to personal
                        peril to himself, or to the danger of the republic. <milestone n="42" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="90" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>How, then, can you accuse Sestius with reference to this fact of his having
                        provided himself with a guard, when at the same time you praise <persName><surname>Milo</surname></persName>? Is it legal for that man to provide
                        himself with a guard who is defending his own house, who is repelling fire
                        and sword from his altars and his fire-side, who seeks to be allowed to
                        present himself with safety in the forum, in the temples of the gods, and in
                        the senate-house; but do you think that man who is warned by the wounds
                        which he sees every day over his whole person, to defend his head, and his
                        neck, and his throat, and his sides, by some protection or other, deserving
                        to be prosecuted for violence? <milestone n="91" unit="section"/>For who of
                        you, O judges, is ignorant that the nature of things has been such, that at
                        one time men, before there was any natural or civil law fully laid down,
                        wandered in a straggling and disorderly manner over the country, and had
                        just that property which they could either seize or keep by their own
                        personal strength and vigour, by means of wounds and bloodshed? Those men,
                        therefore, who showed themselves to be the most eminent for virtue and
                        wisdom, they, having considered the character of men's aptitude for
                        instruction and of their natural disposition, collected into one place those
                            <pb n="197"/> who were previously scattered abroad, and brought them
                        over from their former savage way of life to justice and mildness of
                        manners. Then came those constitutions devised for the utility of man, which
                        we call commonwealths. Then came collections of men which were subsequently
                        called states; then men surrounded with walls sets of houses joined
                        together, which we now call cities, and divine and human laws began to be
                        recognised. </p>
					<p><milestone n="92" unit="section"/>And there is no point in which there is so
                        much difference between this manner of life, polished by civilization and
                        that savage one, as in the fact of law being the ruling principle of the
                        one, and violence of the other. If we do not choose to be guided by one we
                        must adopt the other. Do we wish violence to be put an end to? Law must
                        inevitably prevail; that is to say, courts of justice must, for in them all
                        law and justice are comprehended. Do we disapprove of courts of justice, or
                        are they destroyed or suspended? In a moment violence must be supreme.
                        Everybody sees this. <persName><surname>Milo</surname></persName> saw it
                        and acted in such a manner as to try the power of law and to banish
                        violence. He wished to avail himself of the one, in order that courage and
                        virtue might defeat audacity; he had recourse to the other from compulsion,
                        in order to prevent virtue and courage from being defeated by audacity. And
                        the principle of conduct of Publius Sestius was the same if not in
                        prosecuting Clodius, (for, it does not follow that exactly the same details
                        of conduct are to be pursued by every one,) still at all events in the
                        necessity of defending his safety, and in preparing a defence against force
                        and personal violence. <milestone n="43" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="93" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>O ye immortal gods! what an end do you show to us? what hope of the republic

                        as to embrace the cause of the republic when it is the justest of causes?
                        and to consult the interests of the virtuous part of the community? and to
                        seek no glory but that which is solid and genuine? when he knows that of
                        those two monsters so nearly fatal to the republic, Gabinius and Piso, one

                        against a most virtuous and brave citizen, appears now little more than a

                        to ravage and plunder. Moreover, he distributed the property of their
                        creditors, Roman citizens, among their Greek debtors; he exacted immense
                        sums from the people of <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Dyrrachium</placeName>,
                        he plundered the Thessalians, he exacted a fixed sum of money from the
                        Achaeans every year; and, above all, in no public or consecrated place has
                        he left one statue, or picture, or ornament. Who, I say, will embrace the
                        cause of the republic when he knows all this, and when he sees that these
                        men are so triumphant who deserve most richly, according to every law in
                        existence, every sort of penalty, and every extremity of punishment? and
                        that these two men whom you see here are brought to trial? I say nothing of
                        Numerius, and Serranus, and Aelius, the mere dregs of the sedition of
                        Clodius; but still, even these go triumphantly about as you behold; nor, as
                        long as ever you are in a state of apprehension for yourselves, will they
                        ever be alarmed for themselves. <milestone n="44" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="95" unit="section"/></p>

                        himself to repent that he behaved with such virtue, and with such firmness
                        of mind towards the republic; but what will be the thoughts of the young men
                        who see all these things? The man who has attacked and destroyed and burnt
                        the public monuments, and the sacred holdings, and the houses of his
                        enemies; who was constantly escorted by assassins, fenced round by armed

                        great a plenty; who stirred up even a foreign band of wicked men, and bought
                        a lot of slaves ready for bloodshed, and who in his tribuneship poured the

                        and accuses the <pb n="199"/> man who did to some extent check his exulting
                        frenzy. And the man who has hitherto defended himself in such a manner,
                        that, as a private individual he has been defending his own household gods,
                        and in his public capacity the privileges of his tribuneship and the

					<p><milestone n="96" unit="section"/>This, in truth, is the question which you

                        is what you said. You ask a question which it is very desirable for the

                        with respect to it, I will, O judges, say a few words. And, as I think what
                        I say will not be wholly unconnected with the advantage of those who hear me
                        nor with my duty, nor with the very case which we are arguing of Publius

					<p>There have always in this city been two kinds of men who have been ambitious

                        and the others wish both to be and to be considered of the party of the best
                        men in the state. Those whose object it was that whatever they did and
                        whatever they said should be agreeable to the multitude, were the popular
                        party; but those who conducted themselves in such a way as to induce all the
                        best men to approve of their counsels were considered of the best
                            party.<note anchored="yes">It is quite impossible to give Cicero's

					<p>Who then are they? Every good man. If you ask what are their numbers, they
                        are innumerable. For if they were not, we could not stand. They are the
                        chief men of the public council; they are those who follow their school they
                        are the men of the highest orders of the state to whom the senate house is
                        open; they are the citizens of the municipal towns and Roman citizens who
                        dwell in the country; they are men engaged in business; there are even some
                        freedmen of the <pb n="200"/> best party. The number, as I have said, of
                        this party is widely scattered in various directions; but the entire body
                        (to prevent all mistakes) can be described and defined in a few words. All
                        men belong to the best party, who are not guilty of any crime, nor wicked by
                        nature, nor madmen, nor men embarrassed by domestic difficulties. Let it be
                        laid down, then, that these men (this race, as you call them) are all those
                        who are honest and in their senses, and who are well off in their domestic
                        circumstances. Those who are guided by their wishes, who consult their
                        interests and opinions in the management of the republic, are the partisans
                        of the best men, and are themselves accounted best men, most wise and most
                        illustrious citizens, and chief men in the state. </p>
					<p><milestone n="98" unit="section"/>What then, is the object proposed to
                        themselves by these directors of the republic, which they are bound to keep
                        their eyes fixed upon, and towards which they ought to direct their course?
                        That which is most excellent and most desirable to all men in their senses,
                        and to all good and happy men,&mdash;ease conjoined with duty. Those who
                        seek this are all best men; those who effect it are considered the chief
                        leaders in and the preservers of their states. For men ought not to be so
                        elated by the dignity of the affairs which they have undertaken to manage,
                        as to have no regard to their ease; nor ought they to dwell with fondness on
                        any sort of ease which is inconsistent with dignity. <milestone n="46" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p><milestone n="99" unit="section"/> And of this easy dignity these are the
                        foundations, these are the component parts, which ought to he upheld by the
                        chief men, and to be defended even at the hazard of their lives: religious
                        observances, the <foreign lang="la">auspices</foreign>, the civil power of
                        magistrates, the authority of the senate, the laws, the usages of one's
                        ancestors, the courts of justice, the jurisdiction of the judges, good
                        faith, the provinces, the allies, the glory of the empire, the whole affairs
                        of the army, the treasury. To the defender and advocate of all these things,
                        numerous and important as they are, is a task to employ great courage, great
                        ability, and great firmness. In truth, in such a vast number of citizens,
                        there is a great multitude of those men, who either, from fear of
                        punishment, because they are conscious of their own misdeeds, are anxious
                        for fresh changes and revolutions in the republic; or who, on account of
                        some innate insanity of mind, feed upon the discords and seditions of the
                            <pb n="201"/> citizens; or else who, on account of the embarrassment of
                        their estates and circumstances, had rather burn in one vast common
                        conflagration, than in one which consumed only themselves. And when these
                        men have found instigators, leaders in and promoters of their own objects
                        and vices, their waves are stirred up in the republic, so that those men
                        must watch who have demanded for themselves the helm of the country, and
                        they must strive with all their skill and with all their diligence, in order
                        that they may be able to preserve these things which I have just now called
                        its foundations and component parts, and so keep in their course and reach
                        that harbour of ease and dignity. <milestone n="100" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>If, O judges, I were to deny that this path is rugged and difficult, and full
                        of danger and snares, I should speak falsely, especially as I have not only
                        always been aware that it was so, but have been alive to its perils and
                        labours more than any other man. <milestone n="47" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>The republic is attacked by greater forces and more numerous bodies than
                        those by which it is defended because audacious and abandoned men are
                        impelled on by a nod, and are even of their own accord excited by nature to
                        be enemies to the republic. And somehow or other good men are slower in
                        action, and overlooking the first beginnings of things, are at last aroused
                        by necessity itself so that some times through their very delays and
                        tardiness of movement while they wish to retain their ease even without
                        dignity, they, of their own accord, lose both. <milestone n="101" unit="section"/>But those who are desirous to be defenders of the
                        republic, if they be fickle men, soon give up the task; if they be at all
                        timid men, they abandon it; and those alone remain and endure everything for
                        the sake of the republic, who are such men as your father was, O Marcus
                        Scaurus, who resisted all seditious men, from the time of Caius Gracchus to
                        that of Quintus Varius, whom no violence, no threats, and no unpopularity
                        ever shook; or such as Quintus Metellus, the uncle of your mother; who, when
                        as censor he had branded a man most flourishing in the popular esteem,
                        Lucius Saturninus, and when he had expunged a pretended Gracchus from the
                        list of the citizens, in spite of the violence of an excited mob, and when
                        he alone had refused to swear obedience to a law which he considered had not
                        been legally enacted, preferred to abandon the city rather <pb n="202"/>
                        than his opinion; or, (to leave off quoting ancient examples, of which there
                        is an abundance worthy of the glory of this empire, while yet I avoid naming
                        any one who is now alive,) such as Quintus Catulus lately was, whom neither
                        the tempest of danger nor the breeze of honour could ever move from his

					<p>Imitate those men, I beg you in the name of the immortal gods, you who seek

                        to the eternal recollection of our annals, and are handed down to posterity.

                    </p>
					<p>The same poet says in another place, (a sentence which wicked citizens are
                        inclined to catch at,) &ldquo;Let them hate me, as long as they

                            <milestone n="103" unit="section"/>But nevertheless this path and this
                        system of undertaking public affairs was formerly more formidable, as in
                        many particulars the desire of the multitude and the whim of the people were
                        at variance with the interests of the republic. A law for the establishment
                        of the ballot was brought forward by Lucius Cassius. The people thought that
                        its liberties were at stake; the chief men of the state dissented, and in a
                        matter affecting the safety of the nobles, they feared the rashness of the
                        multitude, and the licentiousness of the ballot. Tiberius Gracchus brought
                        forward an Agrarian law. It was very acceptable to the people; the fortunes
                        of the poorer classes appeared likely to be established by it. The nobles
                        strove against it, because they saw that discord was excited by it; and
                        because, as the object of it was to deprive the wealthy men of their ancient
                        possessions, they thought that by it the republic was being deprived of its
                            <pb n="203"/> defenders. Caius Gracchus brought forward a law respecting
                        corn. It was a very pleasing proposal to the common people at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>; for food was to be supplied to them
                        in abundance without any trouble. The good resisted it because they thought
                        that its effect would be to lead the common people away from industry to
                        idleness, and because the treasury was likely to be drained by such a
                        measure. <milestone n="49" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="104" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>There have been also many cases within our own recollection, which I pass
                        over on purpose, in which the desire of the people has been at variance with
                        the wisdom of the nobles. At present there is no subject on which the people
                        need disagree with its chosen magistrates and with the nobles; it is not
                        demanding anything, nor is it eager for a revolution, and it is fond of its
                        own tranquillity, and pleased with the dignity and worth of every eminent
                        man, and with the glory of the whole republic. Therefore seditious and
                        turbulent men, because they cannot at present stir up the Roman people by
                        any bribery, since the common people, having gone through some most violent
                        seditious and discords, appear for the most for ease and tranquillity, now
                        hold packed assemblies, and do not concern themselves about saying or
                        proposing what those men who are present in the assembly may like to hear,
                        but they contrive by bribery and corruption that whatever they say may
                        appear to be what those men wish to hear. </p>
					<p><milestone n="105" unit="section"/> Do you think that the Gracchi, or that
                        Saturninus, or that any one of those ancient men who were considered devoted
                        to the interests of the people, had ever any hired fellows in their
                        assemblies? No one of those men ever stooped to such a course. For the mere
                        liberality of their proposed laws, and the hope of the advantage which was
                        held out to them, excited the multitude sufficiently without any bribery.
                        Therefore, in those times, those men who set up for friends of the people,
                        were hindered in their plans by wise and honourable men, but they were great
                        men in the opinion of the populace, and received every sort of honour from
                        them. They were applauded in the theatre; they gained whatever they sought
                        for by their suffrages; men loved their names, their language, their
                        countenances, their very gait. But those who opposed this class of men were
                        accounted wise and great men; they had great influence in the senate, great
                        influence among all <pb n="204"/> good men; but they were unpopular with the
                        multitude; their inclinations were frequently thwarted by the suffrages of
                        the populace; and if any one of them at any time received any applause in
                        the theatre, he began to be afraid that he had done something wrong; but at
                        the same time, if there was anything of more than ordinary importance under
                        discussion, then that same populace was chiefly influenced by the authority
                        of those men. <milestone n="50" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="106" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>Now, unless I am mistaken, the state is in such a condition, that if you take
                        away the artisans who are hired to support the party of these wicked men,
                        everybody in the republic appears to be of the same opinion. In truth, there
                        are three places in which the opinion and inclination of the Roman people
                        may be ascertained in the greatest degree; the assembly, the <foreign lang="la">comitia</foreign>, and the meetings at the games and at
                        exhibitions of gladiators. What assembly has there been of late years, which
                        has not been a packed and bribed one, but a genuine one, in which the
                        unanimity of the Roman people has not been very perceivable? Many assemblies
                        were held concerning me by that most wicked gladiator, to which no one ever
                        went who was unbribed, no one who was an honest man; no good man could
                        endure to behold that ill-omened countenance, or to listen to that frantic
                        voice. Those assemblies were, I admit that those assemblies of abandoned men
                        were necessarily turbulent. <milestone n="107" unit="section"/>Publius
                        Lentulus, too, held an assembly, also about my affairs. There was a vast
                        flocking to it of the whole Roman people; all ranks of society, all
                            <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> stood side by side in
                        that assembly. He argued my cause with the greatest authority, and the
                        greatest fluency of language amid such silent attention and such visible
                        approbation from every one, that nothing so pleasing appeared ever to have
                        fallen on the ears of the Roman people. Cnaeus Pompeius was brought forward
                        by him, who displayed himself then not only as the main author of my safety,
                        but even as a suppliant to the Roman people. His oration also was one of
                        great weight and was pleasing to the assembly. And I assert that no opinion
                        of his ever carried more authority with it; and that no eloquence of his was
                        ever more agreeable. With what silent attention were the other chief men of
                        the city listened to while speaking in my behalf;<milestone n="108" unit="section"/> whom I do not mention in this place, only lest my
                        speech, if I say too little of any one, <pb n="205"/> should seem ungrateful
                        and if I were to say enough of each individual, interminable. </p>
					<p>Turn now to the harangue of that same enemy of mine concerning me the same
                        person of whom those great men had been speaking, delivered in the Campus
                        Martins, to a genuine assembly of the people. Who was there who (I will not
                        say approved of it but who) did not think it a most scandalous thing that he
                        should be allowed to live and breathe at all, much less to speak? Who was
                        there who did not think that the republic was polluted by his voice and that
                        he himself, if he only listened to him was implicated in his wickedness?

					<p>I come now to the <foreign lang="la">comitia</foreign>, whether those for
                        electing magistrates or for enacting laws. We often see many laws passed. I
                        say nothing of those which are passed in such a manner that scarcely five
                        men, and those only of the lowest class, can be found to give a vote for
                        them. He says that at the time of that ruin of the republic he carried a law
                        respecting me, whom he called a tyrant and the destroyer of liberty. Who is
                        there who will confess that he gave a vote when this law was passed against
                        me? But when, in compliance with the same resolution of the senate, a law
                        was passed about me in the <foreign lang="la">comitia centuriata</foreign>
                        who is there who does not profess that then he was present, and that he gave
                        a vote in favour of my safety? Which cause then, is the one which only to
                        appear popular? that in which everything that is honourable in the city, and
                        every age, and every rank of men agree? or that to the carrying of which
                        some excited enemies fly as if hastening to banquet on the funeral of the

                        saw one more so. Why, even <pb n="206"/> when, in his youth, he might have
                        shared to some extent in the credit arising from the ample honours of that
                        most admirable man, Lucius Philippus, his step-father, he was so far from
                        being fond of the people, that he devoured the whole of his property by
                        himself. Afterwards, from having been a profligate and licentious young man,
                        after he had brought down his paternal property from the easy circumstances
                        in which stupid people take delight, to the strict rule of philosophers, he
                        wished to be considered a man of Greek learning, and a quiet scholar, and on
                        a sudden devoted himself to the study of literature. But his old Greeks did
                        not do him much good; his slaves who read to him, and his books, were often
                        pledged for wine; his appetite was as insatiable as ever; but his resources
                        fell short enough. Therefore he was perpetually occupied with thoughts of
                        revolution; he was growing old and weary of the peace and tranquillity of
                        the republic. <milestone n="52" unit="chapter"/></p>

                        Has he ever spoken well of any good man? Spoken well, do I say? Yes, rather,
                        is there any brave and good citizen whom he has not attacked in the most
                        wanton manner? A fellow who&mdash;not, I fancy, out of any desire, but
                        merely in order to seem a favourer of the common people&mdash;took a
                        freedwoman for his wife. <milestone n="111" unit="section"/>He voted
                        concerning me; he was present at the assembly; he was present at all the

                        avenged me well when he kissed my enemies with that impure mouth of his.
                        For, just as if it were owing to me that he has lost his property, he is an
                        enemy to me on that very account, because he has nothing left. Have I, O
                        Gellius, taken your patrimony from you, or have you devoured it? What? Were
                        you, you gulf and whirlpool of your patrimony, were you gormandising at my

                        because as consul I had defended the republic against you and your

                        of guardians he did not appoint you as one of the guardians of his children.
                        But I have been carried away by indignation on my own account and on that of
                        the republic (and I do not know which of us two he hates most) to say more
                        than I need have said against that most frantic and impoverished glutton.
                            <milestone n="112" unit="section"/>I return to my original subject,
                        that, when the proceedings were being carried on against me, while the city
                        was taken and oppressed, Gellius and Firmius and Titius, all Furies of the
                        same class, were the chiefs and leaders of those mercenary bands, while the
                        proposer of the law himself was in no respect free from being implicated in
                        their baseness, and audacity, and iniquity. But when the law was passed for
                        my restoration to my dignity, no one thought that either infirm health or
                        old age supplied him with any reasonable excuse for being absent, there was
                        no one who did not consider that by his vote he was recalling not only me
                        but also the republic at the same time to its ancient position. <milestone n="53" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="113" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>Let us now consider the <foreign lang="la">comitia</foreign> held for the
                        election of magistrates. There was lately a college of tribunes, among whom
                        three were considered not at all attached to the party of the people; but
                        three were supposed to be most violently so. Of those who were not
                        considered friends of the people and who were unable to stand before a
                        packed and bribed assembly of that sort, I see that two have been made
                        praetors by the Roman people and as far as I have been able to understand,
                        by the conversation of the common people and by their votes, the Roman
                        people openly alleged that the consistent and illustrious courage exhibited
                        by Cnaeus Domitius in his tribuneship and the good faith and fortitude of
                        Quintus Ancharius, would have been pleasing to them for the mere good-will
                        which it proved even if they had not been able to effect anything. We see,
                        now, what is the opinion which is entertained of Caius Fannius; and what the
                        opinion of the Roman people is likely to be when he seeks for honours, ought
                        to be doubtful to no one. <milestone n="114" unit="section"/>What more shall
                        I say? How did those two friends of the people fare? One, who however had
                        put some restraint on himself, had proposed no law; he had merely
                        entertained very different sentiments respecting the republic from those
                        which men expected of him as he <pb n="208"/> had been a virtuous and
                        innocent man, and one at all times esteemed by virtuous men; but as in his
                        tribuneship he had shown himself very little able to comprehend what was
                        approved by the genuine body of the people, and because he imagined that
                        that was the Roman people which attended those assemblies, he did not attain
                        that honour at which he would easily have arrived, if he had not hunted so
                        much after popularity. </p>
					<p>The other, who was so frantic in his desire for popularity, that he thought
                        neither the <foreign lang="la">auspices</foreign>, nor the Aelian law, nor
                        the authority of the senate, nor the consul, nor his colleagues, nor the
                        estimation of good men, of any importance at all, stood for the aedileship
                        along with some virtuous men of the highest character, but still not men in
                        the first rank for riches and personal influence; and did not get the vote
                        of even his own tribe. He lost also the vote of the <placeName key="tgn,3000935">Palatine</placeName> tribe, by the assistance of which
                        it used to be said that all those pests were able to annoy the Roman people;
                        and, indeed, (as was very acceptable to all good men,) he got nothing but
                        repulses at that <foreign lang="la">comitia</foreign>. You see, therefore,
                        that the very people itself&mdash;if I may use such an
                        expression&mdash;is not for a seeker after popularity, since it so
                        vehemently rejects those men who are accounted popular characters, and
                        considers those men the most worthy of honour who are the most opposed to
                        that class of men. <milestone n="54" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="115" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>Let us now come to the games. For the way in which I see your attention given
                        to me, and your eyes directed towards me makes me think that I may be
                        allowed now to speak in a lighter tone. At times the intimations of opinion
                        which take place in assemblies and <foreign lang="la">comitia</foreign> are
                        to be depended on; at times they are worthless and corrupt. The crowd of
                        spectators in the theatre and at the gladiatorial games, are said at all
                        times to pour forth their purchased applauses in small and scanty proportion
                        at the caprice of a few directors. But it is easy, when that is the case, to
                        see how it is done, and by whom, and what the entire people are doing. Why
                        need I tell you now what men, or what description of citizens, receive the
                        greatest applause? There is not one of you who is ignorant of this. However,
                        let this be a matter of slight consequence, not that it really is, since it
                        is given to every virtuous man; but, if it be a matter of slight
                        consequence, it <pb n="209"/> is so only to a wise man. But to him who
                        depends on the most trivial circumstances, who (as these men say themselves)
                        is fettered and guided by popular rumour and popular favour, it is
                        inevitable that applause must appear immortality and hissing death. </p>
					<p><milestone n="116" unit="section"/>I, then, ask you, above all men, O
                        Scaurus, you who have exhibited the most splendid and magnificent games of
                        all men,&mdash;whether any one of those popular characters was ever a
                        spectator of your games? whether any one of them ever trusted himself to the
                        theatre and to the Roman people? That very chief buffoon of all that man who
                        was not only spectator, but it the same time actor and
                        spouter,&mdash;that man who filled up all his sister's interludes who is
                        introduced into companies of women as a singing-girl,&mdash;neither
                        ventured to go to see your games in that furious tribuneship of his, nor any
                        other games either except those from which he had some difficulty in
                        escaping with his life. Once altogether, I say, did that popular man venture
                        to trust himself among the spectators of the games when in the temple of
                        Honour and Virtue honour was paid to virtue and when the monument of Caius
                        Marius, the preserver of this empire had afforded a place in which the
                        citizens could provide for the safety of a man who was a fellow citizen of
                        his own municipal town, and defender of the republic. <milestone n="55" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="117" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>And at that time it was shown plainly enough with reference to both parties
                        what were the real feelings of the Roman people in the first place when,
                        after having heard the resolution of the senate universal applause was given
                        to the proposer of the law and to the senate as a body, though it was not
                        present and secondly, when every individual senator, as he returned from the
                        senate to see the games, was received with loud clapping of hands. But, when
                        the consul himself, who was exhibiting the games, took his seat, then the
                        people stood undertaking him with extended hands, and with tears of joy
                        declared their good will towards and pity for me. But when that furious
                        enemy of mine with his senseless and frantic mind, arrived the Roman people
                        could hardly restrain itself; the men could hardly abstain from wreaking
                        their hatred on his foul and wicked person. Words indeed, and menacing
                        gestures of the hands and loud outcries in the war of abuse and of curses on
                        him were universal <pb n="210"/><milestone n="118" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>But why need I speak of the disposition and courage of the Roman people,
                        looking back on their liberty after their long slavery, as shown by their
                        conduct towards that man, whom, though he was at that time standing for the
                        aedileship, even the actors did not spare to his face. For as the play being
                        exhibited was one of Roman life,&mdash;&ldquo;The
                            Pretender,&rdquo;<note anchored="yes">This was a play of Afranius,
                            on the subject of the pretended madness of Junius Brutus, the expeller
                            of the Tarquins.</note> I believe,&mdash;the whole troop of actors,
                        speaking in most splendid concert, and looking in the face of this
                        profligate man, laid the greatest emphasis on the words, &ldquo;To such
                        a life as yours,&rdquo; and, &ldquo;The continued course and end of
                        your wicked life.&rdquo; He sat frightened out of his wits; and he, who
                        formerly used to pack the assemblies which he summoned with bands of noisy
                        buffoons, was now driven away by the voices of these same players. </p>
					<p>And since I have mentioned the games, I will not omit that circumstance, that
                        amid the great variety of sentences and apophthegms which occur in that
                        play, there was not one passage in which any expression of the poet had any
                        bearing on our times, which either escaped the notice of the main body of
                        the people, or on which particular emphasis was not laid by the actor.
                            <milestone n="119" unit="section"/>And I entreat you, while speaking on
                        this topic, O judges, not to think that I am led by any levity of
                        disposition to an unusual description of oratory, if in a court of justice I
                        speak of poets, and actors, and games. <milestone n="56" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>I am not, O judges, so ignorant of the forms of proceeding in trials, I am
                        not so inexperienced in speaking, as to hunt for topics of every sort, and
                        to gather and taste every sort of flower from every quarter. I know what is
                        due to your dignity, and to my duty as counsel for the defence, and to this
                        court, and to the character of Publius Sestius, and to the magnitude of his
                        danger, and to my own age and to my own honour. But I have considered that
                        while speaking on this point it was desirable to explain to the youth of the
                        city who were the best men. And in explaining that point it was necessary to
                        show that those men are not all friends of the people who are thought to be
                        so. And that I can do most easily, if I represent to them the genuine and
                        unbribed opinion of the Roman people, and the real inmost feelings of the
                        citizens. <pb n="211"/><milestone n="120" unit="section"/>

					<p>How was it that,&mdash;when the news of that resolution of the senate
                        which was passed in the temple of Virtue was fresh, and was brought to the
                        people while engaged in beholding the games, and to the actors on the stage,
                        in a very full house&mdash;that consummate actor, a man in truth who
                        always performs the best part in the republic as he does on the stage
                        weeping both from recent joy and also from a mixture of grief and regret for
                        me, pleaded my cause before the Roman people in much more impressive
                        language than I could possibly have pleaded for myself? For he gave a
                        representation of the genius of the great poet whose play was being acted
                        not merely by his art as an actor, but by his real grief. &ldquo;What,
                        shall he who with a constant mind assisted and supported the state; who has
                        always stood on the side of the Greeks<gap desc="* * *"/>&rdquo; He said
                        that I had always stood on your side; he pointed to your ranks; he was
                        encored by every body. &ldquo;Who in a critical state of affairs, did
                        not hesitate to expose his life, did not spare his own person or
                            privileges<gap desc="* * *"/>.&rdquo; <milestone n="121" unit="section"/> What shouts were raised as he recited these passages!
                        when, omitting all consideration of his acting, the people applauded the
                        words of the poet and the zeal of the actor, and the encouragement of their
                        expectations respecting me. &ldquo;A most excellent friend, in a most
                        important war<gap desc="* * *"/>:&rdquo; for the actor added that of
                        himself, from his friendly inclination towards me; and perhaps men applauded
                        it on account of their regret for me: &ldquo;A man endowed with the
                        highest ability.&rdquo; <milestone n="57" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>Then came those words in the same play, with what groans on the part of the
                        Roman people were they accompanied when the actor repeated them!
                        &ldquo;Oh my father<gap desc="* * *"/>.&rdquo; He thought
                        me,&mdash;me, I say, deserving to be lamented as his father, whom
                        Quintus Catulus and whom many other men had repeatedly styled in the senate
                        the Father of my country. With what great weeping for my ruin and for the
                        confirmation of my property were his words accompanied, when he deplored his
                        father driven away, his country afflicted, his house burnt and destroyed. He
                        acted in such a manner, when after having dilated on his former fortune, he
                        turned his description in this way. &ldquo;All these things have I seen
                        destroyed by fire<gap desc="* * *"/>,&rdquo; as to rouse the tears of
                        even my enemies and my enviers. <milestone n="122" unit="section"/> O ye
                        immortal gods, what did he do next? in <pb n="212"/> what way did he
                        pronounce the next words? which indeed seem to me to have been acted and
                        written in such a manner, that they might appropriately have been uttered
                        even by Catulus himself, if he had come to life again; for he was;
                        accustomed at times to reprove and attack the precipitate counsels of the
                        people, and the blunders of the senate as well, with great freedom.
                        &ldquo;O ungrateful Argives; empty-headed Greeks; forgetful of
                        kindness!&rdquo; That, indeed, was not true; for they were not
                        ungrateful, but miserable in not being allowed to secure the safety of that
                        man from whom they had received their own: nor was any body ever more
                        grateful to another than all of them were to me. But still what that most
                        eloquent poet wrote was; applicable to me; and that not only best but also
                        boldest of actors applied it to me, when he pointed at all orders of
                        citizens, and accused the senate, the Roman knights, and the whole Roman
                        people: &ldquo;You allow him to be banished, you have voted for his
                        being driven away, you endure his being driven away.&rdquo; I myself
                        only know by report what indications every one then gave of their feelings
                        on that occasion, and how universally the whole Roman people declared their
                        inclinations towards a man who had never sought to curry favour with the
                        people; but they can judge more accurately of that who were present.
                            <milestone n="58" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="123" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>And since my speech has carried me on to this point the actor bewailed my
                        misfortune so repeatedly, while he was pleading my cause so mournfully, that
                        his beautiful voice was hindered by his tears. Nor were the poets, whose
                        genius I have always had an affection for, wanting to my necessities at that
                        time, and the Roman people approved of their words, not only with their
                        applause, but even with their groans. Ought then Aesop or Accius to have
                        said these things on my behalf of the Roman people had been free, or ought
                        they to have left them to the chief men of the state to say? In the Brutus,
                        I was mentioned by name: &ldquo;Tullius, who had established the liberty
                        of the citizens.&rdquo; It was encored again and again. Did the Roman
                        people appear to be giving slight indications that it had been established
                        by me and by the senate, though profligate citizens accused us as having
                        destroyed it? <milestone n="124" unit="section"/>But above all other times
                        the sentiments of the entire Roman people were declared at the <pb n="213"/>
                        exhibition of the gladiatorial games. For they were the gift of Scipio,
                        worthy both of him and Quintus Metellus, in whose honour they were given.
                        And they are a spectacle of that sort which is attended by immense numbers
                        and by every class of men, and with which the multitude is delighted above
                        all things into that crowd of spectators came Publius Sestius as tribune of
                        the people when during his whole period of office he had been nothing
                        whatever but serving my cause and he went among the people, not from any
                        personal desire of applause but that our enemies might themselves see the
                        inclinations of the universal people. He came, as you know, to the Maenian
                        pillar, and such great applause ensued from all the places for beholding the
                        spectacle all the way from the Capitol, and such universal clapping of hands
                        from every seat, that it was said that there had never been in any cause
                        whatever, greater or more manifest unanimity on the part of the Roman
                        people. <milestone n="125" unit="section"/>Where at that time were those
                        regulators of the assemblies, those masters of the laws, those expellers of

                        we have given offence, and by whom we are hated? <milestone n="59" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>I think, indeed, that there never was a time when the people were assembled
                        in greater crowds, than that time of those gladiatorial games; neither at
                        any assembly, nor even at any <foreign lang="la">comitia</foreign>. What
                        then did this innumerable multitude of men, this extraordinary indication of
                        the will of the entire Roman people, without the slightest disagreement on
                        those very days when it was thought that my cause was going to be decided,
                        declare, except that the safety and dignity of the best citizens was dear to
                        the entire Roman people? <milestone n="126" unit="section"/>But that tribune
                        of the people, who was accustomed to put questions to the assembly, not
                        according to the usual custom of his father, or his grandfather, or his
                        great grandfather, or of any of his ancestors, but like a Greek
                        schoolmaster, &ldquo;Did they wish me to return?&rdquo; and when an
                        outcry was raised against it by the faint voices of his hirelings, he said
                        that the Roman people affirmed that they had no such wish,&mdash;he,
                        though he used to go and see the gladiators every day, was never seen when
                        he did come. He used to emerge on a sudden after he had crept along under
                        the benches, so that he seemed as if he were going to say, <pb n="214"/>
                        &ldquo;Mother, I call you.&rdquo;<note anchored="yes">These words,
                            quoted also by Horace, are from Pacuvius's play of Ilione, the mother of

                            Polydorus.</note> And so that dark way by which he used to come to see
                        the games was called the Appian Road. But still, the moment the people got
                        sight of him, not only the gladiators, but the very horses of the
                        gladiators, were frightened at the sudden hisses that ensued. <milestone n="127" unit="section"/>Do you not see, then, what a great difference
                        there is between the Roman people and an assembly? Do you not see that the
                        masters of the assemblies are the object of the hatred of the Roman people?
                        and that those who are not permitted to appear without insult in the
                        assembly of artisans, are honoured by every possible mark of respect by the

					<p>Certainly, I suppose I was anxious for violence, who, as long as there was

                        been undermined and injured if it had not been for violence. <milestone n="128" unit="section"/>Was I to regret such a recall as this, which was
                        so honourable to me that I am almost afraid of seeming to have left the city
                        from a covetousness of glory, in order to return in such a manner? For what
                        citizen except me did the senate ever recommend to the protection of foreign
                        nations? For whose safety except mine did the senate ever publicly return
                        thanks to the allies of the Roman people? I am the only person concerning
                        whom the conscript fathers ever decreed that whoever went in command to any

                        of my safety and my life. Mine is the only cause since the foundation of the
                        city in which every one who had any regard for the safety of the republic

                        thought it necessary to decree for the preservation of my individual safety.
                        Who was <pb n="215"/> ever more regretted in the senate house? who was ever

                        became deserted, melancholy, mute, full of grief and lamentation. What spot

                        preserved the country; and the senate in the fullest possible house adopted
                        his opinion so entirely that only one enemy of mine dissented from it, and
                        the decree as supported by Pompeius was recorded in the public registers for
                        the eternal recollection of posterity? Or that which was passed the next day

                        of those men who had come up from the municipal towns to the effect that no
                        one was to observe the heavens that no one was to cause any delay whatever,
                        that if any one did so, he should be considered at once as one who wished to
                        overturn the republic, and the senate would be very much offended, and that
                        a motion should be immediately made respecting his conduct? And when the
                        senate, meeting in great numbers, had checked the wickedness and audacity of
                        some of those men by its authority and dignity, it added this clause,
                        moreover; that if within the next five days in which my affairs could be
                        discussed, they were not brought to a termination, I was to return to my
                        country and be restored to all my former dignities. <milestone n="62" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>The senate decreed at the same time that thanks should be given to those men
                        who had come up from all parts of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> for the sake of my safety; and that they should be
                        requested to come again when the consideration of the subject was renewed.
                            <milestone n="130" unit="section"/>And there was such a rivalry between
                        all people to show their zeal for my safety, that the very men to <pb n="216"/> whom entreaties were addressed in my behalf by that senate,
                        did also themselves address entreaties to the senate respecting me; and,
                        accordingly, in all those transactions but one man alone was found who
                        openly dissented from this earnest unanimity of all good men, so that even
                        Quintus Metellus, the consul, who had been in a very great degree an enemy
                        to me in the violent party contests which had arisen about political
                        affairs, himself, made a motion in favour of my safety. And when he, being
                        roused up by the exceeding authority of Publius Servilius, and also by a
                        certain energy which gave weight to his eloquence, when he had invoked all
                        the Metelli from the shades below, and had diverted the thoughts of his
                        relation from the piratical attempts of Clodius to the dignity of that
                        family by which they were connected together; and when he had brought him
                        back to the recollection of their great domestic example and to the fate
                        (shall I call it glorious, or melancholy?) of that great man Metellus
                        Numidicus; then, I say, that illustrious man,&mdash;that genuine
                        Metellus wept, and gave himself up from that moment to Publius Servilius
                        even before he had come to the end of his speech. Nor could he, as a man of
                        the same illustrious family, withstand that godlike dignity of eloquence so
                        pregnant with the virtues of old time, and, though I was absent, he still
                        became reconciled to me from that moment. <milestone n="131" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>And certainly, if it be the case that illustrious men retain any sense or
                        feeling after death, then he did a thing which was most acceptable to all
                        the Metelli, and, above all, to that bravest of men and best of citizens,
                        his own brother, the companion of all my labours, and dangers, and counsels.

					<p>But who is there who is ignorant of what a triumphant return mine was? how
                        the people of <placeName key="perseus,Brundusium">Brundusium</placeName>
                        held out to me on my arrival the right hand, as it were, of all <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, and of my country herself; and when
                        the same day, the fifth of August, was the day of my arrival, and also the
                        birthday of my dearest daughter, whom I then beheld for the first time after
                        our long regret for one another, and our mourning; and was also the day
                        consecrated as the day of the foundation of that very colony of <placeName key="perseus,Brundusium">Brundusium</placeName>; and also the
                        anniversary of the dedication of the temple of Salus, as you know. And when
                        I had been received into the joyful house of those most excellent and
                        learned men, Laenius <pb n="217"/> Flaccus and his father and brother which
                        had received me with tears the year before when I was leaving <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> and had defended me not without risk
                        and danger to itself; and when along my whole road all the cities of
                            <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> seemed to be keeping the
                        days of my arrival as days of festivity and the roads themselves were filled
                        with a multitude of deputies sent from all quarters, and there was a vast
                        throng of men crowding towards the city, full of exultation and
                        congratulation to me; and my whole path up from the gate of the city, my
                        ascent to the Capitol and my return to my house, was of such a nature, that
                        amid my excessive joy I grieved also that so grateful a city should be so
                        miserable and so ill-treated. <milestone n="132" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>You now, then have an answer to the question which you put to
                        me&mdash;who were the best men? They are not a race, as you termed them,
                        an expression which I recognised at once, for it was one invented by that
                        man by whom above all others, Publius Sestius sees himself
                        opposed,&mdash;by that man who has wished the whole of this race of
                        Romans destroyed and slaughtered,&mdash;who has constantly reproached
                        and constantly attacked Caius Caesar, a very mild-tempered man and very
                        averse to bloodshed, asserting that he, as long as that race lived, would
                        never be free from anxiety. He gained nothing by his attacks on the whole
                        body, but he never ceased to urge the point against me. He attacked me first
                        of all by the instrumentality of the informer Vettius, to whom he put
                        questions in the assembly, concerning me, and concerning the most
                        illustrious men in the state. But while doing this, he joined those citizens
                        in the same danger with me, bringing forward the same accusations against
                        them, so as to deserve great gratitude from me for connecting me with the
                        most honourable and bravest of men. <milestone n="64" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="133" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>But afterwards he in a most wicked manner contrived all sorts of plots
                        against me, for no provocation which I had given him, except inasmuch as I
                        was anxious to please all virtuous men. He was every day mentioning some
                        fault of mine to those men whom he could get to listen to him; he warned the
                        man who was of all others the most friendly to me, Cnaeus Pompeius, to
                        beware of entering my house, and to be on his guard against me; he united
                        himself with my chief enemy, in such a manner that he said, with respect to
                        that proscription of mine which Sextus Clodius, a fellow thoroughly worthy
                        of his <pb n="218"/> associates, promoted, that he was the tablet on which
                        it was written, and that he himself was the writer. And he alone of our
                        whole order openly exulted at my departure and at your grief. And I, for my
                        part, O judges, though he was every day attacking me, never said one word
                        against him; nor did I think, while I was being attacked by every sort of
                        engine and weapon of violence, and an army, and a mob, that it was suited to
                        my dignity to complain of one archer more. </p>
					<p>He says that my acts displease him. Who doubts that? when he despises that
                        law which expressly forbids any one to exhibit shows of gladiators within
                        two years of his having stood, or being about to stand, for any office.
                            <milestone n="134" unit="section"/>And in that, O judges, I cannot
                        sufficiently marvel at his rashness. He acts most openly against the law;
                        and he does so, who is a man who is neither able to slip out of the
                        consequences of a trial by his pleasant manner, nor to struggle out of them
                        by his popularity, nor to break down the laws and courts of justice by his
                        wealth and influence. What can induce the fellow to be so intemperate? I
                        imagine it is out of his excessive covetousness of popularity, that he
                        bought that troop of gladiators, so beautiful, noble, and magnificent. He
                        knew the inclination of the people, he saw that great clamours and
                        gatherings of the people would ensue. And elated with this expectation, and
                        burning with a desire of glory, he could not restrain himself from bringing
                        forward those gladiators, of whom he himself was the finest specimen. If
                        that were the motive for his violation of the law, and if he were prompted
                        by zeal to please the people on account of the recent kindness of the Roman
                        people to himself, still no one would pardon him; but as the fact is that
                        this band did not consist of men picked out of those who were for sale, but
                        of men bought out of jails, and adorned with gladiatorial names, while he
                        drew lots to see whom he would call Samnites, and whom Challengers, who
                        could avoid having fears as to what might be the end of such licentiousness
                        and such undisguised contempt for the laws?</p>
					<p>
                        <milestone n="135" unit="section"/>But he brings forward two arguments in
                        his defence. First of all, &ldquo;I exhibit,&rdquo; says he,
                        &ldquo;men fighting with beasts, and the law only speaks of
                        gladiators.&rdquo; A very clever idea! Listen now to a statement which
                        is still more ingenious. He says <pb n="219"/> that he has not exhibited
                        gladiators, but one single gladiator; and that he has limited the whole of
                        his aedileship to this one exhibition. A true aedileship truly. One lion,
                        two hundred men who fight with beasts. However, let him urge this defence. I
                        wish him to feel confidence in his case; for he is in the habit of appealing
                        to the tribunes of the people, and to use violent means to upset those
                        tribunals in which be has not confidence. And I do not so much wonder that
                        he despises my law, as having been framed by a man whom he considers his
                        enemy, as at his having made up his mind to regard no law whatever which has
                        been passed by a consul. He despises the Caecilian Didian law and the
                        Licinian Junian law. Does he also deny that the law of Caius
                        Caesar&mdash;who he is in the habit of boasting has been adorned and
                        strengthened and armed by his law and by his kindness, respecting extortion
                        and corruption,&mdash;is a law? And do they complain that there are
                        other men, too, who wish to rescind the acts of Caesar, while this most
                        excellent law is neglected by his brother-in-law and by this slave?
                            <milestone n="65" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>And the prosecutor has dared, while pleading in this cause, to exhort you, O
                        judges, to show at last some severity, and at length to apply some healing
                        measures to the republic. But that is not a remedy when the knife is applied
                        to some sound and healthy part of the body, that is the act of an
                        executioner and mere inhumanity. Those are the men who really apply healing
                        remedies to the republic, who cut out some pestilence as if it were a wen on
                        the person of the state. <milestone n="136" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>But in order that my speech may have some termination, and that I may cease
                        speaking before you are weary of listening to me with attention, I will
                        finish my argument about the party of the best men and about their leaders
                        and about those who are the chief defenders of the republic. I will stir you
                        up, O young men, especially you who are of noble birth, to the imitation of
                        your ancestors and I will exhort you who have the opportunity of arriving at
                        high rank by the exercise of genius and virtue to adopt that line of conduct
                        by which many new men have become crowned with honour and glory. <milestone n="137" unit="section"/>This, believe me, is the only path to praise,
                        and dignity and honour,&mdash;to be praised and beloved by men who are
                        wise and good, and endowed with good dispositions by nature; to <pb n="220"/> become acquainted with the constitution of the state, as it has been most
                        wisely established by our ancestors, who, when they could no longer endure
                        the power of a king, created annual magistrates on the principle of making
                        the senate the perpetual supreme council of the republic, and of allowing
                        men to be elected into that body by the whole people, and of opening the
                        road to that supreme order to the industry and virtue of all the citizens.
                        They established the senate as the guardian, and president, and protector of
                        the republic; they chose the magistrates to depend on the authority of this
                        order, and to be as it were the ministers of this most dignified council;
                        and they contrived that the senate itself should be strengthened by the high
                        respectability of those ranks which came nearest to it, and so be able to
                        defend and promote the liberties and interests of the common people.
                            <milestone n="66" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="138" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>Those who defend these institutions with all their might are the best men, of
                        whatever rank they are; and they who chiefly support all these offices and
                        the republic on their necks as it were, are accounted the chiefs of the
                        party of the best men,&mdash;the chief advisers and preservers of the
                        state. I confess that there are, as I have said before, many adversaries and
                        enemies to, and enviers of, this class of men, that there are many dangers
                        in their path, that many injuries are heaped upon them, that many labours
                        have necessarily to be experienced and undergone by them. But all my speech
                        is addressed to virtue, and not to sloth; to dignity, and not to luxury; to
                        those men who look upon themselves as born for their country, for their
                        fellow-citizens, for praise, for glory, not for sleep, for banquets, and
                        soft delights. For if there be any men who are influenced wholly by
                        pleasures, and who have given themselves entirely up to the seductions of
                        vices and to the gratification of their desires, let them abandon all desire
                        for honours; let them abstain from meddling with the republic; let them be
                        satisfied with enjoying their ease, and owing it to the labour of virtuous
                        and brave men. </p>
					<p><milestone n="139" unit="section"/>But they who desire the good report of
                        good men, which is the only thing which is really entitled to be called
                        glory, ought to seek ease and pleasures for others and not for themselves.
                        They must toil for the common advantage; they must incur enmities, and often
                        encounter tempests, for the sake of the republic; they must combat with many
                        audacious and wicked <pb n="221"/> men,&mdash;sometimes even with men of
                        great influence. This is what we have heard of the sentiments and actions of
                        the most illustrious men; this is what tradition reports of them, and what
                        we have read nor do we ever see those men loaded with praise who from time
                        to time have stirred up the minds of men to sedition or who by bribery have
                        corrupted the rich nations of the ignorant or who have brought brave and
                        illustrious men, who have deserved well of the republic into odium and
                        unpopularity. Our countrymen have always thought such men as those
                        contemptible and audacious and wicked and mischievous citizens. But they who
                        have checked the violence and the attempts of those men, they who by their

                        have resisted the designs of audacious men, have been at all times
                        considered wise and good men, the chiefs, and leaders and advisers of this
                        order of this dignified body, and of the empire. <milestone n="67" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="140" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>And let no one on account of what has happened to me, or perhaps to one or
                        two others besides, fear to adopt this plan of life. One man in this state
                        whom I can mention, a man who had done great services to the republic,
                        Lucius Opimius, did fall in a most shameful manner. And if his grave is a
                        deserted one on the shore of <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Dyrrachium</placeName>, he has a most superb monument in our forum. And
                        the Roman people itself at all times delivered him from danger, though he
                        was exceedingly unpopular with the mob on account of the death of Caius
                        Gracchus; and it was a storm coming from another quarter&mdash;from an
                        iniquitous judicial derision which crushed that illustrious citizen. But the
                        other men who have done good service to the state have either if for a while
                        they have been stricken by any sudden violence or tempest of popular odium,
                        been restored again and recalled by the people of its own accord, or else
                        they have passed their whole lives without any such injuries or attacks. But
                        they who have disregarded the wisdom of the senate, and the authority of
                        good men, and the established rules of our ancestors, and have sought to
                        become agreeable to an ignorant and excited multitude, have nearly all
                        suffered just retribution and made atonement to the republic either by
                        instant death, or shameful exile. <milestone n="141" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>But it even among the Athenians, a nation of Greeks, far removed from the
                        serious wisdom of our ancestors, there were <pb n="222"/> not wanting men to
                        defend the republic against the rashness of the people;&mdash;though
                        every one who ever did so was sure to be banished from the
                        city;&mdash;if the great Themistocles, the preserver of his country, was
                        not deterred from defending the republic, either by the calamity of
                        Miltiades, who had saved that state only a little before, or by the
                        banishment of Aristides, who is said to have been the greatest of all men:
                        and if, after his time, many illustrious men of the same state, whom it is
                        unnecessary for me to mention by name, in spite of the numerous instances of
                        the popular ill-temper and fickleness which they had before them, still
                        defended that republic of theirs; what ought we to do who, in the first
                        place, have been born in that city which appears to me to be the very
                        birth-place of wisdom and dignity and magnanimity; and who, in the second
                        place, are raised on such a pinnacle of glory that all human things may well
                        appear insignificant by the side of it; and who, lastly, have undertaken to
                        uphold that republic, which is one of such dignity, that to slay a man who
                        is defending it is no less a crime than to attack it and to endeavour to
                        seize the supreme power? <milestone n="68" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="142" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>Those Greeks whom I have just mentioned, having been unjustly condemned and
                        banished by their fellow-citizens, still, because they deserved well of
                        their state, enjoy such renown at this present time, not in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> alone, but among ourselves also,
                        and in other lands, that no one ever mentions the names of those men by whom
                        they were oppressed, and that every one prefers their disasters to the
                        superior power of their enemies. Who of the Carthaginians was superior to
                        Hannibal in wisdom, and valour, and actual achievements? a man who
                        single-handed fought for so many years for empire and for glory with such
                        numbers of our generals. His own fellow-citizens banished him from the city;
                        but we see that he, though our enemy, is celebrated in the writings and
                        recollection of our citizens. </p>
					<p><milestone n="143" unit="section"/> Let us then imitate our Bruti, our
                        Camilli, and Ahalae our Decii, our Curius, and Fabricius, and Maximus, our
                        Scipios, our Lentuli, our Aemilii, and countless others, who have given
                        liberty to this republic; all of whom I consider deserving of being ranked
                        among the company and number of the immortal gods. Let us love our country,
                        let us obey the senate, let us consult the interests of the good; let us <pb n="223"/> disregard present rewards, and fix our eyes on the glory which
                        we shall receive from posterity. Let us think that the most desirable
                        conduct, which is the most upright; let us hope for whatever we choose, but
                        bear whatever befalls us, let us consider, lastly, that the bodies of brave
                        men and great citizens are mortal, but that the impulses of the mind and the
                        glory of virtue are everlasting. And let us not if we see that the opinion
                        is consecrated by the most holy example of the great Hercules, whose body
                        indeed has been burnt but whose life and virtue are said to have received
                        instant immortality, think any the less that they who by their counsels and
                        labours have either increased the greatness or defended the safety, or
                        preserved the existence of this great republic have acquired everlasting

					<p>But suddenly, O judges, while speaking of the dignity and renown of those
                        valiant and most illustrious citizens, and while I was preparing to say
                        still more on that subject, I have been checked in the onward progress of my
                        speech by the sight of these men. I see Publius Sestius the defender and
                        upholder and chief maintainer of my safety and of your authority, and of the
                        cause of the commonwealth on his trial as a criminal; I see his young son
                        present here before you, gazing on me with tearful eyes, I see <persName><surname>Milo</surname></persName> the vindicator of your liberty, the
                        guardian of my safety the support and defence of the afflicted republic, the
                        extinguisher of the piratical attempts of our domestic enemies, the
                        repressor of daily bloodshed, the defender alike of the temples of the gods
                        and of the houses of individuals the bulwark of the senate-house, in
                        mourning apparel, and under a prosecution. I see Publius Lentulus, to whose
                        father I pay my salutations as the protecting deity and parent of my fortune
                        and my name, and of my brother, and of all my hopes and property in the
                        miserable garb and squalid condition of an impeached man: I see the man who
                        in the course of last year received the robe of manhood by the will of his
                        father, and the purple robe by the deliberate choice<note anchored="yes">Publius Lentulus had been named one of the college of augurs, in spite
                            of his youth, which was a legal disqualification for such an office, in
                            compliment to his father.</note> of the people, now, in this year, in
                        the same robe seeking to avert by his entreaties the sudden infliction of
                        this most iniquitous decree, supplicating you on <pb n="224"/> behalf of his
                        most gallant father, and your most illustrious citizen. <milestone n="145" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>And these mourning robes of so many and of such illustrious citizens, and
                        these signs of grief, and these tokens of abasement have all been put on for
                        my single sake; because they defended me, because they grieve for my
                        misfortune and for my grief, because, in compliance with the entreaties of
                        all of you, they restored me to my mourning country, to the senate who
                        demanded me back, and to <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> who
                        entreated my recall. What great wickedness is imputed to me? What great
                        crime did I commit on that day; on that day, I say, when I laid before you
                        the proofs against, and the letters and confessions of those men who were
                        seeking the general destruction; when I obeyed your commands? But, if it be
                        a wicked thing to love one's country, still I have suffered punishment
                        enough; my house has been pulled down, my property has been pillaged; my
                        children have been scattered abroad, my wife has been insulted, my most
                        excellent brother, a man of incredible affection and unheard-of devotion to
                        me, has fallen, with all the emblems of most bitter grief, at the feet of my
                        bitterest enemies; I have been driven from my altars, from my hearth, from
                        my household gods; I have been separated from my friends and torn from my
                        country, which (to say the very least) I had most undoubtedly shielded; I
                        have endured the cruelty of my enemies, the wickedness of faithless men, and
                        the dishonesty of envious ones. <milestone n="146" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>If this is not enough, because all this appears to be defaced by my return;
                        it were better&mdash;it were far better, I say, for me, O judges, to
                        fall back again into the same misfortune as before, than to bring such
                        calamity on my defenders and preservers. Would it be possible for me to
                        remain in this city after those men have been driven away from it, who alone
                        enabled me again to enjoy this city? I cannot do so&mdash;it will not be
                        possible for me, O judges,&mdash;nor shall this boy, who now, by his
                        tears, shows how great his filial affection is, ever behold me in safety if
                        he loses the presence of his father on account of his kindness to me; nor
                        shall he, as often as he sees me, groan, and say that he beholds a man who
                        has been the ruin of himself and of his father. I, in every fortune,
                        whatever may befall me, will cling to you; nor shall <pb n="225"/> any
                        fortune ever separate me from those men whom you, O judges, behold in
                        mourning apparel for my sake. Nor shall those nations to whom the senate
                        recommended me, and to whom it gave thanks for their treatment of me, ever
                        see this man as an exile on account of his conduct to me, without seeing me
                        as his companion. <milestone n="147" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>But the immortal gods, who received me on my arrival in their temples,
                        accompanied by these men and by Publius Lentulus the consul, and the
                        republic itself, than which there is nothing more holy, have entrusted these
                        things, O judges, to your power. You are able by your decision to encourage
                        the minds of all virtuous men, and to check the designs of the wicked; you
                        are able by your decision to avail yourselves of the services of the
                        virtuous citizens, to strengthen me, and to renew the republic. Wherefore, I
                        beseech and entreat you, if you wish for my safety, to save those men by
                        whose instrumentality you have recovered me. </p>

					<head> THE SPEECH OF M. T. CICERO AGAINST PUBLIUS VATINIUS; CALLED ALSO, THE EXAMINATION OF PUBLIUS VATINIUS.</head>
					<argument>
						<head>THE ARGUMENT.</head>
						<p>This speech arose out of the preceding one. Vatinius was a partisan and
                            creature of Caesar's and instigated by him to appear as a witness
                            against Sestius on his trial and Cicero was so indignant at a man of so
                            infamous a character appearing against his friend that be exposed the
                            whole iniquity of his life by the severity of his examination and the
                            searching nature of the questions which he put to him. And he says of
                            this speech himself (<bibl n="Cic. Fam. 1.9"><title>Epist. Fam.</title>
                                i. 9</bibl>): &ldquo;The whole of my examination of him
                            consisted of nothing but a reproof of his conduct in his tribuneship;
                            and I spoke with great freedom, and the greatest earnestness and
                            indignation.&rdquo; </p>
						<p>Vatinius had also, while replying to Cicero's questions, attacked Cicero
                            himself as having been a turncoat, and being now anxious himself to
                            curry favour with Caesar, because he saw that his affairs were becoming
                            more prosperous than they had been, and reminded him of his having not
                            always entertained a favourable opinion of Caesar; and Cicero replied,
                            that he still preferred the condition of Bibulus's consulship to the
                            triumphs and victories of any one whatever.</p>

					<p>If, O Vatinius, I had chosen to regard merely what the unworthiness of your
                        character deserved, I should have <pb n="226"/> treated you in a way that
                        would have been very pleasing to these men, and, as your evidence could not,
                        on account of the infamy of your life and the scandal of your private
                        conduct, be possibly considered of the slightest consequence, I should have
                        dismissed you without saying a single word to you. For not one of these men
                        considered it worth my while either to refute you, as if you were an
                        adversary of any importance, or to question you, as if you were a scrupulous
                        witness. But I was, perhaps, a little more intemperate just now than I
                        should have been. For from detestation of you, in which, although, on
                        account of your wicked conduct to me, I ought to go beyond all men, yet I am
                        in fact surpassed by everybody, I was carried away so far, that though I did
                        not despise you at all less than I detest you, still I chose to dismiss you
                        in embarrassment and distress, rather than in contempt. </p>
					<p><milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Wherefore, that you may not wonder at my
                        having paid you this compliment of putting questions to you, whom no one
                        thinks worthy of being spoken to or visited, whom no one thinks deserving of
                        a vote, or of the rights of a citizen, or even of the light of life; know
                        that no motive would have induced me to do so, except that of repressing
                        that ferocity of yours, and crushing your audacity, and checking your
                        loquacity by entangling it in the few questions I should put to you. In
                        truth, you ought, O Vatinius, even if you had become suspected by Publius
                        Sestius undeservedly, still to pardon me, if, on the occasion of such great
                        danger to a man who has done me such great services, I had yielded to the
                        consideration of what his necessities required, and what his inclination
                        deserved of me. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>But you unintentionally
                        showed a few moments ago that you spoke falsely in the evidence which you
                        gave yesterday, when you asserted that you had never had the least
                        conversation with Albinovanus, not only about the prosecution of Sestius,
                        but about anything whatever; and yet you said just now that Titus Claudius
                        had been in communication with you, and had asked your advice with respect
                        to the conduct of the prosecution against Sestius, and that Albinovanus, who
                        you had said before was hardly known to you, had come to your house, and had
                        held a long conversation with you. And lastly, you said that you had given
                        to Albinovanus the written harangues of Publius Sestius, which he had never
                        had any knowledge of, and did not know <pb n="227"/> where to find, and that
                        they had been read at this trial. And by one of these statements you
                        confessed that the accusers had been instructed and suborned by you; and by
                        the other you confessed your own inconsistency, liable to the double charge
                        of folly and of perjury; when you stated that the man who you had previously
                        said was an entire stranger to you, had come to your house, and that you had
                        given the documents which he asked for to aid him in his accusation to a man
                        whom you had from the beginning considered a trickster and a prevaricator.

					<p>You are too impetuous and fierce by nature. You do not think it allowable for
                        a word to escape from any man's mouth which may not fall pleasantly and
                        complimentary on your ears. You came forward in a rage with everybody which
                        I perceived and comprehended the moment I saw you, before you began to
                        speak, while Gellius, the dry nurse of all seditious men, was giving his
                        evidence before you. For on a sudden you sprang forward like a serpent out
                        of his hole, with eyes starting out of your head and your neck inflated and
                        your throat swelling so that <milestone n="5" unit="section"/><gap desc="* * * * * *"/> I defended my old friend, who was, nevertheless an
                        acquaintance of yours, though in this city an attack on another, such as you
                        are now making, is sometimes found fault with, but the defence of a man
                        never is. </p>
					<p>But I ask you why I should not defend Caius Cornelius? I ask whether
                        Cornelius has ever passed any law in defiance of the <foreign lang="la">auspices</foreign>? whether he has despised the Aelian or the Fufian
                        law? when he has offered violence to the consul? whether he has occupied any
                        temple with armed men? whether he has driven away by violence any magistrate
                        who was exercising his veto? whether he has profaned any religious
                        ceremonies? whether he has drained the treasury? whether he has pillaged the
                        republic? These, all these, are actions of yours. No imputation of this sort
                        is cast upon Cornelius. He was said to have read a document.<note anchored="yes">There is some corruption in the text here.</note> It was
                        urged in his defence, his colleagues giving evidence in support of his
                        cause, that he read it not for the sake of reading it but for the sake of
                        examining it more particularly. However, it was quite certain that Cornelius
                        dismissed the council that day, and submitted to the interposition of the
                        veto. But you who are <pb n="228"/> offended at my defending Cornelius, what
                        cause do you bring to your advocates to uphold, or what countenance have you
                        to show? when you already point out to them in an imperious manner, what a
                        disgrace it will be to them if they defend you by thinking the defence of
                        Cornelius a matter for accusation and abuse of me. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>However, Vatinius, remember this&mdash;that a little after the time when
                        I defended him in a way which you say gave great offence to all good men, I
                        was appointed consul in the most honourable manner in which any one has been
                        elected since the memory of man, not only by the exceeding zeal in my behalf
                        of the entire Roman people, but also by the special and extraordinary
                        exertions in my cause of every virtuous man; and that I gained all these
                        honours by living in a modest manner, which you have over and over again
                        said that you hoped to obtain by dealing in the most impudent
                            prophecies.<note anchored="yes">The critics say that Cicero intends a

					<p>For as regards your having blamed me for my departure, and your having
                        attempted to renew the grief and lamentation of those men to whom that day
                        was most miserable, which, however, was to you most joyful, I will make you
                        this reply,&mdash;that when you and the other pests of the republic were
                        seeking a pretext to take up arms, and using my name as a cloak for your
                        proceedings to pillage the property of the rich citizens, and to drink the
                        blood of the chief men of the state, and satiate your barbarity and the
                        long-standing hatred which you had cherished against all good men till it
                        had become inveterate, I preferred to break the force of your frenzy and
                        wickedness by yielding to it, rather than by resisting it. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>Wherefore, I entreat you, O Vatinius, to pardon me for
                        sparing the country which I had saved; and I beg you, if I bear with you who
                        would willingly be a harasser and destroyer of the republic, to bear also
                        with me who have been its preserver and its guardian. Do you find fault with
                        that man for having departed from the city, who, as you see, was recalled by
                        the regret of all the citizens, and by the grief of the republic herself? </p>
					<p>Oh, but you say that men were anxious for my return, not for my sake, but for
                        the sake of the republic. As if any man <pb n="229"/> who had mixed himself
                        up in the affairs of the state in a proper spirit could think anything more
                        desirable for him than to be beloved by his fellow-citizens for the sake of
                        the republic. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Forsooth, my nature, I
                        suppose, is a harsh one, I am difficult of access, my countenance is
                        forbidding, my answers to men are arrogant, my way of life insolent. No one
                        ever sought the aid of my humanity,&mdash;no one was ever anxious for my
                        intimacy, for my advice, or my aid; for mine, out of regret for whom (to say
                        the least of it) the forum was sad, the senate-house silent, and all studies
                        of virtuous and liberal sciences voiceless and lifeless. </p>
					<p>However, I will allow that nothing was done for my sake. Let us admit that
                        all those resolutions of the senate and commands of the people, and decrees
                        of all Italy, and of all companies, and of all colleges and guilds
                        concerning me were passed for the sake of the republic. What then, O man
                        most ignorant of the character of solid glory and real dignity, could
                        possibly happen better for me? What could be more desirable as regards the
                        immortality of my glory and the everlasting recollection of my name, than
                        for all my fellow citizens to be of this opinion,&mdash;that the safety
                        of the state was indissolubly bound up with my individual safety? <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> But I will send you back the arrow which you
                        aimed at me. For as you said that I was dear to the senate and people of
                            <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> not so much for my own
                        sake as for that of the republic, so I say that you, although you are a man
                        of scandalous character, disgraced by every sort of foulness and infamy,
                        still are detested by the city, not so much on your own account as for the
                        sake of the republic. <milestone n="4" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>And, that I may at length come to speak of you, this shall be the last thing
                        which I will say of myself. What any one of us may say of himself, that is
                        not the question. Let good men judge; that is the consideration of the
                        greatest importance and weight. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>There are
                        two times at which the decisions of our fellow-citizens about us are looked
                        for with anxiety,&mdash;one when our honours, and the other when our
                        safety is at stake. Honours have been given to few men with such good-will
                        on the part of the Roman people as I have experienced. No one has ever been
                        restored to safety with such extraordinary zeal on the part of all the
                        citizens as I have. But what men think of you we have already had <pb n="230"/> experience when you were a candidate for honour; and now that
                        your safety is at stake, we are in expectation of what we shall see. </p>
					<p>However, not to compare myself with these the leading men of the state, who
                        are here to give their countenance to Publius Sestius by their presence, but
                        merely to compare myself to one, the most impudent and vilest of men, I will
                        just ask you, O Vatinius,&mdash;you the most arrogant of all men, and
                        also the most hostile to me,&mdash;whether you think it was better and
                        more desirable for this state, for this republic, for this city, for these
                        temples, and for the treasury, and for the senate-house, and for these men
                        whom you see around us, and their property, fortunes, and
                        children,&mdash;whether you think it was better and more desirable for
                        all the rest of the citizens, and for the temples of the gods, and for the
                            <foreign lang="la">auspices</foreign>, and for the religious rites and
                        observances of the city, that I should have been born as a citizen in this
                        city, or that you should? When you have answered me this question, either so
                        impudently that men will hardly he able to keep their hands off you, or in
                        so melancholy a manner as to burst that inflated neck and throat of yours;
                        after that, reply to me from memory to these questions which I am going to
                        put to you. <milestone n="5" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="11" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>And I will allow that dark period of your early youth to remain in obscurity.
                        You may with impunity, as far as I am concerned, have broken through walls
                        in your youth, and plundered your neighbours, and beaten your mother. Your
                        infamous character has this advantage, that the baseness of your youth is
                        concealed by your obscurity and vileness. </p>
					<p>You stood for the quaestorship with Publius Sestius; while he was talking of
                        nothing but the object which he had in view at the moment and you were
                        constantly saying that you were thinking of obtaining a second consulship. I
                        ask you this. Do you recollect when Publius Sestius was unanimously elected
                        quaestor, that you then were named as the last quaestor, against the will of
                        every one; not owing to the kindness which the people felt for you, but only
                        to that of the consul? <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>In that magistracy,
                        when the province of <placeName key="perseus,Ostia">Ostia</placeName>, down

                        you had been sent, not as a guardian to take care and keep the wealth at
                        home, but as a carrier to distribute it, and as you in a most robber-like
                        manner were examining into every one's house, and store, and ship, and
                        harassing men occupied in business and in trade with most iniquitous law
                        proceedings, frightening merchants as they disembarked from their ships, and
                        delaying them as they were embarking,&mdash;do you recollect, I say,
                        that violent hands were laid on you in <placeName key="perseus,Puteoli">Puteoli</placeName> while you were present among the body of the Roman
                        settlers? and that the complaints of the people of <placeName key="perseus,Puteoli">Puteoli</placeName> were brought before me as
                        consul? Do you recollect that after your quaestorship you went as lieutenant

                        Cosconius being the proconsul? Do you recollect too, that though that

                        by land, or if any one chooses to go by sea, there is a regular route by

                        give notice to the senate that the responses of the augurs and the arrogance
                        of that college should be no obstacle to your proceedings? <milestone n="15" unit="section"/>Next to that I ask you whether you kept your promise in

                        proposing your intended law? And since this is the one thing which you say

                        for the sake of the republic, but also for the sake of Caesar, lest any
                        stain from your extraordinary infamy should seem to attach itself to his

                        privilege to yourself, and is the voice of Vatinius, the thief and
                        sacrilegious man, to be heard, demanding that the same indulgence is to be
                        allowed to him that is allowed to Caesar? For this is what I ask of you.
                            <milestone n="7" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="16" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>You were a tribune of the people. Separate yourself from the consul. You had
                        nine gallant men for your colleagues. Of these there were three whom you
                        knew to be <pb n="233"/> every day observing the heavens, whom you used to
                        laugh at, whom you used to call private individuals, of whom you see two now
                        sitting here in their robes of office; (you know that you sold the official
                        robe of an aedile which you had had made for yourself to no purpose;) and
                        the third, you are aware, after that tribuneship, in which you oppressed and
                        ill-treated him, gained the consular authority, though a very young man.
                        There were six others; of whom some openly adopted your opinion, and some
                        held a sort of middle course. All had laws which they wished to propose; and
                        among them my own intimate friend Caius Cosconius, one of our judges, had
                        several, some even drawn up by my advice; a man who makes you ready to burst
                        with envy when you see him invested with the rank of aedile. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/>I wish you to reply to me. Did any one of the
                        whole college venture to bring forward any law, except you alone? And how
                        did you become possessed of so much audacity, how did you dare to act with
                        so much violence, as alone&mdash;you, a man raised out of the mud,
                        beyond all comparison the lowest of all men in every respect&mdash;to
                        think that a proper subject for your contempt and scorn, and derision, which
                        all your nine colleagues thought deserving of their fear and awe? Have you
                        ever known of any one tribune of the people, since the foundation of the
                        city, having transacted business with the people when it was known that any
                        magistrate was observing the heavens? <milestone n="18" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>I wish you also to answer me, as, while you were tribune of the people, the
                        Aelian and Fufian laws still existed in the republic; laws which have
                        repeatedly checked and repressed the frenzy of the tribunes; in
                        contravention of which no one has ever dared to act except you; (though
                        those same laws the year after, when two men were sitting in the temple,
                        whom I will not call consuls, but betrayers of this state, and pestilences,
                        were destroyed at the same time with the <foreign lang="la">auspices</foreign>, and the power of intercession, and all public law:)
                        Did you ever hesitate to transact business with the people, and to convene
                        the assembly in defiance of these laws? Have you ever heard of any one out
                        of all the tribunes of the people that ever existed, however seditious they
                        may have been, being so audacious as to summon an assembly in defiance of
                        the Aelian and Fufian laws? <milestone n="8" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="19" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>I ask you this, also, whether you endeavoured, <pb n="234"/> whether you
                        wished, whether, in short, you intended, (for these all amount to the same
                        thing, so that if it ever only occurred to your mind, there is no one who
                        would not think you worthy of the greatest severity of
                        punishment,)&mdash;I ask you, I say, whether you ever intended in the
                        course of that intolerable (I will not say reign of yours, for that is a
                        word which you would like me to use, but) piratical power, to be made augur
                        in the room of Quintus Metellus? so that whoever beheld you might feel a
                        twofold grief and misery, both from his regret for a most illustrious and
                        most gallant citizen, and from the honour of a most worthless and infamous
                        one. I ask you, did you think, I will not say, that the republic had been so
                        undermined while you were tribune, or that the constitution had been so much
                        battered and shaken, but that this city had been so entirely stormed and
                        overthrown, that we could endure Vatinius for an augur? <milestone n="20" unit="section"/>Here also I ask, if you had been made augur, as you were
                        anxious to be, the bare idea of which on your part caused us, who hated you,
                        a pain which we could hardly endure, while they who were your intimate
                        friends could scarcely forbear laughing at it; still I ask, I say, if in
                        addition to the other wounds under which you believed the republic to be
                        sinking, you had added the deadly and fatal blow of your augurship, would
                        you have decreed that which every augur ever since the time of Romulus has
                        invariably decreed, that when <persName><surname>Jupiter</surname></persName> was sending forth his lightning it was impious to
                        transact business with the people; or, because you had constantly done so,
                        would you as augur have put an end to the system of taking <foreign lang="la">auspices</foreign> altogether? <milestone n="9" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="21" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>And, not to waste any more words on your augurship, (and I speak of it all
                        against my will, as I do not wish to recollect the ruin of the republic;
                        for, indeed, you yourself never thought that you would be augur as long as
                        not only the majesty of these men, but as long as that city itself remained
                        standing,)&mdash;still, to pass over your dreams, I will come to your
                        acts of wickedness. I wish you to answer me. When you were leading Marcus

                        disagreed with him, should be offended with me; but I will call him a man
                        who certainly never took any violent steps, who never performed <pb n="235"/> any act of hostility towards you in the republic, but who only felt in
                        his heart a great disapproval of your actions;&mdash;when, I say, you
                        were leading him, the consul, to prison, and when your colleagues sitting at

                        led by the inflamed violence of profligate men, a most shameful and
                        miserable spectacle, not only to prison but to execution and to death?
                            <milestone n="22" unit="section"/>I ask whether there was ever any one
                        before your time so wicked as to do such a thing as that? So that we may
                        know whether you are an imitator of old crimes or an inventor of new ones.
                        And when you, by counsels and atrocities of this sort, carried on under the
                        name of Caius Caesar a most merciful and excellent man, but in reality by
                        your own wickedness and audacity, had driven Marcus Bibulus from the forum,
                        and the senate-house, and the temples, and from all public places, and had
                        compelled him to shut himself up in his own house; and when the life of the

                        of the laws, but only by the protection which his own doors and walls
                        afforded him; did you not send a lictor to drag Marcus Bibulus from his
                        house by force, in order that, though even in the case of private
                        individuals the sanctity of their house is always observed, while you were
                        tribune of the people even his own house should not be a safe refuge for the

                        I ask you whether, after a just law had been proposed at the beginning of
                        your magistracy, and after you had also proposed several others, you were
                        waiting till Caius Antonius was prosecuted before Cnaeus Lentulus
                            Clodianus?<note anchored="yes">There is some great corruption or the
                            text here.</note> And after a prosecution was instituted against him,
                        did you not immediately pass a law against him, &ldquo;Whoever was
                        prosecuted after the proposal of your law,&rdquo; in order that a man of
                        consular rank&mdash;unhappy man!&mdash;might be deprived by just
                        that moment of time, of the benefit and equitable provisions of your law? </p>
					<p><milestone n="28" unit="section"/>You will say that there was great intimacy
                        between you and Quintus Maximus. An admirable defence of your guilt! No
                        doubt it is the greatest praise of Maximus, that after he had adopted the
                        quarrel against Caius Antonius, and undertaken the prosecution, and after a
                        president of the court and a bench of judges had been selected, he was
                        unwilling to allow his adversary a power of striking off judges which would
                        have been too favourable for him.<gap desc="* * *"/></p>
					<p>Quintus Maximus did nothing inconsistent either with his <pb n="239"/> own
                        virtue, or with the precedents of those most illustrious men, the Paulli,
                        the Maximi, and Africani; whose renown we not only hope will be renewed by
                        this man's virtue, but we actually see that it is so. It is your dishonesty,
                        your guilt, your wickedness, that when you had proposed a law under a
                        pretence of mercy, you put it off till a time when it might serve a purpose
                        of cruelty. And now, indeed, Caius Antonius consoles himself under his
                        misery with this one fact that he had rather be at a distance to hear that
                        the images of his father and his brother, and that his brother's daughter,
                        are placed, not in the house of their family, but in prison, than be at hand

					<p>And since you so despise the property of others, and boast in a most
                        intolerable manner of your own riches, I desire you to answer me, whether
                        you, while tribune of the people, made any treaties with foreign states, or
                        kings, or tetrarchs? whether you got any money out of the treasury by your
                        laws? whether you did not at that time deprive people of the most valuable
                        part of their privileges? whether it was Caesar or the farmers of the
                        revenue that you were robbing? And as this is the case, I ask you whether,
                        having been a most miserably poor man, you did not become an exceedingly
                        rich one that very year in which a most stringent law was passed about
                        extortion and peculation? So that all men may see that you trampled not only
                        on the acts of us whom you call tyrants, but even on the laws of your own
                        most intimate friend; before whom you are in the habit of employing hard
                        words against us, who are very friendly to him, while you abuse him in the
                        most insulting manner every time that you say that he is in the least degree
                        connected with you. </p>
					<p><milestone n="30" unit="section"/>And I wish also to know this from you, with
                        what design or with what intention you attended at the banquet given by
                        Quintus Arrius, an intimate friend of mine, in a black robe? who you ever
                        saw do such a thing before? who you ever heard of having done such a thing?
                        What precedent had you for such conduct, or what custom can you plead for
                        it? You will say that you did not approve of those supplications. Very well.
                        Suppose that those supplications were inexcusable. Do you not see that I am
                        not questioning you at all with respect to the occurrence of that year, nor
                        of those <pb n="240"/> circumstances in which you may appear to be concerned
                        in common with any eminent men; but only about your own peculiar acts of
                        wickedness? Grant that the supplication was informal. Still, tell me, who
                        ever went to a banquet in a mourning garment? For by such conduct the
                        banquet itself is turned into a funeral feast; though the proper intention
                        of a banquet is to be a scene of enjoyment and compliment. <milestone n="13" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="31" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>But I pass over the fact of its having been a banquet of the Roman people,
                        the day of festival, adorned with the exhibition of silver plate, and robes,
                        and all sorts of furniture and ornaments; I ask who ever in a time of
                        domestic mourning, who ever at a funeral of one of his own family, sat down
                        to supper in a black robe? who ever, except you, as he was leaving a bath,
                        had a black gown given to him? When so many thousand men were sitting at the
                        feast, when the master of the feast himself, Quintus Arrius, was in a white
                        robe, you introduced yourself into the temple of Castor, with Caius Fidulus
                        and the rest of your Furies, in black garments, like the assistants at a
                        funeral. Who was there who did not then receive you with groans? who was
                        there who did not lament over the fate of the republic? what other topic of
                        conversation was there at that banquet except this, that this city, so great
                        and so wise, was now exposed not only to your frenzy, but also to your
                        derision? <milestone n="32" unit="section"/>Were you ignorant of the usual
                        practice on such occasions? had you never seen a feast of the sort? had you
                        never, when a boy or young man, been among the cooks? had you not a short
                        time before satisfied your ancient voracity at that most magnificent banquet
                        of Faustus, a noble young man? And when did you ever see the master of a
                        feast and his friends in mourning, and in black robes, while sitting at a
                        feast? What insanity took possession of you, that you should think, that,
                        unless you did what it was impious to do, unless you insulted the temple of
                        Castor, and the name of a feast, and the eyes of a citizen, and ancient
                        custom, and the authority of the man who had invited you, you had not given
                        sufficient proof that you did not think that a properly decreed and formal
                        supplication? <milestone n="14" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="33" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>I will also ask you about this thing which you did as a private individual; a
                        matter in which you, at all events, will not be able to say that your cause
                        is at all connected with that of any other illustrious man. I ask you,
                        whether you <pb n="241"/> were not prosecuted in accordance with the
                        provisions of the Licinian and Junian laws? whether Caius Memmius, the
                        praetor, did not in accordance with that law, order you by his edict to
                        appear on the thirtieth day? When that day arrived, did you not do what was
                        not only never done before in this republic, but what was never even heard
                        of, at any time since the beginning of the world? Did you not appeal to the
                        tribunes of the people to save you from the necessity of pleading your
                        cause? I have put the case too lightly; although that of itself would be an
                        unprecedented and an intolerable thing to have done; but did you not appeal
                        by name to that pest of the year, to that Fury of his country, to that storm
                        which was desolating the republic, to Clodius? and when he could not by any
                        right which he possessed, or by virtue of any precedent or by any power
                        given him by his office, offer any obstacle to proceedings in a court of
                        justice, he had recourse to his usual violence and frenzy, and put himself
                        at the head of your soldiers as their leader. And, in respect to this
                        transaction, that you may not consider anything as a direct statement of
                        mine, rather than as elicited by questions put to you, I will not impose on
                        myself the burden of producing any evidence in support of what I say; and
                        what I see that I shall have to state in the same place in a short time, I
                        will reserve at present and I will not accuse you; but as I have done with
                        respect to other matters, I will only put questions to you. <milestone n="34" unit="section"/></p>
					<p> I ask you then, O Vatinius, whether any one in the state since the first
                        foundation of the city, has ever appealed to the tribunes of the people to
                        interpose and save him from having to plead his case? Has any criminal ever
                        mounted up to the tribunal of the president of the court which tried him and
                        driven him down from thence by violence? and upset all the benches? and
                        overturned all the balloting urns? and in short, in disturbing the court of
                        justice committed all those crimes on account of which courts of justice
                        were instituted? Are you aware that Memmius fled at that time? that your
                        accusers were with difficulty saved from your hands and those of your
                        friends? that the judges were even driven away out of the tribunals which
                        were near? that in the forum, in broad daylight in the sight of the Roman
                        people, the investigation was put an end to, and the magistrates, and the
                        usages of our ancestors, and the laws, and the judges, and the defendant and
                            <pb n="242"/> the penalty, were all alike disregarded and trampled on?
                        Do you know that all these circumstances were, by the diligence of Caius
                        Memmius, entered and proved in the public records? And moreover, I ask you
                        this, when, after you had had an accusation preferred against you, you
                        returned from your lieutenancy, in order that no one might think that you
                        wished to avoid a trial; and when you used to say that, though you might
                        have done whichever you pleased, still you preferred pleading your cause, as
                        you had been accused; I ask, I say, how it was consistent with that conduct
                        of yours, in being unwilling to avail yourself of the door of escape which
                        your lieutenancy opened to you, for you to have recourse to an impious
                        source of assistance by means of a most dishonest appeal? <milestone n="15" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="35" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>And since mention has been made of your lieutenancy, I wish also to hear from
                        you, by what resolution of the senate you were appointed lieutenant? I
                        understand, from your gestures, what answer you are going to give. By your
                        own law, you say. Are not you, then, a most manifest parricide of your
                        country? Had not you had regard to the idea that the conscript fathers might
                        be wholly destroyed from out of the republic?&mdash;did you not even
                        leave this to the senate, which no one ever took from it&mdash;the
                        privilege, namely, of having all lieutenants appointed by authority of that
                        order? Did the great public council appear to you so contemptible? did the
                        senate appear so depressed? did the republic appear so miserable and
                        prostrate, that the senate was no longer able to appoint, in conformity with
                        the uniform precedent of our ancestors, the messengers of peace and war, and
                        managers, and interpreters, and authors of warlike determinations, and
                        ministers of the different sorts of provincial duty? </p>
					<p><milestone n="36" unit="section"/>You had taken from the senate the power of
                        decreeing provinces to the different magistrates, and the decision as to
                        what general was to be appointed to a command, and the management of the
                        treasury; things which the Roman people never coveted for itself, as it
                        never endeavoured to deprive the republic of the direction of the supreme
                            council.<note anchored="yes">There is apparently some considerable

                        lieutenants have been appointed without a resolution of the senate to
                        authorize it? No one before you. Immediately after you, Clodius did the same
                        thing, in the case of those two pestilences of the republic; and, on this
                        account, you deserve to be punished with still greater misfortunes; because
                        you have injured the republic, not only by your deed, but also by your
                        example; and because you are not only infamous yourself, but you have also
                        wished to teach others to be so too. Do you not know that, on all these
                        accounts, you have been branded with the unfavourable judgment of those most
                        strict men, the Sabines, of those brave tribes, the Marsi and the Peligni,
                        people of the same tribe as yourself, and that there is no other instance,
                        since the foundation of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, of

					<p> And I wish to hear this also from you, why it is, since I carried the law

                        and Fufian laws that you do not consider that a law? especially as I obey
                        your laws whatever the means are by which they were carried; while my law

                        compliance with a will on a day appointed in the will. How can you be so
                        insane as to dare to exhibit shows of gladiators actually at the very time
                        when you are a candidate? Do you think that any tribune of the people can be
                        found like that undeniable gladiator of yours, who will interpose to save

					<p>And if you disregard and despise all these considerations, because you have

                        everything which you desire in consequence of the incredible regard which
                        Caius Caesar has for you; have you ever heard, has any one told you, that

                        and that he was also greatly annoyed at any one having been made praetor,
                        who was wholly opposed to his opinions and interests? That, on that, some

                        that Vatinius had done nothing in his tribuneship without a sufficient

                        relations disown you, and the men of your own tribe execrate you, and your
                        neighbours dread you, and your connections are ashamed of you; lastly, if
                        all your evil humours have left your odious face and settled in other
                        places; if you are the object of general hatred to the people and the
                        senate, and to all the tribes of the country; what reason can you have for
                        wishing for the praetorship rather than for death? especially as you try to
                        make yourself out a friend of the people, and as you cannot possibly do
                        anything which would be more agreeable to the people than you would if you
                        were to kill yourself! </p>
					<p><milestone n="40" unit="section"/>But that we may hear at length how fully
                        you reply to my interrogations, I will now conclude my examination of you,
                        and at the end I will ask you a few questions relating to the cause itself.
                            <milestone n="17" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>I ask you what is the meaning of all this inconsistency and levity of yours,
                        that in this trial you extolled Titus Annius in the very same words in which
                        good men and good citizens have been in the habit of extolling him, when
                        lately, when you were produced before the people by that foul Fury, Clodius,
                        you gave false evidence against him with the greatest eagerness? Is this to
                        be a matter left to your option and in your power, so that when you see
                        Clodius's band of artisans, and that troop of furious and abandoned men, you
                        then say, <pb n="245"/> as you said in the assembly, that <persName><surname>Milo</surname></persName><note anchored="yes">Titus Annius are
                            the two other names of <persName><surname>Milo</surname></persName>.</note> has besieged the republic with gladiators and
                        men who combat with beasts; but when you come before such men as these, then
                        you do not venture to say anything against a citizen of extraordinary
                        virtue, and integrity, and wisdom, and firmness? <milestone n="41" unit="section"/>But as you praise Titus Annius so excessively, and by
                        your encomium cast some sort of slight stain on that most illustrious man,
                        (for Titus Annius would prefer being one of those men who are loaded with
                        reproaches by you,) still I ask, since in the administration of the affairs
                        of the republic there has been an entire community of and agreement in every
                        counsel between Titus Annius and Publius Sestius, (a fact which has been
                        proved not only by the decision of the good, but also by that of the wicked;
                        for each of them is now on his trial on the same account and for the same
                        accusation,&mdash;the one having had a prosecution instituted against
                        him by that man whom you are sometimes accustomed to confess is the only man
                        who is more worthless than yourself, and the other being reduced to the same
                        condition by your design indeed, not with his assistance,)&mdash;I ask,
                        I say, how you can separate those men in your evidence, whom you connect
                        together by your accusation? </p>
					<p>The last thing which I wish you to answer me is this:&mdash;As you said a
                        great deal against Albinovanus with respect to his prevarication, I wish to
                        know whether you said or did not say that you were not pleased at Sestius
                        being prosecuted for violence, and that he ought not to have been so
                        prosecuted; and that there was no law and no charge on which he was not more
                        liable to impeachment? Did you also say that the cause of <persName><surname>Milo</surname></persName>, a most admirable man, was generally
                        considered as closely connected with his cause? and that the things which
                        were done by Sestius in my behalf were agreeable to good men? I am not now
                        arguing against the inconsistency of your language and of your evidence; for
                        you have given evidence at great length against those identical actions of
                        this man which you say have been approved of by good men; and as for the man
                        with whom you connect the cause and danger of my client, Sestius, you have
                        extolled him with the highest praises. But I ask this;&mdash;whether you
                        think that Publius Sestius ought to be condemned according to the <pb n="246"/> provisions of a law under which you say that he never ought to
                        have been accused at all? or, if you think that your opinion ought not be
                        asked while you are giving your evidence, lest I should appear to be
                        attributing to you any authority by so doing, I ask whether you gave
                        evidence against a man on his trial for violence, who you say never ought to
                        have been prosecuted for violence at all?</p>

					<head>THE SPEECH OF M. T. CICERO IN DEFENCE OF MARCUS CAELIUS.</head>
					<argument>
						<head>THE ARGUMENT.</head>
						<p>Marcus Caelius was a young man of the equestrian order, and had been a
                            sort of pupil of Cicero himself; and was a man of very considerable
                            abilities. When a very young man, he had distinguished himself by
                            prosecuting Caius Antonius, who had been Cicero's colleague in his
                            consulship; and after that, by prosecuting Lucius Atratinus for bribery
                            and corruption. Out of revenge for this last prosecution, he was now
                            impeached by the son of that Lucius Atratinus for public violence, in
                            having been concerned in the murder of Dio, the chief of the Alexandrian
                            embassy, and in an attempt to poison Clodia, the sister of Clodius. The
                            real truth is said to have been that this prosecution was mainly
                            instigated by Clodia, who considered herself slighted by Caelius, who
                            had been a lover of hers. Caelius was a tenant of Clodius for a house on
                            the <placeName key="tgn,3000935">Palatine Hill</placeName>. He was
                            acquitted, and was at all times very grateful to Cicero for his
                            exertions. Some years afterwards he was praetor, in which capacity he
                            recalled <persName><surname>Milo</surname></persName> from his
                            banishment at <placeName key="tgn,7008781">Marseilles</placeName>, and
                            with <persName><surname>Milo</surname></persName> was murdered by the
                            soldiery, with whom he was tampering in the hopes of being able to
                            effect some diversion in favour of Pompey, a short time before the
                            battle of Pharsalia.</p>

					<p>If any one, O judges, were now present by any chance, ignorant of our laws,
                        and of our judicial proceedings, and of our customs, he would in truth
                        wonder what great atrocity there is in this particular cause of so serious a
                        nature, as to cause this trial alone to be proceeded with during these days
                        of festival and public games, when all other forensic business is
                        interrupted; and he would not doubt that a criminal was being prosecuted for
                        a crime of such enormity, that, if it were neglected, though but for a
                        moment, the state could no longer stand upright. If the same man were to
                        hear that there is <pb n="247"/> a law which orders daily investigations to
                        take place about seditious and wicked citizens, who may have taken arms and
                        besieged the senate or offered violence to the magistrates, or attacked the
                        constitution, he would find no fault with the law, but he would inquire what
                        is the crime which is now before the court; and when he heard that there was
                        no crime at all, no audacity, no deed of violence which was the subject of
                        this present action, but that a young man of eminent abilities, and
                        industry, and popularity is impeached by the son of that man whom he himself
                        prosecutes and has prosecuted and that he is attacked owing to the influence
                        of a prostitute, he would not find fault with the filial affection of
                        Atratinus, but he would think it right to curb the lust of the woman, and he
                        would think you the judges a really laborious race, when you are not allowed
                        to be at rest at a time of universal rest to every one else. </p>
					<p><milestone n="2" unit="section"/> In truth, if you are willing to attend
                        diligently, and to form a correct opinion of the whole of this cause, O
                        judges, you will make up your minds that no one would ever have come down to
                        the court, to prefer this accusation who had the power of doing so or not,
                        just as he pleased; and that, when he had come down, he would not have had
                        the slightest hope of succeeding if he had not relied on the intolerable
                        licentiousness and exaggerated hatred of some one else. But, for my part, I
                        can make allowance for Atratinus, a most humane and virtuous young man, and
                        a great friend of my own; who has the excuse of filial affection, and
                        necessity, and of youth. If he wished to accuse my client I attribute it to
                        his filial affection; if he was ordered to do so, I lay the blame on the
                        necessity; if he had any hope of succeeding, I impute that to the
                        inexperience of his boyhood. But as for the other partners in this
                        impeachment, those I have not only no allowance to make for, but I must
                        resist them most vigorously. <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>And, O judges, this beginning of my defence appears to me to suit most
                        especially with the youth of Marcus Caelius so that I should reply first to
                        those things which the accusers have advanced with the general view of
                        disparaging him and for the sake of detracting from his honour and
                        despoiling him of his dignity. His father was cast in his teeth on various
                        accounts,&mdash;at one time as having been a man of no great
                        respectability himself; at another, he was said to have been <pb n="248"/>
                        treated with but little respect by his son. On the score of dignity, Marcus
                        Caelius, to those who know him and to the older men among us, is of himself,
                        without speaking, himself able easily to make a very sufficient reply, and
                        without my having any occasion to make any statement for him; but as for
                        those to whom he is not equally well known, on account of his great age,
                        which has now for some time hindered his mixing much with us in the forum,
                        let them think this: that whatever dignity can exist in a Roman
                        knight,&mdash;and certainly the very greatest may be found in that
                        body,&mdash;has always been considered, and is to this day considered,
                        to shine out in great lustre in the case of Marcus Caelius; and moreover it
                        is so considered, not only by his own relations and friends, but by every
                        one to whom he can possibly be known on any account whatever. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>And to be the son of a Roman knight ought neither to be attributed to any one
                        as a crime, either by the present prosecutor, or before those men who are
                        the judges, or while I am the counsel for the defence. For as to what you
                        have said about his filial affection, or the want of it, that can only be a
                        vague opinion of ours, but the decision as to the truth of it must certainly
                        rest with his parent. What our opinion is, you shall hear from witnesses on
                        their oath: what his parents feel to be the truth, the tears of his mother
                        and her incredible sorrow, the mourning appearance of his father and his
                        distress which you now behold, and his agony, sufficiently declare.
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> For as to the attack made upon him,
                        that as a young man he was not well thought of by his fellow-citizens of the
                        same municipal town, I say that the people of <placeName key="perseus,Puteoli">Puteoli</placeName> never paid greater honours to
                        any one when he was among them than they did to Marcus Caelius while he was
                        absent; for though he was absent they elected him a member of their most
                        honourable body; and they conferred those distinctions on him without his
                        asking for them, which they have refused to numbers when they solicited
                        them; and they have, moreover, now sent their most chosen men, and men of
                        our order, and Roman knights, with a deputation to attend this trial, and to
                        bear most honourable and authoritative testimony in his favour. </p>
					<p>I seem to myself now to have laid the foundations of my defence; and they are
                        the firmest possible, if they rest on the <pb n="249"/> judgment of his own
                        relations and fellow-citizens. For his life could not be sufficiently
                        recommended to you to meet with your approbation, if it displeased not only
                        his parent, who is so excellent a man, but also so illustrious and dignified
                        a municipality. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>In truth, to return to myself, it is from such beginnings as his that I
                        myself have risen to credit among men; and this forensic labour of mine, and
                        the system of conduct which I have adopted, has made its way to the
                        favourable opinion of men, by means of the extended commendation and
                        favourable opinion of my own relations and friends. For as to the attacks
                        which have been made on him on the score of chastity, which has been harped
                        upon by all the accusers, not by regular charges, but by outcry and abuse;
                        Marcus Caelius will never be indignant at that, so far as to repent of not
                        being ugly. For those sort of reproaches are habitually heaped upon every
                        one, whose person and appearance in youth is at all gentlemanly. But to
                        vituperate is one thing, and to accuse is another. An accusation requires a
                        crime in order to define the matter, to bind the man, to prove its charges
                        by argument, and to confirm them by witnesses. But vituperation has no
                        settled object except insult and if any one is attacked in that way with
                        ill-temper it is called abuse; but if it is done with some sort of wit and
                        mirth, it is then styled bantering. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> And I
                        wondered and was indignant at that department of the accusation being given
                        to Atratinus above all men; for it did not become him, nor did his age
                        justify it, nor (as indeed you might have observed yourself) did the modesty
                        of that excellent young man allow him to show to advantage in a speech on
                        that subject. I should have preferred having one of you who are older and
                        more robust, to undertake this part of vituperation; and we should then have
                        been able with more freedom of speech and more vigour, and in a manner more
                        in accordance with our usual habits, to refute the licentiousness of that
                        vituperation. With you, O Atratinus, I will deal more gently, both because
                        your own modesty is a check on my language, and because I am bound to have a
                        regard to the good-will which I entertain towards you and your parent.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>I wish, however, that you would keep one thing in mind; first of all, to form
                        a correct estimate of yourself, and to learn <pb n="250"/> to think yourself
                        such a man as in truth you are; in order to keep yourself as clear of
                        licentiousness of language as you are free from all impropriety of conduct;
                        and secondly, to avoid alleging those things against another, which would
                        make you blush if in reply they were falsely imputed to you. For who is
                        there to whom such a path as that is not open? who is there who is not able
                        to attack a man of Caelius's age and of Caelius's rank as petulantly as he
                        pleases on that subject, even if without any real grounds for suspicion, at
                        all events not without some apparent argument? But the people who are to
                        blame for your undertaking that part, are they who compelled you to make
                        these allegations. This praise belongs to your own modesty, of being, as we
                        saw that you were, unwilling to make them; and to your genius, of making
                        them in a courteous and polite manner. <milestone n="4" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="9" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>But however, with respect to all that part of your speech, my reply in
                        defence may be very brief. For, as far as the age of Marcus Caelius might
                        give room for any such suspicion, in the first place it was fortified
                        against it by his own modesty, and in the second place by his father's
                        attentive care of him and rigid discipline; for, as soon as he had given him
                        the robe of a man,&mdash;(I will say nothing here of myself; you
                        yourselves are competent judges of what credit is due to me,&mdash;I
                        only say that he was immediately brought by his father to me as a
                        pupil,)&mdash;after that time no one ever saw Marcus Caelius in that the
                        flower of his age, that he was not either with his father, or with me, or
                        else in that most virtuous house of Marcus Crassus, and being instructed in
                        the most honourable branches of learning. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>For as for the imputation which has been levelled against Caelius, of having
                        been intimate with Catiline, he ought to be wholly exempt from any such
                        suspicion. For you all know that he was a very young man when Catiline stood
                        for the consulship the same year that I did; and if he ever joined his
                        party, or ever departed from mine, (though many virtuous young men did
                        espouse the cause of that worthless and abandoned man,) then, indeed, I will
                        allow it to be thought that Caelius was too intimate with Catiline. But we
                        know, and we ourselves saw after that, that he was one of his friends. Well,
                        who denies it? But I am at this moment engaged in defending his conduct at
                        that period of life, which is of itself <pb n="251"/> unsteady and very
                        liable to be at the mercy of the passions of others. He was continually with
                        me while I was praetor; he knew nothing of Catiline. After that Catiline
                        being praetor had <placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName> for his
                        province. Another year ensued in which Catiline was prosecuted for
                        extortions and peculation. Caelius was still with me and never went to him
                        not even as an advocate of his cause. The next year was the one in which I
                        was a candidate for the consulship; Catiline was also a candidate. He never
                        went over to him; he never departed from me. <milestone n="5" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="11" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>Having then been so many years about the forum without any suspicion, and
                        without any slur on his character, he espoused the cause of Catiline when he
                        offered himself for the consulship a second time. How long then do you think
                        that men of his age are to be kept in a state of pupilage? Formerly, we had
                        one year established by custom during which the arm was restrained by our
                        robe and during which we practised our exercises and sports in the
                            <placeName key="tgn,7006964">Campus Martius</placeName> in our tunics.
                        And the very same practice prevailed in the camps and in the army, if we
                        began to serve in campaigns at once. And at that age, unless a man protected
                        himself by great gravity and chastity on his own part and not only by rigid
                        domestic discipline, but by an extraordinary degree of natural virtue,
                        however he was looked after by his relations, he still could not escape some
                        slur on his character. But any one who passed that beginning of his life in
                        perfect purity, and free from all stain, never was liable to have any one
                        speak against his fair fame and his chastity when his principles had gained
                        strength, and when he was a man and among men. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Caelius espoused the cause of Catiline, when he had
                        been for several years mixing in the forum; and many of every rank and of
                        every age did the very same thing. For that man, as I should think many of
                        you must remember, had very many marks&mdash;not indeed fully brought
                        out, but only in outline as it were of the most eminent virtues. He was
                        intimate with many thoroughly wicked men; but he pretended to be entirely
                        devoted to the most virtuous of the citizens. He had many things about him
                        which served to allure men to the gratification of their passions; he had
                        also many things which acted as incentives to industry and toil. The vices
                        of lust raged in him; but at the same time he was conspicuous for <pb n="252"/> great energy and military skill. Nor do I believe that there
                        ever existed so strange a prodigy upon the earth, made up in such a manner
                        of the most various, and different and inconsistent studies and desires.

					<p>Who was ever more acceptable at one time to most illustrious men? who was
                        more intimate with the very basest? What citizen was there at times who took
                        a better part than he did? who was there at other times a fouler enemy to
                        this state? Who was more debased in his pleasures? who was more patient in
                        undergoing labours? who was more covetous as regards his rapacity? who more
                        prodigal in squandering? And besides all this, there were, O judges, these
                        marvellous qualities in that man, that he was able to embrace many men in
                        his friendship, to preserve their regard by attention, to share with every
                        one what he had, to assist all his friends in their necessities with money,
                        with influence, with his personal toil, even with his own crimes and
                        audacity, if need were; to keep his nature under restraint and to guide it
                        according to the requirements of the time, and to turn and twist it hither
                        and thither; to live strictly when in company with the morose, merrily with
                        the cheerful, seriously with the old, courteously with the young,
                        audaciously with the criminal, and luxuriously with the profligate.
                            <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> When&mdash;by giving full swing
                        to this various and multiform natural disposition of his&mdash;he had
                        collected together every wicked and audacious man from every country, so
                        also he retained the friendship of many gallant and virtuous men, by a
                        certain appearance of pretended virtue. Nor would that infamous attempt to
                        destroy this empire have ever proceeded from him, if the ferocity of so many
                        vices had not been based on the deep-rooted foundations of affability and
                        patience. </p>
					<p>Let that allegation then, O judges, be disregarded by you, and let not the
                        charge of intimacy with Catiline make any impression upon you. For it is one
                        which only applies to him in common with many other men, and even with some
                        very good men. Even me myself&mdash;yes, even me, I say&mdash;he
                        once almost deceived, as he seemed to me a virtuous citizen, and desirous of
                        the regard of every good man, and a firm and trustworthy friend; so that in
                        truth, I detected his wickedness with my eyes, before I did so by my
                        opinion; I was aroused to the necessity of acting against him by force,
                        before <pb n="253"/> my suspicions were awakened. So that if Caelius also
                        was one of the great number of friends whom he had to boast of, there is
                        more reason for his being vexed at having fallen into such a mistake, just
                        as sometimes I myself repent also of having been deceived by the same
                        person, than for his having any reason to fear the accusation of having been
                        a friend of his. <milestone n="7" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="15" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>Accordingly, your speech descended from vituperations of him on the score of
                        chastity, to endeavours to excite odium against him on account of that
                        conspiracy. For you laid it down,&mdash;though with hesitating steps and
                        without dwelling on it,&mdash;that he must have been an accomplice in
                        the conspiracy, on account of his friendship with Catiline; in advancing
                        which charge, not only the accusation itself failed to wound, but the speech
                        of that eloquent young man lost its usual coherency. For how could Caelius
                        have been capable of such frenzy? What enormous depravity was there in his
                        natural disposition, or in his habits, or what deficiency in his fortunes or
                        prospects, to dispose him to such a crime? And lastly, when was the name of
                        Caelius ever heard of in connection with any suspicion of the sort? I am
                        saying too much about a matter about which there is not the least doubt; but
                        I say this,&mdash;that if he had not, not merely been guiltless of any
                        participation in the conspiracy, but been a most decided and avowed enemy of
                        that wickedness, he would never have gone so far as to seek for an especial
                        commendation of his youth by a prosecution of men implicated in that
                        conspiracy. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>And I know not whether I need think it equally necessary to make a reply to
                        the charges of corruption, and to the accusations about clubs and agents
                        (since I have lighted on these topics). For Caelius would never have been so
                        insane as to accuse another man of bribery, if he had stained himself with
                        that mean practice of corruption, nor would he seek to fix a suspicion of
                        such conduct on another, when he wished to obtain for himself perpetual
                        licence to commit it. Nor if he thought there was a chance of his being put
                        in peril but once on an accusation of corruption would he twice over
                        prosecute another man on the same charge. And although his doing so is not
                        wise, and is against my will, still it is an action of such a sort, that it
                        is plain that a man who conducts himself so, rather thinks it open to him to
                        attack the innocence <pb n="254"/> of another, than that he has any reason
                        to be afraid of anything on his own account. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>For, as respects the charges that have been brought against him of being in
                        debt, as regards the reproaches which have been levelled at him on the score
                        of prodigality, and of the demands that have been made to see his accounts,
                        just see how briefly I will reply to them. In the first place, he, who is
                        still under the power of his father, keeps no accounts. He has never any
                        transactions connected with borrowing or lending. As to his extravagance,
                        there is one particular item of expense objected to him, that for his house.
                        You say that he dwells in a house which he rents for thirty thousand
                            sesterces.<note anchored="yes">About two hundred and forty
                            pounds.</note> Now, I see by this, that Publius Clodius wants to sell
                        his house; for it is his house that Caelius lives in, at a rent, I suppose,
                        of ten thousand sesterces. And you, O prosecutors, out of your anxiety to
                        please him, have permitted yourselves this enormous lie to suit his
                        purposes. <milestone n="18" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>You have blamed him for dwelling in a house apart from his father, a thing
                        which is not at all to be blamed in a man of his age. For as, labouring in
                        the cause of the republic, he had achieved a victory which was, indeed,
                        annoying to me, but glorious to himself; and as he was now of sufficiently
                        mature age to stand for a magistracy, not only with the permission, but in
                        consequence of even the advice of his father, he left his house, and as his
                        father's house was a long way from the forum, he hired a house on the
                            <placeName key="tgn,3000935">Palatine Hill</placeName>, at no very high
                        rent, in order the more easily to be able to visit us at our houses, and to
                        receive visits from his friends. <milestone n="8" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>And while speaking on this topic, I may say what that most illustrious man,
                        Marcus Crassus, said a little time before, when he was making a complaint of
                        the arrival of king Ptolemaeus:&mdash; <quote>

					<p> For in like manner, O judges, you will find, when I come to discuss this
                        point, that it was this Medea of the <placeName key="tgn,3000935">Palatine
                            Hill</placeName>, and this migration, which has been the cause of all
                        his misfortunes to this young man, or rather of all the things that have
                        been said about him. <milestone n="19" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>Wherefore I, relying on your wisdom, O judges, am not afraid of those
                        assertions which I perceived were some time back being invented, and
                        fortified by the oration of the accusers. For they said that a senator would
                        come forward as a witness, who would say that he had been driven away by the
                            <foreign lang="la">comitia</foreign> for the election of a pontiff by
                        Caelius. And if he does come forward, I will ask, in the first place, why he
                        did not at once take proceedings against him for such conduct? Secondly, if
                        he preferred complaining of it in this way to bringing an action, why he is
                        brought forward by you instead of coming forward by himself of his own
                        accord? and why he has chosen to complain so long after the time, instead of
                        immediately? If he gives me clear and shrewd answers to these questions,
                        then I shall ask from what source this senator has burst forth? For if he
                        has his origin and first springs, as it were, in himself, probably I shall
                        be moved by him, as I usually am; but if he is only a little gutter drained
                        and drawn off from the fountain head of your accusation, then I shall
                        rejoice that, while your accusation relies on so much interest and such
                        mighty influence, there has still been but one senator who could be found
                        willing to gratify you. <milestone n="20" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>Nor am I afraid of that other class of night witnesses. For they have
                        asserted that there would be men who would say that their wives, when
                        returning from supper parties have been roughly handled by Caelius. They
                        will be men of importance who will venture to say this on their oaths as
                        they will be forced to confess that they have never commenced taking any
                        steps for redress for such great injuries not even by a friendly
                        arbitration. <milestone n="9" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>By this time, O judges, you are able to understand the whole nature of the
                        attack which is made on my client and when it is urged against him it is
                        your duty to repel it. For Marcus Caelius is not accused by the same people
                        as those by whom he is attacked. Weapons are shot at him openly but they are
                        supplied secretly. <milestone n="21" unit="section"/> Nor do I say this with
                        the object <pb n="256"/> of exciting odium against those men to whom it
                        ought even to be a subject of boasting. They are discharging their duty,
                        they are defending their friends, they are doing what the bravest men are
                        accustomed to do. When injured they feel pain, when angry they are carried
                        away, when provoked they fight. But nevertheless, it belongs to your wisdom,
                        O judges, if brave men have a reasonable ground for attacking Marcus
                        Caelius, not on that account to think that you also have a reasonable ground
                        for consulting the indignation of others rather than your own good faith.
                        You see how vast a concourse of men is assembled in the forum, of what
                        different classes it is composed, what different objects they have in view,
                        and how great is the difference between them in every respect. Of all this
                        multitude, how many do you think that there are who are in the habit of
                        offering their services of their own accord to influential, and popular, and
                        eloquent men, when they think they are eager about anything; and to use
                        their exertions and to promise their evidence to oblige them? <milestone n="22" unit="section"/> If any of this class of men have by chance
                        thrust themselves into this trial, shut out, O judges, their covetous zeal
                        from the consideration of your wisdom, so as to appear to provide at the
                        same time for this man's safety and for the religious discharge of your own
                        obligations, and for the general welfare of all the citizens against the
                        perilous influence of unscrupulous men. </p>
					<p>In truth, I will lead you away from the witnesses. I will not permit the
                        truth of this trial, which cannot by any means be altered, to depend on the
                        inclination of the witnesses, which may so easily be modeled any way, and be
                        bent and twisted in every direction without the slightest trouble. We will
                        conduct our case by arguments. We will refute the charges brought against us
                        by proofs clearer than daylight. Facts shall combat with facts, cause with
                        cause, reason with reason. <milestone n="10" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="23" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>Therefore, I willingly allow that part of the cause to be concluded, summed
                        up, as it has been, with dignity and elegance by Marcus Crassus; the part, I
                        mean, which relates to the seditions at <placeName key="tgn,7004474">Naples</placeName>, to the expulsion of the Alexandrians from
                            <placeName key="perseus,Puteoli">Puteoli</placeName>, and to the
                        property of Palla. I wish he had also discussed the transaction respecting
                        Dio. And yet on that subject what is there that you can expect me to <pb n="257"/> say, when the man who committed the murder is not afraid, but
                        even confesses it? For he is a king. But the man who is said to have been
                        the assistant and accomplice in the murder, has been acquitted by a regular
                        trial. What sort of crime, then, is this, that the man who has committed it
                        does not deny it&mdash;that he who has denied it has been acquitted, and
                        yet that a man is to be afraid of the accusation who was not only at a
                        distance from the deed, but who has never been suspected of being even privy
                        to it? And if the merits of his case availed Asicius more than the odium
                        engendered by the fact of such a crime injured him, is your abuse to injure
                        this man, who has never once had a suspicion of the crime breathed against
                        him, not even by the vaguest report? <milestone n="24" unit="section"/> Oh,
                        but Asicius was acquitted by the prevarication of the judges. It is very
                        easy to reply to such an assertion as that especially for me, by whom that
                        action is defended. But Caelius thinks that the cause of Asicius is a just
                        one; at all events, whatever may be its merits, he thinks it is quite
                        unconnected with his own. And not only Caelius but even other most
                        accomplished and learned young men, devoted to the most instructive studies
                        and to the most virtuous pursuits, Titus and Caius Coponius, who grieved
                        above all other men for the death of Dio, being bound to him as they were by
                        a common attachment to the pursuit of learning and science and being also
                        connected with him by ties of hospitality, think so too. He was living in
                        the house of Lucius Lucceius, as you have heard; they had become mutually
                        acquainted at <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName>.
                        What Caius Coponius, and what his brother, a man of the very highest
                        respectability, think of Marcus Caelius, you shall hear from themselves if
                        they are produced as witnesses. <milestone n="25" unit="section"/> So let
                        all these topics be put aside, in order that we may at last come to those
                        facts and charges on which the cause really depends. <milestone n="11" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>For I noticed, O judges, that my intimate friend, Lucius Herennius, was
                        listened to by you most attentively. And though you were induced to pay him
                        that attention to a great extent by his own ability and by a sort of
                        eloquence which pervaded his oration, still I was sometimes apprehensive
                        lest that speech of his which was contrived with such subtlety for the
                        purpose of giving weight to his accusation should slowly and imperceptibly
                        inflame your minds. For he said a great deal about luxury, a great deal
                        about justice, a <pb n="258"/> great deal about the vices of youth, a great
                        deal about morals. And he, who in every other action of his life had been
                        gentle, and who has accustomed himself to behave at all times with that
                        humane courtesy with which nearly every one is charmed, acted in this cause
                        like a morose uncle, or censor, or lecturer. He reproached Marcus Caelius in
                        such a manner as no man's father ever abused him. He delivered a long
                        harangue about incontinence and intemperance. What are you expecting me to
                        say, O judges, I exercised you for listening to him with attention, because
                        I myself could not avoid shuddering at so morose and savage an oration.
                            <milestone n="26" unit="section"/> And the first allegation was one
                        which affected me least, namely,&mdash;that Caius had been intimate with
                        my own intimate friend Bestia; that he had supped with him, had been in the
                        habit of visiting him, had aided him when he was a candidate for the
                        praetorship. These things do not move me at all, for they are notoriously
                        false. In fact he is stating that those men supped together who are either
                        in different places, or <gap desc="* * *"/></p>
					<p>Nor am I moved by that assertion either, that he said that Caelius had been a
                        comrade of his own in the Lupercal games. No doubt, it is a savage and
                        purely pastoral and uncivilized sort of companionship,<note anchored="yes">See Smith, Dict, Ant p. 583, v. <foreign lang="la">Lupercalia</foreign>.</note> that of the Lupercal comrades, whose
                        sylvan companies were established before the institution of civilization and
                        of laws. Since these companions not only prosecute one another, but even in
                        the accusation speak of the companionship as a crime, <gap desc="* * *"/> so
                        that they seem to be afraid, lest any one should be ignorant of it.
                            <milestone n="27" unit="section"/> But I will pass over these things,
                        and reply to those which I thought of more consequence. </p>
					<p>There was a very long reproach addressed to my client on the score of luxury;
                        it was, however, a gentle one, and had more argument than ferocity in it; on
                        which account it was listened to with the more attention. For while Publius
                        Clodius, my friend, was allowing himself to be carried away by the greatest
                        violence and impetuosity, and, being in a great state of excitement, was
                        using the most severe language, and speaking at the top of his voice, though
                        I had a high opinion of his eloquence, still I was not at all alarmed. For I
                        had seen him conducting several trials without success. But I will reply to
                        you first of all, O Balbus, with an entreaty to be <pb n="259"/> allowed,
                        without blame and without a charge of impiety to defend a man who never
                        refuses an invitation to supper, who uses perfumes, and who often goes to
                            <placeName key="perseus,Baiae">Baiae</placeName>. <milestone n="12" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="28" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>In truth, I have seen and heard of many men in this city, not only men who
                        had just tasted this kind of life with the edge of their lips, and touched
                        it, as people say, with the tips of their fingers, but men who had devoted
                        the whole of their youth to pleasures, who have at last emerged from them,
                        and have be taken themselves to prudent courses, and have become sensible
                        and eminent citizens. For by the common consent of all men, some indulgence
                        is given to this age, and nature itself suggests desires to youth; and if
                        they break out without injuring any one else a life, or overturning any one
                        else's house, they are generally accounted endurable and pardonable. </p>
					<p><milestone n="29" unit="section"/> But you seemed to me to wish to bring
                        Caelius into some sort of odium by means of the common irregularities into
                        which youth is apt to fall. And, therefore, all that silence with which your
                        speech was received was produced by the fact that, though we had but one
                        criminal before us, we were thinking of the vices of many. It is an easy
                        matter to declaim against luxury. The day would fail me if I were to attempt
                        to enumerate everything that may be said on that subject. The field of
                        seductions, and adulteries and wantonness, and extravagance is boundless.
                        Even though you do not fix your eyes on any particular criminal, but only on
                        the vices themselves, still they are capable of being made the objects of
                        very eloquent and fluent vituperation. But it becomes your wisdom, O judges,
                        not to be diverted from the case of the man who is on his trial before you;
                        nor to let loose against an individual, and him too on his trial, the stings
                        with which your severity and dignity is armed when the accuser has sought to
                        rouse them against the general fact of luxury, against vices in general and
                        the present state of morals, and the present times while by this means the
                        defendant is not being impeached for any crime of his own, but is having
                        unjust odium excited against him on account of the vices of many others.

                    </p>
					<p>Therefore I do not venture to make the reply to your severe judgment which I
                        ought to make. For it was my duty to plead for some sort of exemption from
                        several rules for <pb n="260"/> youth, to claim some indulgence. I do not
                        venture, I say, to do this. I will not have recourse to any door of escape
                        which my client's age might open to me; I will not mention the privileges
                        which are allowed to all other men; I only ask that if at this time there is
                        a general feeling of discontent at the debts, and wantonness, and licentious
                        conduct of the youth of the city,&mdash;and I see that such a feeling
                        does exist to a great extent&mdash;the offences of others, and the vices
                        of the youth of others and of the times, may not prejudice my client. And
                        while I ask this, I do at the same time offer no objection to being called
                        on to reply most carefully to all the charges which are directed against him
                        in consequence of any conduct of his own. <milestone n="13" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>But there are two especial counts in the indictment. There is a charge
                        respecting gold, and one respecting poison. And in both of them one person
                        is concerned. Gold is said to have been taken from Clodia; poison is said to
                        have been sought for, for the purpose of being given to Clodia. All the
                        other statements are not charges, but are rather pieces of abuse prompted by
                        a petulant quarrel, than adduced as a part of a criminal investigation. To
                        call a man an adulterer, an immodest man, a pimp, is abuse, not accusation.
                        For there is no foundation for such charges; they have nothing to rest upon;
                        they are mere abusive expressions poured forth by an accuser in a passion,
                        without any authority. <milestone n="31" unit="section"/> Of these two
                        charges I see the source, I see the author, I see the certain originator and
                        mainspring. Gold was wanted; he received it from Clodia; he received it
                        without any witness; he had it as long as he wanted it. I see here a great
                        proof of some very extraordinary intimacy. Again, he wanted to kill her; he
                        sought for poison; he tampered with every one with whom he could; he
                        prepared it; he arranged a place; he brought it. Again, I see that a violent
                        quarrel has sprung up between them, and engendered a furious hatred. Our
                        whole business in this part of the case, O judges, is with Clodia, a woman
                        not only of high rank, but also notorious; of whom I will say nothing except
                        for the sake of repelling some accusation. <milestone n="32" unit="section"/> But you are aware, O Cnaeus Domitius, as a man of your eminent wisdom
                        must be, that we have in this matter to deal with no one but her; for if she
                        does not say that she lent the money to Caelius, if she does not accuse him
                        and say that <pb n="261"/> poison was prepared by him for her, then we are
                        acting wantonly and groundlessly, in mentioning the name of a mother of a
                        family in a way so different from what is due to a Roman matron. But if, if
                        you only take away that woman, there is no longer any charge against
                        Caelius, nor have the accusers any longer any resources by which to attack
                        him, then what is our duty as the advocates of his cause, except to repel
                        those who pursue him? And, indeed, I would do so still more vigorously, if I
                        had not a quarrel with that woman's husband&mdash;brother, I meant to
                        say; I am always making this mistake. At present I will proceed with
                        moderation, and go no further than my own duty to my client and the nature
                        of the cause which I am pleading compels me. For I have never thought it my
                        duty to engage in quarrels with any woman, especially with one whom all men
                        have always considered everybody's friend rather than any one's enemy.
                            <milestone n="14" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="33" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>But still I will first put this question to her herself, whether she wishes
                        me to deal with her strictly, and gravely, and according to old-fashioned
                        notions of right and wrong; or indulgently, mercifully, and courteously? If
                        I am to proceed in the old-fashioned way and manner of pleading, then I must
                        summon up from the shades below one of those bearded old men,&mdash;not
                        men with those little bits of imperials which she takes such a fancy to, but
                        a man with that long shaggy beard which we see on the ancient statues and
                        images,&mdash;to reproach the woman, and to speak in my stead, lest she
                        by any chance should get angry with me. Let, then, some one of her own
                        family rise up, and above all others that great blind Claudius of old time.
                        For he will feel the least grief, inasmuch as he will not see her. And, in
                        truth, if he can come forth from the dead, he will deal thus with her; he
                        will say,&mdash;&ldquo;Woman, what have you to do with Caelius? What
                        have you to do with a very young man? What have you to do with one who does
                        not belong to you? Why have you been so intimate with him as to lend him
                        gold, or so much an enemy of his as to fear his poison? Had you never seen
                        that your father, had you never heard that your uncle, your grand-father,
                        your great-grandfather, your great-great-grand-father, were all consuls?
                            <milestone n="34" unit="section"/> Did you not know, moreover, that you
                        were bound in wedlock to Quintus Metellus, a most illustrious and gallant
                        man, and most devoted to his country? who from the <pb n="262"/> first
                        moment that he put his foot over his threshold, showed himself superior to
                        almost all citizens in virtue, and glory, and dignity. When you had become
                        his wife, and, being previously of a most illustrious race yourself, had
                        married into a most renowned family, why was Caelius so intimate with you?
                        Was he a relation? a connection? Was he a friend of your husband? Nothing of
                        the sort. What then was the reason, except it was some folly or lust? <gap desc="* * *"/> Even if the images of us, the men of your family, had no
                        influence over you, did not even my own daughter, that celebrated Quinta
                        Claudia, admonish you to emulate the praise belonging to our house from the
                        glory of its women? Did not that vestal virgin Claudia recur to your mind,
                        who embraced her father while celebrating his triumph, and prevented his
                        being dragged from his chariot by a hostile tribune of the people? Why had
                        the vices of your brother more weight with you than the virtues of your
                        father, of your grandfather, and others in regular descent ever since my own
                        time; virtues exemplified not only in the men, but also in the women? Was it
                        for this that I broke the treaty which was concluded with Pyrrhus, that you
                        should every day make new treaties of most disgraceful love? Was it for this
                        that I brought water into the city, that you should use it for your impious
                        purposes? Was it for this that I made the Appian road, that you should
                        travel along it escorted by other men besides your husband?&rdquo;</p>
					<p><milestone n="15" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="35" unit="section"/> But why,
                        O judges, have I brought a person on the scene, of such gravity as to make
                        me fear that this same Appius may on a sudden turn round and begin also to
                        accuse Caelius with the severity which belongs to the censor? But I will
                        look to this presently, and I will discuss it, O judges, so that I feel sure
                        that I shall show even the most rigid scrutineers reason to approve of the
                        habits of life of Marcus Caelius. But you, O woman, (for now I speak to you
                        myself, without the intervention of any imaginary character) if you are
                        thinking of making us approve of what you are doing, and what you are
                        saying, and what you are charging us with, and what you are intending, and
                        what you are seeking to achieve by this prosecution, you must give an
                        intelligible and satisfactory account of your great familiarity, your
                        intimate connection, your extraordinary union <pb n="263"/> with him. The

                        banquets, and revels, and songs, and music parties, and water parties; and
                        intimate also that they do not mention all these things without your
                        consent. And as for you, since, through some unbridled and headlong fury
                        which I cannot comprehend, you have chosen these things to be brought into
                        court, and dilated on at this trial, you must either efface the charges
                        yourself, and show that they are without foundation, or else you must
                        confess that no credit is to be given to any accusations which you may make,

                        childish timidity, I suppose and some groundless fears of what may happen by
                        night, has always, when he was but a little boy, slept with you his eldest

					<p>I come now again to you, O Caelius, in your turn; and I take upon myself the

                        </quote> Such a father as that would say things which you would find it
                        difficult to bear. He would say, &ldquo;Why did you betake yourself to
                        the neighbourhood of a harlot? Why did you not shun her notorious
                        blandishments? Why did you form a connection with a woman who was nothing to
                        you? Squander your money, throw it away; I give you leave. If you come to
                        want, it is you yourself who will suffer for it. I shall be satisfied if I
                        am able to spend pleasantly the small portion of my life that remains to
                        me.&rdquo; <milestone n="38" unit="section"/> To this morose and severe
                        old man Caelius would reply, that he had not departed from the right path
                        from being led away by any passion. What proof could he give? That he had
                        been at no expense, at no loss; that he had not borrowed any money. But it
                        was said that he had. How few people are there who can avoid such a report,
                        in a city so prone to evil speaking! Do you wonder that the neighbour of
                        that woman was spoken of unfavourably, when her own brother could not escape
                        being made the subject of conversation by profligate men? But to a gentle
                        and considerate father such as his is, whose language would be,
                        &ldquo;Has he broken the doors? they shall be mended; has he torn his
                        garments? they shall be repaired;&rdquo;the cause of his son is easily
                        explained. For what circumstances could there be in which he would not be
                        able easily to defend himself? I am not saying anything now against that
                        woman: but if there were a woman totally unlike her, who made herself common
                        to everybody; who had always some one or other openly avowed as her lover;
                        to whose gardens, to whose house, to whose baths the lusts of every one had
                        free access as of their own right; a woman who even kept young men, and <pb n="265"/> made up for the parsimony of their fathers by her liberality;
                        if she lived, being a widow, with freedom, being a lascivious woman, with
                        wantonness, being a rich woman, extravagantly, and being a lustful woman,
                        after the fashion of prostitutes; am I to think any one an adulterer who
                        might happen to salute her with a little too much freedom? <milestone n="17" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="39" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>Some one will say, &ldquo;Is this then the discipline which you enforce?
                        Is this the way you train up young men? Was this the object with which a
                        parent recommended his son to you and delivered him to you, that he might
                        devote his youth to love and pleasure, and that you might defend this manner
                        of life and these pursuits?&rdquo; </p>
					<p>If, O judges, any one was of such vigour of mind, and of a natural
                        disposition so formed for virtue and continence as to reject all pleasures,
                        and to dedicate the whole course of his life to labour of body and to
                        wholesome training of his mind, a man who took no delight in rest or
                        relaxation, or the pursuits of those of his own age, or games, or banquets,
                        who thought nothing in life worth wishing for, except what was connected
                        with glory and with dignity, that man I consider furnished and endowed with
                        good qualities which may be called godlike. Of this class I consider were
                        those great men, the Camilli, the Fabricii, the Curii and all those men who
                        have achieved such mighty exploits with inadequate means. But these examples
                        of virtue are not only not found in our practice, but they occur but rarely,
                        even in books. <milestone n="40" unit="section"/> The very records which
                        used to contain accounts of that old fashioned strictness of morals, are
                        worn out and that not only among us, who have adopted this school and system
                        of life in reality more than in words, but also among the Greeks most
                        learned men, who, though they could not act in such a manner were
                        nevertheless at liberty to speak and write honourably and magnificently;
                        when the habits of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> became
                        changed other precepts arose and prevailed. </p>
					<p>Therefore some of their wise men said that they did everything for the sake
                        of pleasure; and even learned men were not ashamed of the degradation of
                        uttering such a sentiment. <milestone n="41" unit="section"/> Others thought
                        that dignity ought to be united with pleasure, so as by their neatness of
                        expression to unite things as inconsistent with one another as possible.
                        Those who still think that the only direct road to glory is combined with
                        toil, are <pb n="266"/> left now almost solitary in their schools. For
                        nature herself has supplied us with numerous allurements, by which virtue
                        may be lulled asleep, and at which, she may be induced to connive; nature
                        herself has at times pointed out to youth many slippery ways, on which it is
                        hardly possible for it to stand, or along which it can hardly advance
                        without some slip or downfall, and has supplied also an infinite variety of
                        exquisite delights, by which not only that tender age, but even one which is
                        more strongly fortified, may be caught. </p>
					<p><milestone n="42" unit="section"/> Wherefore, if by chance you find any one
                        whose eyes are so well tutored as to look with scorn on the outward beauty
                        of things; who is not captivated by any fragrance, or touch, or flavour, and
                        who stops his ears against all the allurements of sound; I, and perhaps a
                        few others, may think that the gods have been propitious to this man, but
                        most people will consider that he has been treated by them as an object of
                        their anger. <milestone n="18" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>Let this path be abandoned, deserted and uncultivated as it is, and hemmed in
                        with hedges and brambles. Let some allowance be made for age; let youth be
                        allowed some little freedom; let not everything be refused to pleasure; let
                        us not require that true and proper system of life to be always predominant;
                        let us allow desire and pleasure at times to get the upper hand of reason,
                        as long as some sort of rule and moderation is observed in that kind of
                        licence. Let youth have a due regard for its own chastity; let it not
                        deprive others of theirs; let it not squander its patrimony; let it not be
                        swallowed up by usury; let it not attack the house or the fair fame of
                        another; let it not bring shame on the chaste, or disgrace on the upright,
                        or infamy on the virtuous; let it abstain from alarming people by violence;
                        from mixing in plots against people; let it keep itself from wickedness;
                        lastly, when it has yielded for awhile to pleasures, and given up some time
                        to the sports of its age, and to these frivolous and passing passions of
                        youth, let it in due time recall itself to attention to its domestic
                        affairs, to forensic employment and to the business of the state; so that it
                        may appear from satiety to have thrown away, and from experience to have
                        learnt to despise, those things which it had not been able properly to
                        estimate by its unassisted reason, <pb n="267"/><milestone n="43" unit="section"/>

					<p>And, O judges, both within, our own recollection and in the time of our
                        fathers and ancestors, there have been many most excellent men and most
                        illustrious citizens, who, after their youthful passions had cooled down,
                        displayed, when they became of more mature and vigorous age, the most
                        exalted virtues; of whom there is no need for me to name to you any
                        particular instance; you yourselves can recollect plenty. For I should not
                        wish to connect even the slightest error on the part of any brave and
                        illustrious man with his greatest glory. But if I did choose to do so, then
                        I could name many most eminent and most distinguished men, some of whom were
                        notorious for excessive licentiousness in their early days, some for their
                        profuse luxury, their enormous debts, their extravagance, and their
                        debaucheries, but whose early errors were afterwards so veiled over by their
                        numerous virtues, that every one felt at liberty to make excuses for and to
                        defend their youth. <milestone n="19" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="44" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>But in Marcus Caelius (for I will speak with the greater confidence of his
                        honourable pursuits, because, relying on your good sense, O judges, I am not
                        afraid freely to confess some things respecting him) no luxury will be
                        found; no extravagance; no debt; no lasciviousness; no devotion to banquets
                        or to gluttony. Those vices, forsooth, of the belly and the throat, age is
                        so far from diminishing in men, that it even increases them. And loves, and
                        those things which are called delights, and which, when men have any
                        strength of mind, are not usually troublesome to them for any length of
                        time, (for they wear off early and very rapidly,) never had any firm hold on
                        this man so as to entangle or embarrass him. You have heard him, when he was
                        speaking in his own defence. <milestone n="45" unit="section"/> You have
                        heard him before now, when he was acting as prosecutor; (I say this for the
                        sake of defending him, not by way of boasting;) you have seen, your sagacity
                        could not help seeing, his style of eloquence, his facility, his richness of
                        ideas and language; and in that branch of study you saw not only his genius
                        shine forth, which frequently, even when it is not nourished by industry,
                        still produces great effects by its own natural vigour; but there was in him
                        (unless I am greatly deceived by reason of my favourable inclination towards
                        him) a degree of method implanted in him by liberal tastes, and worked up by
                        care and hard labour. <pb n="268"/> And know, O judges, that those passions
                        which are now brought up against Caelius as an objection to him, and these
                        studies on which I am now enlarging, cannot easily exist in the same man;
                        for it is impossible that a mind which is devoted to lust which is hampered
                        by love, by desire, by passion, often with overindulgence, sometimes too by
                        embarrassment in pecuniary matters, can support the labour; such as they
                        are, which we go through in speaking; not merely when actually pleading, but
                        even in thinking. <milestone n="46" unit="section"/> Do you suppose that
                        there is any other reason, why, when the prizes of eloquence are so great
                        when the pleasure of speaking is so great, when the glory is so high, the
                        influence derived from it so extensive, and the honour so pure, there are
                        and always have been so few men who devote themselves to this study? All
                        pleasures must be trampled underfoot, all pursuit of amusement must be
                        abandoned, O judges; sports and jesting and feasting; yes, I may almost say,
                        the conversation of one's friends, must be shunned. And this is what deters
                        men of this class from the labours and studies of oratory; not that their
                        abilities are deficient, or that their early training has been neglected.
                            <milestone n="47" unit="section"/> Would Caelius, if he had given
                        himself up to a life of pleasure, while still a very young man, have
                        instituted a prosecution against a man of consular rank? would he, if he
                        shunned this labour, if he were captivated by and entangled in the pursuit
                        of pleasure, take his place daily among this array of orators? would he
                        court enmities? would he undertake prosecutions? would he incur danger to
                        his life? would he, in the sight of all the Roman people, struggle for so
                        many months for safety or for glory? <milestone n="20" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>Does, then, that neighbourhood of his intimate nothing? nor the common report
                        of men? Does not even <placeName key="perseus,Baiae">Baiae</placeName>
                        itself speak pretty plainly? Indeed, they not only speak, but cry aloud;
                        they proclaim that the lust of that one woman is so headlong, that she not
                        only does not seek solitude, and darkness, and the usual concealments of
                        wickedness, but even while behaving in the most shameless manner, exults in
                        the presence of the most numerous crowd, and in the broadest daylight. </p>
					<p><milestone n="48" unit="section"/> But if there be any one who thinks that
                        youth is to be wholly interdicted from amours with courtesans, he certainly
                            <pb n="268"/> is very strict indeed. I cannot deny what he says; but
                        still he is at variance not only with the licence of the present age, but
                        even with the habits of our ancestors, and with what they used to consider
                        allowable. For when was the time that men were not used to act in this
                        manner? when was such conduct found fault with? when was it not permitted?
                        when, in short, was the time when that which is lawful was not lawful? Here,
                        now, I will lay down what I consider a general rule: I will name no woman in
                        particular; I will leave the matter open for each of you to apply what I say
                        as he pleases. </p>
					<p><milestone n="49" unit="section"/> If any woman, not being married, has
                        opened her house to the passions of everybody, and has openly established
                        herself in the way of life of a harlot, and has been accustomed to frequent
                        the banquets of men with whom she has no relationship; if she does so in the

                        who are seen attending her, and not only by the eager glances of her eyes
                        and the freedom of her conversation, but also by embracing men, by kissing
                        them at water parties and sailing parties and banquets so as not only to
                        seem a harlot, but a very wanton and lascivious harlot, I ask you, O Lucius
                        Herennius, if a young man should happen to have been with her, is he to be
                        called an adulterer or a lover? does he seem to have been attacking chastity
                        or merely to have aimed at satisfying his desires? <milestone n="50" unit="section"/> I forget for the present all the injuries which you
                        have done me, O Clodia; I banish all recollection of my own distress; I put
                        out of consideration your cruel conduct to my relations when I was absent.
                        You are at liberty to suppose that what I have just said was not said about
                        you. But I ask you yourself, since the accusers say that they derived the
                        idea of this charge from you, and that they have you yourself as a witness
                        of its truth; I ask you, I say, if there be any woman of the sort that I
                        have just described, a woman unlike you, a woman of the habits and
                        profession of a harlot, does it appear an act of extraordinary baseness, or
                        extraordinary wickedness, for a young man to have had some connection with
                        her? If you are not such a woman,&mdash;and I would much rather believe
                        that you are not&mdash;then, what is it that they impute to Caelius? If
                        they try to make you out to be such a woman, then why need we fear <pb n="270"/> such an accusation for ourselves, if you confess that it
                        applies to you, and despise it? Give us then a path to and a plan for our
                        defence. For either your modesty will supply us with the defence, that
                        nothing has been done by Marcus Caelius with any undue wantonness; or else
                        your impudence will give both him and every one else very great facilities
                        for defending themselves. <milestone n="21" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="51" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>But since my speech appears at last to have raised itself out of the
                        shallows, and to have passed by the rocks, the rest of my course is made
                        plain and easy to me. For there are two charges, both relating to one
                        woman,&mdash;both imputing enormous wickedness; one respecting the gold
                        which is said to have been received from Clodia, the other respecting the
                        poison which the prosecutors accuse Caelius of having prepared with the view
                        of assassinating Clodia. He took gold, as you say, to give to the slaves of
                        Lucius Lucceius, by whom Dio of <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName> was slain, who at that time was living in
                        Lucceius's house. It is a great crime to intrigue against ambassadors, or to
                        tamper with slaves to induce them to murder their master's guest; it is a
                        design full of wickedness, full of audacity. <milestone n="52" unit="section"/> But with respect to that charge, I will first of all
                        ask this&mdash;whether he told Clodia for what purpose he was then
                        taking the gold, or whether he did not tell her? If he did not tell her, why
                        was it that she gave it? If he did tell her, then she has implicated herself
                        as an accomplice in the same wickedness. Did you dare to take gold out of
                        your strong-box? Did you dare to strip that statue of yours of Venus the
                        Plunderer of men of her ornaments? But when you knew for what an enormous
                        crime this gold was required,&mdash;for the murder of an
                        ambassador,&mdash;for the staining of Lucius Lucceius, a most pious and
                        upright man, with the blot of everlasting impiety&mdash;then your
                        well-educated mind ought not to have been privy to so horrible an atrocity;
                        your house, so open to all people, ought not to have been made an instrument
                        in it. Above all, that most hospitable Venus of yours ought not to have been
                        an assistant in it. <milestone n="53" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>Balbus saw that. He said that Clodia was kept in the dark, and that Caelius
                        alleged to her as his reason for wanting the gold, that he wanted it for the
                        ornamenting of his arms if he was as intimate with Clodia as you make him
                        out when <pb n="271"/> you say so much about his amorous propensities, he,
                        no doubt, told her what he wanted the gold for. If he was not so intimate
                        with her, then, no doubt, she never gave it. Therefore, if Caelius told you
                        the truth, O you most ill-regulated woman, you knowingly gave gold to
                        promote a crime; if he did not venture to tell you, you never gave it at
                        all. <milestone n="22" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>Why need I now bring forward arguments, of which I have a great number, to
                        repel this accusation? I might say that the habits of Marcus Caelius are
                        wholly foreign to such atrocious wickedness; that it is absolutely
                        incredible that it should never have occurred to so able and prudent a man,
                        that a deed of such guilt was not to be entrusted to the slaves of another
                        man, slaves of whom he had himself no knowledge. I might put these questions
                        also to the prosecutor, in accordance with the custom of other pleaders in
                        defence of accused persons and with my own,&mdash;where Caelius met with
                        the slaves of Lucceius? how he got access to them? If he negotiated with
                        them by himself, what rashness it was! if he employed the agency of another,
                        who was that other? I might, in the course of my speech, go through every
                        circumstance beneath which suspicion could be supposed to lurk. No cause, no
                        opportunity, no facility, no accomplice, no hope either of effecting or of
                        concealing the crime, no means whatever of executing it; in short, no trace
                        of such enormous guilt can be found connected with Caelius. <milestone n="54" unit="section"/> But all these topics, which belong peculiarly to
                        the orator, and which might do some service in my hands if I were to work
                        them up and dilate upon them in this presence, not because of any natural
                        ability that I possess, but because of my constant practice in, and habit
                        of, speaking, I, from a view to brevity, forbear to urge. For I have, O
                        judges, a man whom you will willingly allow to be connected with you by the
                        religious obligation of taking a similar oath with yourselves, Lucius
                        Lucceius, a most religious man, and a most conscientious witness; who if
                        such guilt so calculated to compromise his credit and his fortunes had been
                        brought into his household by Caelius, could not have failed to hear of it,
                        and would never have been indifferent to it and would never have borne it.
                        Could such a man as he, a man of such humanity, a man devoted to such
                        pursuits as his, and embued with all his <pb n="272"/> learning and
                        accomplishments, have been indifferent to the imminent danger of that man to
                        whom he had become attached on account of these very studies and pursuits?
                        And when he would have been most indignant at hearing of such a crime if it
                        had been committed against a stranger, would he have omitted taking any
                        notice of it when it affected his own guest? When he would have grieved if
                        he had found out that such a deed had been perpetrated by strangers, would
                        he have thought nothing of it when attempted by his own household? An action
                        which he would blame if done in the fields or in public places, was he
                        likely to think lightly of when it was begun in his own city and in his own
                        house? What he would not have concealed if it threatened any country person
                        with danger, can he, a learned man himself, be supposed to have kept secret
                        when a plot was laid against a most learned man? <milestone n="55" unit="section"/> But why, O judges, do I detain you so long? You shall
                        have the authority and scrupulous faith of the man himself on his oath
                        before you, and listen carefully to every word of his evidence. Read the
                        evidence of Lucius Lucceius. [The evidence of Lucceius is read.] What more
                        do you wait for? Do you think that the case itself, or even that truth of
                        itself can utter any actual words in its own defence? This is the defence
                        made by innocence,&mdash;this is the language of the cause
                        itself,&mdash;this is the single, unassisted voice of truth. </p>
					<p>In the circumstances of the crime itself there is no suspicion; in the facts
                        of the case there is no argument. In the negotiation which is said to have
                        been carried on, there is no trace of any conversation, of any opportunity,
                        of either time or place. No one is named as having been a witness of it. No
                        one is accused of having been privy to it. The whole accusation proceeds
                        from a house that is hostile to him,&mdash;that is of infamous
                        character, cruel, criminal, and lascivious. And that house, on the other
                        hand, which is said to have been tampered with, with a view to this
                        nefarious wickedness, is one full of integrity, dignity, kindness and piety.
                        And from this last you have had read to you a most authoritative declaration
                        under the sanction of an oath. So that the matter which you have to decide
                        upon is one on which very little doubt can arise,&mdash;namely, whether
                        a rash, libidinous, furious woman appears to have invented an accusation, or
                        a dignified, <pb n="273"/> and wise, and virtuous man is to be believed to
                        have given his evidence with a scrupulous regard to truth. <milestone n="23" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="56" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>There remains the charge respecting the poison for me to consider; a charge
                        of which I can neither discover the origin nor guess the object. For what
                        reason was there for Caelius desiring to give poison to that woman? Was it
                        in order to save himself from being forced to repay the gold? Did she demand
                        it back? Was it to save himself from being accused? Did any one impute
                        anything to him? In short, would any one ever have mentioned him if he had
                        not himself instituted a prosecution against somebody? Moreover you heard
                        Lucius Herennius say that he would never have caused annoyance to Caelius by
                        a single word, if he had not prosecuted his intimate friend a second time on
                        the same charge, after he had been already acquitted once. Is it credible
                        then, that so enormous a crime was committed without any object? And do you
                        not see that an accusation of the most enormous wickedness is invented
                        against him in order that it may appear to have been committed for the sake
                        of facilitating the other wickedness? <milestone n="57" unit="section"/> To
                        whom, then, did he entrust its execution? Whom did he employ as an
                        assistant? Who was his companion? Who was his accomplice? To whom did he
                        entrust so foul a crime; to whom did he entrust himself and his own safety?
                        Was it to the slaves of that woman? For that is what is imputed to him. Was
                        he, then; so insane,&mdash;he to whom at least you allow the credit of
                        good abilities, even if you refuse him all other praise in that hostile
                        speech of yours,&mdash;as to trust his whole safety to another man's
                        slaves? And to what slaves? For even that makes a considerable difference?
                        Was it to slaves whose slavery as he was aware was one of no ordinary
                        condition, but who were in the habit of being treated with indulgence and
                        freedom and every familiarity, by their mistress? For who is there, O
                        judges, who does not see, who is there who does not know, that in such a
                        house as that in which the mistress of the house lives after the fashion of
                        a prostitute,&mdash;in which nothing is done which is fit to be
                        mentioned out of doors,&mdash;in which debauchery, and lust, and luxury
                        and, in short all sorts of unheard of vices and wickednesses are carried on,
                        the slaves are not slaves at all? men to whom everything is confided by,
                        whose agency everything is done; who are occupied in the same pleasures <pb n="273"/> as their mistress; who have secrets entrusted to them, and who
                        get even some, and that no inconsiderable, share of the daily extravagance
                        and luxury. Was Caelius, then, not aware of this? <milestone n="58" unit="section"/> For if he was as intimate with the woman as you try to
                        make him out, be certainly knew that those slaves also were intimate with
                        her. But if no such intimacy existed between him and her as is alleged by
                        you, then how could he have arrived at such familiarity with her slaves?
                            <milestone n="24" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>But, however, of the poison itself what account is invented? where was it
                        got? how was it prepared? by what means? to whom was it delivered, and
                        where? They say that he kept it at home, and that he made trial of its
                        strength on one of his slaves whom he provided with that express object, and
                        that his rapid death led him to think highly of the poison. <milestone n="59" unit="section"/> O ye immortal gods! why do you at times appear
                        to wink at the greatest crimes of men, or why do you reserve the punishment
                        of present wickedness to a future day? For I saw, I saw, and I myself
                        experienced that grief, the bitterest grief that I ever felt in my life,
                        when Quintus Metellus was torn from the heart and bosom of his country, and
                        when that man who considered himself born only for this empire, but three
                        days after he had been in good health, flourishing in the senate-house, in
                        the rostrum, and in the republic; while in the flower of his age, of an
                        excellent constitution, and in the full vigour of manhood, was torn in a
                        most unworthy manner from all good men, and from the entire state; at which
                        time he, though dying, when on other points his senses appeared to be
                        bewildered, retained his senses to the last as far as his recollection of
                        the republic was concerned; and beholding me in tears, he intimated with
                        broken and failing voice, how great a storm he saw was impending over the
                        city,&mdash;how great a tempest was threatening the state; and
                        frequently striking that wall which separated his house from that of
                        Catulus, he kept on mentioning Catulus by name, and me myself, and the
                        republic, so as to show that he was grieving, not so much because he was
                        dying, as because both his country and I were about to be deprived of his
                        aid and protection. </p>
					<p><milestone n="60" unit="section"/> But, if no violence of sudden wickedness
                        had carried off that great man, with what vigour would he, as a man of
                        consular rank, have resisted that frantic cousin of his,&mdash;he, who
                        as <pb n="275"/> consul said in the hearing of the senate, at a time when he
                        was beginning and endeavouring to give reins to his fury, that he would slay
                        him with his own hand! And shall that woman, proceeding from this house,
                        dare to speak of the rapidity of the operation of poison? Is she not afraid
                        of the very house itself, lest she should make it utter some sound? Does she
                        not dread the very walls, which are privy to her wickedness? does she not
                        shudder at the recollection of that fatal and melancholy night? </p>
					<p>But I will return to the accusation: but this mention of that most
                        illustrious and most gallant man has both weakened my voice with weeping,
                        and overcome my mind with sorrow. <milestone n="25" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="61" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>But still there is no mention made of whence the poison came from, or how it
                        was prepared. They say that it was given to Publius Licinius, a modest and
                        virtuous young man, and an intimate friend of Caelius. They say that an
                        arrangement was entered into with the slaves, that they should come to the
                        strangers' baths; and that Licinius should come thither also, and should
                        give them the box containing the poison. Now, here first of all I ask this
                        question, What was the object of all this being done in that previously
                        arranged place? Why did not the slaves come to Caelius's house? If that
                        great intimacy and that excessive familiarity between Caelius and Clodia
                        still subsisted, what suspicion would have been excited by one of the slaves
                        of that woman having been seen at Caelius's house? But if a quarrel had
                        already sprung up between them, if the intimacy was over, and enmity had
                        taken its place, <quote>
                            <l>Hence arose those tears.</l>
                        </quote> This is the cause of all that wickedness and of all those crimes.
                            <milestone n="62" unit="section"/> Very true, says he, and when the
                        slaves had reported to their mistress the whole transaction and the guilty
                        designs of Caelius, that crafty woman enjoined her slaves to promise Caelius
                        everything; but in order that the poison when it was being delivered to them
                        by Licinius, might be clearly detected, she commanded them to appoint the
                        strangers' baths as the place where it was to he delivered in order to send
                        thither friends to lie in ambush there and then on a sudden, when Licinius
                        had arrived and was delivering the poison, to jump out, and arrest the man.
                            <milestone n="26" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>But all these circumstances, O judges, furnish me <pb n="276"/> with a very
                        easy method of refuting them. For why had she appointed the public baths, of
                        all places in the world? where I cannot find any spot which may serve as an
                        ambush for men in their gowns. For if they were in the vestibule of the
                        baths, they would not be lying hid at all; if, they wished to enter into the
                        inner parts of the baths, they could not conveniently do it with their shoes
                        and garments on, and perhaps they would not be admitted; unless, perchance,
                        by a species of barter,&mdash;instead of the proper piece of money paid
                        for ad-mission into the baths,&mdash;that vigorous woman had made a
                        friend of the bathing-man. <milestone n="63" unit="section"/> And, in truth,
                        I was waiting eagerly to see who those virtuous men were, who would be
                        stated to have been witnesses of this poison having been so clearly
                        detected. For none have been named as yet. But I have no doubt that they are
                        men of very high authority indeed, as, in the first place, they are the
                        intimate friends of such a woman; and, in the second place, they took upon
                        themselves that share of the business,&mdash;that, namely, of being
                        thrust down into the baths; which she, even were she as powerful as she
                        could possibly wish to be, could never have prevailed on any men to do,
                        except such as were most honourable men, and men of the very greatest
                        natural dignity. But why do I speak of the dignity of those witnesses? Learn
                        yourselves how virtuous and how scrupulous they are. They lay in ambush in
                        the baths. Splendid witnesses, indeed! Then they sprung out precipitately. O
                        men entirely devoted to their dignity! For this is the story that they make
                        up: that when Licinius had arrived, and was holding the box of poison in his
                        hand, and was endeavouring to deliver it to them, but had not yet delivered
                        it, then all on a sudden those splendid nameless witnesses sprung out; and
                        that Licinius, when he had already put out his hand to give them over the
                        box of poison, drew it back again, and, alarmed at that an expected onset of
                        men, took to his heels. O how great is the power of truth! which of its own
                        power can easily defend itself against all the ingenuity, and cunning, and
                        wisdom of men, and against the treacherous plots of all the world.
                            <milestone n="27" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="64" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>But how destitute of all proof is the whole of the story of this poetess and
                        inventress of many fables! How totally without any conceivable object or
                        result is it! For what does she say? Why did so numerous a body of men, <pb n="277"/> (for it is clear enough it was not a small number, as it was
                        requisite that Licinius should be arrested with ease, and that the
                        transaction should be more completely proved by the eyewitness of many
                        witnesses,) why, I say, did so numerous a body of men let Licinius escape
                        from their hands? For why was Licinius less liable to be apprehended when he
                        had drawn back in order not to deliver up the box than he would have been if
                        he had delivered it up? For those men had been placed on purpose to arrest
                        Licinius in order that Licinius might be caught in the very fact either of
                        having just delivered up the poison, or of still having it in his
                        possession. This was the whole plan of the woman. This was the part allotted
                        to those men who were asked to undertake it but why it is that they sprung
                        forth so precipitately and prematurely as you say, I do not find stated. </p>
					<p>They had been invited for this express purpose they had been placed with this
                        especial object in order to effect the undeniable detection of the poison,
                        of the plot, and of every particular of the crime. <milestone n="65" unit="section"/> Could they spring forward at a better time than when
                        Licinius had arrived? when he was holding in his hand the box of poison? and
                        if after that box had been delivered to the slaves the friends of the woman
                        had on a sudden emerged from the baths and seized Licinius, he would have
                        implored the protection of their good faith and have denied that that box
                        had been delivered to them by him. And how would they have reproved him?
                        Would they have said that they had seen it? First of all that would have
                        been to bring the imputation of a most atrocious crime on themselves
                        besides, they would be saying that they had seen what from the spot in which
                        they had been placed they could not possibly have seen. Therefore they
                        showed themselves at the very nick of time when Licinius had arrived and was
                        getting out the box, and was stretching out his hand, and delivering the
                        poison. This is rather the end of a farce than a regular comedy; in which,
                        when a regular end cannot be invented for it some one escapes out of some
                        one else's hands, the whistle<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="la">Scabillum</foreign> is the Latin word. &ldquo;<foreign lang="la">Scabillum</foreign>, a kind of musical instrument which by

					<p>For I ask why that army under the command of the woman allowed Licinius, when
                        embarrassed, hesitating, receding, and endeavouring to fly, to slip through
                        their fingers? why they did not seize him? why they did not prove beyond all
                        denial a crime of such enormous wickedness by his own confession, by the
                        eye-witness of many people, by even the voice of the crime itself if I may
                        say so? Were they afraid that so many men would not be able to get the
                        better of one, that strong men would not be able to beat a weak man, or
                        active men to surprise one in such a fright? </p>
					<p>No corroborative proof is to be found in the circumstances; no ground for
                        suspicion in any part of the case, no object for or result of the crime, can
                        be imagined. Therefore, this cause, instead of being supported by arguments,
                        by conjecture, and by those tokens by which the truth generally has a light
                        thrown upon it rests wholly on the witnesses. And those witnesses, O judges,
                        I long to see, not only without the least apprehension, but with a soft of
                        hope of great enjoyment. <milestone n="67" unit="section"/> My mind is
                        exceedingly eager to behold them, first, because they are luxurious youths,
                        the intimate friends of a rich and high-born woman; secondly, because they
                        are gallant men, placed by their Amazonian general in ambush, and as a sort
                        of garrison to the baths. And, when I see them, I will ask them how they lay
                        hid, and where; whether it was a canal, or a second Trojan horse, which bore
                        and concealed so many invincible men waging war for the sake of a woman? And
                        this I will compel them to tell me, why so many gallant men did not either
                        at once seize this man, who was but a single individual, and as slight and
                        weak a man as you see, while he was standing there; or, at all events, why
                        they did not pursue him when he fled. </p>
					<p>And, in truth, they will never be able to get out of their perplexity, if
                        they ever do go into that witness-box; not though they may be ever so witty
                        and talkative at banquets, and sometimes, over their wine, even eloquent.
                        For the forum is one thing, and the banqueting couch another. The benches of
                        counselors are very different from the sofas of revelers. A tribunal of
                        judges is not particularly like a row of hard-drinkers. In short, the
                        radiance of the sun is a very different thing from the light of lamps. So
                        that we will soon scatter all those gentlemen's delicate airs, all their
                        absurdities, if they <pb n="279"/> do appear. But if they will be guided by

                        of some one else by some other means; let them display their capacity in
                        other employments; let them flourish in that woman's house in beauty; let
                        them regulate her expenses let them cling to her, sup with her, serve her in
                        every possible way, but let them spare the lives and fortunes of innocent
                        men. <milestone n="29" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="68" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>But those slaves have been emancipated by the advice of her
                        relations,&mdash;most highly born and illustrious men. At last then we
                        have found something which that woman is said to have done by the advice and
                        authority of her own relations,&mdash;men of the highest respectability
                        of character. But I wish to know what proof there is in that emancipation of
                        slaves, so that either any charge against Caelius can be made out of that,
                        or any examination of the slaves themselves by means of torture prevented,
                        or any pretext found for giving rewards to slaves who were privy to too many
                        transactions which it is desired to keep secret? But her relations advised
                        it. Why should not they advise it, when you yourself stated that you were
                        reporting to them a matter which you had not received information of from
                        others, but which had been discovered by yourself? <milestone n="69" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>Here also we wonder whether any most obscene story followed the tale of that
                        imaginary box. There is nothing which may not seem applicable to such a
                        woman as that. The matter has been heard of, and has been the subject of
                        universal conversation. You have long ago perceived, O judges, what I wish
                        to say, or rather what I wish not to say. For even if such a crime was
                        committed, it certainly was not committed by Caelius; for what concern was
                        it of his? It may perhaps have been committed by some young man, not so much
                        foolish as destitute of modesty. But if it be a mere fiction, it is not
                        indeed a very modest invention, but still it is not destitute of
                        wit;&mdash;one which in truth the common conversation and common opinion
                        of men would never have sealed with their approbation, if every sort of
                        story which involved any kind of infamy did not appear consistent with and
                        suited to that woman's character. <milestone n="70" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>The cause has now been fully stated by me, O judges, and summed up. You now
                        understand how important an action this is which has been submitted to your
                        decision; how serious <pb n="280"/> a charge is confided to you. You are
                        presiding over an investigation into a charge of violence;&mdash;into a
                        law which concerns the empire, the majesty of the state, the condition of
                        the country, and the safety of all the citizens;&mdash;a law which
                        Quintus Catulus passed at a time when armed dissensions were dividing the
                        people, and when the republic was almost at its last gasp;&mdash;a law
                        which, after the flame which raged so fiercely in my consulship had been
                        allayed, extinguished the smoking relics of the conspiracy. Under this law
                        the youth of Marcus Caelius is demanded, not for the sake of enduring any
                        punishment called for by the republic, but in order to be sacrificed to the
                        lust and profligate pleasures of a woman. <milestone n="30" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="71" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>And even in this place the condemnation of Marcus Camurtius<note anchored="yes">It is quite unknown to as what these allusions of Cicero
                            to passing events refer to.</note> and Caius Caesernius is brought up
                        again! Oh the folly, or shall I rather say, oh the extraordinary impudence!
                        Do you dare,&mdash;you prosecutors,&mdash;when you come from that
                        woman's house, to make mention of those men? Do you dare to reawaken the
                        recollection of so enormous a crime, which is not even now dead, but is only
                        smothered by its antiquity? For on account of what charge, or what fault did
                        those men fall? Forsooth, because they endeavoured to avenge the grief and
                        suffering of that same woman caused by the injury which they believed she
                        had received from Vettius. Was, then, the cause of Camurtius and Caesernius
                        brought up again in order that the name of Vettius might be heard of in
                        connection with this cause, and that that farcical old story, suited to the
                        pen of Afranius, might be rubbed up again? For though they were certainly
                        not liable under the law concerning violence, they were still so implicated
                        in that crime, that they deemed men who ought never to be released from the
                        shackles of the law. <milestone n="72" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>But why is Marcus Caelius brought before this court? when no charge properly
                        belonging to this mode of investigation is imputed to him, nor indeed
                        anything else of such a nature that, though it may not exactly come under
                        the provisions of my law, still calls for the exercise of your severity. His
                        early youth was devoted to strict discipline; and to those pursuits by which
                        we are prepared for these forensic labours,&mdash;for taking part in the
                        administration of the republic,&mdash;for honour, <pb n="281"/> and
                        glory, and dignity <gap desc="* * * *"/> and to those friendships with his
                        elders, whose industry and temperance he might most desire to imitate; and
                        to those studies of the youths of his own age: so that he appeared to be
                        pursuing the same course of glory as the most virtuous and most highly-born
                        of the citizens. <milestone n="73" unit="section"/> Afterwards, when he had
                        advanced somewhat in age and strength, he went into <placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>, as a comrade of Quintus Pompeius
                        the proconsul, one of the most temperate of men, and one of the strictest in
                        the performance of every duty. And as his paternal property and estate lay
                        in that province, he thought that some knowledge of its habits and feelings
                        would be usefully acquired by him, now that he was of an age which our
                        ancestors thought adapted for gaining that sort of information. He departed
                        from <placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>, having gained the most
                        favourable opinion of Pompeius, as you shall learn from Pompeius's own
                        evidence. </p>
					<p>He then wished, according to the old-fashioned custom, and following the
                        example of those young men who afterwards turned out most eminent men and
                        most illustrious citizens in the state, to signalise his industry in the
                        eyes of the Roman people, by some very conspicuous prosecution. <milestone n="31" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="74" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>I wish indeed that his desire for glory had led him in some other direction;
                        but the time for this complaint has passed by. He prosecuted Caius Antonius,
                        my colleague; an unhappy man, to whom the recollection of the great service
                        which he did the republic was no benefit, but to whom the belief of the evil
                        which he had designed was the greatest prejudice. After that he never was
                        behind any of his fellows in his constant appearance in the forum, in his
                        incessant application to business and to the causes of his friends, and in
                        the great influence which he acquired over his relations. He achieved by his
                        labour and diligence all those objects which they cannot attain who are
                        other than vigilant, and sober, and industrious men. <milestone n="75" unit="section"/> At this turning-point of his life, (for I place too
                        much reliance on your humanity and on your good sense to conceal anything,)
                        the fame of the young man stood trembling in the balance, owing to his new
                        acquaintance with this woman, and his unfortunate neighbourhood to her, and
                        his want of habituation to pleasure; for the desire of pleasure when it has
                        been too long pent up, and repressed, and chained down in early youth,
                        sometimes bursts forth on a sudden, and throws <pb n="282"/> down every
                        barrier. But from this course of life, and from being in this way the
                        subject of common conversation, (though his excesses were not by any means
                        as great as report made them out to be;)&mdash;however, from this course
                        of life, I say, whatever it was, he soon emerged, and delivered himself
                        wholly from it and raised himself out of it, and he is now so far removed
                        from the discredit of any familiarity with that woman, that he is occupied
                        in warding off the attacks which are instigated against him by her enmity
                        and hatred. </p>
					<p>
                        <milestone n="76" unit="section"/> And in order to put a violent end to the
                        reports which had arisen of his luxury and inactivity,&mdash;(what he
                        did, he did in fact greatly against my will, and in spite of my strongest
                        remonstrances, but still he did it,)&mdash;he instituted a prosecution
                        against a friend of mine for bribery and corruption. And after he is
                        acquitted he pursues him still, drags him back before the court, refuses to
                        be guided by any one of us, and is far more violent than I approve of. But I
                        am not speaking of wisdom,&mdash;which indeed does not belong to men of
                        his age,&mdash;I am speaking of his ardent spirit, of his desire for
                        victory, of the eagerness of his soul in the pursuit of glory. Those desires
                        indeed in men of our age ought to have become more limited and moderate, but
                        in young men, as in herbs, they show what ripeness of virtue and what great
                        crops are likely to reward our industry. In truth, youths of great ability
                        have always required rather to be restrained from the pursuit of glory, than
                        to be spurred on to it: more things required to be pruned away from that
                        age,&mdash;if indeed, it deserves distinction for ability and
                        genius,&mdash;than to be implanted in it. <milestone n="77" unit="section"/> If, therefore, the energy, and fierceness, and
                        pertinacity of Caelius appear to any one to have boiled over too much,
                        either in respect of his voluntary incurring, or of his mode of carrying on
                        enmities; if even any of the most trifling particulars of his conduct in
                        this respect seem offensive to any one; or if any one feels displeased at
                        the magnificence of his purple robe, or at the troops of friends who escort
                        him, or at the general splendour and brilliancy of his appearance, let him
                        recollect that all these things will soon pass away,&mdash;that a riper
                        age, and circumstances, and the progress of time, will soon have softened
                        down all of them. <milestone n="32" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>Preserve, therefore, to the republic, O judges, a <pb n="283"/> citizen
                        devoted to liberal studies, and to the most virtuous party in the state, and
                        to all good men. I promise you this,&mdash;and I give this undertaking
                        to the republic provided we ourselves have by our own conduct given
                        satisfaction to the republic,&mdash;that Caelius's conduct will never be
                        at variance with our own. And I promise not only because I rely on the
                        intimacy that subsists between him and me, but also because he has taken
                        upon himself already the obligation of the most stringent engagements.
                            <milestone n="78" unit="section"/> For a man who has ventured on such a
                        step as that of prosecuting a man of consular rank because he says that the
                        republic has been injured by his violence, cannot possibly behave as a
                        turbulent citizen in the republic himself: a man who will not allow another
                        to be at peace, even after he his been acquitted of bribery and corruption,
                        can never himself become a briber of others with impunity. </p>
					<p>The republic, O judges, has two prosecutions, which have been carried on by
                        Marcus Caelius, as pledges to secure it from any danger from him and
                        guarantees of his good-will and devotion. Wherefore I do pray and entreat
                        you, O judges, after Sextus Clodius has been acquitted within these few days
                        in this very city;&mdash;a man whom you have seen for the last two years
                        acting on all occasions as the minister or leader of sedition;&mdash;a
                        man who has burnt sacred temples and even the census of the Roman people and
                        all the public records and registers<note anchored="yes">This refers to
                            Clodius having set on fire the temple of the Nymphs, where the registers

                        without property, without honesty, without hope, without a home, without any
                        character or position, polluted in face, and tongue, and hand, and in every
                        particular of his life;&mdash;a man who has degraded the monument of
                        Catulus, who has pulled down my house, and burnt that belonging to my

                            Hill</placeName>, and in the sight of all the city, stirred up the

                        you, I say, not to suffer that man to have been acquitted in this city by
                        the influence of a woman, and at the same time to allow Marcus Caelius to be
                        sacrificed, in the same city, to a woman's lusts. I entreat you never to
                        permit the same woman, in conjunction with a man who is at the same time her
                        brother and her husband, to save a most infamous robber, <pb n="284"/> and
                        to overwhelm a most honourable and virtuous young man. <milestone n="79" unit="section"/> And when you have given due consideration to the fact
                        of his youth, then place also before your eyes, I entreat you, the old age
                        of his miserable father whom you see before you; whose whole dependence is
                        on this his only son; who reposes on the hopes which he has formed of him;
                        who fears nothing but the disasters which may befall him. Support, I pray
                        you, that old man, now a suppliant for your mercy, the slave of your power,
                        who while he throws himself at your feet, so appeals more strongly still to
                        your virtuous habits, and to your kind and right feelings; support him, I
                        say, moved either by the recollection of your own parents, or by the
                        affection with which you regard your own children, so as, while relieving
                        the misery of another, to yield to your own pious or indulgent dispositions.
                        Do not, O judges, cause this old man, who is already, by the silent progress
                        of nature, declining and hastening to his end, to fail prematurely through a
                        wound inflicted by you, before the day which his natural destiny has
                        appointed for him. <milestone n="80" unit="section"/> Do not overthrow this
                        other man, now flourishing in the prime of life, now that his virtue has
                        just taken firm root, as it were by some whirlwind or sudden tempest.
                        Preserve the son for the father, the father for the son, lest you should
                        appear either to have despised the old age of a man almost in despair, or on
                        the other hand not only to have abstained from cherishing, but even to have
                        struck down and crushed, a youth pregnant with the greatest promise. And if
                        you do preserve him to yourselves, to his own relations, and to the
                        republic, you will have him dedicated, devoted, and wholly bound to you and
                        to your children, and you will enjoy, O judges, in the greatest possible
                        degree, the abundant and lasting fruits of all his exertions and labours.

						<p>This speech was delivered about the middle of the year of the consulship
                            of Cnaeus Cornelius Lentulus Marcellinus and Lucius Marcius Philippus,
                            A. U. C. 698. Before the new consuls were elected, the senate assembled
                            to deliberate on what province should be allotted to them on the
                            expiration of their year of office. The provinces about which the
                            question really was were the two Gauls which Caesar had, and <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName> which had been given to Lucius
                            Calpurnius Piso Caesonius, and to Aulus Gabinius, the consuls of the
                            year 696. Several senators had spoken when Cicero rose, and had all,
                            except Servilius, advocated the taking one or both of the Gauls from
                            Caesar, which was in fact what the senate was desirous to do, but
                            Cicero, who had himself been treated with the greatest indignity by Piso
                            and Gabinius, was anxious instead to get them recalled with some marks
                            of disgrace, and to have their provinces assigned to the consuls, and he
                            urged also that Caesar's command should be continued to him till he had
                            finished the war which he was carrying on with such success and till he
                            had settled the conquered countries. This was much against the wishes of
                            the senate and even of the existing consuls, who were principally
                            concerned in the matter so that Philippus reproached Cicero, and
                            reminded him that he had received worse treatment from Caesar than he
                            had even from Gabinius since Caesar had been the real author of the
                            calamities which had befallen him. But Cicero replied that his object
                            was not the satisfying of his own private resentment, but the promotion
                            of the real interests of the republic; that Caesar was deserving well of
                            his country, that if he remained in his province, he would soon reduce
                            all <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> to subjection, but
                            that Piso and Gabinius were only tyrannizing over and draining their
                            provinces while they were objects of contempt to all foreign enemies.
                            The result was that he brought the senate entirely over to this opinion,
                            and they continued Caesar's command in <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> and recalled <placeName key="tgn,2040810">Piso</placeName> and Gabinius from their provinces which were given
                            to the new consuls.<note anchored="yes">See the oration against

					<p>If any one of you, O conscript fathers, is waiting to see what provinces I
                        shall propose to decree to the consuls, let him consider in his own mind
                        what men I must think it most desirable to recall from the provinces; and
                        then he will not <pb n="286"/> have any doubt what ought to be my
                        sentiments, when he has once seriously thought what it is absolutely
                        inevitable that they should be. And if I were the first to deliver the
                        opinion which I am about to state, you would in truth praise it; if I were
                        to stand alone in it, at all events you would pardon me. Even if my opinion
                        were to appear to you on the whole somewhat ineligible, still you would make
                        some allowance for my just indignation. But, as the case stands at present,
                        O conscript fathers, I feel no ordinary delight because it is so entirely
                        for the advantage of the republic that <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> should be the provinces decreed to the consuls,
                        that my own private feelings are in no respect at variance with the general
                        good; and because also I can cite the authority of Publius Servilius, who
                        has delivered his opinion before me, a most illustrious man, and of singular
                        good faith and attachment both to the republic in general, and to my safety
                        in particular. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> And if he, both just now,
                        and whenever he has had any opportunity or possibility of speaking on the
                        subject, has thought it his duty to brand not only with his adverse opinion
                        but with the greatest severity of language, Gabinius and Piso, as the two
                        monsters who have been almost the destruction of the republic, both on other
                        accounts, and also most especially because of their extraordinary wickedness
                        and unseemly inhumanity towards me, with what feelings ought I myself to be
                        actuated towards those men,&mdash;I whose safety they devoted and ruined
                        for the gratification of their own evil passions? </p>
					<p>But in declaring my sentiments at this time, I will not be guided by my
                        indignation, nor will I make my speech subservient to my enmity. The same
                        feelings which every individual among you ought to entertain towards those
                        men, shall influence me also. My own predominant and peculiar feeling of
                        private indignation, which, however, you have always considered as belonging
                        to yourselves in common with me, I will put aside while delivering my
                        opinion, and reserve for a more fitting opportunity of revenge. <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>There are four provinces, O conscript fathers, concerning which I understand
                        that opinions have as yet been delivered: the two Gauls, which at present we
                        see united under one command; and <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>; and <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>; which, against your will, and when you were
                        suffering under oppression <pb n="287"/> and constraint, those pernicious
                        consuls seized on as their reward for having overturned the republic.
                        According to the provisions of the Sempronian law, we have now to decree two
                        to the consuls. How is it possible for us to doubt about <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> being these two? I say nothing of the fact that
                        those men are holding them at present who procured them in such a way that
                        they did not get them till they condemned this order of ours till they had
                        destroyed your authority and put an end to it in the state till they had
                        destroyed all public credit and good faith endangered the lasting safety of
                        the Roman people, and harassed me and my friends and relations in the most
                        shameful and barbarous manner. </p>
					<p><milestone n="4" unit="section"/> All these private matters, all these
                        transactions which took place in the city, I say nothing about; though they
                        are of such a nature that Hannibal himself never wished so much evil to this
                        city, as those men have done. I come to the case of the provinces
                        themselves, of which <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>,
                        which was formerly fortified not by the towers built, but by the trophies
                        erected by numbers of our generals, which had long ago been reduced to a
                        state of tranquillity by many victories and triumphs, is now so harassed by
                        the barbarians who are not allowed to rest in peace in consequence of the
                        avarice of the late consul, that the people of <placeName key="tgn,7011182">Thessalonica</placeName>, placed in the lap as it were of our empire
                        are compelled to abandon their town and to fortify their citadel, that that
                        military road of ours which reaches all through <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> as far as the <placeName key="tgn,7002638">Hellespont</placeName> is not only infested by the incursions of the
                        barbarians but is even studded with and divided among Thracian encampments.
                        And so those nations which had given large sums of money to our illustrious
                        commanders to purchase the blessings of peace, in order to be able to
                        replenish their houses which had been thus drained, instead of the peace
                        which they had purchased, have waged against us what is little short of a
                        regular war. And now that very army of ours, collected by a most splendid
                        enlistment, and by a very rigid levy, has almost entirely perished. I say
                        this with the most real grief. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>The soldiers of the Roman people have been taken prisoners, put to death,
                        abandoned, and dispersed in a most miserable manner. They have been wasted
                        away by neglect, <pb n="288"/> by famine, by disease, by every sort of
                        disaster; so that (and it is a most scandalous thing) the wickedness of the
                        general appears <gap desc="* * *"/>to have been chastised by the punishment of the fatherland
                        and the army. And this <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>,
                        as all the neighbouring nations had been subdued, and all the barbarians
                        checked, we used to be able to preserve by its own resources, in a peaceable
                        state, and in perfect tranquillity, with a very slight garrison, and a small
                        army, even without a commander-in-chief, by means of lieutenants, and by the
                        bare name of the Roman people. And yet now, when there is a man there with
                        consular command and a consular army, it is so harassed that it is scarcely
                        able to recruit its strength by a peace of any duration. And in the meantime
                        who is there of you who has not heard and who does not know that the
                        Achaeans are every year paying a vast sum to Lucius Piso? that all the
                        revenues and harbour duties of the Dyrrachians have been converted to a
                        source of profit for this one man? that the city of the Byzantines, a city
                        most loyal to you and to this empire, is harassed as if it belonged to an
                        enemy? to which city he, after he could no longer squeeze anything out of
                        them, because of the poverty to which he had reduced them, and could not by
                        any acts of violence extort anything more from them, miserable as they were,
                        sent his cohorts into winter quarters, and gave them commanders whom he
                        thought likely to be his most complying and diligent agents in wickedness,
                        and ministers to his desires. </p>
					<p><milestone n="6" unit="section"/> I say nothing of the way in which he
                        exercised his jurisdiction in a free city contrary to the laws and to the
                        resolutions of the senate. I pass over his murders, I omit all mention of
                        his acts of lust; of which there is a most bitter token, for the lasting
                        recollection of his infamy, and almost bringing even our sovereignty into
                        just odium, in the fact that it is notorious that some virgins of the
                        noblest birth threw themselves into wells, and by a voluntary death escaped
                        from otherwise inevitable disgrace. Nor do I omit them now because they are
                        not most enormous atrocities, but because I am speaking without the support
                        of any witnesses. <milestone n="4" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>But who is there who is ignorant that the city of the Byzantines was entirely
                        filled and superbly decorated with statues? which the citizens, even when
                        exhausted by the great <pb n="289"/> expenses of important wars, while
                        sustaining the attacks of Mithridates, and the whole force of <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName>, boiling over and pouring itself
                        over all <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> which they repulsed
                        with difficulty at their own great risk,&mdash;even then, I say, and
                        afterwards, the Byzantines preserved those statues and all the other
                        ornaments of their city and guarded them most religiously. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> But when you, O most unhappy and most infamous of men,
                        became the commander there, O Caesoninus Calventius then a free city, and
                        one which had been made so by the senate and people of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, on account of its recent services,
                        was so plundered and stripped of everything, that, if Caius Virgilius the
                        lieutenant, a very brave and incorruptible man, had not interfered, the
                        Byzantines would not have retained one single statue out of all their great
                        number. </p>
					<p>What temple in all <placeName key="tgn,7002733">Achaia</placeName>? what spot
                        or what grove in the whole of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, was there of such sanctity that a single statue or
                        a single ornament has been left in it? You purchased from a most infamous
                        tribune of the people, at the time of that general shipwreck of the city,
                        which you, the very man who were bound to govern it rightly, had been the
                        main agent in overturning; you purchased, I say, at that time, for an
                        immense sum of money, the power of pronouncing judgment on the people of the
                        free cities, with respect to the moneys which had been advanced, contrary to
                        the resolutions of the senate, and the law of your own son-in-law. What you
                        had bought, you sold in such a manner that you either never gave any
                        decision at all, or else you deprived Roman citizens of their property.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> But I am not bringing forward these
                        facts at this moment, O conscript fathers, as charges against this man, I am
                        merely arguing with respect to the province. Therefore I pass over all those
                        things which you have often heard of and which you are well aware of, even
                        when you do not hear of them. I say nothing of his audacious conduct in the
                        city, which he has fixed deep in the recollection of your eyes and minds; I
                        say nothing of his arrogance, of his insolence, of his cruelty. Let those
                        dark acts of lust of his lie hid, acts which he tried to conceal by his
                        stern countenance and supercilious look, not by modesty and temperance. I am
                        arguing about the province, the welfare of which is at stake in this matter.
                        Will you not send a successor to such a man as this? Will you allow him to
                        remain any longer? a man whose fortune, from the very moment <pb n="290"/>
                        that he first reached the province, has so vied with his wickedness, that no
                        one could decide whether he was more undeserving or more unfortunate.

					<p>But as for <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>, is that Semiramis
                        any longer to be retained there? a man whose march into the province bore
                        the appearance of king Ariobarzanes having hired your consul to come and
                        commit murder, as if he were some Thracian. His very first arrival in
                            <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName> was signalized by the
                        destruction of the cavalry; after that, all his best cohorts were cut to
                        pieces. Therefore, in <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>, since
                        he has been the commander-in-chief, nothing has been done beyond making
                        money-bargains with tyrants, and selling decisions, and committing robbery
                        and piracy and massacre; while the general of the Roman people, with his
                        army in battle array, stretching forth his right hand, did not exhort his
                        soldiers to the pursuit of glory, but only kept crying out that everything
                        had been bought by him and was to be bought still. <milestone n="5" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="10" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>And as for the miserable farmers of the revenue, (miserable man that I also
                        am, when I see the miseries and sufferings of those men who have deserved so
                        well at my hands,) he handed them over as slaves to the Jews and Syrian
                        nations, themselves born for slavery. He laid down as a rule from the very
                        beginning, and he persevered in it, never to decide an action in favour of a
                        farmer of the revenue; he rescinded covenants that had been made without any
                        injustice, he took away all the garrisons established for their protection;
                        he released many people who were subject to pay tributes and taxes from such
                        payments; whatever town he was living in or whatever town he arrived at,
                        there he forbade any farmer of the revenue or any servant of such farmer to
                        remain. Why need I enlarge on this? He would be considered a cruel man if he
                        had shown such a disposition towards our enemies, as he did show towards
                        Roman citizens, especially towards those of that order which has hitherto
                        always been maintained by its own dignity and by the goodwill of the
                        magistrates. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>Therefore, O conscript fathers, you see that the farmers of the revenue were
                        ground down and nearly ruined, not by any rashness with which they had
                        entered into their contracts, nor by any ignorance of the proper methods of
                        transacting business, but by the avarice, the pride, and the cruelty of
                        Gabinius. And to their assistance indeed, in the present difficulties of the
                        treasury, <pb n="291"/> it is actually indispensable that you should come.
                        Although there are many of them whom you cannot now relieve, men who by the
                        means of that enemy of the senate of that most bitter foe of the equestrian
                        order and of all virtuous men, wretched that they are, have lost not only
                        their property but their honourable position; men whom neither parsimony nor
                        temperance nor virtue nor labour nor respectability of character, have been
                        able to protect against the audacity of that glutton and robber. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>What are we to do? shall we suffer those men to perish who are even now
                        supporting themselves on the resources of their patrimony or on the
                        liberality of their friends? Or, suppose any man has been prevented by the
                        enemies means from enjoying his public rights is that man protected by the
                        law of the censors? but in the case of a man who is prevented by one who is
                        an enemy, though he may not be actually called one, is that a man whom we
                        ought not to assist? Retain then in the province a little longer that man
                        who makes covenants with the enemy respecting the allies and with the allies
                        respecting the citizens,&mdash;who thinks himself a more important man
                        than his colleague on this account that he has deceived you by his morose
                        appearance and by his countenance, while he himself has never once pretended
                        to be less worthless than he really is. But Piso boasts in another sort of
                        fashion that he in a very short time has brought it to pass that Gabinius is
                        not thought the most infamous of all men. <milestone n="6" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="13" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>Do not you think that you ought to recall these men from their provinces even
                        if you had no one to send thither in their places? Would you, could you
                        retain there these two pests of the allies, these men who are the
                        destruction of the soldiers, the ruin of the farmers of the revenue, the
                        desolators of the provinces, the disgracers of the empire? But you,
                        yourselves, in the preceding year did recall these very men when they had
                        only just arrived in the provinces. And if at that time your judgment had
                        been unfettered and if the matter had not been so frequently adjourned and
                        at the last taken wholly out of your hands you would have restored your
                        authority, as you were most anxious to do recalling those men by whom it had
                        been lost and compelling them to render up the rewards which they had
                        received and whom had been conferred on them in return for their wickedness
                        and for the <pb n="292"/> overthrow of their country. And if they at that
                        time escaped from that punishment, through no merit of their own, but
                        through the influence of others, greatly against your consent, still they
                        have undergone a much greater and severer punishment. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>For what severer punishment could befall any one, in whom there exists, if
                        not any respect for his reputation, at all events some fear of punishment,
                        than to have those letters of theirs utterly disbelieved which announced
                        that the republic had been very successful in war? The senate decided this,
                        when in a very full house it refused Gabinius a supplication; they decided,
                        in the first place, that no belief at all could be given to a man polluted
                        with every sort of guilt and wickedness; and, secondly, that the affairs of
                        the republic could not possibly be managed successfully by a traitor,
                        especially by that man who was known to be at the time an enemy of the
                        republic; and, lastly, that even the immortal gods themselves did not choose
                        their temples to be thrown open, and supplications to be addressed to them
                        in the name of a most profligate and wicked man. </p>
					<p>Therefore, that other man is either himself a learned man, and one well
                        instructed by his Greek slaves, with whom he now sups behind the scenes, as
                        he used to do before the curtain, or else he has wiser friends than
                        Gabinius, from whom no letters are produced. <milestone n="7" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="15" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>Shall we then have these men for our generals? the one of whom does not
                        venture to inform us whether <gap desc="* * * *"/>he is styled <foreign lang="la">Imperator</foreign>; and the other must in a few days repent of having
                        ventured to mention such a thing to us, if his clerks do not tire of
                        writing. And if that man has any friends, or indeed, if it be possible that
                        any one should be a friend to so savage and foul a brute, they comfort
                        themselves with this consolation, that this senatorial order once refused an
                        application to Titus Albucius. But first of all, the cases are very unlike.
                        The proprietor had had a battle with one auxiliary cohort against a lot of
                        banditti clad in sheepskins in <placeName key="tgn,7003121">Sardinia</placeName>. And a war against the mightiest nations and
                        tyrants of <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName> was brought to a
                        termination by means of a consular army, and a magistrate invested with the
                        supreme military command. In the next place, Albucius had had already
                        decreed to himself in <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName> the
                        same thing which he was soliciting <pb n="293"/> from the senate. For it was
                        notorious that he like a Greek, and like a light-headed inconsiderate man as
                        he was had celebrated something like a triumph in the province itself. And
                        therefore the senate marked their displeasure at this precipitate conduct of
                        his by the refusing of a supplication. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/>
                        But let him in truth enjoy this as some comfort, and let him think this very
                        eminent mark of disgrace all the less considerable because it has been
                        inflicted on himself alone, provided only that he is content to expect the
                        same end as that man by whose precedent he consoles himself. Especially as
                        Albucius was not liable to the reproach of either Piso's lust or Gabinius's
                        audacity and yet fell by this one blow, the infamy with which he was branded
                        by the senate. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>But the man who proposes to decree the two Gauls to the two consuls would
                        return both these men in their provinces. But he who proposes to decree them
                        one of the Gauls and either <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>
                        or <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> still would retain one
                        of these men; and while they are both equal in wickedness, he proposes to
                        make their future condition unequal. No, I will make them, says he,
                        praetorian provinces in order that Piso and Gabinius may have successors
                        appointed immediately. Yes; if you are allowed to do so. For then the
                        tribune will be able to intercede with his veto; but at present he cannot do
                        so. Therefore I myself who now propose to decree to the consuls who are to
                        be elected <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, am prepared also to make them
                        praetorian provinces, in order that the praetors may have their provinces
                        for a year, and that we may see those men among us as soon as possible whom
                        we cannot see at all with any equanimity. <milestone n="8" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>But believe me, those men will never have successors appointed to them,
                        except when a motion shall be made in accordance with the provisions of that
                        law by which it is unlawful for any one to interpose his veto while the
                        debate is pending about the provinces; therefore, as this opportunity is
                        lost, you must now wait an entire year; during which interval the calamities
                        of the citizens, the miseries of the allies, and the impunity of the most
                        wicked men may be extended. <milestone n="18" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>But even if they were the most excellent of men, still, in my opinion, it
                        could never be advisable to appoint a successor to Caius Caesar. Now,
                        concerning this matter, O conscript <pb n="294"/> fathers. I shall declare
                        my real sentiments, and I shall not be disconcerted by that interruption of
                        my most intimate friend, who did a little while ago interrupt my speech, as
                        you heard. That excellent man says that I ought not to be more hostile to
                        Gabinius than to Caesar; for that all that storm, to which I yielded, was
                        raised by the instigation and assistance of Caesar. And if I were in the
                        first instance to reply that I was having regard to the common advantage,
                        and not to my own private sufferings, could I not establish that, when I say
                        that I am doing what I well may do according to the example of other most
                        valiant and most illustrious citizens? Did Tiberius Gracchus (I am speaking
                        of the father, and would that his son had never degenerated from that
                        father's virtue!) gain such great glory because he, while tribune of the
                        people, was the only one of the whole college who was any assistance to
                        Lucius Scipio, though he was the bitterest possible enemy, both to him and
                        to his brother Africanus; and did he not swear in the public assembly that
                        he had by no means become reconciled to him, but that it seemed to him quite
                        inconsistent with the dignity of the empire that, after the generals of the
                        enemy had been led to prison while Scipio was celebrating his triumph, the
                        very man also who had triumphed should be led to the same place? <milestone n="19" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>Who had a greater number of enemies than Caius Marius? There were Lucius
                        Crassus, Marcus Scaurus, (were there no more?) and all the Metelli. But
                        those men not only forbore to recall that enemy of theirs from <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> by their votes, but also, out of
                        consideration for the Gallic war, they even voted him the province out of
                        the regular order. A most important war has been waged in <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>; very mighty nations have been
                        subdued by Caesar; but they are not yet established with laws, or with any
                        fixed system of rights, or by a peace which can be very thoroughly depended
                        on. We see that the war has been carried on, and, to say the truth, nearly
                        brought to a conclusion; but we shall only see it all actually terminated in
                        a successful manner, if the man who commenced it remains to follow it up to
                        the last. If a successor is appointed to him, there is great danger that we
                        may hear that the embers of this momentous war are again fanned into a flame
                        and rekindled. Therefore I, a senator, an enemy, if you please, of the man
                        himself, feel it my duty to be, as I always have been, <pb n="295"/> a
                        friend to the republic.<milestone n="20" unit="section"/> What if I lay
                        aside my enmity itself for the sake of the republic, who, I should like to
                        know, would have a right to blame me? especially as I have at all times
                        thought that I ought to seek for the models for all my intentions and for
                        all my actions in the conduct of the most illustrious men. <milestone n="9" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>Was not, I should like to know, was not that great man Marcus Lepidus, who
                        was twice consul, and also <foreign lang="la">Pontifex Maximus</foreign>,
                        praised not only by the evidence of men's recollection, but also in the
                        records of our annals, and by the voice of an immortal poet, because on the
                        day that he was made censor, he immediately in the <placeName key="tgn,7006964">Campus Martius</placeName> reconciled himself to
                        Marcus Fulvius his colleague a man who was his bitterest enemy in order that
                        they might perform their common duty devolving on them in the censorship
                        with one common feeling and union of good will? <milestone n="21" unit="section"/> And to pass over ancient instances, of which there is
                        no end, did not your own father, O Philippus, did not he become reconciled
                        at one and the same time with all his greatest enemies? to all of whom the
                        same attachment to the republic now reconciled him which had previously
                        separated him from them. <milestone n="22" unit="section"/> I pass over many
                        instances because I see before me these lights and ornaments of the republic
                        Publius Servilius and Marcus Lucullus; would that that great man, Lucius
                        Lucullus, were still alive! What enmities were ever more bitter in this city
                        that those which subsisted between the Luculli and the Servilii? But in
                        those most gallant men the welfare of the republic, and their own dignity,
                        not only put an end to that ill-feeling, but even changed it into friendship
                        and intimacy. What? did not Quintus Metellus Nepos while consul in the
                        temple of the all good and all powerful <persName><surname>Jupiter</surname></persName>, influenced by your authority and also by the
                        incredible dignity of eloquence of that same Publius Servilius, become
                        reconciled to me though I was far away, and do me the greatest possible
                        service? Is it possible for me to be an enemy to this man, by whose letters,
                        by whose glory, and by whose messengers my ears are every day saluted with
                        previously unknown names of tribes, and nations, and places? <milestone n="23" unit="section"/> I burn, believe me, O conscript fathers, (as
                        indeed you do believe of me, and as you feel yourselves,) with an incredible
                        love for my country; which love compelled me formerly to encounter most
                        terrible <pb n="296"/> dangers which were hanging over it, at the risk of my
                        own life; and again, when I saw every sort of weapon aimed from all quarters
                        against my country, drove me to put myself in their way, and to expose
                        myself singly to their blows on behalf of the whole body of citizens. And
                        this, my ancient and perpetual disposition towards the republic, now
                        reunites and reconciles me to and unites me in friendship with Caius Caesar.
                        In short, let men think what they please; it is impossible for me to be
                        other than a friend to one who deserves; well of his country. <milestone n="10" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="24" unit="section"/></p>

                        should not the same republic which was able to make me hostile to my
                        friends, be able also to reconcile me to my enemies? What reason had I for
                        hating Publius Clodius, except that I thought him likely to prove a
                        mischievous citizen to my country, inasmuch as, inflamed by the most
                        infamous lust, he trampled under foot by one crime two most holy
                        considerations, religion and chastity? Is it, therefore, doubtful from these
                        actions, which he has done and which he is doing every day, that I in
                        opposing him was consulting the interests of the republic more than my own
                        tranquillity; but that some others, who defended him, thought more of their
                        own ease than they did of the peace of the community? </p>
					<p>
                        <milestone n="25" unit="section"/> I admit that I was of a different opinion
                        to Caesar with respect to the affairs of the republic, and that I agreed
                        with all of you: but now I am agreeing also with you with whom I felt in
                        common before. For you,&mdash;to whom Lucius Piso does not venture to
                        send letters respecting his exploits,&mdash;you who have condemned the
                        letters of Gabinius with a most remarkable stigma, and an unprecedented mark
                        of disgrace have decreed supplications to Caius Caesar in such number, as
                        were never decreed before to any one in one war, and with such attending
                        circumstances of honour as were never voted to any one at all. Why, then,
                        need I wait for any man to act as a mediator between us, in order to
                        reconcile me to him? This most honourable order has mediated between us;
                        that <pb n="297"/> order which is the instigator and the leader both of the
                        public counsels and of all my own designs. I am following you, O conscript
                        fathers, I am obeying you, I am adopting your opinions;&mdash;yours, I
                        say, who, as long as you had no very favourable opinion of the designs of
                        Caius Caesar with respect to the republic saw that I too was very little
                        connected with him; since you changed your opinions and inclinations on
                        account of his great achievements you have seen me also not only the sharer
                        of your sentiments but also the panegyrist and advocate of them. <milestone n="11" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="26" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>But what is the reason why in this cause men so exceedingly marvel at and
                        find fault with my opinions when I also before now proposed and voted for
                        many things which concerned that man's dignity more than they did the safety
                        of the republic? I proposed and carried a supplication of fifteen days in
                        Caesar's honour the bill being passed in the terms which I drew up. It would
                        have been sufficient for the good of the republic to have had it last only
                        the same number of days as the supplication in honour of Caius Marius. That
                        could not have been accounted by the immortal gods a scanty thanksgiving
                        which was as great as had heretofore been offered in the most important
                        wars. Therefore that increased number of days was given to the dignity of
                        the men. <milestone n="27" unit="section"/> And in respect of that, I, who
                        as consul brought forward the motion, first, for decreeing a supplication of
                        ten days to Cnaeus Pompeius after Mithridates had been slain and the
                        Mithridatic war been terminated,&mdash;I, in compliance with whose
                        opinion it was that the ordinary number of days that a supplication in
                        honour of a consul lasted was doubled (for you all agreed with me when,
                        having had the letters of that same Pompeius read, and knowing that all wars
                        both by sea and land were happily terminated, you decided a supplication of
                        twelve days)&mdash;I, I say, admired the virtue and greatness of mind of
                        Pompeius in that, when he himself had hitherto been preferred to all other
                        men in every sort of honour, he now was giving a more ample honour to
                        another than he himself had received. Therefore, in that supplication which
                        I proposed, the honour was paid to the immortal gods, and to the established
                        usages of our ancestors, and to the welfare of the republic. But the dignity
                        of the language in which the decree was couched, and the honour and the
                        novelty of the attendant circumstances, <pb n="298"/> and the number of the
                            days,<note anchored="yes">
                            <p>A <foreign lang="la">supplicatio</foreign> was a solemn thanksgiving
                                or supplication to the gods, decreed by the senate, when all the
                                temples were opened, and the statues of the gods were frequently
                                placed in public upon couches. (<foreign lang="la">pulvinaria</foreign>,) to which the people offered up their
                                thanksgivings and prayers. (See <bibl n="Cic. Catil. 3.10">Cic.
                                        <title>in Cat.</title> 3.10</bibl>.) </p>
                            <p>It was decreed after great victories, and also in times of public
                                danger and distress, and on account of prodigies, to avert the anger
                                of the gods. </p>
                            <p>When decreed for a victory, the number of days during which it was to
                                last was proportioned to the importance of the victory. Sometimes it
                                was decreed for only one day, but more commonly for three or five
                                days. After the supplication mentioned here of fifteen days, one of
                                twenty days was decreed to Caesar in honour of his victory over
                                Vercingetorix; and from this time forward the senate appears to have
                                increased the number of days out of compliment to the general, so
                                that we find mention of supplications for forty and fifty days, (see
                                    <bibl n="Cic. Phil. 14.14">Cic. <title>Phil.</title>
                                    14.14</bibl>,) and even sixty days. It was generally regarded as
                                a prelude to a triumph, but was not always followed by one; as in
                                the case of Cicero himself, to whom a supplication was decreed for
                                his suppression of Catiline's conspiracy, which was no subject for a
                                triumph, being a civil transaction. <foreign lang="la">Vide</foreign> Smith, Dict. Ant. v. <foreign lang="la">Supplicatio</foreign>.</p>
                        </note> was meant as a compliment to the renown and glory of Caesar himself.

					<p>A motion was lately brought forward before our body concerning the pay of the
                        army. I not only voted for it myself, but I laboured earnestly to induce you
                        to vote for it; I replied to many of the arguments of those who objected to
                        it; I supported it also by writing. In that case also, I was rather
                        considering the dignity of the man who commanded the army, than any
                        particular necessity that existed for the measure. For I thought that he,
                        even without this additional supply of money, was able to maintain his army
                        with the booty that he had already acquired, and to terminate the war. But I
                        thought it would be unbecoming to diminish the glory and splendour of that
                        triumph of his by any parsimony on our part. </p>
					<p>A discussion took place also about the ten lieutenants whom he wished to have
                        appointed; and some voted altogether against giving them, others asked for
                        precedents, others wished to adjourn the consideration of the question, and
                        others declared their opinion in favour of it without any complimentary
                        expressions to Caesar himself. But on that occasion, I spoke in such a
                        manner as to let all men see that, though I thought the measure advantageous
                        to the republic, I was promoting it <pb n="299"/> more cordially out of a
                        desire to pay due honour to the dignity of Caesar. <milestone n="12" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="29" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>And I who have been received in all those discussions with silent attention
                        now that the question is about the provinces which are to be decreed to the
                        consuls am interrupted; though in all the former transactions it was only a
                        compliment to an individual that I urged, while now I have no motive but the
                        consideration of the war and the general welfare of the republic. For, as
                        for Caesar himself, what reason can there be why he should wish any longer
                        to remain in the province, except for the purpose of not giving over to the
                        republic the measures which have been undertaken by him before they are
                        completely consummated? It is the delightful nature of the country, I
                        suppose, and the splendour of the cities, and the civilized state and
                        accomplished habits of those nations and natives,&mdash;it is a desire
                        for victory, it is a wish to extend the boundaries of our empire, that
                        detains him there! What is there anywhere more severe than those countries?
                        what more uncivilized than their towns? what more barbarous than their
                        citizens? Moreover what can be imagined more desirable than the victories
                        which he has already gained or what can be discovered beyond the ocean? Is
                        his return to his country likely to be disagreeable to any one? Can it be so
                        either to the people by whom he was sent on his command, or to the senate
                        from whom he has received so many distinctions? Does time foster his wish to
                        see his country again, or does it rather increase his forgetfulness of it?
                        And do those laurels of his which he has gained amid such dangers, lose
                        their greenness by the time that elapses after their acquisition? If, then,
                        there be any one who is not attached to that man, still such an one has no
                        reason for recalling him from his province. It is only recalling him to
                        glory to triumph, to receive congratulations, to receive the highest honours
                        which the senate can bestow, to receive the thanks of the equestrian order,
                        and to become the object of the devoted affection of the people. <milestone n="30" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>But if he, out of his regard for the interests of the republic, does not
                        hasten to the enjoyment of that extraordinary good fortune which is in store
                        for him, preferring to remain and finish everything; what ought I to do as a
                        senator,&mdash;I, who ought to think only of the advantage of the
                        republic, even if <pb n="300"/> his wishes were opposed to it? For I feel, O
                        conscript fathers, that we at this time, while engaged in decreeing
                        provinces to the consuls, ought to have a regard to the preservation of
                        perpetual peace. <milestone n="31" unit="section"/> For who is there who is
                        not aware that all our other possessions are safe from all danger, and even
                        from all suspicion of wars? We have for some time seen that immense
                        sea,&mdash;by the disturbed condition of which not only our voyages by
                        sea were impeded, but even our cities and our military marches and roads
                        were exposed to annoyance,&mdash;now, in consequence of the valour of
                        Cnaeus Pompeius, possessed from the ocean to the very extremity of
                            <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName>, like one vast harbor in
                        a safe and defensible state; and as for those nations, which by their mere
                        numbers and the immensity of their population, were sufficient to overthrow
                        our provinces, we have seen some of them so thinned in numbers, and others
                        so severely checked by that same man, that <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, which was formerly the limit of our empire, is now
                        itself bounded on the further side by three of our provinces. I might go on
                        speaking of every region and of every race of men. There is no nation which
                        is not either so far destroyed as scarcely to have any existence at all, or
                        so utterly subdued as to be quite tranquil; or else so entirely at peace
                        with us, as to share our exultation at our victories and at the extension of
                        our empire. <milestone n="13" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="32" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>The war with <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, O conscript
                        fathers, has been carried on actively since Caius Caesar has been our
                        commander-in-chief; previously, we were content to act on the defensive, and
                        to repel attacks. For our generals at all times thought it better to limit
                        themselves to repulsing those nations, than to provoke their hostility by
                        any attack of our own. Even that great man, Caius Marius, whose godlike and
                        amazing valour came to the assistance of the Roman people in many of its
                        distresses and disasters, was content to check the enormous multitudes of
                        Gauls who were forcing their way into <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, without endeavouring to penetrate himself into their
                        cities and dwelling-places. And lately, that partner of my labours, and
                        dangers, and counsels, Caius Pomptinus, that most gallant man, crushed in
                        battle a war of the Allobroges which rose up suddenly against us, and which
                        was excited by that impious conspiracy, and defeated those tribes who had
                        provoked us, and then he remained quiet, contented <pb n="301"/> with the
                        victory by which be had delivered the republic from alarm. </p>
					<p>But I see that the counsels of Caius Caesar are widely different. For he
                        thought it his duty, not only to war against those men whom he saw already
                        in arms against the Roman people, but to reduce the whole of <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> under our dominion. <milestone n="33" unit="section"/> Therefore, he fought with the greatest success against
                        those most valiant and powerful nations the Germans and Helvetians; and the
                        other nations he alarmed and drove back and defeated, and accustomed to
                        yield to the supremacy of the Roman people, so that those districts and
                        those nations which were previously known to us neither by any one's
                        letters, nor by the personal account of any one, nor even by vague report,
                        have now been overrun and thoroughly examined by our own general, by our own
                        army, and by the arms of the Roman people. </p>
					<p>Hitherto, O conscript fathers, we have only known the road into <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>. All other parts of it were possessed
                        by nations which were either hostile to this empire, or treacherous, or
                        unknown to us, or, at all events, savage, barbarian, and
                        warlike;&mdash;nations which no one ever existed who did not wish to
                        break their power and subdue: nor has any one, from the very first rise of
                        this empire, ever carefully deliberated about our republic, who has not
                        thought <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> the chief object of
                        apprehension to this empire. But still, on account of the power and vast
                        population of those nations, we never before have had a war with all of
                        them; we have always been content to resist them when attacked. Now, at
                        last, it has been brought about that there should be one and the same
                        boundary to our empire and to those nations. <milestone n="14" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="34" unit="section"/></p>

                        not without some especial kindness of the gods in providing us with such a
                        bulwark. For if that road had been open to the savage disposition and vast
                        numbers of the Gauls, this city would never have been the home and chosen
                        seat of the empire of the world. Now, indeed, they are at liberty to sink
                        down if they please; for there is nothing beyond those lofty heights as far
                        as the ocean itself, which can be any object of fear to <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>. But still it will be the work of
                        one or two summers finally to bind the whole of <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> in everlasting chains either by fear, or hope, or
                        punishment or reward, or <pb n="302"/> arms, or laws. And if our affairs
                        there are left in an unfinished state, and while there is still some
                        bitterness of feeling remaining, although the enemy may be pruned back
                        severely for the present, still they will raise their heads again some time
                        or other, and come forth with recruited strength to renew the war.
                            <milestone n="35" unit="section"/> Let, then, <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> be left in the guardianship of that

                        entrusted. If, in truth, he, having been distinguished by such marked
                        kindness of Fortune, were unwilling to risk the favour of that fickle
                        goddess too often; if he were anxious himself to return to his country, to
                        his household gods, to that dignity which he sees in store for him in this

                        disaster, as no event can now add so much glory to him as a mishap might
                        deprive him of&mdash;still it would be your duty to insist on all those
                        affairs being brought to a termination by the same man who has begun them so
                        successfully. But when he has not yet satisfied his own desire for glory and
                        for the safety of the republic, and as he prefers coming at a later period
                        to reap the rewards of his toils rather than not discharging to the full the
                        duty which the republic has committed to him; then certainly, we, for our
                        part, ought not to recall a general who is so eager to conduct the affairs
                        of the republic gloriously, nor to throw into confusion and to hinder his
                        plans for the whole Gallic war, which are now almost matured and
                        accomplished. <milestone n="15" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="36" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>For I cannot at all approve of those opinions which have been expressed by
                        some most illustrious men, one of whom proposes to give the consuls the
                        further <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>, and the other inclines to the
                        nearer <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>. He who proposes the
                        further <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, throws all those
                        matters into confusion about which I have just been speaking, and shows at
                        the same time that he is advocating a law which he affirms to be no law at
                        all; and that he is taking away that part of the province to which no
                        interruption can be given, but is not touching that part which has a
                        defender. The effect of his conduct also is not to meddle with that which
                        has been conferred <pb n="303"/> by the people while at the same time he a
                        senator is anxious to take away what has been given by the senate. </p>
					<p>The other disregards all consideration of the Gallic war; he discharges the
                        duty of a virtuous senator: though he thinks the law invalid, still he
                        observes it; for he fixes beforehand a day for his successor to enter on his
                        office. <gap desc="* *  *"/> But it seems to me that nothing is more inconsistent with the
                        dignity and principles of our ancestors than for the consul, who on the
                        first of January is to have a province, to have it promised to him in this
                        way, and not regularly decreed to him. Suppose he were during the whole of
                        his consulship without a province, though even before he was elected a
                        province was decreed to him, is he to cast lots for a province, or not?
                            <milestone n="37" unit="section"/> For it is absurd not to draw lots for
                        one,&mdash;absurd also not to get that which one has drawn by lot. Is he
                        to march out in the robe of a commander in chief? Whither is he to march?
                        Why, to a place where he may not arrive before a certain fixed day. All
                        January and February he is not to have a province. At last on the first of
                        March up will spring a province for him all on a sudden. <milestone n="38" unit="section"/> Nevertheless if these sentiments prevail, Piso will
                        remain in his province. </p>
					<p>And though these are weighty considerations, still none of them are more
                        serious than this&mdash;that it is an insulting thing for a commander in
                        chief to be mulcted as it were by a diminution of his provinces, and we
                        ought to take great care that such a thing should not be allowed to happen,
                        not only not in the case of a most illustrious man, but not even in that of
                        a man of moderate reputation. <milestone n="16" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>I am well aware, O conscript fathers, that you have decreed many
                        extraordinary honours to Caius Caesar; honours which are almost
                        unprecedented. In that he has amply merited them, you have been grateful; if
                        I add, too, that he is a man most thoroughly attached to this order of the
                        senate, you have been wise and provident. For this order has never heaped
                        its distinctions and kindness on any one who has subsequently thought any
                        dignity preferable to that which he had obtained by your favour. For it is
                        not possible for any one to be the leading man in this body who has
                        preferred courting the favour of the people. But all men who have done this,
                        have either distrusted themselves on account of their consciousness of their
                        want of worth, or else they have <pb n="304"/> been driven away from a union
                        with this order on account of the disparagement of their merits by the rest,
                        and so they have been almost constrained to throw themselves out of this
                        harbour on those stormy billows. And if, after they have been tossed about
                        on those surges, and have become wearied of their voyage amid the whims of
                        the people, having been successful in the conduct of the affairs of the
                        republic, they show their faces again in the senate-house, and wish to gain
                        the favours of this most honourable order, I say that they are not only not
                        to be repelled, but are to be received with open arms, and courted.

					<p>We are warned by the bravest man and most admirable consul who has ever
                        existed in the memory of man, to take care that the nearer <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> be not decreed against our will to
                        any one after the election of those consuls who are now about to be elected,
                        and that it be not for the future occupied forever by these men who are the
                        constant attackers of this order, by some turbulent system of currying
                        favour with the mob. And although I am not indifferent to the evil
                        consequences of such a measure, O conscript fathers, especially when warned
                        of them by a consul of the greatest wisdom, and one who is an especial
                        guardian of peace and tranquillity, still I think that there is an evil to
                        be regarded with even more apprehension than that,&mdash;the evil, I
                        mean, of diminishing the honours of most illustrious and powerful citizens,
                        and rejecting their zeal for the maintenance of this order. </p>
					<p>For even supposing that Caius Julius, having been distinguished by all sorts
                        of extraordinary and unprecedented honours by the senate, were compelled to
                        deliver up this province to one whom you would be very unwilling to see
                        there, still I cannot possibly be induced to suspect that be would deprive
                        that body of liberty by which he himself had the greatest glory conferred on
                        him. Lastly, what disposition every one will have I know not; I am aware
                        only of what my own hopes are. I, as a senator, am bound to take care, as
                        far as I can, that no illustrious or powerful man shall appear to have any
                        right to feel offended with this body. <milestone n="40" unit="section"/>
                        These sentiments I should express out of regard to the republic, even were I
                        ever so great an enemy to Caius Caesar. <milestone n="17" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>But I do not think it foreign to the present discussion, with the object of
                        being for the future less frequently <pb n="305"/> interrupted by certain
                        persons, or less reproved in the opinion of some who forbear to interrupt
                        me, to explain briefly what is the nature of my relations with Caesar. And
                        in the first place, I pass over that period of familiarity and intimacy
                        which existed between him and me, and my brother and Caius Varro, our
                        cousin, from the time that we were all young men. After that I became deeply
                        engaged in public affairs, my sentiments on matters of state were no
                        different from his, that we were of entirely opposite public parties though
                        without any interruption of our private friendship. <milestone n="41" unit="section"/> He, as consul, adopted measures in which he wished to
                        have me for a partner; and if I was opposed to the measures themselves,
                        still I could not avoid being pleased at the opinion of me which he
                        displayed by that wish. He entreated me also to accept the office of
                            quinquevir.<note anchored="yes">Some read here <foreign lang="la">vigentiviratum</foreign> referring it to the commission of twenty

                            Orellius thinks may refer to some project which was never brought to

                            Cicero refused entering into any engagements with the three whose union
                            he thought dangerous to the state, and at that time too he certainly had

                        and he offered me any lieutenancy or embassy I pleased, with as much honour
                        and distinction as was agreeable to me. All which offers I rejected with
                        great firmness in my own sentiments, but not without feeling obliged to him
                        for them. How wisely I acted is not now the question; for many will not
                        approve of my conduct. At all events I acted with consistency and firmness,
                        inasmuch as though by accepting them I might have fortified myself by the
                        most irresistible assistance against all the wickedness of my enemies and
                        should have been able to repel the attacks of popularity hunters by the
                        protection of popular men, I preferred to meet any fortune to encounter any
                        violence and any in jury, rather than differ from the wise and righteous
                        sentiments <pb n="306"/> of the senate, or deviate from the line of conduct
                        which I had marked out for myself. </p>
					<p>But a man is bound to be grateful, not only if he has received a kindness,
                        but if he has had an opportunity of receiving one. I did not think that all
                        those compliments and distinctions with which he was loading me became me,
                        or were suited to the exploits which I had performed. But I saw that he
                        regarded me with the same friendly disposition with which he looked on that
                        chief of the citizens, his own son-in-law. <milestone n="42" unit="section"/> He afterwards assisted my great enemy in passing over to the ranks of the
                        plebeians, either because he was angry with me when he saw that I could not
                        be allured, not even by all his kindness, to unite with him, or because he
                        was unable to withstand the entreaties of Clodius. And even that was no
                        injury to me in his opinion; for he afterwards not only advised but actually
                        entreated me to act as his lieutenant. Even that I would not accept; not
                        because I thought it inconsistent with my dignity, but because I had no
                        suspicion that such wicked designs against the republic were entertained by
                        the succeeding consuls as afterwards proved to be. <milestone n="18" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>Therefore I have much more reason to fear that I may be blamed for arrogance
                        of conduct with respect to his liberality towards me, than that I should be
                        reproached with the injuries which he has done me in spite of our

                        obligation to aid me; if I was deserted by him, perhaps he was providing for
                        his own safety; if I was even attacked by him, as some men think, or at all
                        events wish me to think, then our friendship was violated, I received an
                        injury, and he has deserved that I should be his enemy. I do not deny it;

                        like the dearest of your sons, and if you all at the same time thought it of

                            <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> in the municipal towns
                        and the Roman people in the assembly, and you too who were always most
                        devoted to me, in the Capitol, to take measures for my safety; if in short
                        Cnaeus Pompeius is at the same time a witness to me of the good will which
                        Caesar entertains for me, and a surety to him of my attachment to him; does
                        it not appear to you that I ought rather to recollect the times that are
                        long past and also to remember this time which is nearest to us now, and by
                        means of these memories to eradicate that middle time so full of infamy and
                        misery, if not from the history of events, (which indeed may be impossible,)

					<p>But I, if I may not (as some people think I ought not) boast that I have
                        sacrificed my own private feelings of indignation and enmity to the
                        republic, which it appears to me to be the duty of a great and wise man to
                        do, will at all events avail myself of this plea,&mdash;which is of
                        force not so much to gain praise as to avoid reproach,&mdash;namely,
                        that I am a grateful person, and that I am inclined to be moved, not only by
                        such exceeding services as his, but even by a moderate display of good-will
                        towards me. <milestone n="19" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>I entreat of some most gallant men, who have done me great service, that, if
                        I have been unwilling that they should be partakers of my labours and
                        distresses, they will also spare me from being the partaker of their
                        enmities; especially as they have granted to me that I have a right to
                        defend those acts of Caesar's which I neither attacked nor defended before.
                            <milestone n="45" unit="section"/> For the most eminent men of the
                        state, by whose counsels I acted when I preserved the republic, and in
                        deference to whose authority I avoided that union with Caesar to which he
                        invited me, deny that the Julian laws, and the others which were passed
                        during his consulship, were legally passed at all. And at the same time they
                        say that the bill for my proscription was passed in a manner contrary to the
                        safety of the republic, but still without any illegal disregard of the
                            <foreign lang="la">auspices</foreign>. Therefore a man of the highest
                        authority, and of the greatest eloquence, said with great positiveness that
                        that disaster of mine was a funeral of the republic, but <pb n="308"/> a
                        funeral performed with all regular solemnity. To me myself it is altogether
                        excessively complimentary, that my departure should be called the funeral of
                        the republic. His other expressions I do not find any fault with, but I will
                        assume them as a foundation for the sentiments which I feel. For if men have
                        ventured to say that that proposition was carried in a regular manner, for
                        which there was no precedent nor any law authorizing such a bill to be
                        carried, merely because no one had been observing the heavens at the time,
                        had they forgotten that, at the time that the man who carried this bill was
                        made a plebeian by a <foreign lang="la">lex curiata</foreign>, it was
                        announced that a magistrate was observing the heavens? And if it was
                        absolutely irregular for him to be made a plebeian, how could he be made a
                        tribune of the people? And if his tribuneship be declared valid, there is
                        then no one of Caesar's acts which can possibly be invalid; and so, will
                        not, not merely his tribuneship, but also other matters the most mischievous
                        imaginable, appear to have been passed with proper regularity, if it be
                        decided that the religious respect due to the <foreign lang="la">auspices</foreign> was preserved? <milestone n="46" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>Wherefore you must decide either that the Aelian law still exists, that the
                        Fufian law has not been abrogated, and that it is not lawful for a law to be
                        passed on every one of the <foreign lang="la">dies fasti</foreign>; that,
                        when a law is being passed, there is no objection to observations of the
                        heavens being taken, or to such an announcement being made by the
                        magistrates, or to any one interposing his veto; that the decisions and
                        animadversions of the censors, and that most strict inspection of morals,
                        has not been abolished in the city by nefarious laws; that if a patrician
                        has been tribune of the people, he has been so in violation of the most
                        sacred laws,&mdash;if a plebeian, in disregard of the <foreign lang="la">auspices</foreign>: or else men must grant to me that it is not
                        necessary for me in the case of good measures to be bound by those rules
                        which they themselves do not adhere to in shameful ones; especially as it
                        has been a proposal made by them to Caius Caesar several times, that he
                        should carry the same measures in some other manner, (in some manner, that
                        is, which the <foreign lang="la">auspices</foreign> required and which the
                        law sanctioned;) and when, in the case of Clodius, the history of the
                            <foreign lang="la">auspices</foreign> is just the same, and all the laws
                        of the state have been overturned and destroyed. <pb n="309"/>
                        <milestone n="20" unit="chapter"/>This is the last thing which I have to
                        say. If I had any enmity against Caius Caesar, still at this time I ought to
                        consult the interests of the republic, and to reserve my hostility for
                        another time. I might even, following the precedent of most eminent men, lay
                        aside my enmity altogether for the sake of the republic; but as I have never
                        entertained any enmity to him, and as the idea of having been injured by him
                        has been extinguished by services which he has done me, I, by my opinion, O
                        conscript fathers, if the dignity of Caius Caesar is at stake, shall vote
                        for the man;&mdash;if any honour to be paid to him is under discussion,
                        I shall consult the unanimous feeling of the senate if the authority of your
                        decrees is the main point to be regarded, I shall uphold the consistency of
                        our order by voting distinctions to this same
                        commander-in-chief;&mdash;if the everlasting consideration of the Gallic
                        war is to be taken into the account, I shall consult the interests of the
                        republic if I may have respect to my own private duty I shall show that I am
                        not ungrateful. </p>
					<p>And I wish, O conscript fathers, to induce you all to approve of my
                        sentiments; but I shall not be greatly concerned if I fail to induce those
                        men to approve of them who shielded my enemy in spite of your authority; or
                        those who found fault with my reconciliation with their enemy, while they
                        themselves do not hesitate to be reconciled both to my enemy and to their

					<head>THE SPEECH OF M. T. CICERO IN DEFENCE OF LUCIUS CORNELIUS BALBUS.</head>
					<argument>
						<head>THE ARGUMENT.</head>
						<p>Lucius Cornelius Balbus was a native of <placeName key="tgn,7007512">Gades</placeName><note anchored="yes">The modern <placeName key="tgn,7002813">Cadiz</placeName></note> in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, and of an illustrious family in
                            that city. He had been of great service to the Roman generals in
                                <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, both generally, and
                            also especially at the time of the war with Sertorius, and, as a reward
                            for his fidelity, he had had the freedom of the city given to him by
                            Pompeius, by virtue of a law which authorized him to grant it to as many
                            people as he chose. But the validity of this act of Pompeius was now
                            disputed, on the ground that <placeName key="tgn,7007512">Gades</placeName> was not one of the cities whose inhabitants were
                            capable of receiving such a privilege, and that the law of Lucius
                            Gellius Publicola and of Cnaeus Cornelius Lentulus Clodianus did not
                            apply to them; the prosecution against Balbus being instigated in
                            reality out of hatred to Pompeius and Caesar, in whose army he had at
                            this moment an important command, and by whom he was highly trusted in
                            many most important affairs. </p>
						<p>He was defended by Pompeius and Crassus, and at their request by Cicero
                            also, to whom they gave the post of honour. He was confirmed by the
                            judges in his privileges as a citizen, and was afterwards (A. U. C. 714)
                            made consul, being the first foreigner and adopted citizen who had ever
                            attained that honour in <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.</p>

					<milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
					<p>If the authority of those who are advocates in a person's defence be of any
                        weight, the cause of Lucius Cornelius has been defended by the most
                        honourable men; if their experience is to be regarded, it has been defended
                        by the most skillful lawyers; if we look to their ability, by the most
                        eloquent of orators; or if it is their sincerity and zeal that we should
                        regard, it has been upheld by those who are his greatest friends, and who
                        are united to Lucius Cornelius not merely by mutual services, but by the
                        greatest intimacy. What part, then, have I in this defence? That which is
                        given to me by such influence as you have been pleased to allow me; by
                        moderate experience; and by an ability which is by no means equal to my
                        inclination to serve him. For as to the other men by whom he has been
                        defended, I see that to them <pb n="311"/> he is under great obligations;
                        but how much I am under obligations to him I will explain to you at another
                        time. This I assert at the beginning of my speech,&mdash;that if I
                        cannot by my exertions properly requite all those men who have been friendly
                        to my safety and to my dignity, I will at all events recompense them as far
                        as in my power by at all times both feeling and declaring my obligations and
                        my gratitude. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> How great was the energy
                        displayed by Cnaeus Pompeius in speaking yesterday, O judges, how great his
                        fluency, how great the riches of his eloquence, was shown plainly enough,
                        not only by the secret feelings of your minds, but by your evident and
                        unconcealed admiration. For I never heard anything which appeared to me more
                        acute as regards the state of the law, <gap desc="* * *"/> I never heard a more copious
                        recollection of precedents; I never heard a more skillful argument
                        concerning treaties, nor any statements of more illustrious authority
                        concerning our wars, or of more weight and dignity with reference to the
                        general interests of the republic; I never heard any one speak more modestly
                        concerning himself, or more eloquently concerning the cause and the charge.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> So that that saying appeared to me to
                        be a true one, which though some men devoted to literature and to learned
                        studies were said to have given utterance to it, appeared nevertheless to be
                        something incredible; namely, that the man whose soul contained every
                        virtue, could with the most perfect ease do everything which he might wish
                        to do. For how could there have been a greater fertility and variety and
                        richness of eloquence in Lucius Crassus, a man born to a most singular gift
                        of oratory if even he had pleaded this cause than was displayed by that man
                        who was able to devote just so much time to this study as he spared from the
                        uninterrupted succession of wars and victories in which his life has been
                        passed from childhood up to this time? <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>And all this makes my task of summing up the more difficult. For, in truth, I
                        am coming after an oration which has not just passed by your ears, but has
                        sunk deep into the minds of all of you, so that you may very probably derive
                        more pleasure from the recollection of that speech, than you can from the
                        hearing not only of mine, but of any one else's speech whatever. <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>But in this I am forced to comply with the wishes not <pb n="312"/> only of
                        Cornelius, whose desires I cannot possibly thwart in this his hour of
                        danger, but also with those of Cnaeus Pompeius, who has wished me the
                        panegyrist of and the assistant in this action, and this determination, and
                        this kindness of his, as I lately was in another cause which was pleaded
                        before you, O judges. </p>
					<p><milestone n="5" unit="section"/> And it appears to me that this is what the
                        defendant himself deserves, that this is what the unexampled renown of this
                        excellent man deserves, that this is what essentially belongs to the
                        discharge of your duty, and that this is due to the cause itself, that, what
                        it is quite notorious that Cnaeus Pompeius did, all men should allow he had
                        a lawful right to do. For there is nothing more true than that which he
                        himself said yesterday, that Lucius Cornelius had now all his fortunes at
                        stake, without being accused of any single crime of any description. For he
                        is not said to have stolen the rights of a citizen, nor to have given any
                        false account of his family, nor to have proceeded in an underhand manner by
                        any shameless falsehood, nor to have crept fraudulently into the register.
                        One thing alone is imputed to him, that he was born at <placeName key="tgn,7007512">Gades</placeName>; a fact which no one denies. All the
                        rest the prosecutor admits. He admits that he served in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, in a most severe war, with Quintus
                        Metellus, with Caius Memmius; that he served both in the fleet and in the
                        army; and, when Pompeius came into <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName> and began to have Memmius for his quaestor, that he
                        never left Memmius; that he went to take possession of <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>; that he was present at
                        those two hardly contested and most important battles of Sucro and the
                            <placeName key="tgn,7010409">Durius</placeName>; that he remained with
                        Pompeius to the end of the war. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> These are
                        the battles of Cornelius. Such were his exertions; such was his industry;
                        such were his dangers encountered on behalf of our republic; such was his
                        valour, worthy of a general; while his hopes were hopes of a reward in
                        proportion to his dangers. The rewards themselves are not the actions of him
                        who obtained them, but of him who conferred them. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>Therefore on account of this conduct he was presented by Cnaeus Pompeius with
                        the freedom of the city. That the prosecutor does not deny; but he finds
                        fault with it, in such a manner that, as far as Balbus himself is concerned,
                        his cause is approved of even at the moment that it is sought to punish <pb n="313"/> him; in the case of Pompeius, his conduct is disapproved of,
                        but no punishment is designed for him. And this is the way in which they
                        wish to condemn the fame and fortune of a most innocent man and the conduct
                        of a most admirable commander. Therefore it is the status of Cornelius as a
                        citizen, and the action of Pompeius that are now on their trial before this
                        court. For you admit that this man was born of a most honourable rank in
                        that state to which he belongs, and that from his earliest manhood
                        disregarding all his private affairs, he has passed his whole time in our
                        wars in the company of our own generals, and that he has been absent from no
                        labour, from no siege, and from no battle. All these things are full of
                        glory, and are the peculiar glory of Cornelius; nor is there any crime in
                        any part of such conduct. </p>
					<p><milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Where then is his crime? Is it because
                        Pompeius presented him with the freedom of the city? Is that a crime of
                        Balbus's? By no means, unless honour is to be accounted ignominy. Whose
                        crime is it then? In reality nobody's at all; but if we look at the pleading
                        of the prosecutor, it is clearly the crime of that man alone who gave him
                        the freedom of the city. But if he had been influenced by interest, he would
                        probably have selected some less worthy man for that reward. Even had he
                        selected a good man, he would not have chosen one who had deserved as well
                        of the state as Balbus; even if his action had been one of which it could
                        not have been said that it was contrary to what was lawful, it would have
                        been said that it was contrary to what was becoming. But all such
                        vituperation would have deserved to be rejected by you, O judges. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> But at present what is it that is said? What does
                        the prosecutor say? That Pompeius did what it was not lawful for him to do;
                        which is a more serious charge than if he were to say that that had been
                        done by him which was not expedient. For there are things which are not
                        expedient even if they are lawful. But whatever is not lawful is most
                        certainly not expedient. <milestone n="4" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>Am I now, O judges, to hesitate to urge that it is impossible to doubt that
                        we ought to confess that what it is notorious that Cnaeus Pompeius did was
                        not only lawful, but also expedient for him to do? <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> For what qualification is wanting in this man, that, if
                        he had it, we should consider that this liberty might lawfully be given and
                        allowed to him? <pb n="3145"/> Is it experience in affairs? a man who during
                        even the latter days of his childhood was beginning his course of the most
                        important wars and commands? most of whose equals in age have seen a camp
                        less frequently than he has celebrated a triumph? who has celebrated as many
                        triumphs as there are countries and parts of the world? who has won as many
                        victories in war as there are kinds of war in the nature of things? Is it
                        ability? when even the very results and terminations of transactions have
                        been, not the guides, but the companions of his counsels? a man in whom the
                        most extraordinary good fortune has so kept pace with extraordinary valour,
                        that, in the opinion of all men, more credit was due to the man than to the
                        goddess; Have modesty, or integrity, or religion, or diligence ever been
                        wanting in that man? a man than whom our provinces, and all free nations,
                        and all kings, and the very most distant people of the earth have not only
                        never seen one more chaste, more moderate, and more religious, but have
                        never in their hopes or wishes even imagined one. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Why need I speak of his authority, which is as great as

                        conferred on that man the rewards of the most honourable dignity; when he

                        into his conduct should be now taking place, in such terms that there should
                        be a discussion as to whether it was lawful for him to do what he has done;
                        or whether, I will not say, it was lawful, but whether it was impious for
                        him to do so? (for he is said to have done it in contravention of a
                        treaty,&mdash;that is to say, in contradiction to the religion and good
                        faith of the Roman people.) Is it not disgraceful to you yourselves?

					<p>I, when a boy, have heard my father say this. When Quintus Metellus, the son

                        the safety of his country was dearer than the sight of it, who had rather
                        abandon his city than his opinion; when he, I say, was before the court, and
                        when his account-books were being carried round to the judges that they
                        might see the entry of one item, I have heard that there was not one judge

                        of the laws? with the treaties? Shall we scrutinise everything with the most

                        it, all the judges cried out that he need not take the oath. When Greeks
                        were unwilling to appear to imagine that the good faith of a well-proved man
                        felt itself more bound by the formality of an oath than by the simple

					<p>The prosecutor indulges me with a gesture. He intimates that Cnaeus Pompeius
                        acted ignorantly. As if it were <pb n="316"/> a lighter charge, when one has
                        been occupied in affairs of state in so important a republic, and been
                        presiding over the most serious transactions, to do anything which you know
                        not to be legal, or to be utterly ignorant what is legal. Do you really mean
                        that he did not know, he who had waged a most formidable and important war
                        in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, what were the rights of

                        amanuensis professes to be acquainted with? <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> I, indeed, think on the contrary, O judges, that while Cnaeus Pompeius
                        excels in every kind and variety of accomplishment, even of those which are
                        not easily learnt without the most perfect leisure for their study, his most
                        extraordinary credit and his most admirable knowledge consists in his
                        thorough acquaintance with the treaties, and agreements, and conditions of
                        other peoples, kings, and foreign nations, in short, with the entire laws of
                        war and peace; unless, indeed, you mean to make out that the things which
                        our books teach us while in the shade and at our leisure, Cnaeus Pompeius
                        was incapable of learning, either from books, when he was in the enjoyment
                        of peace, or from the actual transactions, when he was engaged in the

					<p>It is my opinion, O judges,<note anchored="yes">Orellius considers the text

                        more to be attributed to the fault of the times than of the individual. Nor
                        will I say any more about a trial of so scandalous a description. For it is
                        the stain and disgrace of this age to envy virtue, and to seek to crush the
                        budding flower of worth and dignity. In truth, if Cnaeus Pompeius had lived
                        five hundred years ago, <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> that man from
                        whom, while a young man and a Roman knight, the senate had often sought aid
                        for the general safety; whose exploits had had all nations for their stage,
                        being crowned everywhere by the most illustrious victories, both by land and
                        sea; of which three triumphs had been the witnesses, proving that the whole
                        world was made subject to <pb n="317"/> our empire; whom the Roman people
                        had distinguished with unexampled honours, in that case if it were now said
                        among you that anything that he had done had been done in contravention of a
                        treaty, who would listen to such a statement? No one. For his death would
                        have put an end to the envy of him, his achievements would rest in the glory
                        of his undying name. As then his virtue, if it were only heard of by us,
                        would leave no room for doubt or question, shall it when present among us,
                        when it has been experienced and beheld by ourselves, be injured by the

					<p>I will, therefore, say nothing about Pompeius in the rest of my speech; but I
                        entreat you, O judges, to retain in your minds and memories what I have
                        said. On the subject of the law, of the treaty, of precedents and of the
                        uninterrupted usage of our state, I shall repeat those things which have
                        been said already. For neither has Marcus Crassus who, as was natural to
                        expect from his eloquence and from his honesty, has in the most careful
                        manner explained the whole bearings of the case to you nor has Cnaeus
                        Pompeius whose speech abounded in every possible ornament of oratory, left
                        me anything new, anything untouched by them to dilate upon: but since,
                        though I drew back, they both wished that this last labour of putting, as it
                        were, a finishing stroke to their work, should be undertaken by me, I beg of
                        you that you will consider that I have undertaken this office and employment
                        more out of regard for what I thought my duty, than from any desire of
                        making a display as an orator. <milestone n="18" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>And, before I approach the law of the case and the cause of Cornelius, it
                        seems to me desirable to say a little about the common condition of all of
                        us, for the sake of deprecating the malevolence of any one. If, O judges,
                        whatever may be the rank in which any one is born or whatever the station in
                        which he is placed by birth in respect of fortune that same station he ought
                        to maintain to his old age, and if all men whom either fortune has raised or
                        whom their own labour or industry has ennobled, are to be visited with
                        punishment, then there does not appear to have been a more severe law or
                        condition of life imposed on Lucius Cornelius than on many other virtuous
                        and gallant men. But if the virtue and genius and humanity of many men,
                        though born in the meanest class of life, and in the lowest degree of
                        fortune, has not only <pb n="318"/> obtained them friendship and a plentiful
                        estate, but has gained them also the greatest praise and honour and glory
                        and dignity, then I cannot understand why envy should be more prompt to
                        attack Lucius Cornelius, than your justice should to come to the assistance
                        of his modesty. <milestone n="19" unit="section"/> And therefore I do not
                        ask of you what it is very important to ask, in order that I may not seem to
                        throw any doubts on your wisdom or your humanity; but I must beg of you not
                        to feel any hatred towards genius, not to be enemies of industry, not to
                        think that humanity deserves to be oppressed, or virtue to be punished. This
                        I beg also; that if you see that my client's cause is of itself a sound and
                        just one, you will allow his personal good qualities and accomplishments to
                        be an assistance to him now that he is on his trial, rather than a
                        hindrance. <milestone n="8" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>The cause of Cornelius, O judges, arises from the law which Lucius Gellius
                        and Cnaeus Cornelius passed in accordance with the resolution of the senate.
                        By that law we see that it is provided that those men shall be Roman
                        citizens whom Cnaeus Pompeius shall separately present with the freedom of
                        the city in accordance with the opinion of his council. Pompeius here in
                        court asserts that Lucius Cornelius was so presented with it. The public
                        records prove this to be the fact: the prosecutor admits it. But he says
                        that no man of a people joined to us by treaty was capable by law of
                        becoming one of our citizens, unless his own people ratified the measure.
                            <milestone n="20" unit="section"/> Oh what a splendid interpreter of the
                        law! what a fine authority on points of antiquity! what an admirable
                        corrector and reformer of our state, to imagine that treaties impose such a
                        penalty on those who are bound by them, as to make them all incapable of
                        receiving our rewards and kindnesses! For what can possibly be said more
                        ignorant than that it is requisite for the federate cities to ratify such a
                        transaction? For that is not a right peculiar to federate cities, but to all
                        free nations. But the whole of this, O judges, has at all times depended on
                        this consideration, and on this intention,&mdash;that when the Roman
                        people had ordered anything, if the allied peoples and the Latins had
                        adopted and ratified it, and if the law which we had among ourselves was in
                        this manner established among some people on a firm footing, then that
                        people should be bound by the obligations of that law; not in such a manner
                        as to detract in the least from our privileges, <pb n="319"/> but that those
                        nations might enjoy either that law which was established among us, or some
                        other advantage and benefit. </p>
					<p><milestone n="21" unit="section"/> Caius Furius, in the time of our

                        by the zeal of nations unconnected with us in our behalf, and by the valour

                        whether the federate states enact these laws that no one shall be permitted

                        or that those things cannot possibly be ratified which we have given to

                        absolutely unlawful for them to meddle at all in our laws. In truth, as,

                        who, without any hope of reward, have been willing to expose their lives to
                        the weapons of the enemy even for the sake of their own country, do you
                        suppose that there will be any one who will expose himself to dangers in the
                        defence of a republic with which he has not any connection, when not only no
                        reward is held out to him, but when all reward for such conduct is
                        prohibited from being bestowed? <milestone n="11" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="27" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>But not only was that a most ignorant thing to say, which was said, about
                        states ratifying and accepting our laws, as that is a privilege common to
                        all free peoples, and not peculiar to federate cities; from which it must
                        inevitably be understood, either that no one of the allies can be made a
                        Roman citizen, or else that an inhabitant of the federate states may
                        likewise be made one; but this great teacher of ours is ignorant also of the
                        whole bearings of the law respecting a man's change of citizenship; which, O
                        judges, is a thing which is not only clearly laid down in the public laws,
                        but which depends also on the inclination of individuals. For, according to
                        our law, no one can change his city against his will, nor can he be
                        prevented from changing it, if he pleases, provided only that he be adopted
                        by that state of which he wishes to become a citizen. As, for instance, if
                        the people of <placeName key="tgn,7007512">Gades</placeName> passed a bill
                        concerning any Roman citizen by name, that he should become a citizen of
                            <placeName key="tgn,7007512">Gades</placeName>, our citizen would in
                        consequence of that bill acquire a complete power of changing his city, and
                        would not be hindered by any treaty from becoming a citizen of <placeName key="tgn,7007512">Gades</placeName> after having been a citizen of
                            <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. <milestone n="28" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>According to our civil law, no one can be a citizen of two cities at the same
                        time; a man cannot be a citizen of this city, who has dedicated himself to
                        another city. And he may do so not only by dedication, which is a thing
                        which we have seen happen in their misfortunes to most illustrious men, to
                        Quintus Maximus, and Caius Laenas, and Quintus Philippus at Nuceria, and to
                        Caius Cato at <placeName key="tgn,7008715">Tarraco</placeName>, to Quintus
                        Caepio and Publius Rutilius at <placeName key="perseus,Smyrna">Smyrna</placeName>, who all became citizens of those cities. (They
                        could not lose their rights of citizenship here, before they had as it were
                        changed their country by their change of citizenship.) </p>
					<p>But a change of citizenship can also take place by a man's <pb n="323"/>
                        returning to his original city. Nor was it without reason that a motion was
                        submitted to the people concerning Cnaeus Publicius Menander, a freedman,
                        whom in the time of our ancestors some ambassadors of ours when going into
                            <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> wished to take with them
                        as an interpreter, that that Publicius if he returned to his home, and after
                        that again came back to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>,
                        should still be a Roman citizen. For, in the recollection of earlier times,
                        many Roman citizens of their own free will, not having been condemned by any
                        process of law, nor having been in danger, have left our state and joined
                        themselves as citizens to other cities. <milestone n="12" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="29" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>But if it is lawful for a Roman citizen to become a citizen of <placeName key="tgn,7007512">Gades</placeName>, either by exile, or by a return to
                        his original city, or by a discarding of his rights of citizenship here, (to
                        come now to the treaty, which, however, in fact has nothing to do with the
                        cause in hand; for what we are discussing is the right of citizenship, and
                        not the treaties,) what reason is there why a citizen of <placeName key="tgn,7007512">Gades</placeName> may not be allowed to become a
                        citizen of this city? My opinion, indeed, goes quite the other way. For as
                        there is a path from all cities to our city, and as the road to all other
                        cities is open to our citizens, so also, in proportion as each city is more
                        closely united with us in alliance and friendship, by agreement, and
                        covenant, and treaty, the more does that state appear to me to be entitled
                        to a participation in our kindness and in our rewards. <gap desc="* * *"/></p>
					<p>But all other cities would without any hesitation receive our men into the
                        rights of citizenship with them if we also had the same laws that other
                        nations have. But we cannot he citizens of this city and of any other city
                        at the same time though in all other cities this is allowed. <milestone n="30" unit="section"/> Therefore in the Greek cities we see that
                        Rhodians and Lacedaemonians and men from all quarters are enrolled among the

                        same individuals are citizens of many cities at the same time. And I have
                        seen some ignorant men, citizens of ours, led by this mistake, sitting at
                            <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> among the judges and
                        members of the Areopagus, in a regular tribe and class of Athenian citizens,
                        being ignorant that it they acquired the rights of citizenship there they
                        lost their rights here, unless they recovered them by a subsequent return to
                        their rights here, and a renunciation of the others. But no one who had any
                        acquaintance with our laws or our customs, <pb n="3245"/> who wished to
                        retain his rights as a citizen of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, ever dedicated himself to another city. <milestone n="13" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>But the whole of this topic of my speech, and the whole of this discussion, O
                        judges, has reference to the common right of changing one's city; it has
                        nothing in it which is peculiar to the religious observance of treaties. For
                        I am defending the universal principle, that there is no nation on the whole
                        face of the earth,&mdash;whether at variance with the Roman people
                        through some quarrel and hatred, or, on the other hand, united with us by
                        the closest loyalty and mutual good-will,&mdash;as to which we are
                        forbidden to adopt any one of its citizens as our own, or to present any one
                        of them with the freedom of our city. <milestone n="31" unit="section"/> Oh
                        how admirable are our laws, and with what god-like wisdom were they
                        established by our ancestors from the very first beginning of the Roman
                        name, especially the law that no one of our people can be a citizen of more
                        than one city, (for it is inevitable that dissimilar states must have a
                        great variety in their laws,) and that no one can be compelled against his
                        will to change his city, nor against his will to remain a citizen of any
                        city. For these are the firmest foundations of our liberty, that every
                        individual should have it in his own power to retain or abandon his
                        privileges. </p>
					<p>And without any dispute, that has been the most solid foundation of our
                        empire, and the thing which has above all others increased the renown of the
                        Roman name, that that first man, the creator of this city, Romulus, taught
                        by the treaty which he made with the Sabines, that it was expedient to
                        increase the population of this city by the adoption of even enemies as
                        citizens. And in compliance with his authority and with the precedent which
                        he established, the presentation of the freedom of our city to others has
                        never been interrupted by our ancestors. Therefore, many tribes from
                            <placeName key="tgn,7003080">Latium</placeName>, the people of
                            <placeName key="perseus,Tusculum">Tusculum</placeName>, the people of
                            <placeName key="perseus,Lanuvium">Lanuvium</placeName>, and all other
                        peoples of all other races, have been received into the privileges of our
                        city;&mdash;as, for instance, the Sabines, the Hernici, and the Volsci;
                        the citizens of which cities were not compelled to change the city to which
                        they belonged, if they were unwilling to do so; nor if any of them had
                        acquired the privileges of our citizens by the kindness of the Roman people,
                        would the treaty made with them appear to have been violated. <pb n="325"/>
                        <milestone n="14" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="32" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>But some treaties are in existence, as for instance those with the Germans,
                        the Insubres, the Helvetians, and the Iapidae, and with some of the
                        barbarian tribes in <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> in which
                        there is a special exception made that no one of them is to be received by
                        us as a citizen of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. And if
                        the exception prevents such a step from being lawful, it is quite evident
                        that it is lawful where there is no such exception made. Where, then, is the
                        exception made in the treaty between us and the city of <placeName key="tgn,7007512">Gades</placeName>, that the Roman people is not to
                        receive any one of the citizens of <placeName key="tgn,7007512">Gades</placeName> into their citizenship? Nowhere. And if there were
                        any such clause, the Gellian and Cornelian law would have annulled it which
                        expressly gave to Pompeius a power of giving the freedom of the city to
                        anybody whatever. &ldquo;The whole treaty,&rdquo; says the
                        prosecutor, &ldquo;is such an exception, because it was ratified with
                        solemn oaths.&rdquo; I can excuse you if you do not know much about the
                        laws of the Carthaginians, for you had left your own city; and you were not
                        able to examine our laws very strictly; for they prevented your having any
                        opportunity of instituting such an examination by a public sentence. </p>
					<p><milestone n="33" unit="section"/> What was there in that enactment which was
                        passed concerning Pompeius by Gellius and Lentulus in their consulship in
                        which any exception appears to have been made of treaties which had been
                        ratified by an oath? For first of all, nothing can be ratified in such a
                        manner except what the burgesses or the common people have so ratified. In
                        the second place, such ratifications are to be accounted sacred, either
                        because of the form of ratification itself, or because the invocation of the
                        gods and dedication of the law, <gap desc="* * *"/> or else, because of some
                        punishment to which the life of that man is devoted who acts in
                        contravention of it. What argument, then, of this sort can you allege with
                        respect to our treaty with the city of <placeName key="tgn,7007512">Gades</placeName>?<note anchored="yes">There is a good deal of
                            corruption and conjecture in the text here and whatever reading may be

                        treaty was solemnly ratified by the devotion of the life of any offender
                        against it, or by any invocation of the gods to uphold the law? I assert
                        that nothing was ever submitted to the burgesses or to the common people
                        with respect to that treaty [I assert that no law was enacted, and no
                        punishment appointed.] </p>
					<p>When, therefore even if it had been enacted that we were <pb n="326"/> not to
                        receive any man as a citizen, still that would have been ratified which the
                        people enacted subsequently, nor would any exception have appeared to have
                        been made by that expression, &ldquo;If anything had been formally
                        ratified by an oath,&rdquo; do you venture to say that anything is
                        formally ratified in this way, with respect to which the Roman people has
                        never come to any decision at all? <milestone n="15" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="34" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>Nor, O judges, has this argument of mine any tendency to invalidate our
                        treaty with the city of <placeName key="tgn,7007512">Gades</placeName>. For
                        it would not become me to say anything against the rights of a city which
                        has deserved very well at our hands, against the invariable opinion of
                        antiquity, and against the authority of the senate. For once, at a very
                        critical period of this republic, when <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>, being exceedingly powerful by sea and land,
                        relying on the two Spains, was threatening this empire, and when those two
                        thunderbolts of our empire, Cnaeus and Publius Scipio, had suddenly perished
                        in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, Lucius Marcius, a
                            centurion<note anchored="yes">&ldquo;Polybius, in the fragments of
                            the sixth book, has left an accurate account of the election of
                            centurions. From each division of the legion, i.e. <foreign lang="la">hastati principes</foreign>, and <foreign lang="la">triarii</foreign>, they elect ten men in order of merit to command
                            in their own division. After this a second election of a like number
                            takes place, in all sixty, who are called centurions. The centurions of
                            the first election usually command the right of the
                            <emph>maniple</emph>; but if either of the two is absent, the whole
                            command of the <emph>maniple</emph> devolves on the other. He who is
                            chosen first is admitted to the councils of the general (<foreign lang="la">principilus</foreign>). The <foreign lang="la">principilus</foreign> was the first centurion of the first

                            was entrusted with the care of the eagle, and had the right of attending
                            the councils of the general.&rdquo;&mdash;Smith, Dict. Ant. v.
                                <foreign lang="la">Centurio</foreign>.</note> of the first division,
                        is said to have made a treaty with the people of <placeName key="tgn,7007512">Gades</placeName>. And as this treaty was maintained
                        more in consequence of the loyalty of that people, of our justice, and,
                        indeed, of its own antiquity, than because it was ratified by any public
                        bond of religion, the people of <placeName key="tgn,7007512">Gades</placeName>, being wise men and well instructed in public law,
                        when Marcus Lepidus and Quintus Catulus were consuls, made a request to the
                        senate for a more regular treaty; and then the treaty was renewed or made
                        (whichever you please to call it) with the men of <placeName key="tgn,7007512">Gades</placeName>. And concerning that treaty the
                        Roman people never recorded any vote; and they cannot possibly be bound by
                        any religious obligation which has been contracted without their orders. </p>
					<p><milestone n="35" unit="section"/> And so the city of <placeName key="tgn,7007512">Gades</placeName> obtained what it was well entitled
                            <pb n="327"/> to obtain by its services done to our republic, by the
                        testimony borne in its favour by our commanders by the antiquity of its
                        alliance with us, by the authority of Quintus Catulus, a most illustrious
                        man by the formal decision of the senate, and by a regular treaty; but it
                        has not received any additional sanction from any public religious
                        ceremonies of ratification. For the people has in no respect whatever bound
                        itself, nor is the cause of the men of <placeName key="tgn,7007512">Gades</placeName> any the worse for that; for it is upheld by many and
                        those the very wealthiest of circumstances. But however there is at present
                        no room for that discussion; for nothing can be so ratified as to be sacred
                        unless it be something that has been adopted by the burgesses or by the
                        common people. <milestone n="16" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>But if this treaty, which the Roman people, with the authority of the senate
                        with the recommendation and decision of antiquity in its favour approves not
                        only by its tacit inclination, but also by its open expression of opinion,
                        had been also sanctioned by its votes, what reason was there, from the words
                        of the treaty itself, why it should not have been lawful to receive a
                        citizen of <placeName key="tgn,7007512">Gades</placeName> into our city? For
                        there is nothing else provided for in the treaty except that there be a
                        pious and everlasting peace. What has that to do with the rights of
                        citizenship? That also is added which does not occur in every treaty:
                        &ldquo;Preserve, with all courtesy and respect, the majesty of the Roman
                        people.&rdquo; And that expression carries this force with it, that it
                        shows that the people of <placeName key="tgn,7007512">Gades</placeName> is
                        the inferior party in the treaty. <milestone n="36" unit="section"/> First
                        of all, the very description of word used &ldquo;Preserve&rdquo;
                        which is a form that we are more accustomed to use in laws than in treaties
                        is an expression of one giving a command, not of one addressing an entreaty.
                        In the next place, as the majesty of the one people is ordered to be
                        preserved and no mention is made of the other, most certainly that people is
                        placed on the higher footing and in the superior condition whose majesty is
                        defended by the sanction of the treaty. And in respect of this the
                        interpretation of the prosecutor is quite undeserving of any reply, who said
                        that the expression &ldquo;with courtesy and respect,&rdquo; meant
                        the same as &ldquo;respectively&rdquo; just as if he were explaining
                        some ancient and nearly obsolete word. Men are called courteous, kind,
                        affable, pleasant. <quote>

                    </p>
					<p>And, at the same time, it is a perfect absurdity for a provision to be made
                        in the treaty that they should &ldquo;respectively&rdquo; preserve
                        the majesty of the Roman people; that is to say, that the Roman people is to
                        wish its own majesty to be uninjured. And if it were so now, as it cannot
                        be, still the fact would remain, that provision had been made for our
                        majesty, but none at all for theirs. Can our majesty then be preserved with
                        good feeling by the people of <placeName key="tgn,7007512">Gades</placeName>, if we are not able to tempt the men of <placeName key="tgn,7007512">Gades</placeName> by rewards to be anxious for its
                        preservation? Can there, in fact be any majesty at all, if we are prevented
                        from availing ourselves of the consent of the Roman people to confer on our
                        commander-in-chief the power of distributing honours and kindnesses as a
                        reward of virtue? <milestone n="17" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="38" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>But why am I arguing against statements which it would seem to me might be
                        uttered with truth, if the people of <placeName key="tgn,7007512">Gades</placeName> were speaking against me? for, if they were to demand
                        back Lucius Cornelius, I should reply, that the Roman people had enacted a
                        law with respect to giving the freedom of the city; and that there was no
                        occasion, nor was it usual for the entire people to ratify laws of this
                        sort; that Cnaeus Pompeius, in accordance with the advice of his council,
                        had given the freedom of the city to this man, and that the people of
                            <placeName key="tgn,7007512">Gades</placeName> had no single law
                        whatever of the Roman people in their favour. Therefore, that nothing had
                        been sanctified by any peculiar solemnity, which appeared to be excepted
                        against by the law; that if there were, still there had been no provision
                        made in the treaty respecting anything but peace. That this clause also was
                        added, that they were bound to preserve our majesty unimpaired; which
                        certainly would be diminished, if it was unlawful either for us to avail
                        ourselves of the citizens of those nations as assistants in our wars, or if
                        we were to have no power whatever of rewarding them. <milestone n="39" unit="section"/>

                        tremendous wars against us, they excluded them from their city, they pursued
                        them with their fleets, they repelled them with their personal exertions,
                        and with all their resources and power. They have at all times considered
                        that phantom of a treaty made by Marcius as more inviolable than any
                        citadel; and by this treaty and by that of Catulus, and by the authority of
                        the senate, they have considered themselves as most intimately connected
                        with us. Their ambition, and our ancestors' wish, has been, that their
                        walls, their temples, their lands, should be the boundaries of the Roman
                        name and Roman empire, as Hercules wished them to be of his journeys and of

                        of provisions they have relieved with a large supply of corn as they had
                        often done before. They call them, I say, to witness that they wish this to

                        and that by these steps they should have a power of rising up to the freedom

                        they will think that they have not a treaty with us, but that most
                        iniquitous laws have been imposed on them by us. And, O judges, the very
                        circumstances of this case show that this assertion is <pb n="330"/> not one
                        just invented by me for the purpose, but that I am saying what the men of

                        publicly entered into a connection of mutual hospitality many years before
                        this time with Lucius Cornelius. I will produce witnesses, I will produce
                        ambassadors who will prove this; I will bring forward panegyrists, whom you

                        the danger of my client by their prayers. Lastly, by an act perfectly
                        unheard-of among the people of <placeName key="tgn,7007512">Gades</placeName> before this time, the moment that it was known that
                        the prosecutor was preparing to bring Balbus before this court, the men of
                            <placeName key="tgn,7007512">Gades</placeName> passed most solemn

                        (since I have taken a great fancy to the expression,)&mdash;if what is
                        meant by ratifying is, to approve of our decrees and commands by its
                        decision,&mdash;than when it enters into connections of hospitality for
                        the express purpose of admitting, by so doing, that Balbus had changed his
                        city, and of showing that it considered him entirely worthy of the honour of
                        this city? Was it possible for it to exhibit its own opinion and inclination
                        more undeniably, than when it imposed a fine and a penalty on my client's
                        prosecutor? Was it possible for it to give its decision on the subject more
                        plainly, than when it sent its most honourable citizens as deputies to this
                        trial which is now taking place before you, to be the witnesses of Balbus's
                        rights, and the panegyrists of his conduct through life, and his saviours

                        cause to rejoice exceedingly that this goodwill of Lucius Cornelius towards
                        his friends is still in existence at <placeName key="tgn,7007512">Gades</placeName>, and that his interest and power of serving his

                        among them; and how, at the request of this my client, he displayed the

                        they otherwise would have done. Therefore the chief men of the city are here
                        to stand by him and to defend him: with affection, as being their fellow
                        citizen with their evidence as a citizen of ours; with kindness, as one who

					<p>Who, then are the men whom we consider the wisest interpreters of treaties

					<p>In truth if that celebrated augur Quintus Scaevola, when he was consulted

                        than Caius Aquillius, because constant practice devoted <pb n="332"/> to one
                        particular line of business often proves superior to ability and to general
                        information, who can hesitate to prefer our generals to all the most

                        not therefore, mention, with your approbation, Caius Marius, the original
                        author of that conduct and of that precedent which is found so much fault
                        with by you? Do you require any more weighty example? any one of more
                        consistent wisdom? any one more eminent for virtue and prudence, and
                        conscientiousness and equity? Did he, then, confer the freedom of the city
                        on Marcus Annius Appius, a most gallant man, and one endued with the most
                        admirable virtue, when he knew that the treaty made with Camertum had been
                        most solemnly ratified, and was in all respects a most equitable one? Is it
                        possible, then, O judges, that Lucius Cornelius should be condemned, without
                        condemning also the conduct of Caius Marius? <milestone n="47" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>Let then, that great man be present for a while to your thoughts, as he
                        cannot appear before you in reality, so that you may behold him with your
                        minds whom you cannot behold with your eyes. Let him state to you that he
                        has not been altogether unversed in treaties, nor wholly inexperienced in
                        the nature of precedents, nor entirely ignorant of war; that he was the
                        pupil and soldier of Publius Africanus; that he was trained in campaigns and
                        in many warlike lieutenancies; that if he had read of as many wars as he has
                        served in and conducted, and brought to a termination,&mdash;that if he
                        had served under consuls as often as he himself was consul, he might have
                        learnt and become thoroughly acquainted with all the laws of war; that he
                        never doubted for a moment that no treaty could hinder him from doing
                        anything which was for the advantage of the republic; that he carefully
                        selected all the bravest men out of every city which was closely connected
                        with and friendly to us; that none of the people of <placeName key="perseus,Iguvium">Iguvium</placeName> or of Camertum were excepted
                        by treaty, so that their citizens were incapable of receiving from the Roman
                        people the rewards of their virtue. <milestone n="21" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="48" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>Therefore, when, a few years after this present of the freedom of the city, a
                        very important and strenuously-contested question arose concerning the
                        rights of citizenship according to the previsions of the Licinian and Mucian
                        law, <pb n="333"/> was any prosecution instituted against any one of those
                        men of the federate states who had had the freedom of the city conferred on
                        him? For Titus Matrinius, of Spoletum, one of those men whom Caius Marius
                        had presented with the freedom of the city, was indeed prosecuted, being a
                        man of a Latin colony, which was among the first for vigour and high
                        character. And when Lucius Antistius, a very eloquent man, prosecuted him,
                        he never said that the people of Spoletum had not ratified the deed of
                        Marius; for he saw that states were accustomed to ratify laws which
                        concerned their own rights, not those which affected ours. But as colonies
                        had not been established by the law of Appuleius, by which law Saturninus
                        had carried, in favour of Marius, a proposition that he should have
                        authority to make three Roman citizens in every colony, he said that this
                        power which was so granted could have no validity, since the case for which
                        it had been intended to provide did not exist. </p>
					<p><milestone n="49" unit="section"/> There is no resemblance to this case in
                        the present prosecution. But still so great was the authority of Caius
                        Marius, that he did not employ true oratory of Lucius Crassus his own
                        relation, a man of extraordinary eloquence, but himself in a few words
                        defended his conduct with the weight and wisdom which belonged to him, and
                        proved his case to everybody's satisfaction. For who could there be, O
                        judges who would wish that the power of selecting men for distinction on
                        account of their valour in war, in the line of battle, and in the army,
                        should be taken from our generals; or that all hope of rewards for the
                        energy shown in defending the republic should be taken from our allies, and
                        from the federate states? But if the countenance of Caius Marius, and his
                        voice,&mdash;if that quickness of eye so advantageous to a
                        general,&mdash;if his recent triumphs, and the authority of his
                        presence, had such influence, then let his authority, and his exploits, and
                        his memory, and the undying name of that most illustrious man, prevail
                        still. Let there be this difference between agreeable citizens and brave
                        ones,&mdash;that the former, while living, may have all the enjoyment of
                        their influence, but that the authority of the latter may flourish without
                        decay even after they are dead themselves, (if indeed any defender of this
                        empire can be properly said to die at all.) <milestone n="22" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="50" unit="section"/></p>

                        sobriety of conduct but also one who is usually even too sparing in
                        admitting men as citizens of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>?
                            <milestone n="51" unit="section"/> And do you now attempt to disparage
                        Cnaeus Pompeius's kindness, or I should rather say, his discretion and
                        conduct, in doing what he had heard that Caius Marius had done; and what he
                        had actually seen done in his own town by Publius Crassus, by Lucius Sulla,
                        by Quintus Metellus; and, though last not least, what he had a family
                        precedent for in his own father? Nor was Cornelius the only instance of his
                        doing this. For he also presented Hasdrubal, of <placeName key="tgn,7008559">Saguntum</placeName>, after that important war in <placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>, and several of the Mamertines<note anchored="yes">There is probably corruption in both these names;
                            especially in the latter. The Mamertines were a people of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>.</note> who came across him,
                        and some of the inhabitants of <placeName key="tgn,7018163">Utica</placeName>, and the Fabii from <placeName key="tgn,7008559">Saguntum</placeName>, with the freedom of the city. </p>
					<p>In truth, as those men are worthy of all other rewards too who defend our
                        republic with their personal exertions and at the expense of their own
                        personal danger, so certainly those <pb n="335"/> men are of all others the
                        most worthy of being presented with the freedom of the city in defence of
                        which they have encountered dangers and wounds. And I wish that those men in
                        all quarters of the world who are the defenders of this empire, could all
                        enter this city as citizens, and, on the other hand, that all the enemies of
                        the republic could be got rid or out of it. Nor, indeed did that great poet
                        of our country intend that exhortation which he put into the mouth of
                        Hannibal to be peculiarly his language, but rather the common address of all

                        men who may have been meanly born to the inactivity of the nobility.

					<p>You have before you the interpretation put upon the law and upon treaties by
                        the most consummate generals, by the wisest men and the most illustrious
                        citizens. I will add now that given by the judges who presided at this
                        investigation; I will add that of the whole Roman people; I will add the
                        most conscientious and sensible decision of the senate. When the judges were
                        stating openly and were explaining without any disguise what they intended
                        to decide with respect to the Papian law in the case of Marcus Crassus, when
                        the Mamertines claimed him back as a citizen of theirs, the Mamertines,
                        though they had commenced the cause under the sanction of the public
                        authority of their state abandoned it. <milestone n="53" unit="section"/>
                        Many men who had been admitted to the freedom of this city from the free
                        states, or the federate cities, were released from all apprehension on the
                        subject. No one was ever prosecuted on account of his rights as a citizen,
                        either because his own state had not ratified his admission, or because his
                        right to change his city was hindered by any treaty. I will venture also to
                        assert even this, that no one ever lost his action who was proved to have
                        been presented with the freedom of the city by any one of our generals. </p>
					<p>Listen now to the decision of the Roman people given on many different
                        occasions, and approved of in the most important causes, in consequence both
                        of the facts of the case, and <pb n="336"/> of precedent. Who is there that
                        does not know that a treaty was made with all the Latins in the consulship
                        of Spurius Cassius and Postumus Cominius? <milestone n="54" unit="section"/>
                        Which, indeed, we recollect to have been in existence till quite lately,
                        engraved and written on a brazen column at the back of the <foreign lang="la">rostra</foreign>. How then was Lucius Cossinius, a man of
                            <placeName key="perseus,Tibur">Tibur</placeName>, the father of our
                        present Roman knight of the same name, a most excellent and most
                        accomplished man, after Titus Caelius had been condemned; and how was Titus
                        Coponius, of the same city, he also being a citizen of the very greatest
                        virtue and dignity, (his grandsons Titus and Caius Coponius you are all
                        acquainted with,) after Caius Masso had been condemned, made a Roman
                        citizen? Are we going to affirm that the path to the freedom of the city is
                        open to eloquence and genius, but shall not be open to courage and virtue?
                        Was it lawful for the federate states to acquire spoils from us, and shall
                        it not be lawful for them to carry them off from the enemy? Or shall it be
                        impossible for them to acquire by fighting what they are enabled to acquire
                        by speaking? Or did our ancestors intend that the rewards of a prosecutor
                        should be greater than those of a warrior? <milestone n="24" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>But if by that most severe Servilian law, the chief men of the city, men of
                        the greatest dignity, citizens of the most profound wisdom, allowed this
                        road to the freedom of the city to be opened, in accordance with the
                        resolution of the people, to the Latins, that is to say to the federate
                        states, and if this was found no fault with by the Licinian and Mucian law,

                        which no one could obtain except through the misfortune of some

                        decisions of our generals were to be of force with respect to that kind of
                        reward in which the decisions of the judges had already been ratified? Do we
                        suppose, then, that the sanction of the Latin tribes was given to the
                        Servilian law, or to the other laws in which the reward of the freedom of
                        the city was held out to men of the Latin towns, as an encouragement to such
                        and such conduct? <milestone n="55" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>Listen now to the decision of the senate, which has at all times been
                        approved of by the decision of the people. Our <pb n="337"/> ancestors, O
                        judges, ordained that the sacred rites of <placeName key="tgn,7010621">Ceres</placeName> should be performed with the very strictest religious
                        reverence and the greatest solemnity; which, as they had been originally
                        derived from the Greeks, had always been conducted by Greek priestesses, and
                        were called Greek rites. But when they were selecting a priestess from
                            <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> to teach us that Greek
                        sacred ceremony, and to perform it, still they thought it right that it
                        should be a citizen who was sacrificing for citizens, in order that she
                        might pray to the immortal gods with knowledge, indeed, derived from a
                        distant and foreign source but with feelings belonging to one of our own
                        people and citizens. I see that these priestesses were for the most part
                        Neapolitans or Velians, and those are notoriously federate cities. I am not
                        speaking of any ancient cases, I am only mentioning things that have
                        happened lately, as, for instance, that before the freedom of the city was
                        conferred on the Velians, Caius Valerius Flaccus being the city praetor,
                        did, in accordance with a resolution passed by the senate, submit a motion
                        to the people concerning a woman of <placeName key="perseus,Velia">Velia</placeName>, called Calliphana, mentioning her expressly by name,
                        for the purpose of making her a Roman citizen. Are we then to suppose that
                        the Velians ratified the law which was then passed about her; or that that
                        priestess was not made a Roman citizen; or that the treaty was violated by
                        the senate and people of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>?
                            <milestone n="25" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="56" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>I am aware, O judges, that in a cause that is so plain and so little liable
                        to any doubt, many more arguments have been adduced and more men of great
                        experience have spoken than the case at all required. But that has been
                        done, not in order by our speaking to prove to you a matter which required
                        proof so little, but in order to check the hostile disposition of all
                        spiteful, and wicked, and envious men, whom the prosecutor has sought to
                        inflame, hoping that some of the reports current among men who grieve over
                        the prosperity of another might reach your ears, and have their effect on
                        the result of this trial; and on that account you saw aspersions scattered
                        about with great art in every part of his speech; especially with respect to
                        the riches of Lucius Cornelius, which do not deserve to be brought into
                        odium, and which, whatever their amount may be, are such as to seem to have
                        been rather acquired by care than by any illicit or <pb n="333"/> unfair
                        means; and with respect to his luxury, which he attacked, not by bringing
                        any definite charge of licentiousness against him, but by mere general
                        abuse. Then, too, he attacked him about his farm at <placeName key="perseus,Tusculum">Tusculum</placeName>, which he recollected had
                        belonged to Quintus Metellus, and to Lucius Crassus; but he was not aware
                        that Crassus had bought it of a man who was a freedman, Sotericus Marcius by
                        name; that it had come to Metellus as part of the property of Venonius
                        Vindicius; and also, he did not know that lands do not belong to any
                        particular family, that they are accustomed to pass by sale to strangers,
                        often even to the very lowest people, not being protected by the laws like
                        guardianships. <milestone n="57" unit="section"/> It has been imputed to him
                        also that he has become one of the tribe Crustumina, a privilege which he
                        obtained by means of the law concerning bribery, and which is less invidious
                        than the advantages acquired by those men who, by the assistance of the
                        laws, obtain the power of delivering their opinion as praetor, and of
                        wearing the <foreign lang="la">praetexta</foreign>. And then, too, the
                        adoption of Theophanus was discussed; by means of which Cornelius gained
                        nothing beyond being confirmed in his possession of the inheritances of his
                        own relations. <milestone n="26" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>Although it is not a very difficult matter to propitiate the minds of those
                        men who themselves are envious of Cornelius. They show their envy in the
                        ordinary way; they attack him at their feasts; they abuse him at their
                        conversations; they carp at him, not in a downright hostile spirit, but in a
                        disparaging manner. <milestone n="58" unit="section"/> They who are enemies
                        to the friends of Lucius Cornelius, or who envy them, are much more greatly
                        to be feared by him. For who has ever been found who would confess himself
                        an enemy to the man himself? Or who could be so with any reason? What good
                        man has he not cultivated the friendship of? Who is there whose fortune and
                        dignity he has not promoted? Living in the closest intimacy with the most
                        influential man in the state, at a time of our greatest misfortunes and most
                        bitter dissensions, he has never offended any one of either party, either by
                        act or word, or even by a look. It was my fate, or the fate of the republic,
                        that the whole weight of distress and ill-will at that time should fall upon
                        me alone. Cornelius was so far from exulting in my disasters or in your
                        dissensions, that while I was absent, he aided all my friends with his kind
                            <pb n="339"/> assistance, with his tears, with his exertions, and with
                        consolation. <milestone n="59" unit="section"/> And I have been induced by
                        their testimony in his behalf, and by their entreaties, to offer him my
                        service now, which he has so well deserved, and which on my part is only a
                        repayment of just and reasonable gratitude. And I hope, O judges, as you
                        love and consider dear to you those men who were the chief agents in my
                        preservation and safety, and in the restoration of my dignity, that so also
                        the things which were done by this man to the extent of his power and of the
                        opportunities which were afforded him, will be grateful to and approved of
                        by you. He, then, is not now attacked by his own enemies, for he has none,
                        but by those of his friends; enemies who are both numerous and powerful; men
                        whom yesterday Cnaeus Pompeius, in a very eloquent and dignified oration,
                        desired to come forward and contend with him if they chose, but to abandon
                        the unequal contest and unjust persecution which they were carrying on
                        against this man. <milestone n="27" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="60" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>And it was a fair condition, and one very advantageous, O judges, for us and
                        for all those who are connected with us in intimacy that we should carry on
                        our own enmities against one another as we chose, but that we should spare
                        the friends of our enemies. And if my authority had in this matter much
                        weight with those men, especially as they see that I am well instructed in
                        such matters both by the variety of circumstances in which I have found
                        myself, and by special experience in cases of this sort, I would exhort them
                        to give up even those greater dissensions. For I have at all times
                        considered it the part both of fearless citizens and of virtuous men to
                        labour in the administration of the affairs of the republic in such a way as
                        to defend whatever one really thinks best; nor have I myself ever failed in
                        this labour or duty or line of exertion. But contention is only wise so long
                        as it either does some good or, if it does not do any good, at all events
                        does no harm to the state. <milestone n="61" unit="section"/> We ourselves
                        have had wishes, we have urged points, we have tried to carry measures, and
                        we have not succeeded. Other men have felt indignation; we have undergone
                        real sorrow and distress. Why should we choose to destroy those things which
                        exist rather than to preserve them if merely because we are not allowed to
                        alter them exactly as we wish? The senate complimented Caius Caesar with the
                        most honourable distinction of a supplication <pb n="340"/> lasting for a
                        number of days which was quite unprecedented. The senate again, though at a
                        time when the treasury was in great difficulties, gave his victorious army a
                        large sum for pay, appointed ten lieutenants to assist the
                        commander-in-chief at his request, and by the Sempronian law decided not to

                        mover and the chief author; nor did I think myself bound to preserve a
                        consistency with the previous differences which I had had with him, rather
                        than to consult what was advantageous with regard to the present necessities
                        of the republic and to unanimity. Other men may perhaps think differently.
                        They are, maybe, firmer in their opinions. I find fault with no one; but I
                        do not agree with all of them. Nor do I think it any proof of inconsistency
                        to regulate one's opinions, as one would do a ship or a ship's course on a
                        voyage, according to the weather which might be prevailing in the republic.

                        their train and followers. Some of them, perhaps, will consider that conduct
                        obstinacy, and some will think it courage; but this attacking of the

                        cruelty. But if there be some men, O judges, whose minds we cannot
                        propitiate by any means whatever, at all events we feel sure that your
                        inclinations are favourable to us, not because of our speeches, but because

					<p>For, what reason is there why the intimate friendship of Caesar should not
                        avail to procure this my client the highest praise rather than the very
                        slightest injury? Caesar knew him when a young man; he, that most able man,
                        thought highly of him, and though he had a most excessive multitude of
                        friends, Balbus was accounted by him one of his most intimate friends of
                        all. In his praetorship and in his consulship he appointed him prefect of
                        the engineers; he thought highly of his prudence, he loved him for his
                        integrity, he was grateful to him for his constant assistance and attention.
                        He was at different times the partner of very many of his labours; he is
                        perhaps even now the partaker of some of <pb n="341"/> his benefits. And if
                        they are to be an injury to my client in your judgment, I do not see what is
                        ever to be an advantage to any one before such judges. <milestone n="64" unit="section"/>

					<p>But since Caius Caesar is a great distance off, and is now in those places
                        which, if we regard their situation, are the boundaries of the world, or, if
                        we regard his exploits, of the Roman empire, do not, I entreat you, in the
                        name of the immortal gods, O judges, do not allow such bitter news to be
                        taken to him, as that his own prefect of engineers, the man of all others
                        most dear to and most intimate with him, is crushed by your decision, not on
                        account of any offence of his own, but because of his intimacy with him.
                        Pity the man who is now before the court at his own peril, not on account of
                        any offence of his own, but because of the action of this great and most
                        illustrious man,&mdash;who is contesting not any charge which is brought
                        against him, but a point of public law and of general interest. And if
                        Cnaeus Pompeius, and Publius Crassus, and Quintus Metellus, and Cnaeus
                        Pompeius the father of this man, and Lucius Sulla, and Marcus Crassus, and
                        Caius Marius, and the senate and people of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> and all those who have ever given a decision under
                        similar circumstances and the federate states, and the allies and those
                        ancient men of the Latin tribes whom I have mentioned are all ignorant of
                        this law, consider whether it may not be more advantageous and honourable
                        for you to err with those men for your guides than to be rightly instructed
                        with this man for your teacher. </p>
					<p>But if you see that you are now come to a decision about a law which is
                        certain and clear and advantageous and well established and determined, then
                        beware of establishing any new principle in a case which has been so loud
                        and so repeatedly decided on. <milestone n="65" unit="section"/> And at the
                        same time, O judges, place all these considerations before
                        you:&mdash;first of all, that all those most illustrious men who have
                        ever given any man of a federate city the freedom of this city are now on
                        their trial after death; secondly, that the senate is so too, which has
                        repeatedly decided in favour of such an act and the people which has voted
                        it and the judges who have approved of it. Then consider this also that
                        Cornelius does live and always has lived in such a manner that though
                        investigations are appointed for every imaginable offence, still he is now
                        brought before the court, not for the sake of any punishment which is sought
                        to be inflicted on his vices, but for that at the rewards <pb n="342"/>
                        which have been conferred on his virtue. Add this consideration also; that
                        you by your decision are about to determine whether you choose that for the
                        future the friendship of illustrious men should be a calamity to men, or an
                        ornament. Lastly of all, O judges, keep this fixed in your minds, that in
                        this action you are about to decide, not on any crime imputed to Lucius
                        Cornelius, but on a kindness shown by Cnaeus Pompeius.</p>

					<head>THE ORATION OF M. T. CICERO AGAINST LUCIUS CALPURNIUS PISO.</head>
					<argument>
						<head>THE ARGUMENT.</head>
						<p>After the decision which the senate came to in consequence of Cicero's
                            speech on the subject of the consular provinces, Piso returned home from
                                <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, being the first
                            senator of consular rank who had ever had that province, and had
                            returned from it without a triumph. On the contrary, he had lost most of
                            his troops in engagements with the barbarians on the frontiers. When he
                            arrived in <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, he stripped
                            his forces of their laurels, and entered the city as obscurely and
                            quietly as he could. But on his first appearance in the senate, relying
                            on the influence of Caesar, who was his son-in-law, he attacked Cicero
                            violently, complaining that he had treated him ill in his absence,
                            especially in promoting the measure which deprived him of his province.
                            And among other topics he reproached him with having been banished; on
                            which the whole senate interrupted him with evident indignation. He
                            reproached him also with his bad verses, and with his vanity in praising
                            himself in them. Cicero was exasperated by this attack to break out with
                            the following invective against him by way of reply, of which a good
                            deal of the beginning is lost, and one or two other portions are in a
                            very corrupt or doubtful state.</p>

                        at all <pb n="344"/> that was known of either in war or at home. You crept
                        into honours through men's blunders, by the recommendation of some old

                        confer all its honours on me in that way-on me, a new man. But when you were

                        name. You were made aedile. A Piso was elected by the Roman people; but not
                        the Piso that you are. The praetorship also was conferred in reality on your

					<p>When the Roman people made me quaestor among the first of the candidates, and

                        it should be divided; if it was expedient, I reserved it for more
                        respectable authors of the division. I, in the case of Caius Rabirius, a man

                        the Roman people against my doing so. I ordered Lucius Catiline planning not

                        council, in the fullest possible house, called me the father of my country.
                        This most illustrious man, who is at this moment sitting close to you,
                        Lucius Gellius, in the hearing of all these people, said that a civic crown
                        was owed to me by the republic.<note anchored="yes">A civic crown was given
                            to those who had saved the life of a citizen.</note> Though I was only
                        clad in the garb of peace, the senate, by an unprecedented sort of
                        supplication, opened the temples of the gods in my <pb n="346"/> honour; not
                        because I had successfully governed the republic, that being a compliment
                        which had been paid to many, but because I had saved it, that being an
                        honour which has never been conferred on any one. When in the assembly of
                        the people, on giving up my office, I was prevented saying what I had
                        intended by the tribune of the people, and when he would only allow me to
                        take the oath, I swore without any hesitation that the republic and this
                        city had been saved by my single exertions. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> On that day, the entire Roman people gave me in that assembly, not a
                        congratulation to be remembered for the rest of the day, but they gave me
                        immortality and eternal glory, when they themselves swearing also, with one
                        voice and consent approved of my oath couched in such proud and triumphant
                        words. And on that occasion, my return home from the forum was of such a
                        nature that there did not appear to be a single citizen who was not in my
                        train. And my consulship was conducted throughout in such a manner, that I
                        did nothing without the advice of the senate,&mdash;nothing without the
                        approbation of the Roman people; that in the <foreign lang="la">rostra</foreign> I constantly defended the senate,&mdash;in the
                        senate-house I was the unwearied advocate of the people; that in that
                        manner, I united the multitude with the chief men, and the equestrian order
                        with the senate. I have now briefly described my consulship. <milestone n="4" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>Dare now, O you Fury to describe yours; the beginning of which was the
                        Compitalitian games, then first celebrated since the time that Lucius
                        Metellus and Quintus Marcius were consuls, contrary to the inclination of
                        this order: games which Quintus Metellus (I am doing injury to a gallant man
                        who is dead when I compare him, to whom this city has produced few equals,
                        to this ill-omened beast)&mdash;but he, being consul elect when a
                        certain tribune of the people, relying on his own power, had ordered the
                        master of the games to celebrate them in contempt of a resolution passed by
                        the senate, though still a private individual, forbade it to be done, and he
                        carried that point by the weight of his character, which he had not as yet
                        any power to enforce. You, when the day of the Compitalitia<note anchored="yes">The <foreign lang="la">compitalicii ludi</foreign>, or
                                <foreign lang="la">compitalia</foreign>, as they are called a few
                            lines after, were a festival celebrated once a year in honour of the
                                <foreign lang="la">lares compitales</foreign>, to whom sacrifices
                            were offered at places where two ways met. It is said to have been
                            instituted by Tarquinius Priscus, in honour of the birth of Servius
                            Tullius, and Tarquinius Superbus is said to have sacrificed boys at them
                            to Mania the mother of the Lares; but after his expulsion this custom
                            was abolished, and the offerings were garlic and poppies. The exact day
                            on which the games were celebrated varied, but it was always in the
                            winter. In one of Cicero's letters to Atticus, (<bibl n="Cic. Att. 7.7.1">vii. 7,</bibl>) he speaks of them as falling one
                            year on the second of January. According to some editions the proper
                            reading here is the thirtieth of December. Smith, Dict. Ant. p.279, v.
                                <foreign lang="la">Compitolia</foreign>.</note> had fallen on the
                        first <pb n="347"/> of January, permitted Sextus Clodius, who had never
                        before filled any office which entitled him to wear the <foreign lang="la">pratetexta</foreign>, to celebrate the games, and to strut about in a
                            <foreign lang="la">praetexta</foreign> like a profligate man, as he was,
                        a man thoroughly worthy of your countenance and regard. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Therefore, when you had laid this foundation of your
                        consulship, three days after, while you were looking on in silence, the
                        Aelian and Fufian law, that bulwark and wall of tranquillity and peace, was
                        overturned by Publius Clodius, that fatal prodigy and monster of the
                        republic. Not only the guilds which the senate had abolished were restored
                        but countless new ones were established of all the dregs of the city and
                        even of slaves. The same man, immersed in unheard of and impious
                        debaucheries, abolished that old preceptress of modesty and charity, the
                        severity of the censor, while you in the mean time, you sepulchre of the
                        republic, you who say that you were at that time consul at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, never by one single word intimated
                        any opinion of your own amid such a terrible shipwreck of the state.
                            <milestone n="5" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="10" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>I have not yet said what you did yourself, but only what you allowed to be
                        done. Nor does it make much difference, especially in a consul whether he
                        himself harnesses the republic with pernicious laws mid infamous harangues,
                        or allows others to harass it. Can there be any excuse for a consul, I will
                        not say being disaffected to the state, but sitting with his hands before
                        him dawdling and sleeping amid the greatest commotions of the republic? For
                        nearly a hundred years had we possessed the Aelian and Fufian law; for four
                        hundred years had we enjoyed the censor's power of deciding on, and
                        animadverting on, the conduct of citizens; laws which I will not say no
                        wicked man has ever dared to uproot, but which no one has ever been able to
                        uproot, a power which no one, not if he were ever so profligate has ever
                        attempted to diminish so as to <pb n="348"/> prevent a formal judgment from
                        being passed every fifth year on our morals. </p>
					<p><milestone n="11" unit="section"/> These things now, O worst of men, are
                        entombed in the bosom of your consulship. Proceed on to the days which
                        followed their funeral obsequies. In front of the tribunal of Aurelius,
                        while you were not only shutting your eyes to the measure, which of itself
                        would have been wicked enough, but while you were looking on with a more
                        delighted countenance than usual, a levy of slaves was had by that man who
                        never considered anything too infamous for him either to say or to do. Arms
                        (O you betrayer of all temples) were placed in the temples of Castor by that
                        robber, while you were looking on, to whom that temple, while you were
                        consul, was a citadel for profligate citizens,&mdash;a receptacle for
                        the veteran soldiers of Catiline,&mdash;a castle for forensic robbery,
                        and the sepulchre of all law and of all religion. Not only my house, but the
                        whole <placeName key="tgn,3000935">Palatine Hill</placeName>, was crowded by
                        the senate, by Roman knights, by the entire city, by the whole of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, while you not only never once came
                        near that Cicero (for I omit all mention of domestic circumstances, which
                        perhaps you would deny, and speak only of those facts which were done openly
                        and are notorious)&mdash;you never, I say, came near that Cicero to whom
                        all the <foreign lang="la">comitia</foreign> in which you were elected
                        consul had given the first tablet of the prerogative tribe, but who in the
                        senate was the third person whose opinion you asked; but more, you were
                        present, yes, and you presided in the most cruel manner, over all the
                        counsels which were entertained for the purpose of crushing me. <milestone n="6" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="12" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>But what was it that you dared to say to me myself, in the presence of my
                        son-in-law, your own relation? &ldquo;That Gabinius was a beggar,
                        without either house or property; that he could not exist if he did not
                        obtain a province; that you had hopes from a tribune of the people, if you
                        united your plans to his; that you had no hope at all from the senate; that
                        you were complying with his covetousness as I had done in the case of my
                        colleague; that there was no reason why I should implore the protection of
                        the consuls; that every one ought to take care of his own
                        interests.&rdquo; And these things I scarcely venture to say. I am
                        afraid that there may be some one who does not clearly see his enormous
                        wickedness, concealed as it is under his impenetrable countenance; still I
                            <pb n="349"/> will say it: he himself, at all events, will recognise the
                        truth, and will feel some pain in recollecting his crimes. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>Do you recollect you infamous fellow, when about the fifth hour of the day I
                        came to you with Caius Piso, that you came out of some hovel or other with
                        your head wrapped up, and in slippers? and when you, with that fetid breath
                        of yours, had filled us with the odour of that vile cookshop, that you made
                        the excuse of your health, because you said that you were compelled to have
                        recourse to some vinous remedies? and when we had admitted the pretence,
                        (for what could we do?) we stood a little while amid the fumes and smell of
                        your gluttony, till you drove us away by filthy language and still more
                        filthy behaviour? <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>About two days afterwards you were brought forward in the assembly of the
                        people by that man with whom you had shared your consulship in that manner;
                        and when you were asked what were your sentiments respecting my consulship,
                        you, a very grave authority, some Calatinus, I suppose, or Africanus, or
                        Maximus, surely not a Caesoninus half-Placentian Calventius, make answer,
                        lifting one eyebrow up to your forehead, and depressing the other down to
                        your chin, &ldquo;that you did not approve of its entirety.&rdquo;
                            <milestone n="7" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>On this, that noble man, so exceedingly worthy of being admitted into your
                        counsels, praised you. Do you, then, you scoundrel, do you as consul condemn
                        the senate for cruelty before an assembly of the people? For you are not
                        condemning one who only obeyed the senate;&mdash;for that salutary and
                        diligent report of the conspiracy was the work of the consul; the sentence
                        and the punishment were the act of the senate. And when you find fault with
                        them, you show what sort of consul you would have been at that time, if by
                        chance it had so happened. You, I make no doubt would have considered that
                        Catiline deserved to be aided with pay and provisions. For, what was the
                        difference between Catiline and that man to whom you sold the authority of
                        the senate, the safety of the state, and the whole republic, for the reward
                        of a province? <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> For the consuls assisted
                        Clodius while doing those very things which Catiline was only attempting
                        when I as consul defeated his machinations. He, indeed, wished to massacre
                        the senate; you two abolished it. He wished to destroy the laws by fire and
                        sword; you two abrogated them. <pb n="350"/> He wished the country to
                        perish; you two aided him. What, during your consulship, was ever
                        accomplished except by force of arms? That band of conspirators wished to
                        fire the city; you two sought to burn the house of that man, to whom it was
                        owing that the city was not burnt. And even these men, if they had a consul
                        like you, would never have thought of burning the city: For they did not
                        wish to deprive themselves of their homes; but as long as those consuls
                        flourished, they thought that there would be no home for their wickedness.
                        They desired the slaughter of the citizens; you desired to bring them to
                        slavery; and in this were even more cruel than they; for, until your
                        consulship, the spirit of liberty was so deeply implanted in this people,
                        that they would have thought it preferable to die rather than to become
                        slaves. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> But that pair of you, acting on
                        the designs of Catiline and Lentulus, expelled me from my house, and
                        confined Cnaeus Pompeius to his; for they did not think that as long as I
                        stood firm, and remained in the city exerting all my vigilance for its
                        defence, and as long as Cnaeus Pompeius, the conqueror of all the world,
                        opposed them, they should ever be able utterly to destroy the republic. You
                        sought even to inflict punishment on me, by which you might make atonement
                        to the shades of the dead conspirators. You poured forth upon me all the
                        hatred which had been long nursed in the wicked feelings of impious men. And
                        if I had not yielded for a while to their frenzy, I should have been
                        murdered in the tomb of Catiline, under your leadership. But what greater
                        proof do you want that there is no real difference between you and Catiline,
                        than is the fact, that you awakened again that same band from the half-dead
                        relics of Catiline's army? that you collected all abandoned men from all
                        quarters? that you let loose against me the dregs of the prisons? that you
                        armed conspirators? that you sought to expose my person and the lives of all
                        good men to their frenzy and to their swords? <milestone n="8" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="17" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>But I come back now to that splendid harangue of yours. You are the man who
                        disapprove of cruelty, are you? you who, when the senate had decided on
                        displaying its grief and indignation by a change of their garments, and when
                        you saw that the whole republic was grieving in the mourning of its most
                        honourable order, you, O merciful man, what do you <pb n="351"/> do? Why,
                        what no tyrant in any country of barbarians ever dreamt of. For, I say
                        nothing of the fact of a consul issuing an edict, that the senate should not
                        obey a resolution of the senate; an action than which none more shameful can
                        either be done or imagined. I return to the merciful disposition of that
                        man, who thinks that the senate were over cruel in preserving the country.
                            <milestone n="18" unit="section"/> He with his mate&mdash;whom
                        however he was desirous to surpass in all vices&mdash;dared to issue an

                        resolution which that body itself had passed. What tyrant in any part of
                            <placeName key="tgn,6005315">Scythia</placeName> ever behaved in such a
                        way as not to permit those men to mourn whom he was loading with misery? You
                        leave them their grief, you take away the emblems of grief, you take away
                        their tears not by comforting them but by threatening them. But even if the
                        conscript fathers had changed their attire not in consequence of any public
                        resolution, but out of private affection or pity still it would have been an
                        intolerable stretch of power that your interdict should prohibit them from
                        doing so; but when the senate in a full house had passed a resolution to
                        that effect, and all the other orders in the state had already changed their
                        attire, then you, a consul, dragged out of a dark dirty cookshop, with that
                        shaved dancing girl of yours, forbade the senate of the Roman people to
                        mourn for the setting and death of the republic. <milestone n="9" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>But a little time before, he even asked me what need I had of his assistance?
                        why I had not resisted my enemies with my own resources? Just as if not only
                        I who had often been of assistance to many others, but as if any one were
                        ever in so wholly desperate a condition as to consider himself not only
                        safer if he had that man for a protector but more ready for the struggle if
                        he had him only for an advocate or seconder. <milestone n="19" unit="section"/> Was I, forsooth, anxious to lean on the counsel or
                        protection of that piece of senseless cattle, of that bit of rotten flesh?
                        was I likely to seek for any support or ornament for myself from that
                        contemptible carcass? I suppose I was looking for a consul, I say, but one
                        (that I was not likely to find in that hog) who might uphold the cause of
                        the republic with his dignity and wisdom, not one who like a stock or like a
                        trunk of a tree, if he only stood upright, might maintain the title of
                        consul. For as the whole of my cause was the cause of a consul and of the
                        senate, I had need of the assistance of the <pb n="302"/> consul and senate;
                        one of which sources of aid was even turned by you when you were consuls to
                        my injury; the other was entirely suspended, if not abolished in the
                        republic. </p>
					<p>But if you ask what were my intentions; I would not have yielded, and the
                        republic should still have retained me in its embrace, if I had only had to
                        contend with contemptible gladiators,<note anchored="yes">The Latin is

                        your colleague. For the cause of that most admirable man Quintus Metellus
                        was a wholly different one; a citizen whom, in my opinion, I consider equal
                        in glory to the immortal gods; <milestone n="20" unit="section"/> who
                        thought it best for him to leave the city in order to avoid a contest with
                        Caius Marius&mdash;a most gallant man, a consul, yes, a man who had been
                        consul six times&mdash;and with his invincible legions. For what contest
                        like this lay before me? Should I have had to fight with Caius Marius or
                        with any one like him, or rather with one consul who was a sort of barbarian
                        Epicurus, and with the other, a mere hut-boy of Catiline's? I was not, in
                        truth, afraid of your supercilious looks, or of the cymbals and castanets of
                        your colleague; nor was I so nervous, after having guided the vessel of the
                        state amid the most terrible storms and billows of the republic, and placed
                        it safe in harbour, as to fear the little cloud which gathered on your brow,
                        or the polluted breath of your colleague. </p>
					<p>They were other gales which I beheld threatening; they were other storms
                        which my mind foresaw; <milestone n="21" unit="section"/> and I did not so
                        much yield to those other storms which were impending, but rather exposed
                        myself alone to them to secure the safety of all the rest of the citizens. </p>
					<p>Accordingly at that time, on my departure, all those wicked swords fell from
                        the hands of those most cruel men; when you, O senseless and insane

                        nefarious licentiousness, and civil bloodshed, and the foulness or every
                        sort of wickedness, and the impunity of every crime; and in the same temple,
                        at that very same time and in the very same place, you forbade the senate to
                        express its opinion not only on my destruction, but on that of their

					<p>Why need I speak of the banquets of those days, why of your joy and
                        self-congratulation, why of your most intemperate drinking-bouts with your
                        crew of infamous companions? Who in those days ever saw you sober, who ever
                        saw you doing any thing which was worthy of a freeman; who, in short, ever
                        saw you in public at all? while the house of your colleague was resounding
                        with song and cymbals, and while he himself was dancing naked at banquets;
                        in which even then, when he was going round in the circle of the dance, he
                        seemed to have no fear of any revolution of fortune. But this man, who is
                        not quite so refined in gluttony nor so musical, lay stupefied amid the
                        reeking orgies of his Greek crew. The banquets celebrated by that fellow at
                        the time of all this misery of the republic, resembled what is reported of
                        the feast of the Centaurs and Lapithae; and it is quite impossible to tell
                        in what sort of debauchery he indulged to the most disgraceful excess. </p>
					<p>Will you dare to make mention of your consulship? will you dare to say that
                        you ever were consul at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>?
                            <milestone n="23" unit="section"/> What? do you think that the
                        consulship consists in being attended by lictors and in wearing the <foreign lang="la">toga praetexta</foreign>? ornaments which, while you were
                        consul you wished to belong also to Sextus Clodius. And do you, O you dog of
                        Clodius's, think that the consulship consists wholly in the possession of
                        these insignia? A consul ought to be a consul in courage, in wisdom, in good
                        faith, in dignity, in vigilance, in prudence, in performing all the labours
                        and duties of the consulship, and above all things&mdash;as, indeed, the
                        name of the magistracy itself points out&mdash;in consulting the
                        interests of the republic. Am I to think that man a consul who thought that
                        the senate had no existence in the republic? and am I to account him a
                        consul, who takes no heed of that great council without which, even in the
                        time of the kingly power, the kings could not have any existence at

                        the remnant of the conspirators, and by the man who had once been a
                        pretended accuser of Catiline, but who now was seeking to be his avenger;
                        when Roman knights were being banished; when <pb n="353"/> virtuous men were
                        being driven with stones out of the forum; when the senate were prevented

                        might say that with truth), but certainly without your lifting up your voice
                        against it;&mdash;will any one believe that there were any consuls at

					<p>Great, O senators, is the name, great is the honour, great is the dignity,

					<p>But even then, O you impious Caesoninus, you did not emerge from the

                        of a most illustrious man quickly demanded the restoration of one who was

                        of the ancient customs and principles of the republic. Nor would that great

                        republic, which he himself had embellished and whose power he had extended.

                        at last with genuine ardour and vehemence, in support of Cnaeus Pompeius.
                        And in that spectacle the impartiality of the Roman people was very
                        admirable. It looked on like a master of gladiators, and whichever of them
                        perished, it thought would he an equal advantage to itself; but if both

                        the austerity of a most admirable man. He was himself a wicked man; he was a
                        mere ruffian and gladiator himself; but still he was fighting against one
                        who was as wicked and as much a gladiator and ruffian as himself. You,
                        forsooth, religious and conscientious man that you were, were reluctant to
                        violate the treaty which you had ratified in my blood concerning the bargain
                        made about the provinces. For that fellow, the adulterer with his own
                        sister, had made this bargain for himself, that if he gave you a province,
                        if he gave you an army, if he gave you money torn from the very life-blood
                        of the republic, you were to give yourself up to him as his partner and
                        assistant in all his crimes. Therefore, in that tumult the <foreign lang="la">fasces</foreign> were broken; you yourself were wounded; every
                        day there were weapons, stonings, and banishments. At last a man was
                        arrested close to the senate, armed with a sword, who it was notorious had

                        your colleague consuls at that time when, if you ever ventured to say one
                        word on any subject or to submit any motion whatever to the senate, the
                        whole body raised an outcry against you, and declared that you should do
                        nothing whatever till you had first made a motion <pb n="357"/> concerning
                        me and my affairs? and when you both, though in fact you were fettered by
                        your treaty with that man, still said that you were anxious to do so, but
                        that were hindered by the law? <milestone n="30" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>A law which even to private individuals seemed to be no law at all, having
                        been framed by slaves, posted up by violence, carried by piratical fury when
                        the senate was driven away when all virtuous men had been frightened from
                        the forum when the republic had been taken by storm in violation of all laws
                        whatever, and which was drawn up in violation of every precedent; were men
                        who said that they were afraid of that law, consuls? could, I will not say
                        the minds of men, but could any records or annals even style them such? For
                        even if you did not consider that a law, which was contrary to all law,
                        being the proscription by the mere power of a tribune of a citizen who had
                        never been condemned, and the deprivation of his rights and the confiscation
                        of his property, but nevertheless were held fast by the agreement which you
                        had made; who would consider you to have been then, not only consuls, but
                        even free men at all, when your minds were hampered by a bribe, your tongues
                        padlocked by wages? But if, on the other hand, you, being the only people in
                        the state who did so, did consider that a law; can any one think that you
                        were consuls then, or that you are men of consular rank now, you who are
                        ignorant of the laws, and principles, and usages, and rights of that state
                        in which you wish to be accounted some of the chief citizens? <milestone n="31" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>When you were going in your robes as generals into those&mdash;provinces
                        which you had (shall I say bought or stolen?) did any one consider you
                        consuls? Therefore, I imagine, even if men did abstain from escorting you on
                        your departure from the city with a numerous attendance to pay you a
                        compliment and do honour to you, at all events they followed you with their
                        good wishes as consuls, but with curses as enemies or traitors. <milestone n="14" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>Did you, O you most horrible and foul monster! dare also to speak of that
                        departure of mine,&mdash;that evidence or your wickedness and
                        cruelty,&mdash;as if it were a subject for your abuse and insult? And
                        when you did so, then, O conscript fathers, I received an immortal reward of
                        your attachment to, and favourable opinion of me,&mdash;when you crushed
                            <pb n="358"/> the frenzy and insolence of that abject and frightened
                        man, not only with a murmur, but with a loud and indignant outcry.
                            <milestone n="32" unit="section"/> Will you speak of the mourning of the
                        senate,&mdash;the regret of the equestrian order,&mdash;the
                        universal sadness of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>,&mdash;the silence of the senate-house, which lasted
                        the whole year,&mdash;the uninterrupted vacation of the courts of
                        justice and the forum,&mdash;and all the other circumstances of that
                        time, as grounds for abuse of me? They were the wounds which my departure
                        inflicted on the republic. And if my departure had been ever so full of
                        calamity, still it would have been deserving of pity rather than of insult;
                        and it would have been considered as connected with my glory rather than
                        with any reproach; and it would have been accounted my misfortune only, but
                        your crime and wickedness. </p>
					<p>But when,&mdash;(perhaps this thing which I am about to say may appear a
                        strange thing to you to hear, but still I will certainly say what I feel to
                        be true,)&mdash;when I, O conscript fathers, have had such kindnesses
                        and such honours conferred on me by you, I not only do not consider that a
                        calamity, but, if I could have any feeling whatever unconnected with the
                        interests of the republic, (which is hardly possible,) I should consider it,
                        as far as my private interests were concerned, a fortune greatly to be
                        wished for and desired by me. <milestone n="33" unit="section"/> And, if I
                        may compare that day which was most joyful to you with that one which was
                        most sorrowful to me, which do you think most desirable to a virtuous and
                        wise man,&mdash;to depart from his country in such a manner that all his
                        fellow-citizens pray for his safety, for his preservation, and for his
                        return, which happened to me; or, (which happened to you when you left the
                        city,) to depart in such a way that every one should curse him, should pray
                        for harm to him, and should wish that that road might be his only one? I
                        call the gods to witness, that if I were so hated by all
                        mortals,&mdash;especially if I were so justly and deservedly
                        hated,&mdash;I should think any banishment whatever preferable to any
                        province that could be given to me. <milestone n="15" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>But to proceed. If that most disturbed period, when I was forced to depart
                        from the city, is superior to the time of your greatest triumph, why need I
                        compare our other circumstances, which in your case were all full of
                        disgrace, and in mine of dignity? <milestone n="34" unit="section"/> On the

                        dawned on the republic after my setting and eclipse,&mdash;the senate,
                        in a very full house, amid a crowd gathered together from all <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, on the motion of a most illustrious
                        man, Publius Lentulus, with one voice and one consent pronounced my recall.
                        The same senate recommended me to all foreign nations, and to all our own
                        magistrates and lieutenants, by its authority and by letters under the hand
                        of the consuls, not (as you, you Insubrian, have dared to say) an exile from
                        my country, but (as the senate itself styled me at the very time) a citizen
                        who had been the saviour of the republic. The senate thought it right to
                        implore, by the voice and letters of the consul, the assistance of all the
                        citizens in all <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, who were
                        desirous of securing the safety of the republic to assist also in promoting
                        the safety of me, a single individual. For the sake of the preservation of
                        my life and rights, the whole of Italy assembled at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> at one time, as if in obedience to a
                        signal which had been given. <milestone n="35" unit="section"/> Concerning
                        my safety most magnificent and admirable speeches were made by Publius
                        Lentulus a most excellent man and a most admirable consul by Cnaeus
                        Pompeius, that most illustrious and invincible citizen, and by the other
                        leading men of the city, and concerning me the senate passed a resolution,
                        at the instigation and on the especial motion of Cnaeus Pompeius, that if
                        any one hindered my return in any manner, he should be considered as an
                        enemy of the state, and the authoritative opinion of the senate concerning
                        me was declared in such language that no triumph was ever decreed to any one
                        in a more complimentary or more honourable manner than that in which my
                        safety and restoration to my country was provided for. </p>
					<p>When all the magistrates had concurred in the law respecting me, with the

                        the brother of my great enemy, and with the exception also of two tribunes
                        of the people, who had been bought like slaves,<note anchored="yes">The

                            </quote></note> then Publius Lentulus the consul passed a law concerning

                        And why need I tell you how that law was received? I hear from you
                        yourselves that no pretext was admitted in the case of any one whatever as
                        sufficiently reasonable to excuse him from being present; that at no

                        either a more numerous or a more respectable number of men assembled; and
                        this I can certainly see for myself,&mdash;what the public records
                        prove,&mdash;that you were the movers of the vote, that you were the

                        of your own accord for the sake of ensuring my safety, though no one
                        requested you to do so, what, when the honours of your own relations are at
                        stake, you avoid doing under the plea either of your age, or of your rank.

					<p>Compare, now, my fine Epicurus, brought forward out of his sty, not out of

                        obtained a consular province with no other limitations than those which the
                        law of your covetousness, not the law of your son-in-law, had agreed upon.
                        For by that most just and admirable law of Caesar free nations were really
                        and truly free; but by that law which no one except you and your colleague
                        considered a law at all, all <placeName key="tgn,7002733">Achaia</placeName>, and <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>,

                        perform in this command, with this army, and in this consular province? I
                        ask, O conscript fathers, what exploits he performed. A man who, the moment
                        he arrived&mdash;(I am not yet speaking of his acts of rapine, I am not
                        yet speaking of the sums of money which he extorted, or seized, or levied,
                        nor of his slaughter of our allies, nor of his murders of his own friends,
                        nor of his perfidy, nor of his inhumanity, nor of his wicked actions:
                        presently, if you choose to hear me, I will argue with him as with a thief,
                        as with a robber of temples, as with an assassin; but for the present I am

                        letters recounting his achievements, to the senate? But who ever had so
                        important a province as that, with so splendid an army? who ever had

                        their province which were also the boundaries of their swords and
                        javelins,&mdash;without sending such letters? Letters! why, not only
                        several men who have had only praetorian authority have triumphed, but there
                        is not one single instance of any man who had exercised consular authority
                        in that province returning in health and vigour, without celebrating a
                        triumph for his achievements performed in that command. It is quite a new
                        thing; this which I am going to mention is newer still. This vulture of that

                        to write any letters to that body which you had treated with contempt, which
                        you had ill-treated, which you had sought to destroy, or whether your

                        condemnation of your rashness and audacity. And I do not know whether I
                        should not prefer that you should appear so utterly destitute of all shame
                        as to have sent the letters, and that your friends should appear to have had
                        more modesty and more sense than yourself, rather than that you should seem
                        to have had some little modesty, and that your conduct should not have been

                        the lands, and drain the private houses of his province, dared (for what

					<p>O ye immortal gods! Do you, do you,&mdash;you two whirlpools and rocks

                        to extol your own? when concerning me in my absence such resolutions of the
                        senate were passed, such speeches were delivered, such agitation pervaded
                        all the municipal towns and colonies, such votes were passed by all the
                        farmers of the revenue, by all the different guilds, by all ranks and
                        classes of the citizens, as I should not only never have dared to hope for,
                        but as I could not possibly hare dreamt of; and while you, on the other

                        there is no punishment imaginable, which, owing to some accident or other,
                        even virtuous and brave men may not have inflicted on them. And this is what
                        even your Greek followers of pleasure say; men whom I wish you would listen
                        to in the spirit in which they deserve to be listened to; you would <pb n="363"/> never have immersed yourself in such a vortex of wickedness.
                        But you listen to them in brothels, in scenes of adultery, in reveling and

					<p>But they themselves those very men who define evil by pain, and good by
                        pleasure say that the wise man even if he were shut up in Phalaris's bull
                        and roasted by fire being placed under him would still say that it was
                        pleasant and would not allow himself to be moved the least from his
                        assertion. They insist upon it that the power of virtue is so great that it
                        is absolutely impossible for a virtuous man ever to be otherwise than happy.
                            <milestone n="43" unit="section"/> What then is punishment? what is
                        chastisement? A thing which in my opinion, can happen to no one unless he is
                        guilty; it is dishonesty undertaken; it is a mind hampered and overwhelmed
                        by conscience; it is the hatred of all virtuous men; it is the deserved
                        brand of the senate; it is the loss of dignity. <milestone n="19" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>Nor does that illustrious man Marcus Regulus whom the Carthaginians, having
                        cut off his eyelids and bound him in a machine, killed by keeping him awake,
                        appear to have had punishment inflicted on him. Nor does Caius Marius whom
                            <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, which he had saved, saw
                        sunk in the marshes of <placeName key="perseus,Minturnae">Minturnae</placeName>, and whom <placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>, which he had subdued, beheld banished and
                        shipwrecked. For those were the wounds of fortune, not of guilt, but
                        punishment is the penalty of crime. Nor should I, if I were now to pray for
                        evils to fall upon you as I often have done (and indeed the immortal gods

                        a man of the most excessive virtue and piety and military glory was lost at

                        What is the cross? It is punishment that there should be two generals in the
                        provinces of the Roman people, that they should have armies, that they
                        should be styled &ldquo;<foreign lang="la">Imperator</foreign>,&rdquo; that one of them should be so completely
                        cowed by the consciousness of his crimes and of his atrocities, as not to

                        was of all others the richest in triumphs. From that province that man, so
                        distinguished for every sort of worth and dignity, Lucius Torquatus, was
                        returning, when on account of his mighty deeds he was, on my motion, styled

                        senate. In that province it was that those well-deserved triumphs of Cnaeus

                        few years; and from that while you were the commander, no messenger whatever
                        was ever sent to the senate. </p>

                        salvation of the republic, was with me when some one came and said that you
                        had been seen wandering not far from the gate with your house. I know, too,
                        that one of the very bravest of men, a man skillful both in war and in civil
                        business, an intimate friend of mine, Quintus Marcius, one of those

                        any one did, not even of that most officious body of candidates for office,
                        though they had been repeatedly warned and requested to do so, both on that

					<p>Short gowns were ready for the lictors at the gate, which they took, and laid
                        aside their military cloaks, and so formed a new crowd to escort their
                        chief. And in this manner he, the Macedonian &ldquo;<foreign lang="la">Imperator</foreign>,&rdquo; returning home from his mighty and from
                        his important province, after three years government, entered the city in

                        condition. And yet this is the very point on which (so ready is he to defend
                        himself) he finds fault with me. When I said that he had <pb n="369"/>
                        entered the city by the Caelimontane gate, that ever ready man wanted to lay

                        by what gate you had entered, as long as it was not by the triumphal one;
                        for that is the gate which had previously always been open for the
                        Macedonian proconsuls. You are the first person ever discovered who, having
                        been invested with consular authority there, did not triumph on your return

					<p>But you have heard, O conscript fathers, the voice of the philosopher. He has
                        said that he never had any desire for a triumph. O you wickedness! you pest!
                        you disgrace! when you were extinguishing the senate, and putting up for
                        sale the authority of this order&mdash;when you were knocking down your
                        own consulship to a tribune of the people, and overturning the republic, and
                        betraying my privileges as a citizen, and my safety, for the mere bribe of a
                        province,&mdash;if you then had no desire for a triumph, what is it that
                        you will allege in your defence that you did desire so ardently? For I have
                        often seen men, who appeared to me and to others to be over desirous of a
                        province, veil and excuse their desire under the pretence of eagerness for a
                        triumph. This is what Decimus Silanus the consul lately said before this
                        order,&mdash;this is what my colleague, too, stated. Nor is it possible
                        for any one to desire an army, and openly to demand one, without putting
                        forward as his pretext for such a demand his desire of a triumph. <milestone n="57" unit="section"/> But if the senate and people of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> had compelled you (when you did not
                        desire it, or though you even endeavoured to avoid it) to undertake a war
                        and to command an army still it would have been the act of a narrow and mean
                        spirit to despise the honour and dignity of a well earned triumph. For as it
                        is a proof of a trifling character to catch at such praise as is derived
                        from empty reports, and to hunt after all the shadows of even false glory;
                        so it is surely a sign of a very worthless disposition, of one that hates
                        all light and all respectability, to reject true glory, which is the most
                        honourable reward of genuine virtue. But when the senate was so far from
                        requesting and compelling you to take this charge upon you, that it was only
                        unwillingly and under compulsion that it allowed you to do <pb n="370"/> so;
                        when, not only did the Roman people betray no eagerness that you should do
                        so, but not one single freeman voted for it; when that province was your
                        wages for having, I will not say overturned, but utterly destroyed the
                        constitution, and when this covenant ran through all your wicked actions,
                        that if you handed over the whole republic to nefarious robbers, as a reward
                        for that conduct <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> should
                        be handed over to you with whatever boundaries you chose; when you were
                        draining the treasury, when you were depriving <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> of all its youth, when you were passing over the vast
                        sea in the winter season,&mdash;if you did at that time despise a
                        triumph, what was it, O you most insane of pirates, that urged you on,
                        unless it was some blind desire for booty and rapine? <milestone n="58" unit="section"/>

                        decreed to you by the senate? Publius Servilius, Quintus Metellus, Caius

                        of this most wise man, before falling into such blunders as you did? Even my

					<p>But since we cannot change what is already past, why does this mannikin, this

                        That man, believe me, is influenced by glory. He burns, he is on fire with

                        prevail with your son-in-law. For you will say to him like a man formed to
                        persuade as you are neat, accomplished, a polished specimen of the schools.

					<p>Turn to another school, and then speak thus of a triumph: &ldquo;What is

                        the silver? and of the lieutenants on horseback? and of the tribunes? What

                        universal hatred if you dare. The most carefully prepared and magnificent
                        games within the memory of man are just at hand, games such as not only
                        never have been exhibited, but such that we cannot form a conception how it
                        will he possible for any like them ever to be exhibited for the future.
                        Trust yourself to the people, venture on attending these games. Are you
                        afraid of hisses? Where are all the precepts of your schools? Are you afraid
                        that there will be no acclamations raised in your honour? Surely it does not
                        become a philosopher to regard even such a thing as that. You are <pb n="374"/> afraid that violent hands may be laid on you. For pain is an
                        evil, as you assert. The opinion which men entertain of you, disgrace,
                        infamy, baseness,&mdash;these are all empty words, mere trifles. But
                        about this I have no question. He will never dare to come near the games. He
                        will attend the public banquet not out of regard for his dignity, (unless,
                        perchance, for the purpose of supping with the conscript fathers,<note anchored="yes">There is great doubt about the text here.</note> that is
                        to say, with those men who love him,) but merely for the sake of gratifying
                        his appetite. <milestone n="66" unit="section"/> The games he will leave to
                        us idiots, as he calls us. For he is in the habit, in all his arguments, of

					<p>For though you have perhaps considered him previously only dishonest, cruel,
                        and a bit of a thief, and though he now appears to you also voracious, and
                        sordid, and obstinate, and haughty, and deceitful, and perfidious, and
                        imprudent, and audacious, know, too, that there is also nothing which is
                        more licentious, nothing more lustful, nothing more base, nothing more
                        wicked than this man. But do not think that it is mere luxury to which he is
                        devoted. <milestone n="67" unit="section"/> For there is a species of
                        luxury, though it is all vicious and unbecoming, which is still not wholly
                        unworthy of a well-born and a free man. But in this man there is nothing
                        refined, nothing elegant nothing exquisite; I will do justice even to an
                        enemy,&mdash;there is nothing which is even very extravagant, except his
                        lusts. There is no expense for works of carving. There are immense goblets,
                        and those (in order that he may not appear to despise his countrymen) made

                        cook is the same; his butler and porter the same. He has no baker at home,
                        no cellar. His bread and his wine came from some huckster and some low
                        wine-vault. His attendants are Greeks, five on a couch, often more. He is
                        used to sit by himself, and to drink as long as there was anything in the

					<p>Some one will say, &ldquo;How did you find out all <pb n="375"/>
                        this?&rdquo; I will not indeed, describe any one in such a manner as to
                        insult him, especially if he be an ingenious and learned man, a class with
                        whom I could not be angry, even if I wished it. There is a certain Greek who
                        lives with him, a man, to tell the truth, (I speak as I have found him,) of
                        good manners, at least as long as he is in other company than Piso's, or
                        while he is by himself. He, when he had met that man, as a young man, though
                        even then he had an expression of countenance as if he were angry with the
                        gods, did not disdain his friendship, as the other sought for it with great
                        eagerness; he gave himself up to intimacy with him, so as indeed to live
                        wholly with him, and I may almost say, never to depart from him. I am
                        speaking not before illiterate men, but, as I imagine, in a company of the
                        most learned and highly accomplished men possible. You have no doubt heard
                        it said, that the Epicurean philosophers measure everything which a man
                        ought to desire by pleasure;&mdash;whether that is truly said or not is
                        nothing to us, or if it be anything to us, it certainly has no bearing on
                        the present subject; but still it is a tempting sort of argument for a young
                        man, and one always dangerous to a person of no great intelligence. </p>
					<p><milestone n="69" unit="section"/> Therefore, that profligate fellow, the
                        moment that he heard that pleasure was so exceedingly praised by a
                        philosopher, inquired nothing further; he so excited all his own senses
                        which could be affected by pleasure, he neighed so on hearing this
                        statement, that it was plain he thought that he had discovered not a teacher
                        of virtue, but a pander to his lust. The Greek first began to distinguish
                        between those precepts, and to separate them from one another, and to show
                        in what sense they are uttered; but that cripple held the ball, as they say;
                        he was determined to retain what he had got; he would have witnesses, and
                        would have all the papers sealed up; he said, that Epicurus was an eloquent
                        man. And so he is; he says, as I conceive, that he cannot understand the
                        existence of any good when all the pleasures of the body are taken away. Why
                        need I say much on such a topic? <milestone n="70" unit="section"/> The
                        Greek is an easy man, and very complaisant; he had no idea of being too
                        contradictory to an &ldquo;<foreign lang="la">Imperator</foreign>&rdquo; of the Roman people. <milestone n="29" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>But the man of whom I am speaking is excessively accomplished, not in
                        philosophy alone, but also in general <pb n="376"/> literature, which they
                        say that the rest of the Epicureans commonly neglect. He composes a poem, so
                        witty, so neat, so elegant, that nothing can be cleverer. In respect of
                        which any one may find fault with him who pleases, provided he does so
                        good-humouredly, treating him not as a profligate, or a rascal, or a
                        desperado, but merely as a Greekling, as a flatterer, as a poet. He comes
                        to, or rather, I should say, he falls in with him, deceived by the same
                        rigid brow of his (being, too, a Greek and a stranger) as this wise and
                        great city was beguiled by. He could not withdraw when he had once become
                        entangled in his intimacy, and he was afraid also of getting the character
                        of being fickle. Being entreated, and invited, and compelled, he wrote so
                        many things which he addressed to him, so many things too about him, that he
                        has described in the most delicate poetry possible all the lusts of the man,
                        all his debaucheries, all his different suppers and revels, and even all his
                        adulteries. <milestone n="71" unit="section"/> And, in that poetry, any one
                        who pleases can see that fellow's way of life reflected as in a mirror. And
                        I would recite you much of it, which many men have read or heard, if I were
                        not afraid that even the kind of speech which I am indulging in at this
                        moment is at variance with the general usages of this place; and at the same
                        time, I do not wish to do any injury to the character of the man who wrote
                        it. </p>
					<p>For if he had had better fortune in getting a pupil, perhaps he might have
                        turned out a more strict and dignified man himself; but chance has led him
                        into a habit of writing in this manner, very unworthy of a philosopher; if
                        at least philosophy does, as is reported, comprehend the whole system of
                        virtue, and duty, and living properly; and a man who professes it appears to
                        me to have taken on himself a very serious and difficult character.
                            <milestone n="72" unit="section"/> But the same chance has polluted the
                        man, who was quite ignorant of what he was professing when he called himself
                        a philosopher, with the mud and filth of that fellow's most obscene and
                        intemperate flock. </p>
					<p>And when he had praised the achievements of my consulship, (and I feel that
                        the panegyric of that basest of men was almost a discredit to me myself,)
                        &ldquo;it was not,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;any odium that you
                        incurred by your conduct then, which injured you, but your
                        verses.&rdquo; It was too great a punishment that was established, I
                        trust, by you when you were consul, for a <pb n="377"/> poet, whether he
                        were a bad one, or too free an one. For you wrote&mdash;<quote>

                        </quote> What then?&mdash;&ldquo;This was what excited all that
                        storm against you.&rdquo; But I imagine that never was written in that
                        panegyric, which, while you were consul was engraved on the sepulchre of the
                        republic&mdash;&ldquo;May it please you, that because Marcus Cicero
                        has written a verse,...&rdquo; but because he punished the guilty.

					<p>But since we are to consider you not as Aristarchus, but as a sort of
                        grammatical Phalaris, a man who does not put a mark to a bad verse but who
                        pursues the poet with arms, I wish to know what fault you find with this
                        verse &ldquo;Arms to the gown must yield.&rdquo; &ldquo;You
                        say,&rdquo; says he &ldquo;that the greatest generals must yield to
                        the gown.&rdquo;Why now, you ass, am I to teach you letters? I do not
                        want words for such a purpose but a stick. I did not say <emph>this</emph>
                        gown, in which I am clothed, nor, when I said &ldquo;arms,&rdquo;
                        did I mean the sword and shield of any one particular general. But as the
                        gown is the emblem of peace and tranquillity, and arms on the contrary are a
                        token of disturbance and war, speaking after the manner of poets, I wished
                        this to be understood that war and tumult were to yield to peace and
                        tranquillity. <milestone n="74" unit="section"/> Ask your own intimate
                        friend, that Greek poet; he will recognise and approve of such a figure of
                        speech, and he will not wonder that you have no taste.
                        &ldquo;But&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I cannot digest that other
                        sentence either: <quote>
                            <l>The soldier's bays shall yield to true renown.</l>
                        </quote>&rdquo; Indeed, I am much obliged to you; for I, too, should
                        stick at that, if you had not released me. For when you, frightened and
                        trembling, threw down at the <placeName key="tgn,4012794">Esquiline</placeName> gate the bays which with your own most thievish
                        hands you had stripped off from your blood-stained <foreign lang="la">fasces</foreign>, you showed that those bays were granted not only to
                        the highest but even to the very paltriest degree of glory. </p>
					<p>And yet, by this argument you try, O you wretch, to make out that Pompeius
                        was made an enemy to me by that verse; so that, if my verse has injured me,
                        the injury may appear to have been sought for me by that man whom that verse
                        offended. <milestone n="75" unit="section"/> I say nothing of the fact, that
                        that verse had no reference <pb n="378"/> to him that it was not at all my

                        extolled in many speeches and writings. But grant that he was offended. In
                        the first place, will he not put in the scale against this one verse, the
                        many volumes full of his praises which have proceeded from me? And if he has
                        been moved by such a consideration, could he have countenanced so cruel an
                        injury (I will not say to his own dearest friend, to one who did not deserve
                        such treatment at his hands by the anxiety which he has shown for his glory,
                        nor at the hands of the republic; to a man of consular rank, to a senator,
                        to a citizen, or to a freeman, but) to any human being, on account of a

                        contending against men whom I despised; but that I was leaving those men

                        side; but that if the consuls were defending the republic in obedience to a
                        resolution of the senate, then he would take up arms. <milestone n="78" unit="section"/> Do you at all recollect you wretch, what answer you
                        gave? an answer at which all those men, but especially Torquatus above all,
                        were in a fury at the insolence of your reply, when you said that you were
                        not as brave as Torquatus had been in his consulship, or as I had been; that
                        there was no need of arms, nor of a contest; that it was in my power a
                        second time to save the republic by yielding to the storm; that there would
                        be endless bloodshed if I resisted; and at the last he said, that neither he
                        nor his son-in-law nor his colleague would desert the tribune of the people.
                        And now, you enemy and traitor, do you say that I ought to be a more
                        determined enemy to any one else than to you? <milestone n="32" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="79" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>I know well that Caius Caesar has not always had the same opinion about the
                        republic that I have; but nevertheless, as I have often said of him before,
                        in the hearing of these men, he communicated to me all his intentions during
                        the whole of his consulship, and he wished me to be his partner in all the
                        honours which he shared with his nearest friends; he offered them to me, he
                        invited, he entreated me to accept them. I was not brought over to his
                        party, perhaps out of too great a regard for my character for consistency; I
                        did not wish to be exceedingly beloved by him to whose kindnesses I would
                        never have given up my own opinion. While you were consul, the matter was
                        supposed to be disputed and to have come to a close contest, whether the
                        acts which he had carried the previous year should continue in force, or be
                        rescinded. Why need I say more on this subject? If he thought that there was
                        so much virtue, and vigour, and influence in me, that all the acts which he
                        had performed would be undone if <pb n="380"/> I opposed them, why should I
                        not excuse him if he preferred his own safety to mine? <milestone n="80" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>But I will say nothing of what is past. When Cnaeus Pompeius embraced my
                        cause with all his energies, using all his exertions, and encountering even
                        danger to his life for my sake; when he was going round to the municipal
                        towns to plead my cause, and was imploring the good faith of all <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>; when he was continually sitting by
                        Publius Lentulus, the consul, the author of my safety; when he was always
                        delivering his opinion to the senate, and when in all his harangues he was
                        not only professing himself the defender of my safety, but was descending
                        even to supplications in my behalf; he then took to himself as a companion
                        of and an assistant in his zeal for me, Caius Caesar, whom he knew to have
                        the very greatest influence, and to be no enemy of mine. You see now that I
                        am not an antagonist of yours, not an enemy to you; and that, as for those
                        men whom you hint at, I am bound not only not to be offended with them, but
                        to be a friend to them. One of them, and I will take care always to remember
                        it, has been as great a friend to me as to himself; the other, what I will
                        forget some day or other, certainly was more of a friend to himself than to
                        me. <milestone n="81" unit="section"/> But this is a common state of things,
                        that brave men, even after they have fought together in close combat sword
                        in hand, still lay aside the hostility engendered by the contest at the same
                        time that they cease from the battle itself, and lay down their arms. Nor,
                        indeed, was he ever able to hate me, not even when we were most at variance.
                        Virtue, which you do not even know by sight, has this quality, that its
                        appearance and beauty delight brave men even when existing in an enemy.

					<p>In truth, I will say sincerely, O conscript fathers, what I feel, and what I
                        have often said before in your hearing. If Caius Caesar had never been
                        friendly towards me; if he had always been hostile to me; if he had despised
                        my friendship, and had always shown himself implacable and irreconcilable
                        towards me; still I could not feel otherwise than friendly towards a man who
                        had performed and was daily performing such mighty actions. Now that he is
                        in command, I no longer oppose and array the rampart of the <placeName key="tgn,2066659">Alps</placeName> against the ascent and crossing of
                        the Gauls, nor the channel of the <placeName key="tgn,7012611">Rhine</placeName>, foaming with its vast whirlpools, to those most
                        savage <pb n="381"/> nations of the Germans. <milestone n="82" unit="section"/> Caesar has brought things to such a pass, that even if
                        the mountains were to sink down, and the rivers to be dried up, we should
                        still have <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> fortified, not
                        indeed, by the bulwarks of nature, but by his victory and great exploits.
                        But as he courts me, and loves me, and thinks me worthy of every sort of
                        praise, will you call me off from my enmity against you to a quarrel with
                        him? Will you thus reopen the past wounds of the republic by your
                        enormities? Which, indeed, you, who were well acquainted with the union
                        subsisting between Caesar and me, sought to elude, when you asked
                        me,&mdash;with trembling lips, indeed, but still you did ask
                        me,&mdash;why I did not proceed against you? Although, as far as I am concerned&mdash;<quote>

                        I must consider how much anxiety and how great a burden I, being exceedingly

                        affairs of the republic, and with so formidable a war. </p>
					<p>Nor do I despair, though the youth of the city is indolent, and does not
                        concern itself with the desire of praise and glory as it should, that there
                        will be some men who will not be unwilling to stop this prostrate carcass of
                        its consular spoils, especially in the case of so contemptible, and
                        powerless, and helpless a criminal in the case of you who have behaved in
                        such a manner that you have been afraid of appearing utterly unworthy of

					<p>Do you imagine that we have inquired in only a cursory manner into the
                        disgraces incurred during your command, and into the losses suffered by the

                        left your print. Everything has been noted by us, both the very first crimes
                        which you committed on your arrival, when, having received money from the
                        people of <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Dyrrachium</placeName> for the murder
                        of Plato; who was connected with you by ties of hospitality, you <pb n="382"/> destroyed the house of the man to whose murder you had sold yourself:
                        when, after you had accepted from him some musical slave and other presents,
                        he was still alarmed and hesitated a good deal, you assured him with
                        promises, and desired him to come to <placeName key="tgn,7011182">Thessalonica</placeName> on the security of your good faith. <milestone n="84" unit="section"/> And at last you did not even put him to death
                        according to the custom of our ancestors, when that miserable man was
                        willing to place his neck beneath the axe of his hereditary friend, but you
                        ordered the physician whom you had brought with you to open his veins. After
                        that, you added to the murder of Plator, that of Pleuratus, his companion,
                        whom you put to death by scourging, being a man of extreme old age. After
                        that, you are put to death by the hand of the executioner, Rabocentus, a
                        prince of the Bessic tribe, having sold yourself to do this to king Cottus,
                        for three hundred talents. And you did not murder him alone, but all the
                        other ambassadors also who had come with him, all whose lives you sold to
                        king Cottus. You waged a wicked and cruel war against the Denseletae, a
                        nation which has at all times been obedient to this empire, and which even
                        at the time of that general defection of all the barbarians, preserved
                            <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> for us, when Caius
                        Sentius was praetor. And though you might have had that people for your most
                        faithful allies, you preferred to treat them as our most bitter enemies.
                        Thereby you made those who might have been the perpetual defenders of
                            <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, desirous to harass
                        and destroy it. They have thrown our revenues into confusion, they have
                        taken our cities, laid waste our lands, led away cur allies into slavery,
                        carried off whole families, driven off our cattle, and compelled the people
                        of <placeName key="tgn,7011182">Thessalonica</placeName>, as they despaired

					<p>It was by you that the temple of Jupiter Urius, the most ancient and the most
                        venerated of all the temples of the barbarians, was plundered. They are your
                        crimes which the immortal gods have been avenging on our soldiers; for when
                        they were all attacked by one kind of disease, and when no one who had once
                        fallen sick was found to recover, no one had any doubt that it must have
                        been the insults offered to men connected with us by ties of hospitality,
                        and the murder of ambassadors, and the attacking of peaceful and allied
                        tribes with wanton and wicked war, and the plundering of temples, <pb n="383"/> which were the causes of this great destruction. You can
                        recognise in such brief particulars as these the universal nature of your

                        reduced them, nor the torrent of their complaints, you fled away to

                        to be appointed your successor had elated your mind with false hopes, while
                        you were in that town, you again, O wretched man, gave the rein to all your

					<p>I say nothing of the gold for a crown, which tormented you a long time, while
                        at one time you were inclined towards it and at another time unwilling to
                        take it. For the law of your son-in-law forbade it to be decreed or to be
                        accepted, unless a triumph was also decreed. But nevertheless you, in
                        respect of that gold, could not find in your heart to disgorge the money
                        which you had received and devoured, as in the case of the hundred talents
                        of the Achaeans; you only changed the names and descriptions of the pretexts
                        under which you extracted the money. I say nothing of the commissions which
                        you scattered at random over the provinces; I say nothing of the number of
                        vessels, or of the sum total of the plunder you acquired; I say nothing of
                        the system under which you levied and extorted all the corn; I say nothing
                        of your having stripped both nations and individuals of their liberties,
                        even though they had had those liberties given them by name as rewards, not
                        one of all which things is not carefully provided against and expressly
                        forbidden to be done by the Sullan law. <milestone n="91" unit="section"/>

                        cities were taken by the enemy. And by what enemies? Why, by those whom you,
                        while encamped at Ambracia, on your first arrival, compelled to depart from
                        the towns of the Agrinae and of the Dolopes, and to leave their altars and
                        their homes. But now, on this departure of yours, O you illustrious
                            &ldquo;<foreign lang="la">Imperator</foreign>&rdquo; though the
                        sudden destruction of Aetolia was no trifling addition to your previous
                        disasters,&mdash;you disbanded your army; nor was there any punishment
                        which could be considered due to such guilt as yours <pb n="385"/> which you
                        were not willing to undergo, rather than allow any one to become acquainted

					<p>And, that you, O conscript fathers, may see how great is the resemblance
                        between the two Epicurean generals in their military exploits and management
                        of their command; Albucius, after he had triumphed in Sardinia, was
                        condemned at Rome. And as this man expected a similar end to his campaigns,
                        he laid aside his trophies in Macedonia; and those things which all nations
                        have agreed in considering the insignia and monuments of military glory and
                        victory, this extraordinary &ldquo;<foreign lang="la">Imperator</foreign>&rdquo; of ours made the fatal evidences of
                        towns which had been lost of legions which had been cut to pieces, of a
                        province stripped of its garrison and of all the rest of its troops, to the
                        everlasting disgrace of his family and name; and then, in order that there
                        should to something which might be recorded and engraved on the pedestal of
                        his trophies, when, on his departure from his province, he arrived at
                        Dyrrachium, he was besieged by those very soldiers whom he told Torquatus
                        just now, in answer to his questions, had been disbanded by him out of
                        kindness. </p>
					<p>And when he had assured them with an oath that he would pay them the next day
                        all that was due to them, he hid himself at home; and then on a very stormy
                        night, in slippers and in the garb of a slave, he embarked on board a ship,
                        and avoided Brundusium, and sailed towards the furthest part of the coast of
                        the Adriatic Sea; <milestone n="93" unit="section"/> while, in the meantime,
                        the soldiers at Dyrrachium began to besiege the house in which they thought
                        that he was, and as they thought that he was hiding himself there, they
                        began to set fire to it. And the people of Dyrrachium, being alarmed at that
                        proceeding, told them that their &ldquo;<foreign lang="la">Imperator</foreign>&rdquo; had fled away by night in his slippers.
                        Then the troops displace, and throw down, and deface, and destroy a statue
                        of his, an excellent likeness of him, which he had caused to be erected in
                        the most frequented place, that the recollection of so delightful a man
                        might not perish; and in this way they expended on his likeness and on his

                        exhortation or by invitation. It is quite enough for me to be reminded. And
                        no one and nothing will remind me except the critical occasions of the
                        republic which appear to me indeed to be more immediately pressing than you
                        have ever thought. <milestone n="39" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>Do you not in the least see or perceive what sort of judges we are going to
                        have for the future when the law regulating the courts of justice is passed?
                        Then it will not be the case that every one who likes will be appointed and
                        that every one who has any objection will be excused. No men will be thrust
                        into the order of judges no one will be irregularly removed from it.
                        Ambition will not be allowed to work its way to popularity, nor wickedness
                        to gratify its enmity, by that means. Those will be the judges whom the law
                        itself, not those whom the depraved caprices of men appoint. And as this is
                        the case believe me you will not have need to demand a prosecutor against
                        your will. The case itself, or the necessities of the republic will either
                        call forth me myself&mdash;which I should be sorry for&mdash;or some
                        one else, or will repress us. <milestone n="95" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>In truth, as I said a little time ago, I do not think that the same things
                        are punishments to men which most people consider such, namely condemnation,
                        banishment, or death. Lastly, it seems to me that that which may happen to
                        an innocent, or to a brave or to a wise or to a virtuous man and citizen,
                        cannot be a punishment in the proper sense of the word. That condemnation
                        which is now demanded to be inflicted on you, befell Publius Rutilius, a man
                        whom this city accounted a pattern of innocence. Lucius Opimius was driven
                        from his country&mdash;he who, as praetor and consul, had delivered the
                        republic from the greatest dangers. The punishment of guilt and of the
                        consciousness of it, did not belong to the man to whom the injury was done,
                        but to those who did it. But on the other hand, Catiline was twice
                        acquitted; even that man who was the cause of your obtaining your province
                        was acquitted after he had profaned the sacred rites of the Good Goddess.
                        But who was there in all this city who thought that he was released from the
                        guilt of impiety, and <pb n="388"/> not that those who acquitted him were,
                        by their sentence, made accomplices in his wickedness? <milestone n="40" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="96" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>Am I to wait while seventy-five voting tablets are distributed in your case;
                        when all men of all classes and ages and ranks of society have long since

                        deserving of a visit; or of any compliment or even of an ordinary
                        salutation? All men wish to efface all recollection of your consulship, to
                        extirpate your conduct, your habits, your very appearance and name from the
                        republic. The lieutenants who were with you are alienated from you, the
                        military tribunes are hostile to you; the centurions and any other soldiers
                        who may be left out of that once numerous army, and who were not disbanded
                        by you but scattered abroad, hate you, wish for calamities to befall you,
                        execrate you. Achaia which has been drained by you, Thessaly which has been
                        harassed by you, Athens which has been plundered by you, Dyrrachium and
                        Apollonia which have been completely emptied by you, Ambracia which has been
                        pillaged by you, the Parthinians and Bulliensians who have been mocked by
                        you, Epirus which has been laid waste by you, the Locrians, the Phocians,
                        the Boeotians whom you have ravaged with fire and sword, Acarnania,
                        Amphilochia, Perrhaebia, and the nation of the Athamanes who have been sold
                        by you, Macedonia which has been sacrificed by you to the barbarians,
                        Aetolia which has been lost, the Dolopians and the neighbouring mountaineers
                        who have been driven from their towns and from their lands, the Roman
                        citizens who have dealings as merchants in those countries,&mdash;all
                        feel that you came among them as their chief despoiler, and harasser, and
                        robber, and enemy. </p>
					<p><milestone n="97" unit="section"/> To all these numerous and weighty opinions

                        sentence of condemnation which you have passed upon yourself. Your secret
                        arrival, your stealthy journey through Italy, your entry into the city
                        deserted by your friends;&mdash;the fact of your sending no letters to
                        the senate, of your addressing no congratulation to them on successes
                        achieved by you during the whole of three summer campaigns, of your making
                        no mention of any triumph;&mdash;you do not only omit to say what you
                        did, but you do not even dare to say where you were. </p>
					<p>When you had brought back the dry withered leaves of <pb n="389"/> your
                        laurels from that fountain and seed-ground of triumphs, when you threw them
                        down and left them at the gate, then you yourself gave your verdict against
                        yourself, and pronounced yourself &ldquo;guilty.&rdquo; And if you
                        had done nothing deserving of honour, what had become of your army? where
                        was the need for all that expense? what did you want with a military
                        command? why did you seek for that province so fruitful in supplications and
                        triumphs? But if you had ventured to cherish hopes of anything,&mdash;if
                        you had nourished the thoughts which the name of &ldquo;<foreign lang="la">Imperator</foreign>,&rdquo; the <foreign lang="la">fasces</foreign> bound with laurel, and those trophies so full of
                        disgrace and ridicule to you, show that you had entertained,&mdash;who
                        can be more miserable, who more thoroughly condemned than you, who neither

                        had been prosperously conducted by you, nor dare to say as much when you are

					<p>Do you think that you can possibly appear to be anything but a condemned man
                        to me, who have always been of opinion that a man's fortune was to be
                        estimated by his actions themselves, and not by their results, and that our
                        character and our fortunes depended not on the voting tablets of a few
                        judges, but on the opinions and judgments of all the citizens? when I see
                        that the allies, and the people of the federate states, and all free
                        nations, and all the tributary peoples, and the merchants, and the farmers
                        of the public revenue, and the whole population of the city, and the

                        disease, think you worthy of every extremity of punishment? when no excuse
                        can be possibly alleged either before the senate, or before any order of men
                        whatever, or before the Roman knights, or in the city, or in any part of
                        Italy, sufficient to induce any one to pardon your enormous crimes? when I
                        see that even you yourself hate yourself, and are afraid of everybody, and
                        can find no one to whom you can venture to entrust your cause, and by your

                        looking with despair on your prospects, and abandoned even by yourself;
                        looking timidly around at every noise which sounded near you; trembling at
                        everything; distrusting the continuance of even your present safety, such as
                        it is; not daring to utter a word; deprived of all liberty, destitute of all
                        authority, stripped of all the dignity of a consul and of a man of consular
                        rank; shivering, trembling, and fawning on all men. And I have seen you.
                        Wherefore, if that future befalls you which you are in hourly apprehension
                        of, I shall be in no respect concerned at it; if it is even a long while
                        coming, still I shall enjoy the indignities to which you are exposed; and I

					<head>THE SPEECH OF M. T. CICERO IN DEFENCE OF TITUS ANNIUS MILO.</head>
					<argument>
						<head>THE ARGUMENT.</head>
						<p>Titus Annius Milo, often in the following speech called only Titus
                            Annius, stood for the consulship while Clodius was a candidate for the
                            praetorship, and daily quarrels took place in the streets between their
                            armed retainers and gladiators. Milo, who was dictator of Lanuvium, his
                            native place, was forced to go there to appoint some priests, etc.; and
                            Clodius, who had been to Aricia, met him on his road. Milo was in his
                            carriage with his wife, and was accompanied by a numerous retinue, among
                            whom were same gladiators. Clodius was on horseback, with about thirty
                            armed men. The followers of each began to fight, and when the tumult had
                            become general, Clodius was slain, probably by Milo himself. The
                            disturbances at Rome became so formidable that Pompey was created sole
                            consul; and soon after he entered on his office, A.U.C. 702, Milo was
                            brought to trial. This speech, however, though composed by Cicero, was
                            not spoken, for he was so much alarmed by the violence of Clodius's
                            friends, that he did not dare to use the plain language he had proposed.
                            Milo was convicted and banished to Marseilles.</p>

					<p>For those guards which you behold in front of all the temples, although they

                        although we are protected with all military and necessary defences, yet we

                        the assemblies because he always espoused the cause of the good against the
                        bad; but in a court of justice, and in that council in which the most
                        honourable men of all ranks are sitting as judges, I never imagined that
                        Milo's enemies could have any hope of diminishing his glory by the aid of

                        against this accusation, unless you see with your own eyes that a plot was
                        laid against Milo by Clodius; and we shall not entreat you to pardon us this

                        you, O judges, that, if we have lost everything else, this at least may be

					<p>But before I come to that part of my speech which especially belongs to this
                        trial, it seems necessary to refute those things which have been often said,
                        both in the senate by our enemies, and in the assembly of the people by
                        wicked men, and lately, too, by our prosecutors; so that when every cause of
                        alarm is removed, you may be able distinctly to see the matter which is the
                        subject of this trial. They say that that man ought no longer to see the
                        light who confesses that another man has been slain by him. In what city,
                        then, are these most foolish men using this argument? In this one, forsooth,
                        where the first trial for a man's life that took place at all was that of
                        Marcus Horatius, a most brave man, who even before the city was free was yet
                        acquitted by the assembly of the Roman people, though he avowed that his
                        sister had been slain by his hand. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>Is there any one who does not know, that when inquiry is made into the
                        slaying of a man, it is usual either altogether to deny that the deed has
                        been done, or else to defend it on the ground that it was rightly and
                        lawfully done? unless, indeed, you think that Publius Africanus was out of
                        his mind, who, when he was asked in a seditious spirit by Caius Carbo, a
                        tribune of the people, what was his opinion of the death of Tiberius
                        Gracchus, answered that he seemed to have been rightly slain. For neither
                        could Servilius Ahala, that eminent man, nor Publius Nasica, nor Lucius
                        Opimius, nor Caius Marius, nor indeed the senate itself during my
                        consulship, have been accounted anything but wicked, if it was unlawful for
                        wicked citizens to be put to death. And therefore, O judges, it was not
                        without good reason, that even in legendary fables learned men have handed
                        down the story, that he, who for the sake of avenging his father had killed
                        his mother, when the opinions of men varied, was acquitted not <pb n="394"/>
                        only by the voices of the gods, but even by the very wisest goddess.
                            <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> And if the Twelve Tables have
                        permitted that a nightly robber may be slain any way, but a robber by day if
                        he defends himself, with a weapon, who is there who can think a man to be
                        punished for slaying another, in whatever way he is slain, when he sees that
                        sometimes a sword to kill a man with is put into our bands by the very laws
                        themselves? <milestone n="4" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>But if there be any occasion on which it is proper to slay a
                        man,&mdash;and there are many such,&mdash;surely that occasion is
                        not only a just one, but even a necessary one, when violence is offered, and
                        can only be repelled by violence. When a military tribune offered violence
                        to a soldier in the army of Caius Marius, the kinsman of that commander was
                        slain by the man whom he was insulting; for the virtuous youth chose to act
                        though with danger, rather than to suffer infamously; and his illustrious
                        commander acquitted him of all guilt, and treated him well. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> But what death can be unjust when inflicted on a
                        secret plotter and robber? </p>
					<p>What is the meaning of our retinues, what of our swords? Surely it would
                        never be permitted to us to have them if we might never use them. This,
                        therefore, is a law, O judges, not written, but born with
                        us,&mdash;which we have not learnt or received by tradition, or read,
                        but which we have taken and sucked in and imbibed from nature herself; a law
                        which we were not taught but to which we were made,&mdash;which we were
                        not trained in, but which is ingrained in us,&mdash;namely, that if our
                        life be in danger from plots, or from open violence, or from the weapons of
                        robbers or enemies, every means of securing our safety is honourable.
                            <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> For laws are silent when arms are
                        raised, and do not expect themselves to be waited for, when he who waits
                        will have to suffer an undeserved penalty before he can exact a merited
                        punishment. </p>
					<p>The law very wisely, and in a manner silently, gives a man a right to defend
                        himself, and does not merely forbid a man to be slain, but forbids any one
                        to leave a weapon about him with the object of slaying a man; so that as the
                        object and not the weapon itself, is made the subject of the inquiry, the
                        man who had used a weapon with the object of defending himself would be
                        decided not to have had his weapon about him with the object of killing a
                        man. Let, then, this principle <pb n="395"/> remembered by you in this
                        trial, O judges; for I do not doubt that I shall make good my defence before
                        you, if you only remember&mdash;what you cannot forget&mdash;that a
                        plotter against one may be lawfully slain. <milestone n="5" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="12" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>The next point is one which is often asserted by the enemies of Milo, who say
                        that the senate has decided that the slaughter by which Publius Clodius fell
                        was contrary to the interests of the republic. But, in fact, the senate has
                        approved, not merely by their votes, but even zealously. For how often has
                        that cause been pleaded by us in the senate? with what great assent of the
                        whole body? and that no silent nor concealed assent; for when in a very full
                        senate were there ever four or five men found who did not espouse Milo's
                        cause? Those lifeless assemblies of this nearly burnt<note anchored="yes">After Clodius's death, Munatius Plancus the tribune exposed his body on

                            in doing which they burnt the senate house, and Plancus himself with

                        assemblies in which he daily used to try and bring my power into
                        unpopularity, by saying that the senate did not pass its decrees according
                        to what it thought itself, but as I chose. </p>
					<p>And if, indeed, that ought to be called power, rather than a moderate
                        influence in a righteous cause on account of great services done to the
                        republic, or some popularity among the good on account of dutiful labours
                        for its sake, let it be called so, as long as we employ it for the safety of
                        the good in opposition to the madness of the wicked. </p>
					<p>
                        <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> But this investigation though it is not
                        an unjust one, yet is not one which the senate thought ought to be ordered,
                        for there were regular laws and forms of trial for murder or for assault;
                        nor did the death of Publius Clodius cause the senate such concern and
                        sorrow that any new process of investigation need have been appointed for
                        when the senate had had the power of decreeing a trial in the matter of that
                        impious pollution of which he was guilty taken from it, who can believe it
                        thought it necessary to appoint a new form of trial about his death? Why
                        then did the senate decide that this burning of the senate house, this siege
                        laid to the house of Marcus Lepidus, and this very homicide had taken place
                        contrary to the interest <pb n="396"/> of the republic? Why, because no
                        violence from one citizen to another can ever take place in a free state
                        which is not contrary to the interests of the republic. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> For the defending of oneself against violence is never
                        a thing to be wished for; but it is sometimes necessary, unless, indeed, one
                        could say that that day on which Tiberius Gracchus was slain, or that day
                        when Caius was, or the day when the arms of Saturninus were put down, even
                        if they ended as the welfare of the republic demanded, were yet no wound and

                        place on the Appian road, not that he who had defended himself had acted in
                        a manner contrary to the interests of the republic; but as there was
                        violence and treachery in the business, I reserved the charge for trial, I
                        expressed my disapprobation of the business. And if the senate had not been
                        hindered by that frantic tribune from executing its wishes, we should not
                        now have this novel trial. For the senate voted that an extraordinary
                        investigation should take place according to the ancient laws. A division
                        took place, it does not signify on whose motion, for it is not necessary to
                        mention the worthlessness of every one, and so the rest of the authority of
                        the senate was destroyed by this corrupt intercession. </p>
					<p><milestone n="15" unit="section"/> &ldquo;Oh, but Cnaeus Pompeius, by his
                        bill, gave his decision both about the fact and about the cause. For he
                        brought in a bill about the homicide which had taken place on the Appian
                        road, in which Publius Clodius was slain.&rdquo; What then did he
                        propose? That an inquiry should be made. What is to be inquired about?
                        Whether it was committed? That is clear. By whom? That is notorious. He saw
                        that a defence as to the law and right could be undertaken, even at the very
                        moment of the confession of the act. But if he had not seen that he who
                        confessed might yet be acquitted, when he saw that we did not confess the
                        fact he would never have ordered an investigation to take place, nor would
                        he have given you at this trial the power<note anchored="yes">Literally,
                            &ldquo;this wholesome letter, as well as that melancholy

                        Pompeius not only delivered no decision at all unfavourable to Milo, but
                        that he also pointed out what you ought to turn your attention to in
                        deciding. For he who did not assign a punishment to the confession, but
                        required a defence of it, he clearly thought that what was inquired into was
                        the cause of the death and not the mere fact of the death <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> Now he himself shall tell us whether what he did of his
                        own accord was done out of regard for Publius Clodius, or from a compliance

					<p>A most noble man, a bulwark, and in those times, indeed, almost a protector
                        of the senate, the uncle of this our judge, of that most fearless man Marcus
                        Cato, Marcus Drusus, a tribune of the people, was slain in his own house.
                        The people had never any reference made to them in the matter of his death,
                        no investigation was voted by the senate. What great grief was there, as we
                        have heard from our forefathers in this city, when that attack was made by
                        night on Publius Africanus, while sleeping in his own house! Who was there
                        then who did not groan, who did not burn with indignation, that men should
                        not have waited even for the natural and inevitable death of that man whom,
                        if possible, all would have wished to be immortal? </p>
					<p>Was there then any extraordinary investigation into the death of
                            Africanus<note anchored="yes">After the death of Tiberius Gracchus,
                            Publius Aemilianus Africanus Scipio, the conqueror of Carthage and
                            Numantia, was know a to be hostile to the agrarian law and threw every
                            obstacle in the way of it; his enemies gave out that he intended to
                            abrogate it by force. One morning he was found dead in his bed without a
                            wound. The cause and manner of his death were unknown; some said it was
                            natural; some that he had slain himself; some, that his wife Sempronia,
                            the sister of Gracchus, had strangled him. His slaves it was said
                            declared that some strangers had been introduced into the house at the
                            back who had strangled him, and the triumvir Carbo is generally believed
                            to have been the chief agent in his murder and is expressly mentioned as
                            the murderer by <bibl n="Cic. Q.fr. 2.3.1">Cicero, Ep. ad Q. Fr.
                                2.3</bibl>.</note> voted? Certainly none. Why so? <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> Because the crime of murder is not different when
                        eminent men, or when obscure ones are slain. Let there be a difference
                        between the dignity of the lives of the highest and lowest citizens. If
                        their death be wrought by wickedness, that must be avenged by the same laws
                        and punishments in either case; unless, indeed, he is more a parricide who
                        murders a father <pb n="398"/> of consular rank than he who murders one of
                        low degree; or, as if the death of Publius Clodius is to be more criminal
                        because he was slain among the monuments of his ancestors,&mdash;for
                        this is constantly said by that party; as if, I suppose, that illustrious
                        Appius Caecus made that road, not that the nation might have a road to use,
                        but that his own posterity might have a place in which to rob with impunity.
                            <milestone n="18" unit="section"/> Therefore in that same Appian road,
                        when Publius Clodius had slain a most accomplished Roman knight, Marcus
                        Papirius, that crime was not to be punished; for a nobleman among his own
                        family monuments had slain a Roman knight. Now what tragedies does the name
                        of that same Appian road awaken? which, though nothing was said about it
                        formerly, when stained with the murder of an honourable and innocent man, is
                        now incessantly mentioned ever since it has been dyed with the blood of a
                        robber and a parricide. But why do I speak of these things? A slave of
                        Publius Clodius was arrested in the temple of Castor; whom he had placed
                        there to murder Cnaeus Pompeius; the dagger was wrested from his hands and
                        he confessed his design; after that Pompeius absented himself from the
                        forum, absented himself from the senate, and from all public places; he
                        defended himself within his own doors and walls, not by the power of the
                        laws and tribunals. </p>

                        <milestone n="19" unit="section"/> Was any motion made? was any
                        extraordinary investigation voted? But if any circumstance, if any man, if
                        any occasion was ever important enough for such a step, certainly all these
                        things were so in the greatest degree in that cause. The assassin had been
                        stationed in the forum, and in the very vestibule of the senate. Death was
                        being prepared for that man on whose life the safety of the senate depended.
                        Moreover, at that crisis of the republic, when, if he alone had died, not
                        only this state, but all the nations in the world would have been ruined,
                        &mdash;unless, indeed, the crime was not to be punished because it was
                        not accomplished, just as if the execution of crimes was chastised by the
                        laws, and not the intentions of men,&mdash;certainly there was less
                        cause to grieve, as the deed was not accomplished, but certainly not a whit
                        the less cause to punish. <milestone n="20" unit="section"/> How often, O
                        judges, have I myself escaped from the weapons and from the bloody hands of
                        Publius Clodius! But if my good fortune, or that of the republic, had not
                            <pb n="399"/> preserved me from them, who would have proposed any
                        investigation into my death <milestone n="8" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>But it is foolish of us to dare to compare Drusus, Africanus, Pompeius or
                        ourselves with Publius Clodius. All these things were endurable. The death
                        of Publius Clodius no one can bear with equanimity. The senate is in
                        mourning; the knights grieve, the whole state is broken down as if with age;
                        the municipalities are in mourning, the colonies are bowed down; the very
                        fields even regret so beneficent, so useful, so kind hearted a citizen!
                            <milestone n="21" unit="section"/> That was not the cause, O judges, it
                        was not indeed why Pompeius thought an investigation ought to be proposed by
                        him; but being a man wise and endowed with lofty and almost divine
                        intellect, he saw many things, that Clodius was his personal enemy, Milo his
                        intimate friend; he feared that if he were to rejoice in the common joy of
                        all men the belief in his reconciliation with Clodius would be weakened. He
                        saw many other things, too, but this most especially,&mdash;that in
                        whatever terms of severity he proposed the motion, still you could decide
                        fearlessly. Therefore he selected the very lights of the most eminent ranks
                        of the state. He did not, indeed as some are constantly saying, exclude my
                        friends in selecting the tribunal; for neither did that most just man think
                        of this, nor, when he was selecting good men, could he have managed to do
                        so, even had he wished for my influence would not be limited by my
                        intimacies which can never be very extensive, because one cannot associate
                        habitually with many people, but, if we have any influence, we have it on
                        this account, because the republic has associated us with the virtuous; and
                        when he was selecting the most excellent of them, and as he thought that it
                        especially concerned his credit to do so, he was unable to avoid selecting
                        men who were well disposed towards me. </p>

                        <milestone n="22" unit="section"/> But as for his especially appointing you,
                        O Lucius Domitius, to preside over this investigation, in that he was
                        seeking nothing except justice, dignity, humanity and good faith. He passed
                        a law that it must be a man of consular dignity, because, I suppose, he
                        considered the duty of the men or the highest rank to resist both the
                        fickleness of the multitude and the rashness of the profligate; and of the
                        men of consular rank he selected you above all; for from your earliest youth
                            <pb n="400"/> you had given the most striking proofs how you despised

					<p>Wherefore, O judges, that we may at last come to the subject of action and
                        the accusation, if it is neither the case that all avowal of the deed is
                        unprecedented, nor that anything has been determined about our cause by the
                        senate differently to what we could wish; and if the proposer of the law
                        himself, when there was no dispute as to the deed, yet thought that there
                        should be a discussion as to the law; and if the judges had been chosen, and
                        a man appointed to preside over the investigation, to decide these matters
                        justly and wisely; it follows, O judges, that you have now nothing else to
                        inquire into but which plotted against the other; and that you may the more
                        easily discern this, attend carefully, I entreat you, while I briefly
                        explain to you the matter as it occurred. </p>

                        before, that he would not be able to continue his praetorship many months,
                        as he had no regard to the degree of honour, as others have, but both wished
                        to avoid having Lucius Paullus, a citizen of singular virtue, for his
                        colleague, and also to have an entire year to mangle the republic; on a
                        sudden he abandoned his own year, and transferred himself to the next year,
                        not from any religious scruple, but that he might have, as he said himself,
                        a full and entire year to act as praetor, that is, to overthrow the

                        <milestone n="25" unit="section"/> It occurred to him that his praetorship
                        would be crippled and powerless, if Milo was consul; and, moreover, he saw
                        that he was being made consul with the greatest unanimity of the Roman
                        people. He betook himself to his competitors, but in such a manner that he
                        alone managed the whole election, even against their will,&mdash;that he
                        supported on his own shoulders, as he used to say, the whole <foreign lang="la">comitia</foreign>,&mdash;he convoked the

                        one caused greater confusion, so did the other acquire additional power
                        every day. When the fellow, prepared for every atrocity, saw that a most
                        brave man, his greatest enemy, was a most certain consul, and that that was

                        <milestone n="26" unit="section"/> He had brought down from the Apennines
                        rustic and barbarian slaves, whom you saw, with whom he had ravaged the
                        public woods and Etruria. The matter was not concealed at all. In truth he
                        used to say undisguisedly that the consulship could not be taken from Milo,
                        but that life could. He often hinted as much in the senate he said it
                        plainly in the public assembly. Besides, when Favonius, a brave man, asked
                        him what he hoped for by giving way to such madness while Milo was alive? he
                        answered him, that in three, or at most in four days, he would be dead. And
                        this saying of his Favonius immediately reported to Marcus Cato, who is here

                        he himself left Rome the day before, in order (as was seen by the event) to
                        lay an ambush for Milo in front of his farm; and he departed, so that he was
                        not present at a turbulent assembly in which his madness was greatly missed,
                        and which was held that very day, and from which he never would have been
                        absent if he had not desired to avail himself of the place and opportunity

                        to, without his wife, which was scarcely ever the case; while this plotter,
                        who had taken, forsooth, that journey for the express purpose of murder, was
                        driving with his wife in a carriage, in a heavy travelling cloak, with
                        abundant baggage, and a delicate company of women, and maidservants, <pb n="402"/> and boys. <milestone n="29" unit="section"/> He meets Clodius
                        in front of his farm, about the eleventh hour, or not far from it.
                        Immediately a number of men attack him from the higher ground with missile
                        weapons. The men who are in front kill his driver, and when he had jumped
                        down from his chariot and flung aside his cloak, and while he was defending
                        himself with vigorous courage, the men who were with Clodius drew their
                        swords, and some of them ran back towards his chariot in order to attack
                        Milo from behind, and some, because they thought that he was already slain,
                        began to attack his servants who were behind him; and those of the servants
                        who had presence of mind to defend themselves, and were faithful to their
                        master, were some of them slain, and the others, when they saw a fierce
                        battle taking place around the chariot, and as they were prevented from
                        getting near their master so as to help him, when they heard Clodius himself
                        proclaim that Milo was slain, and they thought that it was really true,
                        they, the servants of Milo, (I am not speaking for the purpose of shifting
                        the guilt onto the shoulders of others, but I am saying what really
                        occurred,) did, without their master either commanding it, or knowing it, or
                        even being present to see it, what every one would have wished his servants
                        to do in a similar case. <milestone n="11" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="30" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>These things were all done, O judges, just as I have related them. The man
                        who laid the plot was defeated; violence was defeated by violence; or, I
                        should rather say, audacity was crushed by valour. I say nothing about what
                        the republic, nothing about what you, nothing about what all good men gained
                        by the result. I do not desire it to be any advantage to me to hear that he
                        was born with such a destiny that he was unable even to save himself,
                        without at the same time saving the republic and all of you. If he had not a
                        right to do so, then I have nothing which I can urge in his defence. But if
                        both reason has taught this lesson to learned men, and necessity to
                        barbarians, and custom to all nations, and nature itself to the beasts, that
                        they are at all times to repel all violence by whatever means they can from
                        their persons, from their liberties, and from their lives, then you cannot
                        decide this action to have been wrong, without deciding at the same time
                        that all men who fall among thieves must perish, either by their weapons, or
                        by your sentence. <pb n="403"/>

                        law, it would have been preferable for Milo to offer his throat to Publius
                        Clodius,&mdash;which was not attacked by him once only, nor for the
                        first time on that day,&mdash;rather than now to be destroyed by you
                        because he did not surrender himself then to be destroyed by him. But if
                        there is no one of you who entertains such an opinion as that, then the
                        question which arises for the consideration of the court is not whether he
                        was slain or not which we admit but whether he was slain legally or
                        illegally, which is an inquiry which has often been instituted in any
                        causes. It is quite plain that a plot was laid and that if a thing which the
                        senate has decided to be contrary to the laws of the republic. By whom it
                        was laid is a question. And on this point an inquiry has been ordered to be
                        instituted. So the senate has marked its disapproval of the fact not of the
                        man; and Pompeius has appointed this inquiry into the merits of the case and
                        not into the fact of its existence. <milestone n="12" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>Does then any other point arise for the decision of the court, except this
                        one,&mdash;which laid a plot against the other? None whatever. The case
                        comes before you in this way, that if Milo laid a plot against Clodius, then
                        he is not to be let off with impunity. If Clodius laid it against Milo, then
                        we are acquitted from all guilt. <milestone n="32" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>How then are we to prove that Clodius laid a plot against Milo? It is quite
                        sufficient in the case of such a wicked, of such an audacious monster as
                        that, to prove that he had great reason to do so; that he had great hopes
                        founded on Milo's death; that it would have been of the greatest service to
                        him. Therefore, that maxim of Cassius, to see to whose advantage it was, may
                        well have influence in respect of these persons. For although good men
                        cannot be induced to commit crimes by any advantage whatever, wicked men
                        often can by a very trifling one. And, if Milo were slain, Clodius gained
                        this, not only that he should be praetor without having him for a consul,
                        under whom he would not be able to commit any wickedness, but also that he
                        should have those men for consuls while he was praetor, who, if they did not
                        aid him, would at all events connive at all his proceedings to such an
                        extent that he hoped he should be able to escape detection in all the
                        frantic actions which he was contemplating; as they (so he argued to
                        himself) would not even if they were able to <pb n="404"/> do so, be anxious
                        to check his attempts when they considered that they were under such
                        obligations to him; and on the other hand, if they did wish to do so,
                        perhaps they would hardly be able to crush the audacity of that most wicked
                        man when it got strength by its long continuance. Are you, O judges, the
                        only persons ignorant of all this? <milestone n="33" unit="section"/> Are

                        my humanity could resolve to demand? You cast the bloody carcass of Publius
                        Clodius out of the house, you threw it out into the public street, you left
                        it destitute of all images, of all funeral rites, of all funeral pomp, of
                        all funeral panegyric, half consumed by a lot of miserable dogs, to be torn
                        to pieces by the dogs who nightly prowl about the streets. Wherefore,
                        although in so doing you acted most impiously, still you were wreaking all
                        your enemy on my enemy; though I cannot praise you, I certainly ought not to
                        be angry with you. <gap desc="* * *"/></p>
					<p>
                        <milestone n="34" unit="section"/> [You have heard, judges, how much it was
                        in Clodius's interest] that Milo should be slain. Now turn your attention to
                        Milo. What advantage could it be to Milo that Clodius should be slain? What
                        reason was there why Milo, I will not say should do such an action, but
                        should even wish for his death? Oh, Clodius was an obstacle to Milo's hope
                        of obtaining the consulship. But he was obtaining it in spite of him. Yes, I
                        might rather say be was obtaining it all the more because Clodius was
                        opposing him, nor in fact was I a more efficient support to him than Clodius
                        was. The recollection, O judges, of the services which Milo had done to me
                        and to the republic had weight with you. My entreaties and my tears with
                        which I perceived at that time that you were greatly moved had weight with
                        you, but still more weight had your own fear of the dangers which were
                        impending. For who of the citizens was there who could turn his eyes to the
                        unrestrained praetorship of Publius Clodius, without feeling the greatest
                        dread of a revolution? and unrestrained you saw that it would be unless you
                        had a consul who had both courage and power to restrain him, and as the
                        whole Roman people saw that Milo alone was that man, who could hesitate by
                        his vote to release himself from fear and the republic from danger? </p>
					<p>But now that Clodius is removed, Milo has got to labour by more ordinary
                        practices to preserve his dignity. That preeminent glory which was then
                        attributed to him alone, and which was daily increasing in consequence of
                        his efforts to repress the frenzy of Clodius, has been put an end to by the
                        death of Clodius. You have gained your object of being no longer afraid of
                        any one of the citizens; he has lost that incessant arena for his valour,
                        that which procured him <pb n="406"/> votes for the consulship, that
                        ceaseless and ever-springing fountain of his glory. Therefore, Milo's
                        canvass for the consulship, which could not be hindered from prospering
                        while Clodius was alive, now, the moment that he is dead, is attempted to be
                        checked. So that the death of Clodius is not only no advantage, but is even
                        a positive injury to Milo. <milestone n="35" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>&ldquo;Oh, but his hatred prevailed with him; he slew him in a passion;
                        he slew him because he was his enemy; he acted as the avenger of his own
                        injury; he was exacting atonement to appease his private
                        indignation.&rdquo; But what will you say if these feelings, I do not
                        say existed in a greater degree in Clodius than in Milo, but if they existed
                        in the greatest possible degree in the former, and not at all in the latter?
                        What will you require beyond that? For why should Milo have hated Clodius,
                        the material and ground-work of his glory, except as far as that hatred
                        becoming a citizen goes, with which we hate all worthless men? There was
                        plenty of reason for Clodius to hate Milo, first, as the defender of my
                        safety; secondly, as the repressor of his frenzy, the defeater of his arms;
                        and lastly, also, as his prosecutor. For Clodius was liable to the
                        prosecution of Milo, according to the provisions of the Plotian law, as long
                        as he lived. And with what feelings do you suppose that that tyrant bore
                        that? how great do you suppose was his hatred towards him? and, indeed, how
                        reasonable a hatred was it for a wicked man to entertain. <milestone n="14" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="36" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>It remains for me now to urge his natural disposition and his habits of life

                        the other. Clodius, I suppose, had never done anything by violence; Milo had
                        done everything by violence. What then shall I say, O judges? When, amid the
                        grief of all of you, I departed from the city, was I afraid of the result of
                        a trial? was I not afraid of slaves, and arms and violence? What, I pray
                        you, was the first ground of my restoration, except that I had been unjustly
                        driven out? Clodius, I suppose, had commenced a formal prosecution against
                        me; he had named a sum as damages; he had commenced an action for high
                        treason; and, I suppose too, I had cause to fear your decision in a cause
                        which was an unjust one, which was my own private cause, not one which was a
                        most righteous one, and which was, in reality, your cause, and not mine?
                        No,&mdash;I was <pb n="407"/> unwilling that my fellow-citizens, who had
                        been saved by my prudence and by my own personal danger, should be exposed
                        to the arms of slaves and needy citizens and convicted malefactors.
                            <milestone n="37" unit="section"/> For I saw&mdash;I saw, I say,
                        this very Quintus Hortensius, the light and ornament of the republic, almost
                        slain by the hand of slaves, while he was standing by me. In which crowd
                        Caius Vibienus, a senator, a most excellent man, who was with Hortensius,
                        was so maltreated that he lost his life. </p>
					<p>When, then, was it that that assassin's dagger of his which he had received

                        exposed to it for my sake. It was prepared in treachery for Pompeius. It
                        stained with blood, through the murder of Papirius the very Appian road, the
                        monument of his name, this, this same dagger, after a long interval was
                        again turned against me lately as you know, it nearly murdered me close to

                        might he not have done so when that illustrious citizen and most gallant man
                        Publius Sestius his own colleague, was wounded? might he not have done so
                        when that most excellent man Quintus Fabricius, while carrying a bill for my
                        restoration, was driven away and when a most cruel slaughter was taking
                        place in the forum? might he not have done so when the house of Lucius
                        Caecilius, that most upright and fearless praetor, was attacked? might he
                        not have done so on the day on which the law concerning me was passed, and
                        when that vast concourse of people from all parts of Italy, whom a regard
                        for my safety had roused up, would have gladly recognised and adopted as its
                        own the glory of that action? so that even if Milo had performed it the
                        whole state would claim the praise of it as belonging to itself? <milestone n="15" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="39" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>And what a time was it? A most illustrious and fearless consul, Publius
                        Lentulus, an enemy to Clodius, the avenger of his wickedness, the bulwark of
                        the senate, the defender of your inclinations, the patron of that general
                        unanimity, the restorer of my safety; seven praetors, eight tribunes of the
                        people, adversaries of him, defenders of me; Cnaeus Pompeius, the prime
                        mover of, and chief agent, in my return, his open enemy; whose opinion
                        respecting my return, delivered in the most dignified and most complimentary
                        language, the whole senate adopted; he who exhorted the whole Roman people,
                        and, when he passed a decree concerning me at Capua, gave himself the signal
                        to all Italy, which was eager for it, and which was imploring his good
                        faith, to join together for the purpose of restoring me to Rome; in short,
                        universal hatred on the part of all the citizens, was excited against him,
                        while their minds were inflamed with as earnest a regret for me; so that if
                        any one had slain him at that time, people's thoughts would have been, not
                        how to procure impunity for such a man, but how to reward him sufficiently. </p>
					<p>
                        <milestone n="40" unit="section"/> Nevertheless, Milo restrained himself,
                        and twice summoned Publius Clodius before the court, but never once invited
                        him to a trial of strength in scenes of violence. What do I say? while Milo
                        was a private individual, and on his trial before the people, on the
                        accusation of Publius Clodius, when an attack was made on Cnaeus Pompeius,
                        while speaking in defence of Milo, was there not then not only an admirable
                        opportunity of, but even a reasonable pretext for slaying him? And lately,
                        when Marcus Antonius had inspired all virtuous men with the very greatest
                        hope of safety, and when he, being a most noble young man, had with the
                        greatest gallantry espoused the cause of the republic, and had that beast
                        almost in his toils in spite of his avoiding the snares of the law; what an
                        opportunity, what a time and place was there, O ye immortal gods! And when
                        Clodius had fled and hidden himself in the darkness of the stairs, there was
                        a fine opportunity for Milo to slay him without incurring the slightest
                        odium himself, and to load Antonius at the same time with the greatest
                        glory! <milestone n="41" unit="section"/> What? How repeatedly had he a
                        similar chance in the <foreign lang="la">comitia</foreign>! when he had
                        broken into the voting booth, and contrived to have swords drawn and stones
                        thrown, and then on a sudden, terrified at the look of Milo, fled towards
                        the Tiber, and you and all virtuous men prayed to heaven that Milo might
                        take it into his head to give fall scope to his valour. <pb n="409"/>
                        <milestone n="16" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>If then he did not choose to slay him, when he might have done so with the
                        gratitude of everyone, is it likely that he should have chosen to do so when
                        some people were sure to complain of it? If he did not venture to do it when
                        he might have done so lawfully, when he had both place and time in his
                        favour, when he might have done so with impunity can we believe that he did
                        not hesitate to slay him unjustly at a time and place which supplied him
                        with no excuse for the deed, when it was at the hazard of his life?
                            <milestone n="42" unit="section"/>especially, O judges, when the day of
                        contest for the greatest distinction of the state, and the day of the
                            <foreign lang="la">comitia</foreign>, was at hand. At which time, (for I
                        know what a nervous thing ambition is, how vehement and how anxious is the
                        desire for the consulship,) we are afraid of everything, not only of those
                        things which can be openly found fault with, but even of whatever can be
                        secretly thought; we shudder at every rumour, at every idle and empty story;
                        we look anxiously at every one's countenance, at every one's eye. For there
                        is nothing so soft, so tender, so frail, so flexible, as the inclinations
                        and feelings of our fellow-citizens towards us; for they are not only angry
                        at any impropriety in the conduct of candidates, but they often even take a
                        disgust at our virtuous actions. <milestone n="43" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>Did Milo then, keeping in view this long hoped-for and wished-for day of the
                        Campus Martius, propose to himself to come to those venerable <foreign lang="la">auspices</foreign> of the centuries with bloody hands, owning
                        and confessing a wickedness and a crime? How perfectly incredible is such
                        conduct in such a man! At the same time how undoubted is it in the case of
                        Clodius, who thought that he should be a king as soon as Milo was slain.
                        What shall I say more? This is the very mainspring of audacity, O judges,
                        for who is there who does not know that the greatest temptation of all to do
                        wrong is the hope of impiety? Now in which of the two did this exist? In
                        Milo? who is even now on his trial for an action which I contend was an
                        illustrious one, but which was at all events a necessary one, or in Clodius,
                        who had shown such contempt for court's of justice and punishment that he
                        took no pleasure in anything which was not either impious, from its
                        disregard of the prohibitions of nature, or illegal, from its violation of
                        law. <milestone n="44" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>But what am I arguing about? why do I keep on disputing at greater length? I
                        appeal to you, O Quintus Petillius, a most virtuous and fearless citizen; I
                        call you to witness, O Marcus Cato; whom some heavenly interposition has
                        given me for judges. You have heard from Marcus Favonius, and you heard it
                        too while Clodius was alive, that he, Clodius, had said to him that Milo
                        would die within three days,&mdash;and on the third day the deed which
                        he had mentioned was put in execution. When he did not hesitate to reveal
                        what he was thinking of, can you have any doubt what he did? <milestone n="17" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="45" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>How then was it, that he was so correct in the day? I told you that just now.
                        There was no great difficulty in knowing the regular days of sacrifice for
                        the dictator of Lanuvium. He saw that it was necessary for Milo to go to
                        Lanuvium on the very day in which he did go,&mdash;therefore, he
                        anticipated him. But on what day? Why, on the day on which, as I have said
                        before, there was a most furious assembly of the people, stirred up by the
                        tribune of the people whom he had in his pay&mdash;a day, and an
                        assembly, and an uproar which he would never have missed if he had not been
                        hastening to some premeditated crime. Therefore, he had not only no reason
                        for going on a journey, but he had even a reason for stopping at home. Milo
                        had no possibility of stopping at home, and he had not only a reason, but a
                        positive necessity for going on a journey. What more? Suppose, while he knew
                        that Milo must go on the road on that day, so, on the other hand, Milo could
                        not even suspect that Clodius would? <milestone n="46" unit="section"/>For,
                        first of all, I ask, how could Milo know it? a question which you cannot ask
                        respecting Clodius. For even if he had not asked any one beyond his own
                        intimate friend, Titus Patina, he could have ascertained from him that on
                        that particular day a priest must absolutely be appointed at Lanuvium by
                        Milo as the dictator there. But there were plenty more people from whom he
                        could easily learn that, for instance, all the people of Lanuvium. Of whom
                        did Milo make any inquiry about the return of Clodius? Grant that he did
                        make inquiry; see what large allowances I am making you: grant even that he
                        bribed his slave, as my good friend Quintus Arrius said&mdash;Read the
                        evidence of your own witnesses. </p>
					<p>Caius Cassinius Schola, a man of Interamna, gave his evidence,&mdash;a
                        most intimate friend of Publius Clodius, and <pb n="411"/> more, a companion
                        of his at the very time; according to whose testimony, Publius Clodius was
                        at Interamna and at Rome at the very same time. Well, he said, That Publius
                        Clodius had intended to remain that day at his Alban villa; but that on a
                        sudden news was brought to him, that Cyrus his architect was dead; and,
                        therefore, that he determined to proceed to Rome immediately. Caius Clodius,
                        who was also a companion of Publius Clodius, said the same. <milestone n="18" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="47" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>Take notice, O judges, what the real effect of this evidence must be. First
                        of all, Milo is certainly acquitted of having set out with the express
                        intention of waylaying Clodius on his road; this must be since there was
                        apparently no chance whatever of his meeting him. In the next place, (for I
                        see no reason why I should not do something for myself at the same time,)
                        you know, O judges, that there have been men found to say while urging on
                        this bill against Milo, that the murder was committed by the hand indeed of
                        Milo, but by the plan of some one of more importance than he. Those abject
                        and profligate men, forsooth, pointed me out as a robber and assassin. Now
                        they are convicted by their own witnesses, who say that Clodius would not
                        have returned to Rome that day if he had not heard the news about Cyrus I
                        breathed again; I was delivered, I am not any longer afraid of being
                        supposed to have contemplated an action which I could not possibly have
                        suspected. </p>
					<p>
                        <milestone n="48" unit="section"/> Now I will examine the other point. For
                        this expression occurs in their speech: &ldquo;Therefore, Clodius never
                        even thought of the plot against Milo, since he intended to remain in his
                        Alban villa.&rdquo; Yes, he meant to remain there, if he did not rather
                        intend to go out and commit a murder. For I see that the messenger who is
                        said to have brought him news of Cyrus's death did not announce that to him,
                        but told him that Milo was at hand. For why should he bring any news about
                        Cyrus, whom Clodius had left at Rome on his deathbed? I was with
                        him&mdash;I signed his will as a witness together with Clodius; and he
                        had openly made his will, and had left him and me his heirs. When he had
                        left him the day before, at the third hour, at the very point of death, was
                        news sent express to him the next day, at the tenth hour that he was at last
                        dead? <milestone n="19" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="49" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>Well, be it so; what reason had he for hastening to <pb n="412"/> Rome? for
                        starting at nightfall? Why should the fact of his being his heir cause him
                        to make so much haste? In the first place, there was no reason why there
                        should be need of any haste; secondly, even if there was, still what was
                        there which he could obtain that night, but which he would lose if he
                        arrived at Rome early the next morning? And as an arrival in the city by
                        night was rather to be avoided by him than to be desired, so it was just
                        suited for Milo to lie in ambush and wait for him, as he was a plotter of
                        that sort, if he knew that he was likely to come to the city by night.
                            <milestone n="50" unit="section"/> He would have slain him by night, in
                        a place calculated for an ambush and fall of robbers; no one would have
                        refused to believe him if he denied it, when now all men wish to save him
                        even when he confesses it. The brunt of the blame would have fallen on the
                        place itself, so well suited to receive and conceal robbers, while neither
                        the voiceless solitude would have informed against, nor the dark night
                        discovered Milo; secondly, the numbers of men who had been insulted by
                        Clodius, or plundered by him, or stripped of all their property by him,
                        many, too, who were in constant fear of such misfortunes, would have fallen
                        under suspicion; in short, the whole of Etruria would have been impeached in
                        people's opinion. </p>
					<p>
                        <milestone n="51" unit="section"/> And certainly on that day Clodius
                        returning from Aricia did turn aside to his Alban villa. But although Milo
                        knew that he was at Aricia, still he ought to have suspected that he, even
                        if he was desirous to return to Rome that day, would turn aside to his own
                        villa, the grounds of which skirted the road. Why, then, did he not meet him
                        before, and prevent his going to his villa? nor wait in that place where he
                        would certainly arrive by night? <milestone n="52" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>I see that all things up to this point are plain and consistent. That it was
                        even desirable for Milo that Clodius should live; that for Clodius the death
                        of Milo was the most advantageous thing possible, with reference to those
                        objects on which he had set his heart; that he bore him the most bitter
                        hatred, but that Milo had no such feelings towards him; that the one lived
                        in a perpetual round of violence, that the other's habits were limited to
                        repelling it; that Milo had been threatened by him with death, and that his
                        death had been openly predicted by him; that no such expression had ever
                        been heard from Milo; that the day of Milo's journey was well known to
                        Clodius., but that Clodius's return was unknown to Milo; that the journey of
                        the one was inevitable, and that of the other was even inconvenient to
                        himself; that the one had openly declared that on that day he should set out
                        from Rome, that the other had concealed the fact of his intending to return
                        on that day; that the one had in no respect whatever changed his intention,
                        that the other had invented a false pretence for changing his mind; that the
                        one, if he were plotting, would naturally wish night to come on when he was
                        near the city, while an arrival at the city by night was to be feared by the

					<p>Let us now consider this which is the main point or all; for which of the two
                        the identical spot where they did meet was the best suited for planting an
                        ambush. But is that, O judges, a matter about which one can possibly doubt
                        or think seriously for a moment? In front of Clodius's farm,&mdash;that
                        farm in which on account of those absurd erections and excavations for
                        foundations of his, there were pretty well a thousand vigorous men
                        employed,&mdash;on that high and raised ground belonging to his
                        adversary, did Milo think that he should get the better in the contest, and
                        had he with that view selected that spot above all ethers? Or was he rather
                        waited for in that place by a man who had conceived the idea of attacking,
                        because of the hopes that that particular spot suggested to him? The facts,
                        O judges, speak for themselves; facts, which are always of the greatest
                        weight in a cause. <milestone n="54" unit="section"/> If you were not
                        hearing of this transaction, but were looking at a picture of it still it
                        would be quite visible which of the two was the plotter which was thinking
                        no evil, when one of the two was driving in a chariot wrapped up in a
                        mantle, with his wife sitting by his side. It is hard to say which was the
                        greatest hindrance to him, his dress, or his carriage, or his wife. How
                        could a man be less ready for battle than when he was entangled in a mantle
                        as in a net, hampered with a carriage, and fettered as it were by his wife
                        clinging to him? Look, on the other hand, at Clodius, first setting out from
                        his villa; all on a sudden: why? It was evening. Why was he forced to set
                        out at such a time? Going slowly. What was the object of that especially at
                        that time of night? He turns aside to the villa of Pompeius. To see
                        Pompeius? He knew <pb n="414"/> that he was near Alsium. To see the villa?
                        He had been in it a thousand times. What then, was his object? Delay; he
                        wanted to waste the time. He did not choose to leave the spot till Milo
                        arrived. <milestone n="21" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="55" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>Come now, compare the journey of this unencumbered bandit with all the
                        hindrances which beset Milo. Before this time be always used to travel with
                        his wife; now he was without her. He invariably went in a carriage; now he
                        was on horseback. His train were a lot of Greeklings wherever he was going;
                        even when he was hastening to the camp in Etruria<note anchored="yes">That
                            is, to Manlius's camp in Etruria at the time of Catiline's conspiracy in
                            which, in all probability, Clodius was implicated.</note> but this time
                        there were no triflers in his retinue. Milo, who was never in the habit of
                        doing so, did by chance have with him some musical slaves belonging to his
                        wife, and troops of maid-servants. The other man, who was always carrying
                        with him prostitutes, worn-out debauchees, both men and women, this time had
                        no one with him except such a band that you might have thought every one of
                        them picked men. Why, then, was he defeated? Because the traveler is not
                        always murdered by the robber; sometimes the robber is killed by the
                        traveler; because, although Clodius in a state of perfect preparation was
                        attacking men wholly unprepared, still it was the case of a woman falling
                        upon men. <milestone n="56" unit="section"/> And, indeed, Milo was never so
                        utterly unprepared for his violence, as not to be nearly sufficiently
                        prepared. He was always aware how greatly it concerned the interest of
                        Publius Clodius that he should be slain, how greatly he hated him, and how
                        great was his daring. Wherefore, he never exposed his life to danger without
                        some sort of protection and guard, knowing that, it was threatened, and that
                        a large price, as it were, was set upon it. </p>
					<p>Add to this consideration all the chances; add the always uncertain result of
                        a battle, and the common fortune of Mars, who often overthrows the man who
                        is already exulting and stripping his enemy, and strikes him to the ground
                        by some mean agent; add the blundering conduct of a leader who had dined and
                        drank, and who was yawning and drowsy; who, when he had left his enemy cut
                        off in the rear, never thought of his companions on the outskirts of his
                        train; and then when he fell among them inflamed with anger, and <pb n="415"/> despairing of saving the life of their master, he fell on that punishment
                        which the faithful slaves inflicted on him as a retribution for their
                        master's death. Why, then, has Milo emancipated them? <milestone n="57" unit="section"/> He was afraid, I suppose, lest they should give
                        information against him; lest they should be unable to bear pain; lest they
                        should be compelled by tortures to confess that Publius Clodius was slain in
                        the Appian road by the slaves of Milo. </p>
					<p>What need is there of any torturer? What do you want to know? whether he was
                        slain? He was slain. Whether he was slain lawfully or unlawfully? That is
                        beyond the province of the torturer. For the rack can only inquire into the
                        fact; it is the bench of judges that must decide on the law. <milestone n="22" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>Let us then here confine our attention to what must be investigated in this
                        trial. All that you can want to find out by tortures we admit. But if you
                        prefer asking why he emancipated his slaves rather than why he gave them
                        inadequate rewards, you are but a bungling hand at finding fault with an
                        enemy. For Marcus Cato, who says everything with great wisdom, and
                        consistency, and courage, said the same thing; <milestone n="58" unit="section"/> and he said, too, in a very turbulent assembly of the
                        people, which, however, was pacified by his authority, that those slaves
                        were worthy not only of liberty, but even of every sort of reward possible,
                        who had defended the life of their master. For what reward can be
                        sufficiently great for such well-affected, such virtuous, such faithful
                        slaves, owing to whom it is that he is still alive? Although even that is
                        not putting it so strongly as to say, that it is owing to those very men
                        that he did not glut the eyes and mind of his most cruel enemy with his
                        blood and wounds. And if he had not emancipated them, then those preservers
                        of their master, those avengers of wickedness, those defenders of their
                        master from death, must have even been surrendered to torture. But in all
                        these misfortunes the most comfortable reflection which Milo has is, that,
                        even if anything should happen to himself, still he has given them the
                        reward which they deserved. <milestone n="59" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>But now the examinations which have just been conducted in the hall of
                        liberty, are said to press against Milo? Who are the slaves who have been
                        examined? Do you ask? The slaves of Publius Clodius. Who demanded that they
                        should <pb n="416"/> be examined? Appius. Who produced them? Appius. Where
                        were they brought from? From the house of Appius. O ye good gods, what can
                        be done with more animosity? There is no law which authorizes slaves to be
                        examined as witnesses against their master, except on accusations of
                        impiety, as was the case in the prosecution instituted against Clodius.
                        Clodius has been raised nearly to the gods, more nearly than even when he
                        penetrated into their sanctuary, when an investigation into the
                        circumstances of his death is carried on like one into a profanation of
                        sacred ceremonies. But still, our ancestors did not think it right that
                        slaves should be examined as witnesses against their masters, not because
                        the truth could not be discovered, but because it seemed a scandalous thing
                        to do, and more oppressive to the masters than even death itself. Well,
                        then, when the slaves of the prosecutor are examined as witnesses against
                        the defendant can the truth be found out? <milestone n="60" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>Come, however, what was the examination; and how was it conducted? Holloa,
                        you Rufio, (that name will do as well as another,) take care you tell the
                        truth. Did Clodius lay a plot against Milo? &ldquo;He did.&rdquo; He
                        is sure to be crucified for saying so. &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo; He
                        has hopes of obtaining his liberty. What can be more certain than this mode
                        of examination? The men are suddenly carried out to be examined; they are
                        separated from all the rest and put into cells that no one may be able to
                        speak to them. Then, when they have been kept a hundred days in the power of
                        the prosecutor, they are produced as witnesses by the prosecutor himself.
                        What can be imagined more upright than this sort of examination? What can be
                        more free from all suspicion of corruption? <milestone n="23" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="61" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>And if you do not yet see with sufficient clearness, (though the transaction
                        is evident of itself by so many and such irresistible arguments and
                        proofing) that Milo was returning to Rome with a pure and guiltless
                        intention, with no taint of wickedness, under no apprehension, without any
                        consciousness of crime to disquiet him; recollect, I implore you, in the
                        name of the immortal gods, how rapid his speed while returning was; how he
                        entered the forum while the senate-house was all on fire with eagerness; how
                        great was the magnanimity which he displayed; how he looked, and what he
                        said. Nor did he trust himself to the people only, but also to the senate;
                        nor to the senate only, but also to the public guards and their arms; nor to
                        them only, but also to the power of that man to whom the senate had already
                            entrusted<note anchored="yes">The disturbances on the death of Clodius
                            arose to such a height, that the senate at last passed a resolution that
                            Marcus Lepidus the Interrex, assisted by the tribunes of the people and
                            Pompeius, should take care that the republic received no injury. And at
                            last the senate appointed Pompeius consul without a colleague, who
                            immediately published several new laws, and among them the one under
                            which this trial was conducted, (see note on <bibl n="Cic. Mil. 1">chap.1</bibl>) and he now limited the duration of trials, allowing
                            only three days for the examination of witnesses, and on the fourth day
                            the accuser was only allowed two hours to enforce the accusation, and
                            the defendant three hours to speak in his defence. Caelius endeavoured
                            to arrest these laws by his veto as tribune, declaring that they were
                            framed solely with a view to crush Milo, whom Pompeius certainly desired
                            to get rid of; to effect which he even descended to the artifice of
                            pretending to believe that Milo had laid a plot to assassinate
                            him.</note> the whole republic, all the youth of Italy, and all the arms
                        of the Roman people. And surely he never would have put himself in his
                        power, if he had not been confident in the justice of his cause; especially
                        as he was one who heard everything, and feared great danger, and suspected
                        many things, and even believed some. The power of conscience is very great,
                        O judges, and is of great weight on both sides: so that they fear nothing
                        who have done no wrong, and they, on the other hand, who have done wrong
                        think that banishment is always hanging over them. </p>
					<p>
                        <milestone n="62" unit="section"/> Nor, indeed, is it without good reason
                        that Milo's cause has always been approved of by the senate. For these
                        wisest of men took into their consideration the whole circumstances of the
                        case; Milo's presence of mind, and vigour in defending himself. Have you
                        forgotten, O judges, when the news of Clodius's death was still recent, the
                        opinions and the language which was held, not only by Milo's enemies, but
                        also by other ignorant people? They said that he would not return to Rome at
                        all. <milestone n="63" unit="section"/> For if he had committed the deed in
                        a passionate and excited mood, so that he had slain his enemy while under
                        the influence of strong hatred, they thought that he would consider the
                        death of Publius Clodius an event of such importance, that he would bear
                        being deprived of his country with equanimity, as he had sated his hatred in
                        the <pb n="418"/> blood of his enemy; or, if he had deliberately intended to
                        deliver his country by the slaughter of Clodius, then they thought that he,
                        as a brave man, would not hesitate, after having brought safety to his
                        country at his own risk, to submit with equanimity to the laws, to carry off
                        with himself everlasting renown, and to leave those things to us to enjoy
                        which he had preserved for us himself </p>
					<p>Many also spoke of Catiline and the monsters of his train. &ldquo;We
                        shall have another Catiline breaking out. He will occupy some strong place;
                        he will make war on his country.&rdquo; Wretched sometimes is the fate
                        of those citizens who have faithfully served the republic! when men not only
                        forget the illustrious exploits which they have performed, but even suspect
                        them of the most nefarious designs! <milestone n="64" unit="section"/>
                        Therefore, all those things were false, which would certainly have turned
                        out true if Milo had committed any action which he could not defend with
                        honour and with truth. <milestone n="24" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>What shall I say of the charges which were afterwards heaped upon him? which
                        would have crushed any one who was conscious of even trifling offences. How
                        nobly did he support them! O ye immortal gods, do I say support them? Say
                        rather, how did he despise them, and treat them as nothing! Charges which no
                        guilty man, were he ever so high-minded, and, indeed, no innocent man,
                        unless he were also a most fearless man, could possibly have disregarded. It
                        was said that a vast collection of shields, swords, bridles, lances, and
                        javelins had been seized. They said that there was no street, no alley in
                        the whole city, in which there was not a house hired for Milo; that arms had
                        been carried down the Tiber to his villa at Oriculum; that his house on the
                        Capitoline Hill was full of shields; that every place was full of firebrands
                        prepared for the burning of the city. These things were not only reported,
                        but were almost believed, and were not rejected till they had been
                        thoroughly investigated. <milestone n="65" unit="section"/> I praised,
                        indeed, the incredible diligence of Cnaeus Pompeius; but still I will say
                        what I really think, O judges. </p>
					<p>Those men are compelled to listen to too many statements; indeed, they cannot
                        do otherwise, who have the whole republic entrusted to them. It was
                        necessary even to listen to that eating-house keeper Licinius, if that was
                        his name, a fellow out of the Circus Maximus, who said that Milo's slaves
                        had <pb n="419"/> got drunk in his house,&mdash;that they had confessed
                        to him that they were engaged in a conspiracy to assassinate Cnaeus
                        Pompeius, and that he himself was afterwards stabbed by one of them to
                        prevent him from giving information. He went to Pompeius's villa to tell him
                        this. I am sent for among the first. By the advice of his friends Pompeius
                        reports the affair to the senate. It was impossible for me to be otherwise
                        than frightened almost to death at the bare suspicion of such danger to one
                        who was the protector both of me and of my country; but still I wondered
                        that an eating-house keeper should be at once believed&mdash;that the
                        confession of the slaves should be listened to, and that a wound in the
                        side, which looked like the prick of a needle should be admitted to be a
                        wound inflicted by a gladiator. <milestone n="66" unit="section"/> But, as I
                        take the fact to have been, Pompeius was rather taking precautions than
                        feeling any actual alarm, guarding not only against those things which it
                        was reasonable to fear, but also against everything which could possibly
                        disquiet you. </p>
					<p>The house of Caius Caesar, that most illustrious and gallant man, was
                        besieged, as was reported during many hours of the night. No one in that
                        frequented part of the city had either seen or heard of any such thing.
                        Still such a report spread about. I could not possibly suspect Cnaeus
                        Pompeius, a man of the most admirable valour, of being timid; and thought no
                        diligence could be over-strained in a man who had undertaken the management
                        and protection of the whole of the republic. In a very full meeting of the
                        senate, lately held in the Capitol, a senator was found to say that Milo had
                        a weapon about him. He threw back his garments in that most sacred temple,
                        that, since the life of so good a citizen and so good a man could not
                        procure him credit the facts themselves might speak for him while he held
                        his peace. <milestone n="25" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="67" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>Every word was ascertained to be a false and treacherous invention. And if
                        people are even now afraid of Milo, we are not now under apprehension
                        because of the charge respecting Clodius, but we are shuddering at your
                        suspicions,&mdash;at yours, I say, O Cnaeus Pompeius, (for I address you
                        yourself, and I speak loudly so that you may be able to hear me.) If you are
                        afraid of Milo,&mdash;if you believe that he either now cherishes wicked
                        designs against your life, or that <pb n="420"/> he ever has entertained
                        such; if the levying of troops throughout Italy, as some of your
                        recruiting-sergeants pretend&mdash;if these arms,&mdash;if these
                        cohorts in the Capitol,&mdash;if these watchmen, these
                        sentinels,&mdash;if this picked body of youths, which is the guard of
                        your person and your house, is all armed against an attack on the part of
                        Milo; and if all these measures have been arranged, and prepared, and aimed
                        against him alone,&mdash;then certainly he must be a man of great power,
                        of incredible courage; surely it must be more than the power and resources
                        of one single man which are attributed to him, if the most eminent of our
                        generals is invested with a command, and all Italy is armed against this one
                        man. <milestone n="68" unit="section"/> But who is there who does not
                        understand that all the diseased and feeble parts of the republic were
                        entrusted to you, O Pompeius, that you might heal and strengthen them with
                        your arms? And if an opportunity had been afforded to Milo, he would,
                        doubtless, have proved to you yourself that no man was ever more dear to
                        another than you are to him; that he had never shunned any danger which
                        might be of service in promoting your dignity; that he had often contended
                        against that most foul pest on behalf of your glory; that his conduct in his
                        tribuneship has been entirely regulated by your counsels for the protection
                        of my safety, which was an object very dear to you; that he afterwards had
                        been defended by you when in danger of his life,<note anchored="yes">When
                            Clodius was aedile, he instituted a prosecution against Milo for
                            violence. Pompeius, Crassus, and Cicero appeared for him; and though
                            Clodius's mob raised a great uproar, and endeavoured to prevent Pompeius
                            from being heard, he made a long speech, lasting three hours, in his
                            defence. The trial was adjourned from February till May, and does not

                        had been assisted by you when he was a candidate for the praetorship; and

                        and I, secured to him by the services which he himself had done me. And if
                        he could not convince you of this,&mdash;if that suspicion had sunk so
                        deep in your mind that it could not possibly be eradicated; if in short,
                        Italy was never to have any rest from those levies, nor the city from arms;
                        till Milo was ruined,&mdash;then no doubt he, without hesitation, would
                        have departed from his country, <pb n="421"/> a man born to make such

					<p>See, now, how various and changeable is the course of human

                        connections fly off, and what cowardice they show. The time will come, yes,
                        will most certainly come,&mdash;that day will surely dawn some time or
                        other, when you, though your affairs are all, as I trust they will be, in a

                        one who is most deeply attached to you, and the good faith of a man of the
                        greatest weight and dignity, and the magnanimity of the very bravest man

                        public law, in the usages of our ancestors, and in all the affairs of the
                        republic, after the senate has entrusted to him the charge of taking care
                        &ldquo;that the republic suffered no injury,&rdquo; by which one
                        line the consuls have always been sufficiently armed, even though no warlike
                        weapons were given to them,&mdash;that he, I say, after having had an
                        army and a levy of troops given to him, would wait for a legal decision to
                        repress the designs of that man who was seeking by violence to abolish the
                        courts of justice themselves? </p>
					<p>It was sufficiently decided by Pompeius, quite sufficiently, that all those
                        charges were falsely brought against Milo; when he passed a law by which, as

                        as all men allow, might legally be acquitted. <milestone n="71" unit="section"/> But when he sits in that place, surrounded by all those

                        whom he himself might punish if guilty, both by his own authority and in
                        strict accordance with the precedents of our ancestors?) but that he keeps
                        them about him for the sake of <pb n="422"/> protection; that you may be

                        opinions, in contradiction to that assembly of the people which was held

					<p>Nor, O judges, am I at all moved by the accusation respecting Clodius. Nor am

                        the Roman people. Already our age has seen many, and those most illustrious

					<p>Commit this fact to memory, O judges. I trust that you and your children will
                        see many happy days in the republic. On every such occasion these will
                        always be your feelings,&mdash;that if Publius Clodius had been alive,
                        you never would have seen one of them. We have been led now to conceive the
                        greatest, and, as I feel sure, the best-founded hopes, that this very day,
                        this most admirable man being made our consul, when the licentiousness of
                        men is checked, their evil passions <pb n="425"/> put down, the laws and
                        courts of justice reestablished on a firm footing, will be a salutary day
                        for the republic. Is there, then, any one so insane as to think that he
                        could have obtained all this while Publius Clodius was alive? What? why,
                        what power of perpetual possession could you have had even in those things
                        which you possess as your private property and in the strictest sense your
                        own, while that frenzied man held the reins of government? <milestone n="29" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>I have no fear, O judges, lest it should seem that, because I am inflamed
                        with hatred against him, on account of my own personal enmity to the man, I
                        am vomiting forth these charges against him with more zeal than truth. In
                        truth, though it is natural that that should be an especial stimulus to me,
                        yet he was so completely the common enemy of all men, that my own hatred
                        only bore about its fair proportion to the general detestation with which he
                        was regarded. It cannot be expressed, O judges, it cannot even be imagined,
                        how much wickedness, how much mischief there was in that man. <milestone n="79" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>Moreover, attend to me with this idea, O judges. This investigation relates
                        to the death of Publius Clodius. Imagine in your minds,&mdash;for our
                        thoughts are free, and contemplate whatever they choose in such a manner
                        that we do discern those things which we think we see;&mdash;place,
                        therefore, before your mind's eye the image of this my condition; if I am
                        able to induce you to acquit Milo, but still only on condition of Publius
                        Clodius being restored to life. What fear is that that you show by your
                        countenances? How would he affect you if alive, when even now that he is
                        dead he has so agitated you by the bare thought of him? What? if Cnaeus
                        Pompeius himself, who is a man of such virtue and such good fortune that he
                        has at all times been able to do things which no one except him ever could
                        have done,&mdash;if even he, I say, had been able, in the same manner as
                        he has ordered an investigation into the death of Publius Clodius to take
                        place, so also to raise him from the dead, which do you think he would have
                        preferred to do? Even if out of friendship he had been willing to raise him
                        from the shades below, out of regard for the republic he would not have done
                        it. You, then, are sitting now as avengers of the death of that man, whom
                        you would not restore to life if you thought it possible that his life could
                        be restored by you. And this investigation <pb n="426"/> is appointed to be
                        made into the death of a man who would never have seen such a law passed, if
                        the law which ordered the inquiry had been able to restore him to life.
                        Ought, then, the slayer of this man, if any such slayer there be, to have
                        any reason, while confessing the deed, to fear punishment at the hand of
                        those men whom he delivered by the deed? <milestone n="80" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>Greek nations give the honours of the gods to those men who have slain
                        tyrants. What have I not seen at Athens? what in the other cities of Greece?
                        What divine honours have I not seen paid to such men? What odes, what songs
                        have I not heard in their praise? They are almost consecrated to immortality
                        in the memories and worship of men. And will you not only abstain from
                        conferring any honours on the saviour of so great a people, and the avenger
                        of such enormous wickedness, but will you even allow him to be borne off for
                        punishment? He would confess,&mdash;I say, if he had done it, he would
                        confess with a high and willing spirit that he had done it for the sake of
                        the general liberty; a thing which would certainly deserve not only to be
                        confessed by him, but even to be boasted of. <milestone n="30" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="81" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>In truth, if he does not deny an action from which he seeks no advantage
                        beyond being pardoned for having done it, would he hesitate to avow an
                        action for which he would be entitled to claim rewards? Unless indeed he
                        thinks it more pleasing to you to look upon him as having been the defender
                        of his own life, rather than of you; especially as from that confession, if
                        you were to choose to be grateful, he would reap the very highest honours.
                        If his action were not approved of by you, (although, how is it possible
                        that any one should not approve of what secured his own
                        safety?)&mdash;but still, if the virtue of a most gallant man had
                        happened to be at all unpleasing to his fellow-citizens, then with a lofty
                        and firm mind he would depart from an ungrateful city. For what could be
                        more ungrateful than for all other men to be rejoicing, and for him alone to
                        be mourning, to whom it was owing that the rest were rejoicing? <milestone n="82" unit="section"/> Although we have all at all times been of this
                        disposition with respect to crushing traitors to our country,&mdash;that
                        since the glory would be ours, we should consider the danger and the
                        unpopularity ours also. For what praise should I have deserved to have given
                        to me, <pb n="427"/> when I showed so much courage in my consulship on
                        behalf of you and of your children, if I had supposed that I could venture
                        on the exploits which I was attempting without very great struggles and
                        dangers to myself? What woman is there who would not dare to slay a wicked
                        and mischievous citizen, if she was not afraid of the danger of the attempt?
                        But the man who, though unpopularity, and death, and punishment are before
                        his eyes still ventures to defend the republic with no less alacrity than if
                        no such evils threatened him, he deserves to be considered really a man. </p>
					<p>It behoves a grateful people to reward those citizens who have deserved well
                        of the republic; it is the part of a brave man, not to be so moved even by
                        execution itself, as to repent of having acted bravely. <milestone n="83" unit="section"/> Wherefore, Titus Annius may well make the same
                        confession which Ahala made, which Nasica, which Opimius, which Marius,
                        which we ourselves have made: and then, if the republic were grateful, he
                        would rejoice; if ungrateful, then, though under the pressure of heavy
                        misfortune, he would still be supported by his own conscience. </p>
					<p>But, O judges, the fortune of the Roman people, and your felicity, and the
                        immortal gods, all think that they are entitled to your grateful or this
                        service which has been thus done to you. Nor, indeed, can any one think
                        otherwise except it be a man who thinks that there is no such thing at all
                        as any divine power or authority&mdash;a man who is neither moved by the
                        vastness of your empire, nor by that sun above us, nor by the motions of
                        heaven and of the stars, nor by the vicissitudes and regular order of
                        things, nor (and that is the greatest thing of all) by the wisdom of our
                        ancestors; who both themselves cultivated with the most holy reverence the
                        sacred rites and religions ceremonies and <foreign lang="la">auspices</foreign>, and also handed them down to us their posterity to
                        be so cultivated by us. <milestone n="31" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="84" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>There is, there is indeed, such a heavenly power. It is not the truth, that
                        in these bodies and in this feebleness of ours there is something which is
                        vigorous and endued with feeling, and nothing which is so in this vast and
                        beautiful movement of nature. Unless perhaps some people think that there is
                        no such thing in existence because it is not apparent, nor visible: just as
                        if we were able to see our own mind,&mdash;that by which we are wise, by
                        which we have foresight, by which we do and say these very things which we
                        are doing and saying; or as if we could plainly feel what sort of thing it
                        is, or where it is. That divine power; that very same divine power which has
                        often brought incredible prosperity and power to this city, has extinguished
                        and destroyed this mischief; by first of all inspiring it with the idea of
                        venturing to irritate by violence and to attack with the sword the bravest
                        of men, and so leading it on to be defeated by the man whom if it had only
                        been able to defeat it would have enjoyed endless licence and impunity.
                            <milestone n="85" unit="section"/> That result was brought about, O
                        judges, not by human wisdom, nor even by any moderate degree of care on the
                        part of the immortal gods. In truth, those very holy places themselves which
                        beheld that monster fall, appear to have been moved themselves, and to have
                        asserted their rights over him. </p>
					<p>I implore you, I call you to witness,&mdash;you, I say, O you Alban hills
                        and groves, and you, O you altars of the Albans, now overthrown, but
                        nevertheless partners of and equals in honour with the sacred rites of the
                        Roman people,&mdash;you, whom that man with headlong insanity, having
                        cut down and destroyed the most holy groves, had overwhelmed with his insane
                        masses of buildings; it was your power then that prevailed, it was the
                        divinity of your altars, the religious reverence due to you, and which he
                        had profaned by every sort of wickedness, that prevailed; and you, too, O
                        sacred Jupiter of Latium, whose lakes and groves and boundaries he had
                        constantly polluted with every sort of abominable wickedness and debauchery,
                        you at last from your high and holy mountain, opened your eyes for the
                        purpose of punishing him; it is to you, to all of you, that those
                        punishments, late indeed, but still just and well deserved, have been made
                        an atonement for his wickedness. <milestone n="86" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>Unless, perchance, we are to say that it was by accident that it happened
                        that it was before the very shrine of the Good Goddess which is in the farm
                        of Titus Sextus Gallius, a most honourable and accomplished young
                        man,&mdash;before the Good Goddess herself, I say, that when he had
                        begun the battle, he received that first wound under which he gave up that
                        foul soul of his; so that he did not seem to have been acquitted in that
                        iniquitous trial, but only to have been reserved for this conspicuous
                        punishment. <pb n="429"/>

					<p>Nor, indeed, did that same anger of the gods abstain from inflicting the very
                        same insanity on his satellites, so that without the images of his
                        ancestors, without any funeral song or funeral games, without any obsequies,
                        any lamentation, or any panegyric,&mdash;without, in short, any funeral
                        at all, smeared over with gore and mud, and deprived even of the honours
                        which are paid to every one on that last day, and which even enemies are
                        wont to allow to a man, he was cast out in the street half burnt. It was not
                        right, I suppose, for the effigies of most illustrious men to confer any
                        honour on that most foul parricide; nor was there any place in which it was
                        more seemly that his corpse should be ill-treated than that where his life
                        had been condemned. <milestone n="87" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>I swear to you, the fortune of the Roman people appeared to me hard and
                        cruel, while it for so many years beheld and endured that man triumphing
                        over the republic. He had polluted the holiest religious observances with
                        his debauchery; he had broken the most authoritative decrees of the senate
                        he had openly bought himself from the judges with money; he had harassed the
                        senate in his tribuneship; he had rescinded acts which had been passed for
                        the sake of the safety of the republic, by the consent of all orders of the
                        state; he had driven me from my country; he had plundered my property; he
                        had burnt my house; he had ill-treated my children and my wife; he had
                        declared a wicked war against Cnaeus Pompeius; he had made slaughter of
                        magistrates and private individuals; he had burnt the house of my brother;
                        he had laid waste Etruria; he had driven numbers of men from their homes and
                        their professions. He kept pursuing and oppressing men; the whole state, all
                        Italy, all the provinces, all foreign kingdoms could not contain his frenzy.
                        Laws were already being drawn up in his house which were to hand us over to
                        the power of our slaves. There was nothing belonging to any one, which he
                        had taken a fancy to, which he did not think would become his in the course
                        of this year. <milestone n="88" unit="section"/> No one was an obstacle to
                        his expectations except Milo; the very man who was most able to be an
                        obstacle to them he thought when he returned again would be reconciled and,
                        as it were, bound to him. The power of Caesar, he said, was all his own. The
                        inclinations of all good men he had treated with <pb n="430"/> contempt,
                        while accomplishing my ruin. Milo alone weighed on his mind. <milestone n="33" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>On this the immortal gods, as I have said before, put into the head of that
                        abandoned and frantic man the idea of laying an ambush for Milo. That pest
                        was not to perish any other way; the republic would never have chastened him
                        by her laws. The senate, I suppose, would have been able to restrain him
                        when praetor. Why, it had not been able to do anything when it tried to
                        restrain him while a private individual. <milestone n="89" unit="section"/>
                        Would the consuls have been vigorous in bridling the praetor? In the first
                        place, if Milo had been slain, he would have had his own consuls. Secondly,
                        what consul would have behaved fearlessly against him as praetor, who
                        remembered that he, when tribune, had offered the most cruel injuries to the
                        virtue of the consuls? He would have oppressed everything; he would have
                        taken possession and held possession of everything. By a new law, the
                        draught of which was found in his house, with the rest of the Clodian laws,
                        he would have made all our slaves his own freedmen. Lastly, if the immortal
                        gods had not inspired him with such ideas that he, an effeminate creature,
                        attempted to slay a most gallant man, you would have no republic at all this
                        day. <milestone n="90" unit="section"/> Would that man when praetor, much
                        more when consul, provided only that these temples and these walls could
                        have stood so long if he had been alive, and could have remained till his
                        consulship; would he, I say, if alive, have done no harm, when even after he
                        was dead he burned the senate-house, one of his satellites, Sextus Clodius,

                        Roman people to one of the orders of the state, should be burnt, profaned,
                        and destroyed?<note anchored="yes">When Clodius was killed, his slaves fled,
                            and left his dead body in the road; and it was brought to Rome the next

                            it was exposed to the view of the populace of the city. The next day the
                            mob, headed by Sextus Clodius, carried the body naked, so as to show his
                            wounds, into the forum, and placed it on the <foreign lang="la">rostra</foreign>; and then the tribunes harangued the people on the
                            subject and wrought them up to such a pitch of the excitement, that,
                            snatching up the body, they carried it into the senate-house, and
                            tearing up the benches and tables, dressed up a funeral pile on the
                            spot, and, together with the body, burnt the senate-house itself with
                            the Basilica Porcia which joined it.</note> and that that should be
                        done, not by <pb n="431"/> an ignorant mob, although that would have been a
                        miserable thing, but by one single person? who, if he dared so much in his
                        character of burner of a dead man, what would he not have done as
                        standard-bearer of a living one? He selected the senate-house, of all the
                        places in the city, to throw him down in, in order that when dead he might
                        burn what he had overturned while alive. </p>

					<p>But I have said enough about the cause; and, perhaps, too much that was
                        foreign to the cause. What remains, except for me to pray and entreat you, O
                        judges, to show that mercy to a most gallant man, which he himself does not
                        implore; but which I, even against his will, implore and demand in his

                        Milo,&mdash;if you see his countenance always the same, his voice and
                        language steady and unaltered,&mdash;do not, on that account, be the

                        assisted all the more on that account. In truth, if in <pb n="432"/> battles

                        and fortune, we are accustomed to dislike those who are timid and suppliant,
                        and who pray to be allowed to live, and if we wish to save those who are
                        brave and courageous, and who offer themselves cheerfully to death; and if
                        we feel more pity for those men who do not ask our pity, than for those who
                        entreat it; how much more ought we to nourish those feelings in the case of

                        judges, I am dispirited and almost killed by those expressions of Milo,
                        which I hear continually; and at the utterance of which I am daily present:
                        &ldquo;May my fellow-citizens fare well,&rdquo; says he;
                        &ldquo;may they fare well. May they be safe, and prosperous, and happy;
                        may this illustrious city, and my country, which I love so well, long
                        endure, however it may treat me; may my fellow-citizens (since I may not
                        enjoy it with them) enjoy the republic in tranquillity without me, but still
                        in consequence of my conduct. I will submit and depart; if it cannot be
                        allowed me to enjoy a virtuous republic, at least I shall be at a distance
                        from a bad one; and the first well regulated and free city that I arrive at
                        in that will I rest. Oh how vain,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;are the
                        labours which I have undertaken! Oh how fallacious have been my hopes!
                            <milestone n="94" unit="section"/> Oh how empty all my thoughts! When as
                        tribune of the people, when the republic was oppressed, I had devoted myself
                        to the senate, which, when I came into office, was utterly extinct; and to
                        the Roman knights, whose power was enfeebled, and to the virtuous part of
                        the citizens, who had given up all their authority under the arms of
                        Clodius; could I ever have thought that I should fail to find protection
                        from the citizens? When I had restored you&rdquo; (for he very
                        frequently converses with me and addresses me) &ldquo;to your country,
                        could I ever suppose that I myself should have no place in my country? Where
                        now is the senate which we followed? where are those Roman knights, those
                        knights,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;so devoted to you? where is the zeal
                        of the municipal towns? where is the voice of Italy? what, above all, has
                        become of that voice of yours, O Marcus Tullius, which has been an
                        assistance to many; what has become of your voice and defensive eloquence?
                        am I the only person whom it is unable to help, I who have so often exposed
                        myself to death for your sake?&rdquo; <milestone n="35" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="95" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>Nor does he say these things to me. O judges, weeping, as I now repeat them;
                        but with the same unmoved countenance that you behold. For he says, he never
                        did all the things which he had done for citizens who are ungrateful;
                        ungrateful, he says, they are not. That they are timid and thinking too much
                        of every danger, he does not deny. He says, that he treated the common
                        people, and that multitude of the lower class which, while they had Publius
                        Clodius for their leader, threatened the safety of all of you in such a way,
                        in order to render all your lives more secure; that he not only subdued it
                        by his virtue, but won it over at the expense of three estates which he
                        inherited. Nor has he any apprehension that while he was conciliating the
                        common people by his liberality, he was not also securing your attachment by
                        his singular services to the republic. He says, that the good-will of the
                        senate towards him has been repeatedly experienced by him in the times that
                        have lately gone by; and that he shall carry with him, and ever retain in
                        his recollection, the way in which you and all your order flocked to meet
                        him, the zeal you showed in his behalf, and the kindness of your language to
                        him, whatever may be the destiny which fortune allots to him. <milestone n="96" unit="section"/> He remembers, also, that the voice of the crier
                        proclaiming his triumph, was the only thing wanting to him, but that he was
                        declared consul by the unanimous vote of the people, and that was the great
                        object of his ambition. And now if all these things are to go against him,
                        it will be only the suspicion of guilt, not the reality of any crime, which
                        has injured him. He adds this, which is unquestionably true; that brave and
                        wise men are not in the habit of setting their hearts so much on the rewards
                        for virtuous conduct as on the fact of their conduct being so; that he has
                        never acted throughout his life in any but the most honourable manner, since
                        there can be nothing better for a man to do than to deliver his country from
                        dangers; that those men are happy for whom such conduct procures honour
                        among their fellow-citizens, <milestone n="97" unit="section"/> but yet,
                        that those men are not miserable who have exceeded their fellow-citizens in
                        good deeds. Moreover, that of all the rewards of virtue, if one is to make
                        an estimate of the different rewards, the most honourable of all is glory;
                        that this is the only reward which can make amends for the shortness of
                        life, by the recollection of posterity; which can cause us <pb n="434"/>
                        while absent, to be present when dead to be still alive; that this is the
                        thing by the steps of which men appear to mount even to heaven. <milestone n="98" unit="section"/>

					<p>&ldquo;Concerning me,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;the Roman people and
                        all nations will be continually talking. The remotest ages will never be
                        silent about me. Even at this very time when the firebrands of envy are
                        being hurled against me by my enemies, still I am celebrated in every
                        company of men, who express their thanks to me, who congratulate themselves
                        on my conduct, who make me the sole topic of their conversation. I say
                        nothing of the days of festival, and sacrifice, and joyful celebration in
                        Etruria. This is the hundredth, or I rather think the hundred and first day
                        since the death of Publius Clodius; a day on which, wherever the boundaries
                        of the Roman empire extend, there did not only the report of, but the joy
                        caused by that occurrence penetrate. Wherefore,&rdquo; said he,
                        &ldquo;I am not anxious as to where this body of mine may be; since the
                        glory of my name already is and always will be in every country upon

					<p>This is what you have constantly said to me, O Milo, when these men who hear
                        me now have been absent; but this is what I say to you when they are present
                        to listen. I cannot indeed, praise you sufficiently for being of such a
                        spirit as you are; but the more godlike that virtue of yours is, the greater
                        is the pain which I feel at being separated from you. Nor, indeed, if you
                        are taken from me, will the complaints, which are all that is left to me, do
                        anything to comfort me, or to prevent my being angry with those men from
                        whom I have received so severe a blow. For it is not my enemies who will
                        tear you from me, but those who are my greatest friends. It is not men who
                        have at times deserved ill at my hands, but those who have always deserved
                        exceedingly well. You never, O judges, will inflict such grief upon me,
                        (although, what grief can be so great as this?) but you will never inflict
                        this particular grief upon me, of forcing me to forget how greatly you have
                        always regarded me. And if you, yourselves, have forgotten it, or if any
                        part of my conduct has offended you, why do you not make me atone for that
                        offense rather than Milo? For I shall have lived gloriously enough if I die
                        before seeing any such great misfortune happen to him. </p>

                        that no exertion that affection, or that zeal, or that gratitude could

                        Annius. For your sake I have courted the enmity of powerful citizens; I have
                        repeatedly exposed my person and my life to the weapons of your enemies; I
                        have thrown myself as a suppliant at the feet of many for your sake; I have

                        prepared against you, or any struggle, or any danger of death, I claim my
                        share in that. What remains now? What is there that I can say, or that I can
                        do in return for your services to me, except considering whatever fortune is
                        yours mine also? I do not object, I do not refuse so to consider it. And I
                        entreat you, O judges, either to add to the kindnesses which you have
                        already conferred on me by granting me this man's safety, or else to take

                        not a punishment. Let him continue to cherish these ideas in which he was
                        born. What will you think yourselves, O judges? What will be your feelings?
                        Will you preserve the recollection of Milo, and drive away the man himself?
                        And will you allow any place in the whole earth to be more worthy to receive
                        this virtue of his than this place which produced him? You, you, I appeal to
                        you, O you brave men, who have shed much of your blood for the sake of the
                        republic. I appeal to you, O centurions, and to you, O soldiers, in this
                        time of danger to a brave man and an invincible citizen. While you are not
                        only looking on, but armed, and standing as guards around this court of

                        intended? For that is the spring from which all the distresses of myself and
                        my friends arise. Why did you wish me to return to my country? Was it in
                        order that I might look on while those men were being driven out, by whose
                        efforts I had been restored? Do not, I entreat you, suffer my return to be
                        more miserable than even my departure was. For how can I think that I have
                        been restored if I am torn from those men by whom I was restored? <milestone n="38" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>Would that the immortal gods had granted, (I must entreat your permission to
                        say it, O my country, for I fear lest it should be a wicked wish as far as
                        you are concerned, though it may be a pious one for Milo,)&mdash;would
                        that they had granted that Publius Clodius should not only be alive, but
                        should even be praetor, consul, dictator, rather than I should see this
                        sight! <milestone n="104" unit="section"/> O ye immortal gods, before I
                        should see this brave man, this man who deserves to be saved by you, O
                        judges, in this plight! &ldquo;Say not so, say not so,&rdquo; says
                        Milo. &ldquo;Rather let him have suffered the penalty which he deserved,
                        and let us, if so it must be, suffer what we have not deserved.&rdquo; </p>
					<p>Shall this man, born for his country, die in any other land except his
                        country? or, as it may perchance turn out for his country? Will you preserve
                        the monuments of this man's courage, and yet allow no sepulchre containing
                        his body to exist in Italy? Will any one by his vote banish this man from
                        this city, when all other cities will gladly invite him to them if he is
                        driven out from among you? <milestone n="105" unit="section"/> O happy will
                        that land be which shall receive him! Ungrateful will this land be if it
                        banishes him; miserable if it loses him. </p>
					<p>However, I must make an end. Nor, indeed, can I speak any longer for weeping;
                        and this man forbids me to defend him by tears. I pray and entreat you, O
                        judges, when you are giving your votes, to dare to decide as you think just.
                        And believe me that man<note anchored="yes">Cnaeus Pompeius.</note> will be
                        sure greatly to approve of your virtue, and justice, and good faith; who, in
                        selecting the judges, selected all the best, and wisest and most fearless

                            Pompey, between whom and Caesar (who was in his second consulship) the
                            civil war was just breaking out. But he and Caelius were both killed by

					<head>THE SPEECH OF M. T. CICERO IN DEFENCE OF CAIUS RABIRIUS POSTUMUS.</head>
					<argument>
						<head>THE ARGUMENT.</head>
						<p>When Gabinius, the colleague of Piso, returned from his province of
                            Syria, he was prosecuted on two indictments; in the first prosecution
                            Cicero appeared as a witness against him; but he was acquitted, as
                            Cicero says in his letters to his brother Quintus, (<bibl n="Cic. Q.fr. 3.4.1">3.4,</bibl>) in consequence of the stupidity of
                            Lentulus, the prosecutor, and the great exertion of Pompey, and the
                            corruption of the judges. In the second prosecution Cicero was prevailed
                            on by Pompey to defend him, but he was condemned to perpetual
                            banishment. The trial of Caius Rabirius Postumus, a Roman knight, arose
                            out of that trial of Gabinius. It had been one of the articles against
                            him, that he had received an enormous sum for restoring Ptolemy to his
                            kingdom of Egypt; but when he was convicted, his estate was found
                            inadequate to meet the damages which he was condemned to pay, and the
                            deficiency was now demanded from those through whose hands the
                            management of his money affairs had passed, and who were supposed to
                            have been sharers in the spoil; and of these men the chief was Rabirius,
                            who was now accused of having advised Gabinius to undertake Ptolemy's
                            restoration; of having accompanied him; of having been employed by him
                            to solicit the payment of the money, and of having lived at Alexandria
                            for that purpose in the king's service as the public receiver of the
                            king's taxes, and wearing the dress of an Egyptian. The prosecution was
                            instituted under the provisions of the <foreign lang="la">Lex
                                Julia</foreign>, concerning extortion and peculation. It was
                            conducted by Caius Memmius Gemellus. Rabirius was acquitted; and, though
                            it was to please Pompey that Cicero had undertaken his defence, he
                            afterwards attached himself to Caesar, and was employed by him in the
                            war in Africa and in Sicily.</p>

					<p>If there is any one, O judges, who thinks Caius Rabirius to be blamed for
                        having entrusted his securely founded and well-established fortunes to the
                        power and caprice of a sovereign, he may back his opinion by a reference not
                        only to mine, but also to the feelings of the man himself who did so. For
                        there is no one who is more grieved at the line of conduct which he then
                        adopted than he is himself. Although we are very much in the habit of
                        judging of the wisdom of a plan <pb n="439"/> by the result, and of saying
                        that the man whose designs have succeeded has shown a great deal of
                        foresight, and that he who has failed has shown none at all. If the king had
                        had any honesty, nothing would have been considered more sagacious than the
                        conduct of Postumus; but because the king deceived him he is said to have
                        acted as madly as possible; so that it appears now that nothing is a proof
                        of a man being wise, unless he can foresee the future. </p>
					<p>
                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> But still, if there he any one who thinks
                        that Postumus's conduct, whether it proceeded from a vain hope, or from a
                        not sufficiently considered calculation or (to use the strongest possible
                        terms) from pure rashness deserves to be blamed, I will not object to his
                        entertaining that opinion. But I do beg this, that as he sees that his
                        designs have been punished with the greatest cruelty by fortune himself, he
                        will not think it necessary to add any additional bitterness to the ruin
                        with which he is already overwhelmed. It is quite enough not to help to set
                        men up again who have fallen through imprudence; but to press down those
                        already fallen, or to increase their impetus when falling, is unquestionably
                        most barbarous. Especially, O judges, when this principle is almost
                        implanted by nature in the race of man, that those men who are of a family
                        which considerable glory has already distinguished, should with the greatest
                        eagerness pursue the same path as their ancestors, seeing that the virtue of
                        their fathers is celebrated in the recollection and conversation of all men;
                        just as not only did Scipio imitate Paullus in his renown gained by military
                        exploits; not only did his son imitate Maximus; but his own son also
                        imitated Decius in the devotion of his life, and the exact manner of his
                        death. Let small things, O judges, be compared in this way to great things.
                            <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>For, when we were children, this man's father Caius Curius was a most gallant
                        chief of the equestrian order, and a most extensive farmer of the public
                        revenues, a man whose greatness of spirit as displayed in carrying on his
                        business men would not have so greatly esteemed, if an incredible kindness
                        had not also distinguished him; so that while increasing his property, he
                        seemed not so much to be seeking to gratify his avarice, as to procure
                        additional means for exerting his kindness. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> My client, being this man's son, although he had never seen his father,
                        still under the guidance of nature <pb n="440"/> herself,&mdash;who is a
                        very powerful guide,&mdash;and instigated by the continual conversation
                        of every one in his family, was naturally led on to adopt a similar line of
                        conduct to that of his father. He engaged in extensive business. He entered
                        into many contracts. He took a great share of the public revenues. He
                        trusted different nations. His transactions spread over many provinces. He
                        devoted himself also to the service of kings. He had already previously lent
                        a large sum of money to this very king of Alexandria; and in the meantime he
                        never ceased enriching his friends; sending them on commissions; giving them
                        a share in his contracts; increasing their estates or supporting them with
                        his credit. Why need I say more? He gave a faithful representation of his
                        father's career and habits of life in his own magnanimity and liberality. </p>
					<p>In the meantime, Ptolemaeus being expelled from his kingdom with treachery,
                        with evil designs (as the Sibyl said, expression of which Postumus found out
                        the meaning) came to Rome. This unhappy man lent him money, as he was in
                        want and asked for it; and that was not the first time, (for he had lent him
                        money before while he was king, without seeing him.) And he thought that he
                        was not lending his money rashly, because no one doubted that he would be
                        restored to his kingdom by the senate and people of Rome. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> But he went still further in making him presents and
                        loans. And he lent him not his own money only, but also that of his friends.
                        A very foolish thing to do&mdash;who denies it? at all events, who is
                        there who does not now remind him of it? How could one think that a sensible
                        proceeding which has turned out ill? But it is difficult not to carry out to
                        the end a line of conduct which one has begun with sanguine hopes.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>The king was a suppliant to him. He asked him every sort of favour; he
                        promised him every sort of recompense. So that Postumus was at last
                        compelled to fear that he might lose what he had already lent if he put a
                        stop to his loans. But no one could possibly be more affable, no one could
                        be more kind than the king; so that it was easier to repent having begun to
                        lend than to find out how to stop. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>Here first rises a charge against my client. They say that the senate was
                        bribed. O ye immortal gods! is this that much-desired impartiality of the
                        courts of justice? Those who have bribed us are put on their trial, we who
                        have been <pb n="441"/> bribed are exposed to no such dangers. What, then,
                        shall I do? Shall I here defend the senate, O judges? I ought indeed, to do
                        so here and everywhere, so well has that body deserved at my hands. But that
                        is not the question at the present moment; nor is that affair in the least
                        connected with the cause of Postumus. Although money was supplied by
                        Postumus for the expense of his journey, and for the splendour of his
                        appointments, and for the royal retinue, and though contracts were drawn up
                        in the Alban villa of Cnaeus Pompeius when he left Rome; still he who
                        supplied the money had no right to ask on what he who received the money was
                        spending it. For he was lending it not to a robber, but to a king; nor to a
                        king who was an enemy of the Roman people, but to him whose return to his
                        kingdom he saw was granted to him by the senate, and entrusted to the consul
                        to provide for; nor to a king who was a stranger to this empire, but to one
                        with whom he had seen a treaty made in the Capitol. </p>
					<p>
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> But if the man who lends money is to
                        blame, and not the man who has made a scandalous use of the money which has
                        been lent to him, then let that man be condemned who has made a sword and
                        sold it and not the man who with that sword has slain a citizen. Wherefore,
                        neither you, O Caius Memmius, ought to wish the senate, to support the
                        authority of which you have devoted yourself from your youth upwards, to
                        labour under such disrepute, nor ought I to speak in defence of conduct
                        which is not the subject of the present inquiry. For the cause of Postumus,
                        whatever it is, is at all events unconnected with the cause of the senate.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> And if I show that it has no
                        connection with Gabinius either, then certainly you will have not a leg to
                        stand upon. <milestone n="4" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>For this cause is an inquiry, &ldquo;What has become of the
                        money?&rdquo; a sort of appendix as it were to an action which has been
                        already decided, and in which a man has been convicted. An action was
                        brought successfully against Aulus Gabinius, and he was condemned in
                        damages; but no securities were given for the payment of them, nor did the
                        people get out of his property a sum sufficient for the payment of those
                        damages. The law is impartial. The Julian law orders that what is deficient
                        should be required of those into whose hands the money, which the man who
                        has been convicted received, came. <pb n="442"/> If this is a new provision
                        in the Julian law,&mdash;as there are many clauses of a severer and
                        stricter tendency than those which are found in the ancient laws,&mdash;
                        let us also have this new description of tribunal before which to prosecute
                        the inquiry. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> But if this clause is
                        transferred word for word not only from the Cornelian law but from the
                        Servilian law, which is older still; then, in the name of the immortal gods,
                        what is it that we are doing, O judges? Or what is this new principle of new
                        legal proceedings that we are introducing into the republic? For the ancient
                        mode of proceeding was well known to all of you, and if practice is the best
                        of teachers it ought to be known to me above all men. For I have prosecuted
                        men for extortion and peculation; I have sat as judge; I have conducted
                        inquiries as praetor; I have defended many men; there is no step in such
                        proceedings which can give a man any facility in speaking in which I have
                        not taken a part. </p>
					<p>This is what I assert:&mdash;that no one ever was put on his trial on the
                        formula, &ldquo;What had become of that money,&rdquo; who had not
                        been summoned as a witness on the action for damages. But in the action in
                        this instance, no one was summoned except in consequence of something said
                        by witnesses, or something which appeared in the accounts of private
                        individuals, or in the accounts of the cities. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Therefore, when actions were being brought, those men
                        were usually present who had some apprehension about themselves; and then
                        when they were summoned, then, if they thought it advantageous for them,
                        they proceeded at once to contradict what had been said. But if they were
                        afraid of unpopularity, because the facts in question were recent, they
                        answered at some future time; and when they had done this, many of them
                        gained their object. <milestone n="5" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>But this is quite a novel way of managing business, and one utterly unheard
                        of before this time. In the previous action Postumus name never once occurs.
                        In the action, do I say? You yourselves, O judges, lately sat as judges on
                        Aulus Gabinius. Did any one witness then mention Postumus? Any witness? did
                        ever the prosecutor name him? Did you, in short, in the whole of that trial
                        once hear the name of Postumus? <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>Postumus, then, is not an additional criminal implicated in the cause, which
                        has been already decided. But still one <pb n="443"/> Roman knight has been
                        dragged before the court as a defendant, on a charge of extortion and
                        peculation. On what account-books is this charge founded? On some which were
                        not read on the trial of Aulus Gabinius. By what witness is it supported? By
                        some one who never once mentioned his name at that time. On the sentence of
                        what arbitrator do they rely? On one in which no mention whatever was made
                        of Postumus. In accordance with the provisions of what law? Of one under
                        which he is not liable. </p>
					<p>Here now, O judges, the affair is one which has need of all your acuteness
                        and of all your good sense. For you ought to consider what it is becoming to
                        you to do, and not what is lawful for you. For if you ask what is lawful,
                        you certainly have the power to remove any one whom you please out of the
                        city. It is the voting tablet which gives you that power; and at the same
                        time it conceals the capricious exercise of it. No one has any need to fear
                        the consciousness of the tablet if he has no reverence for his own
                        conscience. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Where, then, is the wisdom of
                        the judge shown? In this, that he considers not only what he has the power
                        to do, but also what he ought to do; and he does not recollect only what
                        power has been committed to him, but also to what extent it has been
                        committed. You have a tablet given you on which to record your judgment.
                        According to what law? To the Julian law about extortion and peculation.
                        Concerning what defendant? Concerning a Roman knight. But that body is not
                        liable to the operation of that law. <gap desc="* * * *"/>But now I hear
                        what you say. Postumus, then, is prosecuted under that law, from the
                        operation of which not only he, but his whole order, is released and wholly
                        flee. <milestone n="6" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="13" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>Here I will not at present implore your aid, O Roman knights&mdash;you
                        whose privileges are attacked by this prosecution,&mdash;before I
                        implore you, O senators, whose good faith towards this order of knights is
                        at stake; that good faith which has been often experienced before, and which
                        has been lately proved in this very cause. For when&mdash;when that most
                        virtuous and admirable consul Cnaeus Pompeius made a motion with respect to
                        this very inquiry&mdash;some, but very few, unfavourable opinions were
                        delivered, which voted that prefects, and scribes, and all the retinue of
                        magistrates were liable to the provisions of this law, you&mdash;you
                        yourselves, I say&mdash;and the senate, <pb n="444"/> in a very full
                        house, resisted this; and although at that time, on account of the offences
                        committed by many men, people's minds were inflamed so that even innocent
                        people were in danger, still, though you could not wholly extinguish its
                        unpopularity, at all events you would not allow fuel to be added to the
                        existing fire. </p>
					<p><milestone n="14" unit="section"/> In this spirit did the senate act. What
                        next? What are you, O Roman knights, what are you about to do, I pray?
                        Glaucia, a profligate but still a shrewd man, was in the habit of warning
                        the people when any law was being read to attend to the first line of it. If
                        the first word was &ldquo;dictator, consul, praetor, master of the
                        horse,&rdquo; then not to trouble themselves about it; they might know
                        that it was no concern of theirs. But if it began &ldquo;Whoever after
                        the passing of this law,&rdquo; then they had better take care that they
                        were not made liable to any new judicial proceedings. </p>
					<p><milestone n="15" unit="section"/> Now do you, O Roman knights, take care.
                        You know that I was born of your order; that all my feelings have always
                        been enlisted in your cause. I say nothing of what I am now saying but with
                        the deepest anxiety and the greatest regard for your order. Other men may be
                        attached to other men and to other orders; I have always been devoted to
                        you, I warn you, I forewarn you, I give you notice while the affair and the
                        cause are still undecided; I call all men and gods to witness. While you
                        have it in your power, while it is lawful for you, beware lest you establish
                        for yourselves and for your order a harder condition than you may be able to
                        bear. This evil (believe me) will crawl on and extend further than you

					<p>When a most powerful and noble tribune of the people, Marcus Drusus, proposed
                        one formula of inquiry affecting the equestrian
                        order,&mdash;&ldquo;If any one had taken money on account of a
                        judicial decision,&rdquo;&mdash;the Roman knights openly resisted
                        it. Why? Did they wish to be allowed to act in such a manner? Far from it.
                        They thought this cause of receiving money not only shameful, but actually
                        impious. But they argued in this way: that those men only ought to be made
                        liable to the operation of any law, who of their own judgment submitted to
                        such conditions of life. &ldquo;The highest rank,&rdquo; say they,
                        &ldquo;in the state is a great pleasure; and the curule chair, and the

                        having an image to keep alive the recollection of one with posterity.
                            <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> There is also some anxiety mingled
                        with this pleasure, and a greater apprehension of laws and of trials. We
                        have never despised those considerations;&rdquo; (for so they argued;)
                        &ldquo;but we have adopted this tranquil and easy kind of life, which,
                        because it does not bring honours with it is also free from
                        annoyance.&rdquo; &ldquo;You are just as much a judge as I am a
                        senator.&rdquo; &ldquo;Just so, but you sought for the one honour,
                        and I am compelled to accept of the other; wherefore, it ought to be lawful
                        for me either to decline being a judge, or else I ought not to be subject to
                        any new law which ought properly to regulate only the conduct of
                        senators.&rdquo; <milestone n="18" unit="section"/> Will you, O Roman
                        knights, abandon this privilege which you have received from your fathers? I
                        warn you not to do so. Men will be hurried before these courts of justice,
                        not only whenever they fall into all deserved unpopularity, but whenever
                        spiteful people say a word against them, if you do not take care to prevent
                        it. If it were now told you that opinions were pronounced in the senate that
                        you should be liable to be proceeded against under these laws, you would
                        think it necessary to run in crowds to the senate-house. If the law was
                        passed, you would throng to the <foreign lang="la">rostra</foreign>. The
                        senate has decided that you are exempt from the operation of this law; the
                        people has never subjected you to it; you have met together here free from

					<p>For if it was imputed as a crime to Postumus, who was neither a tribune, nor
                        a prefect, nor one of his companions from Italy, nor even a friend of
                        Gabinius's, how will these men hereafter defend themselves, who, being of
                        your order, have been implicated with our magistrates in these causes?
                            <milestone n="8" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>&ldquo;You,&rdquo; says the prosecutor, &ldquo;instigated to
                        Gabinius to restore the king.&rdquo; My own good faith does not allow me
                        to speak with severity of Gabinius. For after having been reconciled to him,
                        and given up that most bitter hostility with which I regarded him, and after
                        having defended him with the greatest zeal, I ought not to attack him now
                        that he is in distress. And even if the influence of Cnaeus Pompeius had not
                        reconciled me to him while he was in prosperity, his own disasters would do
                        so now. <milestone n="20" unit="section"/> But still, when you say that <pb n="446"/> Gabinius went to Alexandria at the instigation of Postumus, if
                        you place no confidence in what was alleged in the defence of Gabinius, do
                        you forget also what you stated in your own speech for the prosecution?
                        Gabinius said that he did that for the sake of the republic, because he was
                        afraid of the fleet of Archelaus,&mdash;because he thought that
                        otherwise the sea would he entirely full of pirates. He said, moreover, that
                        he was authorized to do so by a law. You, his enemy, deny that. I pardon
                        your denial, and so much the more because the decision was contrary to the
                        statement of Gabinius. </p>
					<p>I return, therefore, to the charge, and to your speech for the prosecution.
                            <milestone n="21" unit="section"/> Why did you keep crying out that ten
                        thousand talents had been promised to Gabinius? I suppose it was necessary
                        to find out a very civil man indeed, who should be able to prevail on one
                        whom you call the most avaricious of men, not to despise immoderately two
                        hundred and forty millions of sesterces. Whatever may have been the
                        intention with which Gabinius acted, it certainly was his own unsuggested
                        intention. Whatever sort of idea it was, it was Gabinius's own. Whether, as
                        he said himself his object was glory, or whether, as you insist, it was
                        money, it was for himself that he sought it. Had Gabinius any companion or
                        attendant? He says, no. For he had departed from Rome in deference to the
                        authority, not of Gabinius, whose business it was not but of Publius
                        Lentulus, a most illustrious man, given to him by the senate, and with a
                        definite design, and with very sanguine hopes. <milestone n="22" unit="section"/>

					<p>But he was the king's steward. Yes, and he was in the king's prison, and his
                        life was nearly taken away. He bore many things besides, which the caprice
                        of the king and necessity compelled him to endure. So that all these matters
                        come under one single reproach, that he entered his kingdom, and that he
                        entrusted himself to the power of the king. A very foolish action, if we
                        must say the truth. For what can be more foolish than for a Roman knight, a
                        man of this city, I say, a citizen of this republic, which, of all others,
                        is, and always has been, most especially free, to go into a place where he
                        is forced to obey and be the steward of another? <milestone n="9" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="23" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>But, nevertheless, may I not pardon this in Postumus, who is not a man of
                        much learning, when I see that the very <pb n="447"/> wisest men have fallen
                        into the same error? We have heard that that; great man, beyond all
                        comparison the most learned man that all Greece ever produced, Plato, was in
                        the greatest danger, and was exposed to the most treacherous designs by the
                        wickedness of Dionysius, the tyrant of Sicily, to whom be had entrusted
                        himself. We know that Callisthenes, a very learned man, the companion of
                        Alexander the Great, was slain by Alexander. We know that
                        Demetrius,&mdash;he, too, being a citizen of the free republic of
                        Athens, the affairs of which he had conducted with the greatest ability, and
                        being also a man eminent for, and deeply impressed with,
                        learning,&mdash;the one, I mean, who was surnamed Phalereus, was
                        deprived of his life in that selfsame kingdom of Egypt having had an asp
                        applied to his body. <milestone n="24" unit="section"/> I plainly confess
                        that nothing more insane can be done, than for a man willingly to come into
                        a place where he will lose his liberty. But the still greater folly which he
                        had already committed is his excuse for the folly of this subsequent
                        conduct; for that causes this most stupid action, the act I mean, of going
                        into the kingdom, and of trusting himself to the king, to appear a wise and
                        sensible step. At all events, it is not so much the act of one who is for
                        ever a fool, as one who is wise too late, after he has got into difficulties
                        through his folly, to endeavour to release himself by whatever means he can.
                            <milestone n="25" unit="section"/> Let, then, that be rewarded as a
                        fixed and certain point, which can neither be moved nor changed, in which
                        those who look fairly at the matter say that Postumus had entertained hopes,
                        those who are unfavourable to him say that he made a blunder, and he himself
                        confesses that he acted like a madman, in lending his own money, and that of
                        his friends, to the king, to the great danger of his own fortunes; still,
                        when this had once been begun, it was necessary to endure these other evils,
                        in order, at last, to reunite himself to his friends. Therefore, you may
                        reproach him as often as you please with having worn an Egyptian robe, and
                        with having had about him other ornaments which are not worn by a Roman
                        citizen. For every time that you mention any one of these particulars, you
                        are only repeating that same thing&mdash;that he lent money rashly to
                        the king, and that he trusted his fortunes and his character to the royal
                        caprice. <milestone n="26" unit="section"/> He did so rashly, I confess it;
                        but the case could not possibly be changed then; either he was forced <pb n="448"/> to put on an Egyptian cloak at Alexandria, in order afterwards
                        to be able to wear his gown at Rome; or, if he retained his gown in Egypt he
                        must have discarded all hope of recovering his fortunes. <milestone n="10" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p> For the sake of luxury and pleasure we have often seen, not only ordinary

                        much-frequented town. We have even seen Lucius Sulla, that great commander,
                        in a cloak. And you can now see the statue of Lucius Scipio, who conducted
                        the war in Asia, and defeated Antiochus standing in the Capitol, not only
                        with a cloak, but also with Greek slippers. And yet these men not only were
                        not liable to be tried for wearing them, but they were not even talked
                        about; and, at all events, the excuse of necessity will be a more valid
                        defence for Publius Rutilius Rufus; for when he had been caught at Mitylene
                        by Mithridates, he avoided the cruelty with which the king treated all who
                        wore the Roman gown, by changing his apparel. Therefore, that Rutilius, who
                        was a pattern to our citizens of virtue, and of the ancient dignity, and of
                        prudence, and a man of consular rank, put on slippers and a cloak. Nor did
                        any one think of reproaching the man with having done so, but all imputed it
                        to the necessity of the time. And shall that garment bring an accusation
                        upon Postumus, which afforded him a hope that he might at some time or other
                        recover his fortune? </p>

                        judges, this one means of saving his money was proposed to Postumus by the

                        were, the stewardship of the royal revenues. And he could not do that unless
                        he became the steward. For he uses that title which had been given to the
                        office by the king. The business seemed an odious one to Postumus, but he
                        had actually no power of declining it. The name itself, too, annoying; but
                        the business had that name or old among those people, it was not now newly
                        imposed by the king. He detested also that dress, but without it he could
                        neither have the title nor fill his office. Therefore, I say, that he was
                            <pb n="449"/> compelled by force to act as he did,&mdash;by force

					<p>Do not then, impute his hard fortune to him as a fault; do not think the

					<p>But from the circumstance of this employment itself another charge arises.
                        For the prosecutor says, that while Postumus was collecting the money for
                        Gabinius, he also amassed money for himself out of the tenths belonging to
                        the generals. I do not quite understand what this charge
                        means;&mdash;whether Postumus is charged with having made an addition of
                        one per cent to the tenth, as our own collectors are in the habit of doing,
                        or whether he deducted that sum from the total amount of the tenths. If he
                        made that addition, then eleven thousand talents came to Gabinius. But not
                        only was the amount mentioned by you ten thousand talents, but that also was
                        the sum at which it was estimated by them. <milestone n="31" unit="section"/> I add this consideration also: how can it be likely, that when the burden
                        of the tributes was already so heavy, an addition of our thousand talents
                        could he made to so large a sum which was to be collected? or that, when a
                        man, a most avaricious man as you make him out, was to receive <pb n="450"/>
                        so large a reward, he would put up with a diminution of a thousand talents?
                        For it was not like Gabinius, to give up so vast a portion of what he had a
                        right to; nor was it natural for the king to allow him to impose so great an
                        additional tax on his subjects. Witnesses will be produced, deputies from
                        Alexandria. They have not said a word against Gabinius. Nay, they have even
                        praised Gabinius. Where, then, is that custom? what has become of the usages
                        of courts of justice? Where are your precedents? Is it usual to produce a
                        witness to give evidence against a man who has been the collector of money,
                        when he has not been able to say a word against the man in whose name the
                        money collected? <milestone n="32" unit="section"/> Nay more; if it is usual
                        to produce a man who has said nothing, is it usual to produce one who has
                        spoken in his praise? Is it not customary rather to look on such a cause as
                        already decided, and to think that it is sufficient to read the previous
                        evidence of the witnesses, without producing the men themselves? <milestone n="12" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>And this intimate companion and friend of mine says also that the men of
                        Alexandria had the same reason for praising Gabinius that I had for
                        defending him. My reason, O Caius Memmius, for defending him was, that I had
                        become reconciled to him. Nor do I repent of considering my friendships
                        immortal, but my enmities mortal. For if you think that I defended him
                        against my will, because I did not like to offend Pompeius, you are very
                        ignorant both of his character and of mine. <milestone n="33" unit="section"/> For Pompeius would not have wished me to do anything contrary to my
                        inclination for his sake. Nor would I, to whom the liberty of all the
                        citizens has always been the dearest object, ever have abandoned my own. As
                        long as I was on terms of the greatest enmity to Gabinius, Pompeius was in
                        no respect the less my dearest friend. Nor after I had made to his authority
                        that concession to which it was entitled from me, did I feign anything I
                        could not behave with treachery so as to injure the very man whom I had just
                        been obliging. For by refusing to be reconciled to my enemy, I was doing no
                        harm to Pompeius; but if I had allowed him to reconcile us, and yet had
                        myself been reconciled to Gabinius with a treacherous intention I should
                        have behaved dishonestly,&mdash;principally, indeed, to myself, but in
                        the next degree to him also,. <pb n="451"/>

					<p>But, however, I will say no more about myself. Let us return to those
                        Alexandrians. What a face those men have! What audacity! The other day, when
                        you were present at the trial of Gabinius, they were cross-examined at every
                        third word they said. They declared that the money had not been given to
                        Gabinius. The evidence of Pompeius was read at the same time, to the effect
                        that be had written to the king that no money had been given to Gabinius
                        except for military purposes. &ldquo;At that time,&rdquo; says the
                        prosecutor, &ldquo;the judges refused to believe the
                        Alexandrians.&rdquo; What does he say next? &ldquo;Now they do
                        believe them.&rdquo; <milestone n="35" unit="section"/> Why so?
                        &ldquo;Because they now affirm what they then denied.&rdquo; What of
                        that? Is this the way in which we are to regard witnesses,&mdash;to
                        refuse them belief when they deny a thing, but to believe the very same men
                        when they affirm a thing? But if they told the truth then, when they spoke
                        with every appearance of truth, they are telling lies now. If they told lies
                        then, they must give us good proof that they are now speaking the truth. Why
                        need I say more. Let them hold their tongues. We have heard men speak of
                        Alexandria before. Now we know it from our own experience. Thence it is,
                        that every sort of chicanery comes. Thence, I say, comes every sort of
                        deceit. It is from that people that all the plots of the three writers are
                        derived. And, indeed, there is nothing which I wish for more, O judges, than
                        to see the witnesses face to face. <milestone n="13" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="36" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>They gave their evidence a little while ago before this tribunal, at the same
                        time that we ourselves did. With what effrontery did they then repudiate the
                        charge of this ten thousand talents! You are acquainted by this time with
                        the absurd ways of the Greeks. They shrugged their shoulders at that time, I
                        suppose, in respect of the existing emergency; but now there is no such
                        necessity. When any one has once perjured himself he cannot be believed
                        afterwards, not even he swears by more gods than he did before; especially.
                        O judges, when in trials of this sort there is not usually any room for a
                        new witness; and on that account the same judges are retained who were
                        judges in the case of the original defendant, because everything is already
                        known to them, and nothing new can be invented. <milestone n="37" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>Actions on the formula, &ldquo;What has become of that <pb n="452"/>
                        money,&rdquo; are usually decided, not by any proceeding taken
                        especially with reference to them, but by those which were adopted in the
                        case of the original defendant. Therefore, if Gabinius had either given
                        sureties, or if the people had got as large a sum out of his property as the
                        damages amounted to, then, however large a sum had been obtained from him by
                        Postumus, none would have been demanded back again. So that it may easily be
                        seen, that in a case of this sort, the money is only demanded back again
                        from any one who has been clearly proved in the former action to have become
                        possessed of it. But at present what is the question under discussion? Where
                        in the world are we? What can be either said or imagined so unprecedented,
                        so unsuitable, so preposterous as this? <milestone n="38" unit="section"/>
                        That man is being prosecuted who did not receive any money from the king, as
                        it has been decided that Gabinius did, but who lent a vast sum of money to
                        the king. Therefore, he gave it to Gabinius, as he certainly did not repay
                        it to Postumus. Tell me now, I beg since the man who owed Postumus money did
                        not pay it to him, but gave money to Gabinius, now that Gabinius is
                        condemned, has he paid him back that money, or does he owe it to him still?
                            <milestone n="14" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>&ldquo;Oh, but Postumus has the money, and is hiding it.&rdquo; For
                        there are men who talk in this way. What a strange sort of ostentation and
                        vaingloriousness is this? If he had never originally had anything, still, if
                        he had acquired a fortune, there could be no reason why he should conceal
                        his having it. But in the ease of a man who had inherited two ample and
                        splendid patrimonial estates, and who had, moreover, increased his property
                        by legitimate and honourable means, what reason could there possibly he why
                        he should wish to be supposed to have nothing? <milestone n="39" unit="section"/> Are we to believe that, when he was induced by the hope
                        of interest to lend his money, his object was to have as large an estate as
                        possible, but that after he had got back the money which he had lent, he
                        then wished to be thought to be in want? He is certainly aiming at quite a
                        new sort of glory. &ldquo;And again,&rdquo; says the prosecutor,
                        &ldquo;he acted in a very arbitrary manner at Alexandria.&rdquo; I
                        should rather say he was treated in a most arbitrary way, in a most insolent
                        manner; he himself had to endure imprisonment. He saw his intimate friends
                        thrown <pb n="453"/> into prison. Death was constantly before his eyes. And
                        at last, naked and needy, he fled from the kingdom. &ldquo;But his money
                        was employed in commerce in other quarters. <milestone n="40" unit="section"/> We have heard that ships belonging to Postumus arrived at Puteoli, and
                        merchandize belonging to him was seen there, things only showy and of no
                        real value, made of paper, and linen, and glass; and there were several
                        ships entirely filled with such articles; but there was also one little
                        ship, the contents of which were not known.&rdquo; That voyage to
                        Puteoli, (such was the conversation at that time,) and the course taken by
                        the crew, and the parade they made, and the fact, too, of the name of
                        Postumus being rather unpopular with some spiteful people, on account of
                        some idea or other respecting his money, filled in one summer numbers of
                        ears with those topics of conversation. <milestone n="15" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="41" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>But if, O judges, you wish to know the truth,&mdash;if the liberality of
                        Caius Caesar, which is very great to every one, had not been quite
                        incredible towards my client, we should long since have ceased to have
                        Postumus among us in the forum. He, by himself, took upon himself the burden
                        of many of Postumus's friends; and those responsibilities, which during the
                        prosperity of Postumus many of his friends supported by dividing them, now
                        that he is unfortunate, Caesar supports the whole of. You see, O judges, the
                        shadow and phantom of a Roman knight preserved by the assistance and good
                        faith of one single friend. Nothing can be taken from him except this image
                        of his former dignity, and that Caesar by himself preserves and maintains.
                        And that, even amid his greatest distresses, is still to be attributed to
                        him in an eminent degree. </p>
					<p>Unless, indeed, this can be effected by a moderate degree of virtue, that so
                        just a man as Caesar should think this my client of so much consequence,
                        especially now that he is in distress and absent, and while he himself is in
                        the enjoyment of such splendid fortune that it is a great thing for him to
                        give a thought to the fortunes of others; while he is so incessantly busied
                        about the mighty achievements which he has performed and is still
                        performing, that it would be no wonder if he forgot other people altogether;
                        and even if be afterwards recollected that he had forgotten them, he would
                        easily find excuse for so doing. <pb n="454"/><milestone n="42" unit="section"/>

                        suited, as it were, to a more extensive theatre, are what I may almost call
                        virtues to catch the eye of the people. To select a place for a camp, to
                        array an army, to storm cities, to put to flight the army of the enemy, to
                        endure the severity of cold and bad weather, which we can hardly support
                        sheltered by the houses of this city; at this very time<note anchored="yes">This trial took place in January</note> to be pursuing the enemy, at a
                        time when even the wild beasts hide themselves in their lurking-places, and
                        when all wars are suspended by the general consent of
                        nations;&mdash;these are great deeds: who denies it? But still they are
                        prompted by vast rewards, being handed down to the eternal recollection of
                        men. So that there is less reason to wonder at a man a performing them who
                        is ambitious of immortality. <milestone n="16" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="43" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>This is wonderful praise, which is not celebrated by the verses of poets, nor
                        by the records of annals, but is estimated by the judgments of wise men. He
                        took up the cause of a Roman knight, his own ancient friend, one zealous
                        for, attached and devoted to himself, who was getting involved in
                        difficulties; not through licentiousness, nor through any discreditable
                        expense and waste to gratify his passions, but through an honest endeavour
                        to increase his fortune; he would not allow him to fall; he propped him up
                        and supported him with his estate, his fortune, and his good faith, and he
                        supports him to this day. Nor will he allow his friend, trembling in the
                        balance as he is, to fall; nor does the splendour of his own reputation at
                        all dazzle his eyes, nor does the height of his own position and of his own
                        renown at all obscure the piercing vision of his mind. <milestone n="44" unit="section"/> Grant that those achievements of his are great things,
                        as in truth they are; every one else may agree with my opinion or not, as he
                        pleases, for I, amid all his power and all his good-fortune, prefer this
                        liberality of his towards his friends, and his recollection of old
                        friendship, to all the rest of his virtues. And you, O judges, ought not
                        only not to despise or to regret this goodness of so novel a kind, so
                        unusual in illustrious and preeminently powerful men, but even to embrace
                        and increase it and so much the more, because you see that these days have
                        been taken for the purpose of, as it were, undermining his <pb n="455"/>
                        dignity; from which nothing can be taken which be will not either bravely
                        bear, or easily replace. But if he hears that his dearest friend has been
                        stripped of his honourable position, that he will not endure without just
                        indignation; and yet he will not have lost what he can have no possible hope
                        of ever recovering. <milestone n="17" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="45" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>These arguments ought to be quite sufficient for men who are of a just
                        disposition; and mere than sufficient for you, who we feel sure are men of
                        the greatest justice. </p>
					<p>But, in order fully to satisfy everybody's suspicions, or malevolence, or
                        even cruelty, we will take this statement too. &ldquo;Postumus is hiding
                        his money; the king's riches are concealed.&rdquo; Is there any one of
                        all this people who would like to have all the property of Caius Rabirius
                        Postumus knocked down to him for one single sesterce?<note anchored="yes">Those who bought a property took it with all its liabilities.</note>
                        But miserable man that I am! with what great pain do I say
                        this,&mdash;Come, Postumus, are you the son of Caius Curius, the son, as
                        far as his judgment and inclination go, of Caius Rabirius, not in reality
                        and by nature the son of his sister? Are you the man who is so liberal to
                        all his relations; whose kindness has enriched many men; who has never
                        wasted anything; who has never spent any money on any profligacy? and all
                        your property, O Postumus, knocked down by me for one single sesterce? Oh
                        how miserable and bitter is my office as an auctioneer! <milestone n="46" unit="section"/> But he, miserable man, even wishes to be convicted by
                        you; and to have his property sold, so that every one may be repaid his
                        principal. He has no concern about anything except his own good faith. Nor
                        will you, if you should, in his case, think fit to forget your habitual
                        humanity, be able to take from him anything beyond his property. <milestone n="47" unit="section"/> But, O judges, I beg and entreat you not to
                        forget that usual course of yours, and so much the more as in this instance
                        money which he has nothing to do with is being claimed of a man who is not
                        even repaid his own. Odium is sought to be stirred up against a man, who
                        ought to find an ally in the general pity. </p>
					<p>But now, since, as I hope, I have discharged as well as I have been able to,
                        the obligations of good faith to you, O Postumus, I will give you also the
                        aid of my tears, as I well <pb n="456"/> may; for I saw abundant tears shed
                        by you at the time of my own misfortune. That miserable night is constantly
                        present to the eyes of all my friends, on which you came to me with your
                        forces, and devoted yourself wholly to me. You supported me at that time of
                        my departure with your companions, with your protection, and even as much
                        gold as that time would admit of. During the time of my absence you were
                        never deficient in comforting and aiding my children, or my wife. I can
                        produce many men who have been recalled from banishment as witnesses of your
                        liberality; conduct which I have often heard was of the greatest assistance
                        to your father, whose behaviour was like your own, when he was tried for his
                        life. <milestone n="48" unit="section"/> But at present I am afraid of
                        everything: I dread even the unpopularity which your very kindness of
                        disposition may provoke. Already the weeping of so many men as we behold
                        indicates how beloved you are by your own relations; but, as for me, grief
                        enfeebles and stifles my voice. I do entreat you, O judges, do not deprive
                        this most excellent man, than whom no more virtuous man has ever lived, of
                        the name of a Roman knight, of the enjoyment of this light, and of the
                        pleasure of beholding you. He begs nothing else of you, except to be allowed
                        with uplifted eyes to behold this city, and to pace around the forum; a
                        pleasure which fortune would have already deprived him of; if the power of
                        one single friend had not come to his assistance. </p>

					<head>THE SPEECH OF M. T. CICERO IN BEHALF OF MARCUS CLAUDIUS MARCELLUS.</head>
					<argument>
						<head>THE ARGUMENT.</head>
						<p>Marcus Claudius Marcellus was descended from the most illustrious
                            families at Rome, and had been consul with Servius Sulpicius Rufus; in
                            which office he had given great offence to Caesar by making a motion in
                            the senate to deprive him of his command; and in the civil war he
                            espoused the side of Pompeius, and had been present at the battle of
                            Pharsalia, after which be retired to Lesbos. But after some time the
                            whole senate interceded with Caesar to pardon him, and to allow him to
                            return to his country. And when he yielded to their entreaties, Cicero
                            made the following speech, thanking Caesar for his magnanimity; though
                            he had, as he says himself, (<bibl n="Cic. Fam. 4.4.1">Ep. Fam.
                                4.4</bibl>,) determined to say nothing; but he was afraid that if he
                            continued silent Caesar would interpret it as a proof that he despaired
                            of the republic. Caesar, though he saw the senate unanimous in their
                            petition for Marcellus, yet had the motion for his pardon put to the
                            vote, and called for the opinion of every individual senator on it.
                            Cicero appears at this time to have believed that Caesar intended to
                            restore the republic, as he mentions in his letters, (<bibl n="Cic. Fam. 13.68.1">Ep. Fam. 13.68</bibl>.)</p>

					<p>This day, O conscript fathers, has brought with it an end to the long silence
                        in which I have of late indulged; not out of any fear, but partly from
                        sorrow, partly from modesty; and at the same time it has revived in me my
                        ancient habit of saying what my wishes and opinions are. For I cannot by any
                        means pass over in silence such great humanity, such unprecedented and
                        unheard-of clemency, such moderation in the exercise of supreme and
                        universal power, such incredible and almost godlike wisdom. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> For now that Marcus Marcellus, O conscript fathers, has
                        been restored to you and the republic, I think that not only his voice and
                        authority are preserved and restored to you and to the republic, but my own
                        also. </p>
					<p>For I was concerned, O conscript fathers, and most exceedingly grieved, when
                        I saw such a man as he is, who had espoused the same cause which I myself
                        had, not enjoying the same good fortune as myself; nor was I able to
                        persuade myself <pb n="458"/> self to think it right or fair that I should
                        be going on in my usual routine, while that rival and imitator of my zeal
                        and labours, who had been a companion and comrade of mine throughout, was
                        separated from me. Therefore, you, O Caius Caesar, have reopened to me my
                        former habits of life, which were closed up, and you have raised, as it
                        were, a standard to all these men, as a sort of token to lead them to
                        entertain hopes of the general welfare of the republic. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> For it was seen by me before in many instances, and
                        especially in my own, and now it is clearly understood by everybody, since
                        you have granted Marcus Marcellus to the senate and people of Rome, in spite
                        of your recollection of all the injuries you have received at his hands,
                        that you prefer the authority of this order and the dignity of the republic
                        to the indulgence of your own resentment or your own suspicions. </p>
					<p>He, indeed, has this day reaped the greatest possible reward for the virtuous
                        tenor of his previous life; in the great unanimity of the senate in his
                        favour, and also in your own most dignified and important opinion of him.
                        And from this you, in truth, must perceive what great credit there is in
                        conferring a kindness, when there is such glory to be got even by receiving
                        one. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> And he too, is fortunate whose safety
                        is now the cause of scarcely less joy to all other men than it will be to
                        himself when he is informed of it. And this honour has deservedly and most
                        rightfully fallen to his lot. For who is superior to him either in nobleness
                        of birth, or in honesty, or in zeal for virtuous studies, or in purity of
                        life, or in any description whatever of excellence. <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>No one is blessed with such a stream of genius, no one is endowed with such
                        vigour and richness of eloquence, either as a speaker or as a writer, as to
                        be able, I will not say to extol, but even, O Caius Caesar, plainly to
                        relate all your achievements. Nevertheless, I assert, and with your leave I
                        maintain, that in all of them you never gained greater and truer glory than
                        you have acquired this day. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> I am
                        accustomed often to keep this idea before my eyes, and often to affirm in
                        frequent conversations, that all the exploits of our own generals, all those
                        of foreign nations and of most powerful states, all the mighty deeds of the
                        most illustrious monarchs, can be compared with yours neither in the
                        magnitude of your wars, nor in the number of your battles, nor in the
                        variety of <pb n="459"/> countries which you have conquered, nor in the
                        rapidity of your conquests, nor in the great difference of character with
                        which your wars have been marked; and that those countries the most remote
                        from each other could not be traveled over more rapidly by any one in a
                        journey, than they have been visited by your, I will not say journeys, but
                        victories. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>And if I were not to admit, that those actions are so great that scarcely any
                        man's mind or comprehension is capable of doing justice to them, I should be
                        very senseless. But there are other actions greater than those. For some
                        people are in the habit of disparaging military glory, and of denying the
                        whole of it to the generals, and of giving the multitude a share of it also,
                        so that it may not be the peculiar property of the commanders. And, no doubt
                        in the affairs of war, the valour of the troops, the advantages of
                        situation, the assistance of allies, fleets, and supplies, have great
                        influence; and a most important share in all such transactions, Fortune
                        claims for herself, as of her right; and whatever has been done successfully
                        she considers almost entirely as her own work. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>But in this glory, O Caius Caesar, which you have just earned, you have no
                        partner. The whole of this, however great it may be,&mdash;and surely it
                        is as great as possible,&mdash;the whole of it, I say, is your own. The
                        centurion can claim for himself no share of that praise, neither can the
                        prefect, nor the battalion, nor the squadron. Nay, even that very mistress
                        of all human affairs, Fortune herself, cannot thrust herself into any
                        participation in that glory; she yields to you; she confesses that it is all
                        your own, your peculiar private desert. For rashness is never united with
                        wisdom, nor is chance ever admitted to regulate affairs conducted with
                        prudence. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>You have subdued nations, savage in their barbarism, countless in their
                        numbers, boundless, if we regard the extent of country peopled by them, and
                        rich in every kind of resource; but still you were only conquering things,
                        the nature and condition of which was such that they could be overcome by
                        force. For there is no strength so great that it cannot be weakened and
                        broken by arms and violence. But to subdue one's inclinations, to master
                        one's angry feelings, to be moderate in the hour of victory, to not merely
                        raise from the ground a prostrate adversary, eminent for noble birth, for
                        genius, and for virtue, but even to increase his previous dignity,
                        &mdash;they are <pb n="460"/> actions of such a nature, that the man who
                        does them, I do not compare to the most illustrious man, but I consider
                        equal to God. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>Therefore, O Caius Caesar, those military glories of yours will be celebrated
                        not only in our own literature and language, but in those of almost all
                        nations; nor is there any age which will ever be silent about your praises.
                        But still, deeds of that sort somehow or other, even when they are read,
                        appear to be overwhelmed with the cries of the soldiers and the sound of the
                        trumpets. But when we hear or read of anything which has been done with
                        clemency, with humanity, with justice, with moderation, and with wisdom,
                        especially in a time of anger, which is very adverse to prudence, and in the
                        hour of victory, which is naturally insolent and haughty, with what ardour
                        are we then inflamed, (even if the actions are not such as have really been
                        performed, but are only fabulous,) so as often to love those whom we have
                        never seen! <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> But as for you whom we behold
                        present among us, whose mind, and feelings, and countenance, we at this
                        moment see to be such, that you wish to preserve everything which the
                        fortune of war has left to the republic, oh with what praises must we extol
                        you? with what zeal must we follow you? with what affection must we devote
                        ourselves to you! The very walls, I declare, the very walls of this
                        senate-house appear to me eager to return you thanks; because, in a short
                        time, you will have restored their ancient authority to this venerable abode
                        of themselves and of their ancestors. <milestone n="4" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>In truth, O conscript fathers, when I just now, in common with you, beheld
                        the tears of Caius Marcellus, a most virtuous man, endowed with a
                        never-to-be-forgotten affection for his brother, the recollection of all the
                        Marcelli presented itself to my heart. For you, O Caesar, have, by
                        preserving Marcellus, restored their dignity even to those Marcelli who are
                        dead, and you have saved that most noble family, now reduced to a small
                        number, from perishing. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> You, therefore,
                        justly prefer this day to all the splendid and innumerable congratulations
                        which at different times have been addressed to you. For this exploit is
                        your own alone; the other achievements which have been performed by you as
                        general, were great indeed, but still they were performed by the agency of a
                        great and numerous band of comrades. But in this exploit <pb n="461"/> you
                        are the general, and you are your own sole comrade: and the act itself is
                        such that no lapse of time will ever put an end to your monuments and
                        trophies; for there is nothing which is wrought by manual labour which time
                        will not sometime or other impair or destroy; <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> but this justice and lenity of yours will every day
                        grow brighter and brighter, so that, in proportion as time takes away from
                        the effect of your deed, in the same degree it will add to your glory. And
                        you had already surpassed all other conquerors in civil wars, in equity, and
                        clemency, but this day you have surpassed even yourself. I fear that this
                        which I am saying cannot, when it is only heard, be understood as fully as I
                        myself think and feel it; you appear to have surpassed victory itself, since
                        you have remitted in favour of the conquered those things which victory had
                        put in your power. For though, by the conditions of the victory itself, we
                        who were conquered were all ruined, we still have been preserved by the
                        deliberate decision of your clemency. You, therefore, deserve to be the only
                        man who is never conquered, since you conquer the conditions and the violent
                        privileges of victory itself. <milestone n="5" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="13" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>And, O conscript fathers, remark how widely this decision of Caius Caesar
                        extends. For by it, all of us who, under the compulsion of some miserable
                        and fatal destiny of the republic, were driven to take up arms as we did,
                        though we are still not free from the fault of having erred as men may, are
                        at all events released from all imputation of wickedness. For when, at your
                        entreaty, he preserved Marcus Marcellus to the republic, he, at the same
                        time, restored me to myself and to the republic though no one entreated him
                        in my favour, and he restored all the other most honourable men who were in
                        the same case to ourselves and to their country; whom you now behold in
                        numbers and dignity present in this very assembly. He has not brought his
                        enemies into the senate-house; but he has decided that the war was
                        undertaken by most of them rather out of ignorance, and because of some
                        ungrounded and empty fear, than out of either any depraved desires or
                        cruelty. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>And in that war, I always thought it right to listen to all proposals that
                        gave any hope of peace, and I always grieved that not only peace, but that
                        even the language of those citizens who asked for peace, should be rejected.
                        For I never approved of either that or of any civil war whatever; and my <pb n="462"/> counsels were always allied to peace and peaceful measures,
                        not to war and arms. I followed the man from my own private feelings, not
                        because of my judgment of his public conduct; and the faithful recollection
                        of the grateful disposition which I cherish had so much influence with me,
                        that though I had not only no desire for victory, but no hope even of it, I
                        rushed on, knowingly, and with my eyes open, as it were to a voluntary
                        death. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> And, indeed, my sentiments in the
                        matter were not at all concealed; for in this assembly, before any decisive
                        steps were taken either way, I said many things in favour of peace, and even
                        while the war was going on I retained the same opinions, even at the risk of
                        my life.<note anchored="yes">Cicero was not present at the battle of
                            Pharsalia, but remained at Dyrrachium, vexed at his advice being totally
                            disregarded. Cato also remained at Dyrrachium. When Labienus brought
                            them the news of Pompey's defeat, Cato offered Cicero the command, as
                            the superior in dignity, and Plutarch relates, that on his refusal of
                            it, young Pompey was so enraged, that he could have killed him on the
                            spot if Cato had not prevented him. And this is what Middleton (who
                            quotes the sentence in the text) thinks that Cicero is alluding to
                            here.</note> And from this fact, no one will form so unjust an opinion
                        as to doubt what Caesar's own inclination respecting the war was, when, the
                        moment that it was in his power, he declared his opinion in favour of saving
                        the advisers of peace, but showed his anger against the others. And,
                        perhaps, that was not very strange at a time when the event of the war was
                        still uncertain, and its fortune still undecided. But he who, when
                        victorious, attaches himself to the advisers of peace, plainly declares that
                        he would have preferred having no war at all even to conquering. <milestone n="6" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="16" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>And in this matter I myself am a witness in favour of Marcus Marcellus. For
                        as our opinions have at all times agreed in time of peace, so did they then
                        in respect of that man. How often have I seen him affected with the deepest
                        grief at the insolence of certain men, and dreading also the ferocity of
                        victory! On which account your liberality, O Caius Caesar, ought to he more
                        acceptable to us who have seen those things. For now we may compare, not the
                        causes of the two parties together, but the use which each would have made
                        of victory. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> We have seen your victory
                        terminated at once by the result of your battles; we have seen no sword
                        unsheathed in the city. The citizens whom we have lost were stricken down by
                        the force of Mars, not by evil feelings let loose by <pb n="463"/> victory;
                        so that no man can doubt that Caius Caesar would even raise many from the
                        dead if that were possible, since he does preserve all those of that army
                        that he can. </p>
					<p>But of the other party I will say no more than what we were all afraid of at
                        the time, namely, that theirs would have been too angry a victory.
                            <milestone n="18" unit="section"/> For some of them were in the habit of
                        indulging in threats not only against those of their enemies who were in
                        arms, but even against those who remained quiet; and they used to say that
                        the matter to he considered was not what each man had thought, but where he
                        had been. So that it appears to me that the immortal gods, even if they were
                        inflicting punishment on the Roman people for some offence, when they
                        stirred up so serious and melancholy a civil war, are at length appeased, or
                        at all events satiated and have now made all our hopes of safety depend on
                        the clemency and wisdom of the conqueror. <milestone n="19" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>Rejoice, then, in that admirable and virtuous disposition of yours; and enjoy
                        not only your fortune and glory, but also your own natural good qualities,
                        and amiable inclinations and manners; for those are the things which produce
                        the greatest fruit and pleasure to a wise man. When you call to mind your
                        other achievements, although you will often congratulate yourself on your
                        valour, still you will often have reason to thank your good fortune also.
                        But as often as you think of us whom you have chosen to live safely in the
                        republic as well as yourself you will be thinking at the same time of your
                        own exceeding kindness, of your own incredible liberality, of your own
                        unexampled wisdom; qualities which I will venture to call not only the
                        greatest, but the only real blessings. For there is so much splendour in
                        genuine glory, so much dignity in magnanimity and real practical wisdom,
                        that these qualities appear to be given to a man by virtue, while all other
                        advantages seem only lent to them by fortune. </p>

                        <milestone n="20" unit="section"/> Be not wearied then in the preservation
                        of virtuous men, especially of those who have fallen, not from any evil
                        desires, or depravity of disposition, but merely from an opinion of their
                        duty,&mdash;a foolish and erroneous one perhaps, but certainly not a
                        wicked one,&mdash;and because they were misled by imaginary claims which
                        they fancied the republic had on them. For it is no fault of yours if some
                        people were afraid of you; and, on the other hand, it is your greatest
                        praise that they have now felt that they had no reason to fear you. <pb n="464"/>
                        <milestone n="7" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="21" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>But now I come to those severe complaints, and to those most terrible
                        suspicions that you have given utterance to; of dangers which should be
                        guarded against not more by you yourself than by all the citizens and most
                        especially by us who have been preserved by you. And although I trust that
                        the suspicion is an ungrounded one, still I will not speak so as to make
                        light of it. For caution for you is caution for ourselves. So that, if we
                        must err on one side or the other, I would rather appear too fearful, than
                        not sufficiently prudent. But still, who is there so frantic? Any one of
                        your own friends? And yet who are more your friends than those to whom you
                        have restored safety which they did not venture to hope for? Any one of that
                        number who were with you? It is not credible that any man should be so
                        insane as not to prefer the life of that man who was his general when he
                        obtained the greatest advantages of all sorts, to his own. But if your
                        friends have no thoughts of wickedness, need you take precautions lest your
                        enemies may be entertaining such? Who are they? For all those men who were
                        your enemies have either already lost their lives through their obstinacy,
                        or else have preserved them through your mercy; so that either none of your
                        enemies survive, or those who do survive are your most devoted friends.

					<p>But still, as there are so many hiding places and so many dark corners in
                        men's minds, let us increase your suspicions, for by so doing we shall at
                        the same time increase your diligence. For who is there so ignorant of
                        everything, so very new to the affairs of the republic, so entirely
                        destitute of thought either for his own or for the general safety, as not to
                        understand that his own safety is bound up with yours? that the lives of all
                        men depend on your single existence? I myself, in truth, while I think of
                        you day and night,&mdash;as I ought to do,&mdash;fear only the
                        chances to which all men are liable, and the uncertain events of health and
                        the frail tenure of our common nature, and I grieve that, while the republic
                        ought to he immortal, it depends wholly on the life of one mortal man
                            <milestone n="23" unit="section"/> But if to the chances of human life
                        and the uncertain condition of man's health there were to be added also any
                        conspiracy of wickedness and treachery, then what god should we think able
                        to assist the republic, even if he were to desire to do so? <milestone n="8" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>All things, O Caius Caesar, which you now see lying <pb n="465"/> stricken

                        alone. The courts of justice must be reestablished, confidence must be

                        be encouraged, everything which has become lax and disordered must be braced
                        up and strengthened by strict laws. <milestone n="24" unit="section"/> In so
                        vast a civil war, when there was such ardour of feeling and of warlike
                        preparation on both sides, it was impossible but that&mdash;whatever the

                        violently shaken by it should lose my ornaments of its dignity and many
                        bulwarks of its security, and that each general should do many things while
                        in arms, which he would have forbidden to have been done while clad in the
                        garb of Peace. And all those wounds of war thus inflicted now require your
                        attention, and there is no one except you who is able to heal them.

                        heard that celebrated and wise saying of yours, &ldquo;I have lived long
                        enough to satisfy either nature or glory.&rdquo; Sufficiently long, if
                        you please: for nature, and I will add, if you like, for glory; but, which
                        is of the greatest consequence of all, certainly not long enough for your
                        country. Give up then, I entreat you, that wisdom of learned men shown in
                        their contempt of death; do not be wise at our expense. For it has often
                        come to my ears that you are in the habit of using that expression much too
                        frequently&mdash;that you have lived long enough for yourself. I dare
                        say you have; but I could only be willing to hear you say so if you lived
                        for yourself alone, or if you had been born for yourself alone. But as it

                        foundations which you design to lay. And will you then limit your life, not
                        by the welfare of the republic, but by the tranquillity of your own mind?
                        What will you do, if that is not even sufficient for your glory, of
                        which&mdash;wise man though you be&mdash;you will not deny that you
                        are exceedingly desirous? <milestone n="26" unit="section"/> &ldquo;Is
                        it then,&rdquo; you will say, &ldquo;but small glory that we shall
                        leave behind us?&rdquo; It may, indeed, be sufficient for others,
                        however many they may be, and insufficient for you alone. For whatever it
                        is, however ample it may be, it certainly is insufficient, as long as <pb n="466"/> there is anything greater still. And if, O Caius Caesar, this
                        was to be the result of your immortal achievements, that after conquering
                        all your enemies, you were to leave the republic in the state in which it
                        now is; then beware, I beg of you, lest your virtue should earn admiration
                        rather than solid glory; since the glory which is illustrious and which is
                        celebrated abroad, is the fame of many and great services done either to
                        one's own friends, or to one's country, or to the whole race of mankind.

					<p>This, then, is the part which remains to you&mdash;this is the cause
                        which you have before you; this is what you must now labour at,&mdash;to
                        settle the republic, and to enjoy it yourself as the first of its citizens,
                        in the greatest tranquillity and peacefulness. And then, if you please when
                        you have discharged the obligations which you owe to your country, and when
                        you have satisfied nature herself with the devotion of your life, then you
                        may say that you have lived long enough. For what is the meaning of this
                        very word &ldquo;long&rdquo; when applied to what has an end? And
                        when the end comes, then all past pleasure is to be accounted as nothing,
                        because there is none to come after it. Although that spirit of yours has
                        never been content with this narrow space which nature has afforded us to
                        live in; but has always been inflamed with a desire of immortality.
                            <milestone n="28" unit="section"/> Nor is this to be considered your
                        life which is contained in your body and in your breath.
                        That,&mdash;that, I say, is your life, which will flourish in the memory
                        of all ages; which posterity will cherish; which eternity itself will always
                        preserve. This is what you must be subservient to; it is to this that you
                        ought to display yourself; which indeed has long ago had many actions of
                        yours to admire, and which now is expecting some which it may also praise.
                        Unquestionably, posterity will stand amazed when they hear and read of your
                        military commands,&mdash;of the provinces which you have added to the
                        empire,&mdash;of the Rhine, of the ocean, of the Nile, all made subject
                        to us,&mdash;of your countless battles, of your incredible victories, of
                        your innumerable monuments and triumphs. <milestone n="29" unit="section"/>
                        But unless this city is now securely settled by your counsels and by your
                        institutions, your name will indeed be talked about very extensively, but
                        your glory will have no secure abode, no sure home in which to repose. There
                        will he also among those who shall be born hereafter, as there has been
                        among us, great disputes, when some with <pb n="467"/> their praises will
                        extol your exploits to the skies, and others, perhaps, will miss something
                        in them,&mdash;and that, too, the most important thing of
                        all,&mdash;unless you extinguish the conflagration of civil war by the
                        safety of the country, so that the one shall appear to have been the effect
                        of destiny and the other the work of your own practical wisdom. Have regard,
                        then, to those judges who will judge you many ages afterwards, and who will
                        very likely judge you more honestly than we can. For their judgment will be
                        unbiased by affection or by ambition, and at the same time it will be
                        untainted by hatred or by envy. <milestone n="30" unit="section"/> And even
                        if it will be incapable of affecting you at that time, (which is the false
                        opinion held by some men,) at all events, it concerns you now to conduct
                        yourself in such a manner that no oblivion shall ever be able to obscure
                        your praises. <milestone n="10" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>The inclinations of the citizens have been very diverse, and their opinions
                        much distracted; for we showed our variance, not only by our counsels and
                        desires, but by arms and warlike operations. And there was obscurity in the
                        designs of, and contention between, the most illustrious generals: many
                        doubted which was the best side; many, what was expedient for themselves;
                        many, what was becoming; some even felt uncertain as to what it was in their
                        power to do. <milestone n="31" unit="section"/> The republic has at last
                        come to the end of this miserable and fatal war; that man has been
                        victorious who has not allowed his animosities to be inflamed by good
                        fortune, but who has mitigated them by the goodness of his disposition; and
                        who did not consider all those with whom he was displeased deserving on that
                        account of exile or of death. Arms were laid aside by some, were wrested
                        from the hands of others. He is an ungrateful and an unjust citizen, who,
                        when released from the danger of arms, still retains, as it were, an armed
                        spirit, so that that man is better who fell in battle, who spent his life in
                        the cause. For that which seems obstinacy to some people may appear
                        constancy in others. But now all dissension is crushed by the arms and
                        extinguished by the justice of the conqueror; <milestone n="32" unit="section"/> it only remains for all men for the future to be
                        animated by one wish, all at least who have not only any wisdom at all, but
                        who are at all in their senses. Unless you, O Caius Caesar, continue safe,
                        and also in the same sentiments as you have displayed on previous occasions,
                        and on this day most eminently, we cannot be safe either. <pb n="468"/>
                        Wherefore we all&mdash;we who wish this constitution and these things
                        around us to be safe&mdash;exhort and entreat you to take care of your
                        own life, to consult your own safety; and we all promise to you, (that I may
                        say also on behalf of others what I feel respecting myself,) since you think
                        that there is still something concealed, against which it is necessary to
                        guard,&mdash;we promise you, I say, not only our vigilance and our
                        wariness also to assist in those precautions, but we promise to oppose our
                        sides and our bodies as a shield against every danger which can threaten
                        you. <milestone n="11" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="33" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>But let my speech end with the same sentiment as it began. We all, O Caius
                        Caesar, render you the greatest thanks, and we feel even deeper gratitude
                        than we express; for all feel the same thing, as you might have perceived
                        from the entreaties and tears of all. But because it is not necessary for
                        all of them to stand up and say so, they wish it at all events that by me,
                        who am forced in some degree to rise and speak, should he expressed both all
                        that they feel, and all that is becoming, and all that I myself consider due
                        to Marcus Marcellus, who is thus by you restored to this order, and to the
                        Roman people, and to the republic. For I feel that all men are exulting, not
                        in the safety of one individual alone, but in the general safety of all.
                            <milestone n="34" unit="section"/> And as it becomes the greatest
                        possible affection, such as I was always well known by all men to have
                        towards him, so that I scarcely yielded to Caius Marcellus, his most
                        excellent and affectionate brother and certainly to no one except
                        him,&mdash;that love for him which I displayed by my solicitude, by my
                        anxiety, and my exertions, as long as there was a doubt of his safety, I
                        certainly ought to display at this present time, now that I am relieved from
                        my great care and distress and misery on his account. </p>
					<p>Therefore, O Caius Caesar, I thank you, as if,&mdash;though I have not
                        only been preserved in every sort of manner, but also loaded with
                        distinctions by you,&mdash;still, by this action of yours, a crowning
                        kindness of the greatest importance was added to the already innumerable
                        benefits which you have reaped upon me, which I did not before believe were
                        capable of any augmentation. </p>

					<head>THE SPEECH OF M. T. CICERO IN DEFENCE OF QUINTUS LIGARIUS.</head>
					<argument>
						<head>THE ARGUMENT.</head>
						<p>Quintus Ligarius was a Roman knight, who had been one of the lieutenants
                            of Considius, the proconsul of Africa, and one of Pompey's partisans,
                            and as such had borne arms against Caesar in Africa, on which account he
                            had gone into voluntary exile, to get out of the reach of the conqueror.
                            But his two brothers had been on Caesar's side, and had joined Pansa and
                            Cicero in interceding with Caesar to pardon him. While Caesar was
                            hesitating, Quintus Tubero, who was an ancient enemy of his, knowing
                            that Caesar was very unwilling to restore him, (for Ligarius was a great
                            lover of liberty,) impeached him as having behaved with great violence
                            in the prosecution of the African war against Caesar, who privately
                            encouraged this proceeding, and ordered the action to be tried in the
                            forum, where he sat in person as judge to decide it; and so determined
                            was he against Ligarius, that he is said to have brought the sentence of
                            condemnation with him into court, already drawn up and formally signed
                            and sealed. But he was prevailed upon by Cicero's eloquence, which
                            extorted from him a verdict of acquittal against his will; and he
                            afterwards pardoned Ligarius and allowed him to return to Rome. Ligarius
                            afterwards became a great friend of Brutus, and joined him in the
                            conspiracy against Caesar.</p>

					<milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
					<p>It is a new crime, and one never heard of before this day, O Caius Caesar,
                        which my relation Quintus Tubero has brought before you, when he accuses
                        Quintus Ligarius with having been in Africa; and that charge Caius Pansa, a
                        man of eminent genius, relying perhaps on that intimacy with you which he
                        enjoys, has ventured to confess. Therefore I do not know which way I had
                        best proceed. For I had come prepared, as you did not know that fact of your
                        own knowledge, and could not have heard it from any other quarter, to abase
                        your ignorance in order to further the safety of a miserable man. But,
                        however, since that which was previously unknown has been ferreted out by
                        the diligence of his enemy we must, I suppose, confess the truth; especially
                        as my dear friend Caius Pansa has so acted that it would not now be in my
                        power to deny it. Therefore, abandoning all dispute of the fact, all my
                        speech must be addressed to your mercy; by which many have already been
                        preserved, having besought of <pb n="470"/> you, not a release from all
                        guilt, but pardon from admitted error. </p>
					<p><milestone n="2" unit="section"/> You, therefore, O Tubero, have that which
                        is of all things most desirable for a prosecutor, a defendant who confesses
                        his fault; but still, one who confesses it only so far as he admits that he
                        was of the same party as you yourself, O Tubero, were, and as that man
                        worthy of all praise, your father, also was. Therefore you must inevitably
                        confess yourselves also to be guilty, before you can find fault with any
                        part of the conduct of Ligarius. </p>
					<p>Quintus Ligarius, then, at a time when there was no suspicion of war, went as
                        lieutenant into Africa with Caius Considius, in which lieutenancy he made
                        himself so acceptable, both to our citizens there and to our allies, that
                        Considius on departing from the province could not have given satisfaction
                        to those men if he had appointed any one else to govern it. Therefore,
                        Quintus Ligarius, after refusing it for a long time without effect, took
                        upon himself the government of the province against his will. And while
                        peace lasted, he governed it in such a manner that his integrity and good
                        faith were most acceptable both to our citizens and to our allies.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> On a sudden, war broke out, which
                        those who were in Africa heard of as being actually raging before any rumour
                        of its preparation had reached them. But when they did hear of it, partly
                        out of an inconsiderate eagerness, partly out of some blind apprehension,
                        they sought for some one as a leader, at first only with the object of
                        securing their safety, and afterwards with that of indulging their
                        party-spirit; while Ligarius, keeping his eyes fixed on home, and wishing to
                        return to his friends, would not allow himself to be implicated in any
                        business of the sort. In the meantime, Publius Attius Varus, who as praetor
                        had obtained the province of Africa, came to Utica. Every one immediately
                        flocked to him, and he seized on the government with no ordinary eagerness,
                        if that may be called government which was conferred on him, while a private
                        individual, by the clamour of an ignorant mob, without the sanction of any
                        public council. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Therefore, Ligarius, who
                        was anxious to avoid being mixed up in any transactions of the sort remained
                        quiet for some time on the arrival of Varus. <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>Up to this point, O Caius Caesar, Quintus Ligarius is free from all blame. He
                        left his home, not only not for the <pb n="471"/> purpose of joining in any
                        war, but when there was not even the slightest suspicion of war. Having gone
                        as lieutenant in time of peace, he behaved himself in a most peaceable
                        province in such a manner that it wished that peace might last for ever.
                        Beyond all question, his departure from Rome with such an object ought not
                        to be and cannot be offensive to you. Was, then, his remaining there
                        offensive? Much less. For if it was no discreditable inclination that led to
                        his going thither, it was even an honourable necessity which compelled him
                        to remain. Both these times, then, are free from all fault&mdash;the
                        time when he first went as lieutenant and the time when, having been
                        demanded by the province, he was appointed governor of Africa. </p>
					<p><milestone n="5" unit="section"/> There is a third time that during which he
                        remained in Africa after the arrival of Varus; and if that is at all
                        criminal, the crime is one of necessity, not of inclination. Would he, if he
                        could possibly have escaped thence by any means whatever, would he rather
                        have been at Utica than at Rome,&mdash;with Publius Attius, in
                        preference to his own most united brothers,&mdash;would he rather have
                        been among strangers, than with his own friends? When his lieutenancy itself
                        had been full of regret and anxiety on account of the extraordinary
                        affection subsisting between him and his brothers, could he possibly remain
                        there with any equanimity when separated from those brothers by the discord
                        of war? <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>

					<p>You have, therefore, O Caesar, no sign as yet of the affections of Quintus
                        Ligarius being alienated from you. And observe, I entreat you, with what
                        good faith I am defending his cause. I am betraying my own by so doing. O
                        the admirable clemency, deserving to be celebrated by all possible praise,
                        and publicity, and writings, and monuments! Marcus Cicero is urging in
                        Ligarius's defence before you, that the inclinations of another were not the
                        same as he admits his own to have been; nor does he fear your silent
                        thoughts, nor is he under any apprehension as to what while you are hearing
                        of the conduct of another, may occur to you respecting his own. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>See how entirely free from fear I am. See how brilliantly the light of your
                        liberality and wisdom rises upon me while speaking before you. As far as I
                        can, I will lift up my voice so that the Roman people may hear me.
                            <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> When the war began, O Caesar, when it
                        was even very greatly advanced <pb n="472"/> towards its end, I, though
                        compelled by no extraneous force, of my own free judgment and inclination
                        went to join that party which had taken up arms against you. Before whom now
                        am I saying this? Forsooth, before the man who, though he was acquainted
                        with this, nevertheless restored me to the republic before he saw me; who
                        sent letters to me from Egypt, to desire me to behave as I always had
                        behaved; who, when he himself might have been the sole leader of the Roman
                        people in the whole empire, still permitted me to be the other; by whose
                        gift it was, (this very Caius Pansa, who is here present, bringing me the
                        news,) that I retained the <foreign lang="la">fasces</foreign> wreathed with
                        laurel, as long as I thought it becoming to retain them at all, and who
                        would not have considered that he was giving me safety at all, if he did not
                        give it me without my being stripped of any of my previous distinctions. </p>
					<p><milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Observe, I pray you, O Tubero, how I, who
                        do not hesitate to speak of my own conduct, do not venture to make any
                        confession with respect to Ligarius: and I have said thus much respecting
                        myself, to induce Tubero to excuse me when I say the same things of him. For
                        I look in the forum on his industry and desire of glory, either on account
                        of the nearness of our relationship, or because I am delighted with his
                        genius and with his earnestness, or because I think that the praises of a
                        young man who is my relative redound somewhat to my own credit. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> But I ask this&mdash;Who is it who thinks
                        that it was any crime in Ligarius to have been in Africa? Why, the very man
                        who himself also wished to be in Africa, and who complains that he was
                        prevented by Ligarius from going there, and who certainly was in arms and
                        fought against Caesar. For, O Tubero, what was that drawn sword of yours
                        doing in the battle of Pharsalia? against whose side was that sword-point of
                        yours aimed? What was the feeling with which you took up arms? What was your
                        intention? Where were your eyes? your hands? your eagerness of mind? what
                        were you desirous of? What were you willing for? I am pressing you too hard.
                        The young man appears to be moved. I will return to myself. I also was in
                        arms in the same camp. <milestone n="4" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="10" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>But what other object had we, O Tubero, except to be able to do what this man
                        can do now? Shall, then, O Caesar, the speech of those men spur you on to
                        deeds of cruelty <pb n="473"/> whose impunity is the great glory of your
                        clemency? And in this cause, in truth, O Tubero, I am somewhat at a loss to
                        discern your usual prudence, but much more so to see the sagacity of your
                        father, since that man, eminent both for genius and erudition, did not
                        perceive what sort of case this was. For if he had perceived it, he would, I
                        doubt not, have preferred that you should conduct it in any manner in the
                        world, rather than as you did. </p>
					<p>You are accusing one who confesses the facts which you allege against him.
                        That is not enough. You are accusing one who has a case, as I say, better
                        than your own, or, as you yourself allow, at least as good as yours.
                            <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> This is strange though; but what I am
                        about to say is a perfect miracle. That accusation of yours does not tend to
                        the point of procuring the condemnation of Quintus Ligarius, but of causing
                        us death. And this is an object which no Roman citizen has ever pursued
                        before you. That way of acting is quite foreign. It is the hatred of fickle
                        Greeks or of savage barbarians that is usually excited to the pitch of
                        thirsting for blood. For what else is your object? To prevent him from being
                        at ionic? To deprive him of his country? To hinder him from living with his
                        excellent brothers, with this Titus Brocchus, whom you see in court, his
                        uncle, or with Brocchus's son, his cousin? To prevent his appearing in his
                        country? Was that it? Can he be more deprived of all these things than he is
                        already? He is prevented from approaching Italy; he is banished. You,
                        therefore, do not wish to deprive him of his country, of which he already is
                        deprived, but of his life. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>But even in the time of that dictator who punished with death every one whom
                        he disliked, no one ever proceeded in that manner to accomplish such an end.
                        He himself ordered men to be slain, without any one asking him; he even
                        invited men to slay them by rewards; and that cruelty of his was avenged
                        some years afterwards by this selfsame man whom you now wish to become
                        cruel! <milestone n="5" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>&ldquo;But I am not asking for his death,&rdquo; you will say. I
                        think indeed that you do not intend to do so, O Tubero, for I know you, I
                        know your father, I know your birth and your name, and the pursuits of your
                        race and family; our love of virtue, and civilization, and learning; your
                        many admirable qualities,&mdash;all are known to me. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> Therefore <pb n="474"/> I know for a certainty that you
                        are not thirsting for blood, but you give no heed to the effect of your
                        prosecution. For the transaction has this tendency, to make you seem not
                        contented with that punishment under which Quintus Ligarius is at present
                        suffering. What further punishment then is there but death? For if he is in
                        exile, as he is, what more do you require? That he may never be pardoned?
                        But this is much more bitter and much harsher. That which we begged for at
                        his house with prayers and tears, throwing ourselves at his feet, trusting
                        not so much to the strength of our cause as to his humanity, will you now
                        struggle to prevent our obtaining? Will you interrupt our weeping? and will
                        you forbid us to speak, lying at his feet with the voice suppliants?
                            <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> If, when we were doing this at his
                        house, as and as I hope we did not do in vain, you had all on a sudden burst
                        in, and had begun to cry out &ldquo;O Caius Caesar, beware how you
                        pardon, beware how you pity brothers entreating you for the safety of their
                        brother,&rdquo; would you not have renounced all humanity by such
                        conduct? How much harder is this, for you to oppose in the forum what we
                        begged of him in his own house! and while numbers are in this distress, to
                        take away from them the refuge which they might find in his clemency! </p>
					<p>I will speak plainly, O Caius Caesar, what I feel. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> If in this splendid fortune of yours your lenity had
                        not been as great as you of your own accord&mdash;of your own accord, I
                        say, (I know well what I am saying,) make it, that victory of yours would
                        have been pregnant with the bitterest grief to the state. For how many of
                        the conquering party must have been found who would have wished you to be
                        cruel, when some of even the conquered party are found to wish it! how many
                        who, wishing no one to be pardoned by you, would have thrown obstacles in
                        the way of your clemency, when even those men whom you yourself have
                        pardoned are unwilling that you should be merciful to others </p>
					<p>
                        <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> But if we could prove to Caesar that
                        Ligarius was actually not in Africa at all, if we wished to save an
                        unfortunate citizen by an honourable and merciful falsehood; still it would
                        not be the act of a man, in a case of such danger and peril to a
                        fellow-citizen, to contradict and refute our falsehood; and if it were
                        decent for any one to do so, it would certainly not be so for one who had
                        himself been in the same case and condition <pb n="475"/> But, however, it
                        is one thing to be unwilling that Caesar should make a mistake, and another
                        to be unwilling he should be merciful. Then you would say,
                        &ldquo;Beware, O Caesar, of believing all this&mdash;Ligarius was in
                        Africa. He did bear arms against you.&rdquo; But now what is it that you
                        say &ldquo;Take care you do not pardon him.&rdquo; This is not the
                        language of a man but he who uses it to you, O Caius Caesar, will find it an
                        easier matter to abjure his own humanity than to strip you of yours.
                            <milestone n="6" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="17" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>And the first beginning, and the first proposition of Tubero, I imagine, was
                        this; that he intended to speak of wickedness of Quintus Ligarius. I make no
                        doubt that you wondered how it was that no one made this statement
                        respecting some one else, or how it was that he made it who had been in the
                        same condition himself, or what new crime it was which he was bringing
                        forward. Do you call that wickedness, Tubero? Why so? For that cause has not
                        as yet been wicked by that name. Some call it mistake; some call it fear;
                        those who give it a harder name term it hope, ambition, hatred, obstinacy;
                        those who use the hardest language style it rashness. But up to this time no
                        one except you has ever called it wickedness. My own opinion is, if any one
                        seeks for a proper and accurate name for our misfortune, that some disaster
                        sent by destiny descended upon and occupied the provident minds of men; so
                        that no one ought to wonder that human counsels were overruled by divine
                        necessity. </p>
					<p><milestone n="18" unit="section"/> Let it be allowed to us to be miserable,
                        although that cannot be when this man is our conqueror. But I am not
                        speaking of those who have perished. Grant that they were ambitious, that
                        they were angry, that they were obstinate men; but still let Cnaeus
                        Pompeius, for he is dead, and let any others with him, be free from the
                        imputation of wickedness, of insanity, of parricide. When did any one hear
                        such expression from you, O Caius Caesar? or what other object did your arms
                        propose to themselves except the repelling insult from yourself? What was it
                        that was accomplished by that invincible army of yours; beyond the
                        preservation of its own rights, and of your dignity? What? when you were
                        anxious for peace, was it your object to be able to come to terms of
                        agreement with the wicked, or with the virtuous part of the citizens?
                            <milestone n="19" unit="section"/> To me, of a truth, O Caesar, your
                        services towards me, immense as they are, would certainly not appear <pb n="476"/> so great, if I thought that I had been preserved by you while
                        you considered me a wicked man. And how could you possibly have deserved
                        well of the republic, if you had wished so many wicked men to remain with
                        all their dignity unimpaired? Originally, O Caesar, you considered that as a
                        secession, not as a declaration of war; you considered it as a demonstration
                        not of hostile hatred, but of civil dissension, in which both parties
                        desired the safety of the republic, but some departed from measures
                        calculated for the general welfare out of an error of judgment, and some out
                        of party spirit. The dignity of the leaders was nearly on a par; but that of
                        those who followed them was perhaps not quite equal; the justice of the
                        cause, too, was at that time doubtful, because there was something on each
                        side which deserved to be approved of; but now that is unquestionably
                        entitled to be thought the better cause which even the gods assisted. But
                        now that your clemency is known; who is there who does not think well of
                        that victory, in which no one has fallen except those who fell with arms in
                        their hands? <milestone n="7" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="20" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>But to say no more of the general question, let us come to our own individual
                        case. Which do you think was easiest, O Tubero, for Ligarius to depart from
                        Africa, or for you to abstain from coming into Africa? &ldquo;Could we
                        so abstain,&rdquo; you will say, &ldquo;after the senate had voted
                        that we should do so?&rdquo; If you ask me, I say, Certainly not. But
                        still the same senate had appointed Ligarius lieutenant. And he obeyed them
                        at a time when men were forced to obey the senate; but you obeyed at a time
                        when no one obeyed them who did not like it. Do I then find fault with you?
                        By no means;&mdash;for a man of your family, of your name, of your race,
                        of your hereditary principles, could not act otherwise. But I do not grant
                        that you have a right to reprove in others the very same conduct which you
                        boast of in yourselves. </p>
					<p>
                        <milestone n="21" unit="section"/> Tubero's lot was drawn in pursuance of a
                        resolution of the senate when he himself was not present, when he was even
                        hindered by sickness from being present. He had made up his mind to excuse
                        himself. I know all this from the great intimacy which exists between Lucius
                        Tubero and myself: we were brought up together, in our campaigns we were
                        comrades, afterwards we became connected by marriage, and throughout the
                        whole of our lives, in short, we have been friends; it has been, moreover, a
                        great bond between us, that we have been <pb n="477"/> devoted to the same
                        studies. I know, therefore, that Tubero wished to remain at home; but there
                        was a person who contrived matters in such a way, who put forth that most
                        holy name of the republic so artfully, that even had his sentiments been
                        different from what they were, he would not have been able to support the
                        weight of his language. <milestone n="22" unit="section"/> He submitted to
                        the authority of a most distinguished man, or, I should rather say, he
                        obeyed him. He went off at the same time with those men who were already
                        embarked in the same cause, but he made us journey slower than they.
                        Therefore, he arrived in Africa when it was already occupied; and from this
                        it is that the charge against Ligarius, or rather the enmity against him,
                        has its rise. For if it be a crime in him to have wished to hinder you, it
                        is a no less serious one for you to have wished to obtain Africa, the
                        citadel of all the provinces, a land created for the purpose of waging war
                        against this city, than for somebody else to have preferred obtaining it
                        himself,&mdash;and that somebody was not Ligarius. Varus kept saying,
                        that he had the command there; the <foreign lang="la">fasces</foreign> he
                        certainly had. <milestone n="23" unit="section"/> But however the case, as
                        to that part of it may be, what weight is there, O Tubero, in this complaint
                        of yours? &ldquo;We were admitted into the province.&rdquo; Well,
                        suppose you had been admitted? was it your object to deliver it up to
                        Caesar, or to hold it against Caesar? <milestone n="8" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>See, O Caesar, what licence, or rather what audacity, your liberality gives
                        us. If Tubero replies that his father would have given up to you that
                        province to which the senate and the lot which be drew had sent him, I will
                        not hesitate in severe language to reprove that design of his before you
                        yourself, to whose advantage it was that he should so. For even if the
                        action had been an acceptable one to you, it would not have been thought an
                        honest one by you. <milestone n="24" unit="section"/> But, however, all
                        these topics I will pass over, not so much for fear of offending your most
                        patient ears, as because that I do not wish that Tubero should appear to
                        have been likely to do what he never thought of. </p>
					<p>You two came, then, into the province of Africa,&mdash;the province of
                        all others that was most hostile to the views of this victorious party in
                        which there was a most powerful king, an enemy to this cause, and in which
                        the inclinations of a large and powerful body of Roman settlers were
                        entirely adverse to it. I ask what you intended to do? Though I do not
                        really <pb n="478"/> doubt what you intended to do, when I see what you have
                        done. You were forbidden to set foot in your province, and forbidden, as you
                        state yourselves, with the greatest insults. <milestone n="25" unit="section"/> How did you bear that? To whom did you carry your
                        complaints of the insults which you had received? Why, to that man whose
                        authority you had followed when you came to join his party in the war. If it
                        had been in Caesar's cause that you were coming to the province,
                        unquestionably, when excluded from the province, it was to him that you
                        would have gone. But you came to Pompeius. What is the meaning, then, of
                        this complaint which you now urge before Caesar, when you accuse that man by
                        whom you complain that you were prevented from waging war against Caesar?
                        And as to this part of the business you may boast for all I care, even
                        though it will be falsely, that you would have given the province up to
                        Caesar, even if you had been forbidden by Varus, and by some others. But I
                        will confess that the fault was all Ligarius's, who deprived you of an
                        opportunity of acquiring so much glory. <milestone n="9" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="26" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>But observe, I pray you, O Caius Caesar, the consistency of that most
                        accomplished man, Lucius Tubero, which even though I thought as highly of it
                        as I do, I still would not mention, if I were not aware that that is a
                        virtue which you are in the habit of praising as much as any. Where, then,
                        was there ever an example of such great consistency in any man? Consistency,
                        do I say? I do not know whether I might not more fitly call it patience. For
                        how few men would have acted in such a manner as to return to that same
                        party by which he had been rejected in a time of civil dissension, and
                        rejected even with cruelty? That is the act of a great mind, and of a man
                        whom no contumely, no violence, and no danger can turn from a side which he
                        has espoused, and from an opinion which he has adopted. <milestone n="27" unit="section"/> Grant that in all other respects Tubero and Varus were
                        on a par, as to honour, that is, and nobleness of birth, and respectability,
                        and genius,&mdash;which, however, was by no means the case; at all
                        events, Tubero had this great advantage, that he had come to his own
                        province with a legitimate command, in pursuance of a resolution of the
                        senate. When he was prevented from entering it, he did not betake himself to
                        Caesar, lest he should appear to be in a passion,&mdash;he did not go
                        home, lest he should be thought inactive,&mdash;he did not go <pb n="479"/> to any other district, lest he might seem to condemn that
                        cause which he had espoused. He came into Macedonia to the camp of Cnaeus
                        Pompeius, to join that very party by whom he had been repulsed with every
                        circumstance of insult. <milestone n="28" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>What? when that affair had had no effect on the mind of man to whom you came,
                        you behaved, after that with a more languid zeal, I suppose, in his cause?
                        You only stayed in some garrison? But your affections were alienated from
                        his cause? Or were we all, as is the case in a civil war, and not more with
                        respect to you two, than with respect to others,&mdash;were we all
                        wholly occupied with a desire of victory? I, indeed, was at all times an
                        advocate of peace, but that time was too late. For it was the part of a
                        madman to think of peace when he saw the hostile army in battle array. We
                        all, every one of us, I say, were eager for victory; you most especially, as
                        you had come into a place where you must inevitably perish if your side were
                        not victorious. Although, the result now turns out, I make no doubt that you
                        confer your present safety preferable to what would have been the
                        consequences of victory. <milestone n="10" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="29" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>I would not say these things, O Tubero, if you had any reason to repent of
                        your consistency, or Caesar of his kindness. I ask now whether you are
                        seeking to avenge your own injuries, or those of the republic? If those of
                        the republic, what reply can you make with respect to your perseverance in
                        the cause of that other party? If your own, take care that you are not
                        making a great mistake in thinking that Caesar will be angry with your
                        enemies, after he has pardoned his own. Do I, then, appear to you, O Caesar,
                        to be occupied in the use of Ligarius? Do I appear to be speaking of his
                        conduct? In whatever I have said, I have endeavoured to refer everything to
                        the leading idea of your humanity, or clemency, mercy, whichever may be its
                        most proper name. <milestone n="30" unit="section"/> I have, indeed, O Caius
                        Caesar, pleaded many causes with you, while your pursuit of honours detained
                        you in the forum; but certainly I never pleaded in this way,
                        &ldquo;Pardon my client, O judges; he has erred, he has tripped, he did
                        not think.<gap desc="* *"/> If ever hereafter<gap desc="* *"/>&rdquo;
                        This is the sort of way in which he pleads with a parent; to judges one
                        says, &ldquo;He never did it, he never thought of it the witnesses are
                        false, the accusation <pb n="480"/> is false.&rdquo; Say, O Caesar, that
                        you are sitting as judge on the conduct of Ligarius. Ask me in what
                        garrisons he was. I make no reply. I do not even adduce these arguments,
                        which, perhaps, might have weight even with a judge,&mdash;&ldquo;He
                        went as a lieutenant before the war broke out; he was left there in time of
                        peace; he was overtaken by the war; in the war itself he was not cruel; he
                        was in disposition and zeal wholly yours.&rdquo; This is the way in
                        which men are in the habit of pleading before a judge. But I am addressing a
                        parent. &ldquo;I have erred; I have acted rashly; I repent; I flee to
                        your clemency; I beg pardon for my fault; I entreat you to pardon
                        me.&rdquo; If no one has gained such indulgence from you, it is an
                        arrogant address. <milestone n="31" unit="section"/> But if many have, then
                        do you give us assistance who have already given us hope. Is it possible
                        that Ligarius should have no reason for hope, when I am allowed to approach
                        you even for the purpose of entreating mercy for another? Although the hope
                        which we entertain in this cause does not rest upon this oration of mine,
                        nor on the zeal of those who entreat you for Ligarius, intimate friends of
                        your own. <milestone n="11" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>For I have seen and known what it was that you mainly considered when many
                        men were exerting themselves for any one's safety; I have seen that the
                        causes of those who were entreating you had more weight with you than the
                        persons of the advocates, and that you considered, not how much the man who
                        was entreating you was your friend, but how much he was the friend of him
                        for whom he was exerting himself. Therefore, you grant your friends so many
                        favours, that they who enjoy your liberality appear to me sometimes to be
                        happier than you yourself who give them so much. But, however, I see, as I
                        said before, that the causes of those who entreat your mercy have more
                        weight with you than the entreaties themselves; and that you are most moved
                        by those men whose grief, which they display in their petitions to you, is
                        the most genuine. </p>
					<p><milestone n="32" unit="section"/> In preserving Quintus Ligarius you will do
                        what will be acceptable to numbers of your intimate friends; but, I entreat
                        you, give weight to the considerations which are accustomed to influence
                        you. I can mention to you most brave men, Sabines, men most highly esteemed
                        by you; and the whole of the Sabine district, the flower of Italy and the
                        chief strength of the republic. You are well acquainted <pb n="481"/> with
                        the men. Observe the sadness and grief of all these men. You see yourself
                        the tears and mourning attire of Titus Brocchus, who is here present, and I
                        am in no doubt as to what your opinion of him is: you see the grief of his
                        son. <milestone n="33" unit="section"/> Why need I speak of the brothers of
                        Ligarius? Do not fancy, O Caesar, that we are pleading for the life of an
                        individual only. You must either retain all three of the Ligarii in the
                        city, or banish them all three from the city. Any exile is more desirable
                        for them than their own country, their own house, and their own household
                        gods will be if this their brother is banished by himself. If they act as
                        brothers should,&mdash;if they behave with affection and with genuine
                        grief, then let their tears, their affection, and their relationship as
                        brothers move you. Let that expression of yours have weight now which gained
                        the victory; for we heard that you said that we thought all men our enemies,
                        but those who were with us; but that you considered all men as your friends
                        who were not actually arrayed against you. Do you see, then, this most
                        respectable band; do you see the whole house of the Brocchi here present,
                        and Lucius Marcius, and Caius Caesetius, and Lucius Corfidius, and all these
                        Roman knights, who are present here in mourning garments,&mdash;men who
                        are not only well known to, but highly esteemed by you? They all were with
                        you then; and we were full of anger against them,&mdash;we were
                        attacking them; some even personally threatened them. Preserve, therefore,
                        their friends to your friends; so that, like everything else which has been
                        said by you, this, too, may be found to be strictly true. <milestone n="12" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p><milestone n="34" unit="section"/> But if you were able to look into the
                        hearts of the Ligarii, so as to see the perfect unanimity which subsists
                        between them, you would think that all the brothers were on your side. Can
                        any one entertain a doubt that, if Quintus Ligarius had been able to be in
                        Italy, he would also have adopted the same opinions as his brothers adopted?
                        Who is there who is not acquainted with the harmony existing between them,
                        united and molten together, as I may say, by their nearness of age to one
                        another? Who does not feel that anything in the world was more likely than
                        that these brothers should adopt different opinions and embrace different
                        parties? By inclination, therefore, they are all with you. Owing to the
                        necessity of the times, one was separated from <pb n="482"/> you; but he,
                        even if he had done what he did deliberately, would still have been only
                        like those men whom, nevertheless, you have shown yourself desirous to save. </p>
					<p><milestone n="35" unit="section"/> However, grant that he went up of his own
                        accord to the war, and that he departed, not only from you, but also from
                        his brothers. These friends of your own entreat you to pardon him. I,
                        indeed, at the time when I was present at, and mixed up in, all your
                        affairs, remember well what was the behaviour of Titus Ligarius at that
                        time, when he was city quaestor, with reference to you and your dignity. But
                        it is of no importance for me to remember this. I hope that you, too, who
                        are not in the habit of forgetting anything, except the injuries which have
                        been done to you, since it is a part of your character, a part of your
                        natural disposition, to do so, while you are thinking of the manner in which
                        he conducted himself<note anchored="yes">There is some uncertainty as to
                            what Cicero alludes to here. Most of the commentators think that
                            Ligarius must have been quaestor when Metellus and the rest of his
                            colleagues endeavoured to prevent Caesar from taking the money from the
                            public treasury; but Fabritius objects to this view, that at that time
                            Cicero had no connection with Caesar's affairs, which is certainly true,
                            while he says here that he had at the time that he alludes to. He
                            thinks, therefore, that Cicero is alluding to what took place in the
                            consulship of Lentulus and Philippus, (the year of Cicero's recall,)
                            respecting the vote of pay to Caesar's army in Gaul.</note> in the
                        discharge of his duty as quaestor, and while you remember, too, how some
                        other quaestors behaved,&mdash;I hope, I say, that you will also
                        recollect this. <milestone n="36" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>This Titus Ligarius, then, who had at that time no other object except to
                        induce you to think him attached to your interests, and a virtuous man also,
                        (for he could never foresee these present circumstances,) now as a suppliant
                        begs the safety of his brother from you. And when, urged by the recollection
                        of his devotion to you, you have granted that safety to these men, you will
                        by so doing have made a present of three most virtuous and upright brothers,
                        not only to themselves, nor to these men, numerous and respectable as they
                        are, nor to us who are their intimate friends, but also to the republic.
                            <milestone n="37" unit="section"/> That, therefore, which in the case of
                        that most noble and most illustrious man, Marcus Marcellus, you lately did
                        in the senate-house, do now also in the forum with respect to these most
                        virtuous brothers, who are so highly esteemed by all the crowd here present.
                        As you granted him to the <pb n="483"/> senate, so grant this man to the
                        people, whose affections you have always considered most important to you.
                        And if that day was one most glorious to you, and at the same time most
                        acceptable to the Roman people, do not, I entreat you,&mdash;do not
                        hesitate to earn the praise of a glory like that as frequently as possible. </p>
					<p>For there is nothing so calculated to win the affections of the people as
                        kindness. Of all your many virtues, there is none more admirable, none more
                        beloved than your mercy. <milestone n="38" unit="section"/> For there is no
                        action by which men make a nearer approach to the gods, than by conferring
                        safety on others. Fortune has no greater gifts for you than when it bestows
                        on you the ability&mdash;nature has no better endowment for you than
                        when it bestows on you the will, to save as many people us possible. The
                        cause of my client, perhaps, requires a longer speech than this a shorter
                        one would certainly be sufficient for a man of your natural disposition.
                        Wherefore, as I think it more desirable for you to converse, as it were,
                        with yourself, than for me or any one else to be speaking to you, I shall
                        now make an end. This only will I remind you of, that if you do grant this
                        protection to him who is absent, you will be giving it also to all these men
                        who are here present. </p>

					<head>THE SPEECH OF M. T. CICERO IN BEHALF OF KING DEIOTARUS. ADDRESSED TO CAIUS CAESAR.</head>
					<argument>
						<head>THE ARGUMENT.</head>
						<p>This speech, like those for Marcellus and Ligarius, was addressed to
                            Caesar. Deiotarus was king of Galatia, and during Cicero's
                            pro-consulship in Cilicia he had formed a friendship with him, and had
                            been of great assistance to him in his campaign against Pacorus and the
                            Parthians. Having been an adherent of Pompey, he had already been
                            deprived of a considerable part or his dominions by Caesar, and he was
                            now accused by his grandson, who was aware of Caesar's inveterate
                            dislike to him, of having formed a design against Caesar's life four
                            years before, when he entertained him in his palace on his return from
                            Egypt. It is probable that Caesar was aware of the groundlessness of the
                            charge, but countenanced it, and allowed it to be brought before him, in
                            the hopes of finding a pretext for stripping the king of all the rest of
                            his dominions. </p>
						<p>Brutus espoused Deiotarus's cause very warmly, and went towards Spain <pb n="484"/> to meet Caesar, and made him a most earnest address in
                            favour of Deiotarus. </p>
						<p>The present trial was held in Caesar's house, and Cicero proved the
                            king's innocence so completely that he was unable to condemn him; but,
                            as he would not acquit him, he adjourned the further consideration of
                            the matter till he himself could go into the East and investigate the
                            affair on the spot. </p>
						<p>This speech was delivered in the year of Caesar's fourth consulship the
                            year before he was killed.</p>

					<p>In all causes of more than ordinary importance, O Caius Caesar, I am
                        accustomed, at the beginning of my speech, to be more vehemently affected
                        than either common custom or my own age appears to require. And in this
                        particular cause I am agitated by so many considerations, that in proportion
                        as my fidelity to my friend inspires me with zeal to defend the safety of
                        king Deiotarus, in the same proportion do my fears take away from my ability
                        to do so. In the first place, I am speaking in defence of the life and
                        fortunes of a king; and although there is no particular injustice in such a
                        fact, especially when it is oneself who is in danger yet it is so unusual
                        for a king to be tried for his life, that up to this time no such thing has
                        ever been heard of. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> In the second place, I
                        am compelled now to defend against a most atrocious accusation that very
                        king whom I, in common with all the senate, used formerly to extol on
                        account of his uninterrupted services towards our republic. There is this
                        further consideration, that I am disturbed by the cruelty of one of the
                        prosecutors, and by the unworthy conduct of the other. </p>
					<p>O cruel, not to say wicked and impious, Castor! a grandson, who has brought
                        his grandfather into danger of his life, and has caused that man to dread
                        his youth, whose old age he was bound to defend and protect; who has sought
                        to recommend his entrance into life to our favour by impiety and wickedness;
                        who has instigated his grandfather's slave, whom he corrupted by bribes, to
                        accuse his master, and has carried him away from the feet of the king's
                        ambassadors. </p>
					<p><milestone n="3" unit="section"/> But when I saw the countenance and heard
                        the words of this runaway slave, accusing his master,&mdash;his absent
                        master,&mdash;his master, who was a most devoted friend to our
                        republic,&mdash;I did not feel so much grief at the depressed condition
                        of the monarch himself, as fear for the general fortunes of every one. For
                        though, according to the usage of our ancestors, it is not lawful to examine
                        a slave as a witness against his master, not <pb n="485"/> even by
                        torture,&mdash;in which mode of examination pain might, perhaps, elicit
                        the truth from a man even against his will,&mdash;a slave has arisen,
                        who, without any compulsion, accuses him against whom he might not legally
                        say a word even on the rack. <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>This thing also, O Caius Caesar, at times disturbs me; which, however, I
                        cease to fear when I come to a complete recollection of your disposition.
                        For in principle it is an unjust thing, but by your wisdom it becomes a most
                        just one. For it is a serious business (if you consider the matter by
                        itself) to speak concerning a crime before that man against whose life you
                        are accused of having meditated that crime; for there is hardly anybody who,
                        when he is a judge in any matter in which his own safety is at stake, does
                        not act with more partiality towards himself than towards the accused
                        person; but, O Caius Caesar, your admirable and extraordinary natural virtue
                        to a great extent releases me from this fear. For I am not so much afraid
                        what you may wish to decide with respect to king Deiotarus, as I am sure
                        what you wish to decide in all other cases. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>I am affected, also, by the unusual circumstance of the trial in this place;
                        because I am pleading so important a cause&mdash;one, the fellow of
                        which has never been brought under discussion&mdash;within the walls of
                        a private house; I am pleading it out of the hearing of any court or body of
                        auditors, which are a great support and encouragement to an orator. I rest
                        on nothing but your eyes, your person and countenance; I behold you alone;
                        the whole of my speech is necessarily confined to you alone. And if those
                        considerations are very important as regards my hope of establishing the
                        truth, they for all that are impediments of the energy of my mind, and to
                        the proper enthusiasm and ardour of speaking. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>For if, O Caius Caesar, I were pleading this cause in the forum, still having
                        you for my auditor and my judge, with what great cheerfulness would the
                        concourse of the Roman people inspire me! For what citizen would do
                        otherwise than favour that king, the whole of whose life he would recollect
                        had been spent in the wars of the Roman people? I should be beholding the
                        senate-house, I should be surveying the forum, I should call the heaven
                        above me itself to witness;&mdash;and so, while calling to mind the
                        kindnesses of the immortal gods, and of the Roman people, and of the senate
                        to king Deiotarus, it <pb n="486"/> would be impossible for me to be at a
                        loss for topics or armaments for my speech. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> But since the walls of a house narrow, all these topics, and since the
                        pleading of the cause is greatly crippled by the place, it behoves you, O
                        Caesar, who have yourself often pleaded for many defendants, to consider
                        within yourself what my feelings at present must be; so that your justice,
                        and also your careful attention in listening to me, may the more easily
                        lessen my natural agitation and anxiety. </p>
					<p>But before I say anything about the accusation itself, I will say a few words
                        about the hopes entertained by the accusers. For though they appear to be
                        possessed of no great skill or experience in affairs, nevertheless they have
                        never, surely, undertaken this cause without some hope or other and some
                        definite design. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>They were not ignorant that you were offended with king Deiotarus. They
                        recollected that he had been already exposed to some inconvenience and loss
                        on account of the displeasure with which you regarded him; and while they
                        knew that you were angry with him, they had had proofs also that you were
                        friendly to them. And as they would be speaking before you of a matter
                        involving personal danger to yourself, they reckoned that a fictitious
                        charge would easily lodge in your mind, which was already sore. Wherefore, O
                        Caius Caesar, first of all by your good faith, and wisdom and firmness, and
                        clemency deliver us from this fear, and prevent our suspecting that there is
                        any ill-temper lurking in you. I entreat you by that right hand of yours
                        which you pledged in token of everlasting friendship to king Deiotarus; by
                        that right hand, I say, which is not more trustworthy in wars or in battles
                        than in promises and pledges of good faith. You have chosen to enter his
                        house, you have chosen to renew with him the ancient ties of friendship and
                        hospitality. His household gods have received you under their protection;
                        the altars and hearths of king Deiotarus have beheld you at peace with and
                        friendly towards him. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>You are accustomed, O Caius Caesar, not only to he prevailed upon by
                        entreaties easily, but to he prevailed on once for all. No enemy has ever
                        been reconciled to you who has found any remnant of hostility remaining in
                        your breast afterwards. Although, who is there who has not heard of your
                        complaints against king Deiotarus? You have never accused him as being an
                        enemy to you, but as being a friend very slack in his duty, <pb n="487"/>
                        because his inclination led him more to friendships with Cnaeus Pompeius
                        than with you. And yet that very fact you said that you would have pardoned,
                        if when he sent reinforcements and even his son to Pompeius, he had himself
                        availed himself of the excuse furnished him by his age. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> And in this way, which you were acquitting him of the
                        most important charges, you left behind only the little blame of his
                        friendship for another. </p>
					<p>Therefore, you not only abstained from punishing him, but you released him
                        from all apprehension; you acknowledged him as your friend, you left him
                        king. And, indeed, his proceedings were not dictated by any hatred of you;
                        he fell by the general error of us all. That king, whom the senate had
                        repeatedly addressed by this name, using it in decrees most complimentary to
                        him, and who from his youth up had always considered that order most
                        important and most sacred, being a man living at a great distance, and a
                        foreigner by birth, was perplexed by the same affairs which embarrassed us
                        who were born and who at all times had lived in the middle of the republic.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="11" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>When he heard that men had taken arms by the authority of the senate, acting
                        with great unanimity; that the defence of the republic had been entrusted to
                        the consuls, the praetors, the tribunes of the people, and to all of us who
                        had received the title of <foreign lang="la">Imperator</foreign>, he was
                        agitated in his mind, and being a man most deeply attached to this empire,
                        he became alarmed for the safety of the Roman people, in which also he
                        considered that his own was bound up. And being in a state of the greatest
                        alarm, he thought it best to remain quiet himself. But he was beyond measure
                        agitated when he heard that the consuls had fled from Italy, and all the men
                        of consular rank (for so it was reported) with them, and all the senate, and
                        that the whole of Italy was emptied. For the road was wide open for all such
                        messengers and reports to travel to the East, and no true accounts followed.
                        He never heard a word of the conditions which you offered, nor of your
                        eagerness for concord and peace, nor of the way in which certain men
                        conspired against your dignity. And though this was the state of things,
                        still he continued quiet until ambassadors and letters came to him from
                        Cnaeus Pompeius. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Pardon Deiotarus, pardon
                        him, I entreat you, O Caesar, if he, though a king, yielded to the authority
                        of that man whom we all followed, and on whom both gods and men had heaped
                        every sort of distinction, and on whom you yourself had conferred the <pb n="488"/> most numerous and most important honours<note anchored="yes">For Caesar had given Pompey his daughter in marriage.</note> of all.
                        Nor indeed, does it follow that, because your exploits have thrown a cloud
                        over the praises of others, we have, therefore, entirely lost all
                        recollection of Cnaeus Pompeius. Who is there who is ignorant how great the
                        name of that man was, how great his influence, how great his renown in every
                        description of war, how great were the honours paid him by the Roman people,
                        and by the senate, and by you yourself? He had surpassed all his
                        predecessors in glory as much as you have surpassed all the world.
                        Therefore, we used to count up with admiration the wars, and the victories,
                        and the triumphs, and the consulship; of Cnaeus Pompeius. But yours we are
                        wholly unable to reckon. <milestone n="5" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="13" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>To him then came king Deiotarus in this miserable and fatal war, to him whom
                        he had previously assisted in his regular wars against the enemies of Rome,
                        and with whom he was bound, not only by ties of hospitality, but also by
                        personal intimacy. And he came, either because he had been asked, as a
                        friend; or because he had been sent for as an ally; or because he had been
                        summoned, like one who had learnt to obey the senate; and last of all, he
                        came as to a man flying, not to one pursuing others&mdash;that is to
                        say, as a sharer of danger, not a partner in victory. Therefore, after the
                        result of the battle of Pharsalia, he departed from Pompeius; he did not
                        choose to persist in hopes of which he saw no end. He thought he had done
                        quite enough to satisfy the claims of duty, if indeed he was under any such
                        obligations, and that he had made quite mistake enough if he had ignorantly
                        erred. He returned home; and all the time that you were engaged in the
                        Alexandrian war, he consulted your interests. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> He supported in his palaces and from his own resources
                        the army of Cnaeus Domitius, that most distinguished man. He sent money to
                        Ephesus to him whom you selected as the most faithful and most highly
                        esteemed of all your friends. He gave him money a second time; he gave him
                        money a third time for you to employ in the war, though be was forced to
                        sell property by auction in order to raise it. He exposed his own person to
                        danger and he was with you, serving in your army against Pharnaces, and he
                        considered him as his own enemy because he was yours. And all those actions
                        of his were accepted by you, O Caius Caesar, in such a spirit that you paid
                        him the <pb n="489"/> highest possible honours, and confirmed hint in the
                        dignity and title of king. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>He, therefore, having been not only released from danger by you, but having
                        been also distinguished by you with the highest honours, is now accused of
                        having intended to assassinate you in his own house&mdash;a thing which
                        you cannot in truth possibly suspect, unless you consider him to have been
                        utterly mad. For, to say nothing of what a deed of enormous wickedness it
                        would have been to assassinate his guest in the sight of his own household
                        gods; what a deed of enormous unreasonableness it would have been to have
                        extinguished the brightest light of all nations, and of all human
                        recollection; what a deed of enormous ferocity it would have been to have
                        had no dread of the conqueror of the whole earth; what a sign of an inhuman
                        and ungrateful disposition it would have been to be found to behave like a
                        despot to the very man by whom be had been addressed as a king;&mdash;to
                        say nothing of all this, what a deed of utter frenzy would it have been to
                        rouse all kings, of whom there were numbers on the borders of his own
                        kingdom, all free nations, all the allies, all the provinces, all the arms,
                        in short, of every people on earth against himself alone! To what misery
                        would he not have exposed his kingdom, his house, his wife, and his beloved
                        son, not merely by the accomplishment of such a crime, but even by the bare
                        idea of it! <milestone n="6" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="16" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>But I suppose that improvident and rash man did not see all this! On the
                        contrary, who is a more considerate than he? Who is more secret in his
                        plans? Who is more prudent? Although in this place it is not so much on the
                        ground of cleverness and prudence that it seems to me that I should defend
                        Deiotarus, as on that of good faith and religious feeling and conduct. You
                        are well acquainted, O Caius Caesar, with the honesty of the man, with his
                        virtuous habits, with his wisdom and firmness. Indeed, who is there who has
                        ever heard of the name of the Roman people, who has not heard also of the
                        integrity, and wisdom, and virtue, and good faith of Deiotarus? A crime,
                        then, that cannot be imputed to an imprudent man, on account of his fear of
                        instant destruction, nor to an unscrupulous man, unless he be at the same
                        time utterly insane; will you pretend that such a crime was thought of by a
                        most virtuous man, and one too who was never accounted a fool? <pb n="490"/>
                    </p>
					<p><milestone n="17" unit="section"/> And in what a way do you try and support
                        this invention! in a way not only not calculated to win belief, but not even
                        such as to, give rise to the least suspicion. When, says the prosecutor, you
                        had come to the Luceian fort, and had turned aside to the palace of the king
                        your entertainer, there certain place where all those things were arranged
                        which the king had settled to offer you as presents. To this place he
                        intended to conduct you on coming out of the bath, before you lay down; for
                        there were armed men stationed in that very place on purpose to kill you.
                        This is the charge; this is the reason why a runaway should accuse a
                        monarch, a slave accuse his master! I, in truth, O Caius Caesar, at the very
                        beginning, when the cause was originally laid before me, was struck with a
                        suspicion that Philippus, the physician, one of the king's slaves, who had
                        been sent with the ambassadors, had been corrupted by that young man. He has
                        suborned the physician to act as informer, thought I; he will be sure to
                        invent some accusation of poisoning. Although my conjecture was some way
                        from the exact truth, it was not much out as to the general principle of the
                        accusation. What says the physician? <milestone n="18" unit="section"/> Not
                        a word about poison. But in the first place, that might have been
                        administered much more a in a potion or in food; in the second place, a
                        crime is committed in that way with greater impunity, because when it has
                        been done, it can be denied. If he had assassinated you openly, he would
                        have brought upon himself not only the hatred of all nations, but their arms
                        also. If he had slain you by poison, to be sure he never would have been
                        able to conceal the action from the divine wrath of the Jupiter who presides
                        over hospitality, but he might perhaps have concealed it from men. Are we,
                        then, to suppose that that which he might have attempted in secret and have
                        executed with great caution, he never entrusted to you who were a skillful
                        physician, and, as he believed, a faithful servant and yet that he could
                        conceal nothing from you with respect to arms and blood, and ambuscade? And
                        how cleverly is the whole nation worked up! <milestone n="19" unit="section"/> It was your own good fortune, says he that fortune which always preserves
                        you, which saved you then. You said that you did not wish at that moment to
                        see the presents. <milestone n="7" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>What happened afterwards? Did Deiotarus, after he had failed in accomplishing
                        the business at that time, at once <pb n="491"/> dismiss his army? was there
                        no other place where he could set an ambush? But you said that when you had
                        supped you would come back again the same way; and you did so. Was it a very
                        difficult job to detain the armed men one or two hours in the place where
                        they had been stationed? After you had spent your time at the banquet
                        courteously and merrily, then you went back that way, as you had said; and
                        then and there you found that the behaviour of Deiotarus to you resembled
                        that of king Attalus to Publius Africanus to whom, as we have read, he sent
                        the most magnificent gifts from Asia to Numantia; which Africanus accepted
                        in the sight of all his army. And when Deiotarus, being present with you,
                        had done all this in a kingly spirit and with royal courtesy, you departed
                        to your chamber. <milestone n="20" unit="section"/> I entreat you, O Caesar,
                        trace back your recollection of that time, bring that day back before your
                        eyes, remember the countenances of the men who were then gazing on you and
                        admiring you; was there any trepidation among them? any disorder? Was
                        anything done except in an orderly and quiet manner,&mdash;except as
                        became the establishment of a dignified and honourable man? What reason then
                        can be imagined why he should have intended to murder you after you had
                        bathed, and why he should not have chosen to do so after you had supped?
                            <milestone n="21" unit="section"/> &ldquo;Oh, he put it
                        off,&rdquo; says the prosecutor, &ldquo;till the next day, in order
                        that when he arrived at the Luceian fort, he might there put his designs in
                        execution.&rdquo;I do not understand the effect of his changing the
                        place; but still the whole case was conducted in an incriminatory manner.
                        &ldquo;When,&rdquo; says the prosecutor, &ldquo;you said after
                        supper that you wished to vomit, they began to lead you to the bath-room;
                        for that was the place where the ambuscade was; but still that same fortune
                        of yours saved you; you said that you had rather go to your
                        bedroom.&rdquo; May the gods forgive you, you run-away slave! Are you so
                        utterly, not only worthless and infamous, but also stupid and senseless?
                        What? were they brazen statues that he had planted in ambush, so that they
                        could not be moved from the bath-room to the bed-chamber? </p>
					<p>Here you have the whole charge as to the ambuscade: for he said nothing
                        further. &ldquo;In all this,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I was his
                        accomplice.&rdquo; What do you mean? Was he so demented as to allow a
                        man to leave him who was privy to so enormous a wickedness? As even to send
                        him to Rome, where he knew his grandson was, who was most bitterly hostile
                        to him, and <pb n="492"/> where Caius Caesar was, against whom he had laid
                        this plot? especially when he was the only man who could give any
                        information against him in his absence. <milestone n="22" unit="section"/>
                        &ldquo;My brothers too,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;because they also
                        were privy to it he threw into prison.&rdquo; When, then, he was putting
                        those men in prison whom he had with him, did he leave you at large and send
                        you to Rome,&mdash;you who knew the very same facts which you say that
                        they knew? <milestone n="8" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>The remainder of the accusation was of a twofold character; one part of which
                        was, that the king was always in his watch-tower because he was so
                        disaffected to your interests; the other, that he had levied a large army
                        against you. As to the army, I will reply to that charge in a very few
                        words, as I will to the rest of the charges. King Deiotarus never had any
                        forces with which he could have made war upon the Roman people; but only
                        just sufficient to protect his own territories from the incursions of
                        enemies, and to send reinforcements to our generals. And before this time he
                        was able to maintain a larger force than he can now; at present he can with
                        difficulty keep up a very small one. <milestone n="23" unit="section"/>
                        &ldquo;Oh, but he sent to Caecilius; I don't know who it was he sent,
                        but he threw those whom he sent or rather ordered to go, into prison,
                        because they would not go.&rdquo; I do not stop to ask how far it is
                        probable that a king should have had no one to send; or that those whom he
                        ordered to go should not have obeyed him; or how it was that those men who
                        refused obedience in so important an affair, were put in prison, and not
                        executed; but still, when he was sending to Caecilius,<note anchored="yes">This was Quintius Caecilius Brassus, a zealous partisan of Pompey's,
                            who after the battle of Pharsalia collected some of the remnants of his
                            army in Syria, with which he afterwards joined Cassius after the death
                            of Caesar.</note> was he ignorant that that party had been defeated, or
                        did he think that Caecilius a person of great importance? a man whom he, who
                        was well acquainted with our leading men, would have despised because he
                        knew him, and just as much because he did not know him. <milestone n="24" unit="section"/> He added, also, that he did not send his best
                        cavalry;&mdash;I dare say, they were old troops, O Caesar: nothing to
                        your cavalry; but still they were the best men he had, his picked men. He
                        says, that one of the body was recognised as being a slave;&mdash;I do
                        not believe it; I never heard of it. But still, even if such a thing had
                        happened, I should not conceive that that was any fault of the king's. <pb n="493"/>
                        <milestone n="9" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>&ldquo;He was very ill-disposed towards you.&rdquo; How so? He hoped,
                        I suppose, that you would find it difficult to get out of Alexandria, on
                        account of the nature of the country and of the river. But, at that very
                        time, he supplied you with money, and with provisions for your army; he
                        cooperated to the utmost of his power with the officer to whom you had given
                        command in Asia; he assisted you when victorious, not only in the way of
                        affording you hospitality, but with you he encountered danger, and stood by
                        your side in the array of battle. <milestone n="25" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>The African war followed: there were unfavourable reports spread about you,
                        which also roused that frantic Caecilius. What on that occasion was the
                        disposition evinced towards you by the king? He sold property by auction,
                        and preferred stripping himself to not supplying you with money.
                        &ldquo;But,&rdquo; says the prosecutor, &ldquo;at that very time
                        he was sending men to Nicaea, and to Ephesus, to catch every report that
                        came from Africa, and to bring it to him with all speed.&rdquo;
                        Therefore, when news came that Domitius had perished by shipwreck, and that
                        you were blockaded in some fortress, he quoted a Greek verse with reference
                        to Domitius, having the same meaning as that of our poet: <quote>

					<p>What is the next statement? What is the next step taken by this scoundrel? He
                        says that Deiotarus was so elated at this, that he drowned his joy in wine,
                        and danced naked at a banquet. What cross is there that could be a
                        sufficient punishment for this slave? Did any one ever see Deiotarus
                        dancing,&mdash;did any one ever see him drunk? All kingly virtues are
                        united in that man, and that I think yourself <pb n="4945"/> are well aware
                        of, O Caesar; but most especially is that singular and admirable economy of
                        his conspicuous. Although this is an attribute for which I know that it is
                        not usual to praise kings. To say that a man is economical is not much
                        praise for a king. To be brave, just, severe, dignified, magnanimous,
                        open-handed, beneficent liberal&mdash;these are the praises suited to a
                        king. Economy is a virtue for a private individual. Let every one take it as
                        he pleases: but I consider economy&mdash;that is to say, moderation and
                        temperance&mdash;the very greatest of virtues. And this existed in this
                        man from his earliest youth, and was experienced by, and known to, all Asia,
                        and by all our magistrates and ambassadors, and by all the Roman knights who
                        trafficked in Asia. </p>

                        <milestone n="27" unit="section"/> It was by many successive steps of
                        dutiful service towards our republic that he arrived at this title of king;
                        but still, whatever leisure he had from the wars of the Roman people, he
                        devoted entirely to cultivating friendship and intimacy with our citizens,
                        and to uniting his affairs and interests to theirs. So that he was not only
                        considered a noble tetrarch, but also an excellent father of a family, and a
                        most industrious farmer and grazier. Did he, then, who, while a young man,
                        before he had arrived at his subsequent high rank, never did anything that
                        was inconsistent with the most rigid virtue and the greatest dignity, after
                        he had raised to himself the esteem in which he is now held, and when he had
                        become of so advanced an age, did he dance? <milestone n="10" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="28" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>You ought, O Castor, rather to imitate the manner and principles of your
                        grandfather, than calumniate a most virtuous and most illustrious man with
                        the language of a runaway slave. Even if you had had a grandfather who was a
                        dancer, and not a man from whom examples of modesty and chastity might be
                        derived, still this reproach is one which is very little suited to your age.
                        Those pursuits to which he had been habituated from his earliest
                        age&mdash;not dancing, but such as would train him to wield his arms and
                        manage his horses in the best manner,&mdash;those all had now failed him
                        at his advanced time of life; so that we used to wonder, when several men
                        had lifted Deiotarus on his horse, how so old a man as he could contrive to
                        stick on. But this young man, who was a soldier of mine in Cilicia, and a
                        comrade of mine in Greece, how was he used to ride about in <pb n="495"/>
                        that army of ours, with his own picked body of cavalry, whom his father had
                        sent with him to join Pompeius! what gallops he used to take; how he used to
                        display his skill! What a parade he used to make! How did he refuse to yield
                        to any one in his zeal and eagerness for the success of that cause!
                            <milestone n="29" unit="section"/> But even after the army was lost, I,
                        who had at all times been an adviser of peace, but who, after the battle of
                        Pharsalia, urged every one not to lay aside, but to throw away their arms,
                        could never bring this young man to adopt my advice, both because of his own
                        eagerness for that war, and because he thought himself bound to satisfy the
                        expectations of his father. </p>
					<p>Happy is that house which has obtained, not only impunity, but licence to
                        accuse others! Unfortunate Deiotarus, who is not only accused by one who was
                        in the same camp with him, before you, but who is impeached even by his own
                        relations. Cannot you, O Castor, be content with your own good fortune
                        without bringing misery on your relations? <milestone n="11" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="30" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>Grant that there may be enmity between you; which, however, there ought not
                        to be; for it was king Deiotarus who raised your family, when abject and
                        obscure, from darkness into light. Who ever heard of your father, or who he
                        was, before they heard whose son-in-law he was? But even supposing you
                        repudiated the name of the connection with ever so much ingratitude and
                        impiety, still you might have conducted your quarrel like a man, and not
                        pursue him with a false accusation, not seek his life, not prosecute him on
                        a capital charge. Be it so:&mdash;let even this excess of bitterness and
                        hatred be permitted. Was it to go to such an extent that all the laws of
                        ordinary life and of common safety, and even of humanity, are to be
                        violated? to tamper with slaves by words, to corrupt them by hopes and
                        promises; to lead them away to your own house, to arm them against their
                        master, to wage an impious war not against one relation, but against every
                        family in the world? For that corruption of slaves, if it be not only
                        unpunished, but even approved by such a great authority as that of this
                        tribunal, no walls, no laws, no rights will be sufficient for the protection
                        of our safety. For when that which is in our houses and is our own can sally
                        out with impunity and fight against us, slavery then gets the mastery, and
                        the master's position is slavery. <milestone n="31" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>Shame on the times, and on our present habits! That <pb n="496"/> Cnaeus
                        Domitius, whom we as boys saw consul, and censor and chief pontiff, when, as
                        tribune of the people, he had impeached Marcus Scaurus, the chief man of the
                        state, before the people, and when a slave of Scaurus had come secretly to
                        him at his own house, and had offered to give information with respect to
                        charges which might he brought against his master ordered the slave to be
                        apprehended, and taken to Scaurus. See what a difference there is
                        now,&mdash;although it is a shame of me to compare Castor to Domitius;
                        still, he sent his slave back to his enemy, you have seduced one from your
                        grandfather; he refused to listen to one though he had not been bribed, you
                        have bribed one; he rejected a slave as his assistant against his master,
                        you have employed one even as an accuser. But was it only once that that
                        fellow was corrupted by you? <milestone n="32" unit="section"/> Did he not
                        escape back again to the ambassadors after he had been brought forward by
                        you, and after he had been with you? Did he not even come to Caius Cnaeus
                        Domitius? Did not he, in the hearing of this Servius Sulpicius that most
                        illustrious man, who is present here, and of this Titus Torquatus, a most
                        virtuous young man, who is also present, confess that he had been bribed by
                        you, and that it was by your promises that he had been instigated to this
                        dishonesty? <milestone n="12" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>What then is the object of this shameless, and barbarous, and unrestrained
                        inhumanity? Was it for this that you came into this city, that you might
                        corrupt the principles predominant in, and the examples furnished by this
                        city, and that you might pollute the humanity of our state by your own
                        private ferocity? </p>
					<p><milestone n="33" unit="section"/> And how ingeniously have all your charges
                        been collected! Blesamius, says he, (for it was in his name, a very
                        excellent man, and one who was a stranger to you, that he was calumniating
                        you, O Deiotarus,) used to write to the king, that you, O Caesar, were very
                        unpopular; that you were considered a tyrant; that men were exceedingly
                        offended at your statue having been placed among those of the kings; that
                        you were never well received on your appearance in public. Do not you
                        perceive, O Caesar, that these statements were collected by these fellows,
                        from the city conversation of spiteful men? Could Blesamius have written to
                        say that Caesar was a tyrant? Yes, for he had seen the heads of many
                        citizens exposed; he had seen many men by the orders of Caesar ill-treated,
                        scourged <pb n="497"/> and executed; he had seen many houses pillaged and
                        destroyed; he had seen the forum filled with armed troops!&mdash;No;
                        those things which previously we always have felt after victories in civil
                        war, we have not seen now, when you have been our conqueror. <milestone n="34" unit="section"/> You are the only man&mdash;you I say, O
                        Caius Caesar, are the only man, by whose victory no one has perished except
                        with arms in his hand. And can the man whom we, free men, born in the
                        enjoyment of the perfect liberty of the Roman people, consider not only no
                        tyrant but as even the most merciful man possible in the use of victory, can
                        he appear a tyrant to Blesamius, who is living under a king? For who
                        complains about a statue, especially about one single statue, when he sees
                        such a number? Great reason have we, indeed, to envy a man his statues, when
                        we do not grudge him trophies; for if it be the place which provokes envy,
                        surely there is no place more open and fit for a statue than the <foreign lang="la">rostra</foreign>. And as to the way in which he is received in
                        public, why need I make any reply at all? for public applause has never been
                        desired by you, and sometimes, owing to the amazement with which men have
                        viewed your achievements, it has even been stifled by the excess of their
                        admiration; and perhaps, too, it has been omitted because nothing vulgar
                        could possibly appear worthy of you. <milestone n="13" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="35" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>I do not think that anything has been omitted by me; but some topics have
                        been reserved for the end of my speech, and they are of such a nature that
                        they ought to reconcile you cordially to Deiotarus&mdash;for I am not
                        now afraid of your being angry with him; I am apprehensive rather of your
                        suspecting that he harbours some resentment against you. And that suspicion,
                        believe me, O Caesar, is as remote as possible from the truth. For he
                        recollects only what he still has left owing to you, and not what he has
                        lost by your means; nor does he consider that he has been deprived of
                        anything by you, but being aware that it was necessary for you to give many
                        rewards to many people, he did not think it hard that you should take
                        something from him who had been on the other side. <milestone n="36" unit="section"/> In truth, if that great prince, Antiochus the Great the
                        king of Asia, who, after he had been conquered by Scipio, was ordered to
                        consider Mount Taurus as the boundary of his dominions, and was deprived of
                        all this Asia which is now a province of our own,&mdash;if he was
                        accustomed to say that he had been kindly treated by the Roman <pb n="498"/>
                        people, because be had been released by them from the care of an overgrown
                        empire, and was now at liberty to enjoy a kingdom of moderate extent,
                        Deiotarus can comfort himself much more easily. For Antiochus had suffered a
                        chastisement for his insanity, my client only for an error. You, O Caesar,
                        gave everything to Deiotarus when you gave him and his son the title of
                        King; and as long as he is allowed to retain and preserve this title, he
                        does not think that the kindness of the Roman people is at all diminished,
                        or that the senate has come to any unfavourable decision respecting him. He
                        preserves a great and lofty spirit, and will never succumb to his enemies,
                        nor even to fortune. <milestone n="37" unit="section"/>
                    </p>
					<p>He thinks that by his previous conduct he has given birth to much, and that
                        by his own courage and virtue he still has much which he cannot possibly he
                        deprived of. For what fortune, or what accident, or what injury can happen
                        to Deiotarus of such severity as to efface the decrees of all our generals
                        respecting him? For he has been complimented and distinguished ever since he
                        was of an age to serve in their camps, by all those men who have had the
                        conduct of our wars in Asia, and in Cappadocia, and in Pontus, and in
                        Cilicia, and in Syria. And what length of time will ever efface, what
                        forgetfulness will ever obliterate those numerous and honourable resolutions
                        of the senate respecting him, which have been recorded in the public
                        writings and memorials of the Roman people? </p>
					<p>Why need I speak of his valour? why of his greatness of mind? of his wisdom?
                        of his firmness and consistency? qualities which not only have all wise and
                        learned men pronounced to be the greatest blessings, but which some have
                        even considered the only real ones, and have said that virtue wanted nothing
                        more than these for the purpose of living not only well, but even happily.
                            <milestone n="38" unit="section"/> He, considering these things, and
                        reflecting on them day and night, is so far from feeling resentment against
                        you, (for he would not only be ungrateful, but even mad to do so,) that he
                        attributes the whole of the tranquillity and quiet of his old age which he
                        enjoys to your clemency. <milestone n="14" unit="chapter"/></p>
					<p>And as these were his sentiments previously, I do not doubt also that after

                        and that <pb n="499"/> he ceased to feel any anxiety whatever. For in them
                        you bid him entertain good hopes, and to be of good
                        courage&mdash;expressions which I know you are not in the habit of using
                        without a meaning: for I recollect that you wrote to me in almost the same
                        language, and that when you bade me entertain good hopes of the future you
                        were not deceiving me. </p>
					<p>
                        <milestone n="39" unit="section"/> I am anxious, indeed, in this cause of
                        King Deiotarus, with whom the affairs of this republic have united me in

                        many most distinguished men, who have been pardoned by you, and who ought to
                        be able to consider their pardon, whenever pronounced, as binding for ever;

                        should begin again to feel apprehension, who has once been released by you

					<p>I ought not, O Caesar, to endeavour, as is often done by men in such danger
                        as this, to move your pity by my language. There is no need of my doing so.
                        Your feelings are of their own accord accustomed to come to the aid of the
                        suppliant and unfortunate, without being elicited by the eloquence of
                        anybody. Place before your eyes two kings, and contemplate with your mind
                        what you cannot behold with your eyes. You will surely yield to your
                        feelings of compassion what you refused to your resentment. There are many
                        monuments of your clemency, but the chief, sure, are the secure happiness of
                        those men to whom it is you have been the author of safety. And if such an
                        action is glorious in the case of a private individual, much more will it be
                        celebrated when it is a king who is the object of it. The title of King has
                        always been accounted a holy name in this city; but the names of ally and
                        king, when united together, are then the holiest of all titles. <milestone n="15" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="41" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>And these kings were afraid that if you were victorious they might lose that
                        name. But now that they have been allowed to retain it, and have been
                        confirmed in it by you, I confidently trust that they will even transmit it
                        to <pb n="500"/> their posterity. Moreover, these ambassadors whom you see
                        before you, Hieras, and Blesamius, and Antigonus, men with whom you and all
                        of us have long been acquainted, and also Dorylaus, a man of the same
                        loyalty and virtue as they, who was lately sent as ambassador to you in
                        company with Hieras, devoted friends of the king, and men too who, as I
                        hope, are highly esteemed by you, offer you their persons as hostages and
                        pledges to secure the safety of their prince. <milestone n="42" unit="section"/> Ask Blesamius whether he ever wrote anything to the
                        king to the disparagement of your dignity. Hieras, indeed, undertakes the
                        whole cause of Deiotarus, and offers himself as the defendant against all
                        these charges in behalf of, and instead of, the king. He implores the aid of
                        your recollection in his favour; a quality in which you greatly excel: he
                        declares that all the time that you were in the tetrarchy of Deiotarus he
                        never left your side. He says that he met you on the frontier, and that he
                        attended you to the borders on the opposite side of the country; that when
                        you left the bath he was with you, and when you surveyed all those presents
                        after supper, and when you retired to rest in your bed-chamber. And he says,
                        too, that he attended you in the same unremitting manner all the next day.
                            <milestone n="43" unit="section"/></p>
					<p>Wherefore, if any one of those things which Deiotarus has been accused of,
                        really was thought of, he does not object to your thinking the crime his. I
                        entreat you, O Caius Caesar, to consider that on this day your sentence will
                        bring on those kings either most miserable calamity, accompanied with
                        infinite disgrace, or an unsullied reputation attended with safety; and to
                        desire the one of those results would be an act of cruelty, to secure the
                        other is an action suitable to your clemency. </p>
