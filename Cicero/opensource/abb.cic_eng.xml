<div2 type="section">
<p>Cicero's letters are of such wide range and varied interest that it is an
exceptionally difficult task to edit a limited number which shall be fairly
representative of the whole, and it is hoped that those readers who fail to
find some of their favorite letters in this volume will bear this difficulty in
mind.  The editor has chosen in particular the letters which Cicero wrote to
the members of his own family and to his intimate friends upon personal
subjects, in the hope of throwing as much light as possible upon Cicero's
private character, his tastes, his daily life, and his relations with his
personal and literary friends. At the same time it is hoped that letters
bearing upon political matters have been included in sufficient number to
present a good outline of Cicero's public life and of his times.  The letters
are arranged chronologically.
</p>
<p>The text of the <title>Epistulae ad familiares</title> is that of Mendelssohn, with
slight changes in a few passages generally recognized as corrupt and not
readable.  C. F. W. Muller's edition is the basis for the text of the
<title>Epistulae ad Quintum fratrem</title>, and Wesenberg's for that of
the <title>Epistulae ad Atticum</title>, Bks. I.-XI. and XIV.-XVI., but in very many cases
the reading of the Medicean MS., which Wesenberg rejects, has been restored,
and in certain other cases the more probable conjectures of Lehmann and others
have been substituted for the emendations accepted by Wesenberg.  The text of
Bks. XII. and XIII. of the <title>Epistulae ad Atticum</title> is that of O. E. Schmidt.  For further
particulars the reader may Consult the Introduction and the statement in the
Critical Appendix.
</p>
<p>The orthography has been, in general, conformed to the standards established by
Brambach and by Georges in his <title lang="de">Lexikon der lateinischen Wortformen</title>.
</p>
<p>In the Introduction and the Commentary attention has been directed in
particular to the characteristics of epistolary and colloquial Latin. A full
discussion of these peculiarities would have far transcended the limits of this
book.  The editor has therefore contented himself with a statement in the
Introduction of the most important divergencies which the Letters show in
lexicography, syntax, and style from the standard in those matters in formal
Latin, and has supplemented this general statement by more detailed notes at
the proper points in the Commentary.
</p>
<p>The works which the editor has found of most service in the preparation of the
Introduction and Commentary are mentioned in the list given on a subsequent
page, and although his indebtedness is usually noted specifically in the
Commentary, he feels under special obligation to the editions of Tyrrell,
Watson, S&uuml;pfle-B&ouml;ckel, and Hofmann-Andresen, and to the writings of
O. E. Schmidt and Landgraf.
</p>
<p>But, above all, the editor would gratefully acknowledge the deep obligation
which he is under to Professors C. L. Smith and Tracy Peck, the
editors-in-chief of this Series, for the careful criticism which they have
given to this work while it has been passing through the press.           </p>

<note anchored="yes" n="2">Cicero, when a boy, met Archias at Rome;  <bibl n="Cic. Arch. 1">pro Arch. 1</bibl>.</note>
and here, like other boys of the period, Cicero pursued the study of Greek and Latin literature, rhetoric, and,
somewhat later, philosophy and jurisprudence.  His studies were interrupted in <date value="-89">89 B.C.</date>
 by a year's service in the Social War,
<note anchored="yes" n="3"><bibl n="Cic. Phil. 12.27">Philipp. 12.27</bibl>.</note>
but at its close they were taken up again with his old vigor.  His chosen profession was that of the
law, and in <date value="-81">81 B.C.</date> he made his first appearance at the bar in
defending P. Quinctius.  A far more important event was his defense of Sex.
Roscius of Ameria in the following year.  Some political significance attaches
to the trial, as Cicero's real antagonist, Chrysogonus,
<note anchored="yes"><bibl n="Cic. S.Rosc. 6">pro Sex. Rosc. 6</bibl>.</note>
was a favorite of the dictator Sulla.</p></div3>
<div3 id="intr.2" type="para">
<p>2. Possibly to escape the consequent displeasure of Sulla, but more probably
for the sake of his health, Cicero left Rome and spent nearly two years at
Athens, Rhodes, and in Asia Minor, <note anchored="yes" n="5"><bibl n="Cic. ad Brut. 314">Brutus 314-316</bibl></note>
being mainly engaged in the study of
<pb n="xvi"/>
philosophy and oratory.  Cicero's study of philosophy during this period
determined his subsequent philosophical attitude, while his work under Molon of
Rhodes enabled him to Cultivate a less florid style of oratory than that which
characterized his earlier orations.  At Athens he also made the acquaintance of
T. Pomponius Atticus.<note anchored="yes" n="1"><bibl n="Cic. Fin. 5.1">de Fin. 5.1</bibl>.</note></p></div3>
<div3 id="intr.3" type="para">
<p>3. Cicero's marriage to Terentia, a woman of some property and of good family,
must have taken place soon after his return to Rome, or just before his
departure from the city.<note anchored="yes" n="2">Tullia was betrothed in <date value="-66">66 B.C.</date>
Cf. <bibl n="Cic. Att. 1.3.3">Att. 1.3.3</bibl>.</note>
Two years after his return, in <date value="-76">76 B.C.</date>, he was quaestor, and had charge of Western Sicily, with Lilybaeum as his headquarters.
His achievements in Sicily made little impression at Rome,<note anchored="yes" n="3"><bibl n="Cic. Planc. 64">pro Plancio, 64, 65</bibl>.</note> but the intimate
acquaintance which he gained with the island and its people served him in good
stead when he made his first real appearance in politics six years later as the
prosecutor of Verres.</p>
<p>Verres, who had been governor of Sicily from <dateRange from="-73" to="-71">73 to 71 B.C.</dateRange>, was charged
by the Sicilians with extortion and cruelty.  Cicero, who conducted the
prosecution, presented the facts in such a masterly way that Hortensius, the
advocate of Verres, withdrew from the case, and Verres himself went into
exile.<note anchored="yes" n="4"><bibl n="Plut. Cic. 7">Plutarch, Cic. 7, 8</bibl>; <bibl n="Cic. Ver. 2.2.192">in Verr. 2.2.192</bibl>.</note></p></div3>
<div3 id="intr.4" type="para">
<p>4. His prosecution of Verres as well as his defense of Roscius Amerinus (<date value="-80">80
B.C.</date>) and of Cornelius Sulla (in <date value="-62">62 B.C.</date>) have caused much discussion of
Cicero's political tendencies during this early period.  All three of these
cases had a pronounced political character, and in all three Cicero was the
advocate of democratic interests.  He defended Roscius against the attacks of
Sulla's favorite, during the lifetime of that champion of the aristocratic
cause.  He prosecuted Verres without mercy, although Verres was
<pb n="xvii"/>
backed by the entire senatorial party, which felt that its prestige and its
privileges were at stake in the trial.  He defended Cornelius Sulla against the
charge of having taken part in the Catilinarian conspiracy, although it is
probable that Sulla at least sympathized with the purposes of the democratic
leader.<note anchored="yes" n="1"><bibl n="Cic. Sul. 7.22">pro Sulla, 7.22</bibl>; <bibl n="Cic. Off. 2.2.9">de Off. 2.2.9</bibl>;
<bibl>Fam. 15.37.2</bibl>.</note>  It may be said, and perhaps with truth, that in all three cases
Cicero appeared as a lawyer and not in any sense as a politician.  We cannot
help feeling, however, that in Cicero's day, as would be the case in our own
time, in a legal contest involving political interests, the advocates on either
side of the question must have belonged in most instances to the political
party whose interests would be promoted by the success of that side. What could
be more natural than that Cicero, belonging to the equestrian class, whose
rights and privileges had been so seriously curtailed in the aristocratic
reaction of Sulla, should oppose the aristocracy at some points?  The aid which
his action gave to the democratic cause does not, however, stamp him as a
democrat.</p></div3>
<div3 id="intr.5" type="para">
<p>5. As a candidate for the aedileship for <date value="-69">69 B.C.</date>, and for the praetorship for
<date value="-66">66 B.C.</date>, Cicero led all of his rivals at the polls.<note anchored="yes" n="2"><bibl n="Cic. Pis. 2">in Pison. 2</bibl>; <bibl n="Cic. Man. 2">de leg. Manil. 2</bibl>.</note>
Both offices he
filled with distinction, and although as praetor he showed, as in earlier
years, slight democratic tendencies,
<note anchored="yes" n="3">Herzog, 1. p. 538.</note>his personal integrity and his intimate
knowledge of the law made his administration of the office wise and honorable.
Throughout this period, even during his incumbency of the two offices just
mentioned, Cicero followed unremittingly his profession of the law, appearing
in defense, among others, of Fonteius, Caecina, and Cluentius.</p></div3>
<div3 id="intr.6" type="para">
<p>6. The personal admiration which Cicero felt for Pompey, his political sympathy
with that leader, and perhaps his
<pb n="xviii"/>
desire to link his own fortunes with those of Pompey, led Cicero to approve of
the Gabinian law,
<note anchored="yes" n="1"><bibl n="Cic. Man. 52">de leg. Manil. 52</bibl></note>

<note anchored="yes" n="2"><bibl n="Cic. Mur. 42">pro Mur. 42</bibl>.</note> and
devoted all his energy to his candidacy for the consulship.  Cicero's political
attitude underwent a slight change in the two or three years preceding his
consulship.  He had never been an out and out democrat, but had opposed the
abuses of the aristocratic system rather than that system in its entirety.  The
subsidence of that spirit of opposition which often characterizes youth, his
political ambitions, and the growth of a radical faction in the democratic
party with anarchical tendencies, all conspired to draw him nearer to the
Optimates.  Both Marcus and his brother Quintus felt that the support of the
senatorial party was essential, and that all suspicion of a democratic leaning
on the part of Marcus must be removed, as is indicated by a significant passage
in a political pamphlet which Quintus addressed to his brother at this time:  
<foreign lang="la">Hi rogandi omnes sunt diligenter et ad eos adlegandum est

held at his house in honor of the goddess Bona Dea, which it was unlawful for
men to attend . but during the meeting, P. Clodius, a patrician, was found to
be present in disguise  (Cf. Epist V.).  A judicial investigation
of the matter was made, but Clodius secured an acquittal through the kind
offices of Crassus, who bribed a majority of the jurors.  Cicero does not seem

but when, in the trial, Clodius attempted to establish an alibi by
offering evidence to prove that he was at Interamna, ninety miles from Rome, at
the time of the sacrilege, Cicero went on the witness stand and testified that
he had seen Clodius in Rome within three hours of the time he claimed to have
been at Interamna.

so that henceforth he thought of little

opportunity to punish him for his coldness toward them by declining either to

<p>14. After the return of Caesar, Cicero took little part in politics.  He did
not sympathize with the uncompromising attitude of the senate, he was hurt by
the coldness of Pompey towards himself, and disappointed by that leader's
selfish aims.  While appreciating the irresistible power of the Triumvirate, he
saw a ray of hope in the apparent unpopularity of the triumvirs,

The principle of this bill was not new,
and no one was mentioned in it by name, but Cicero knew that it was directed
against himself. There can be little doubt that, in view of the Porcian and
Sempronian laws, the execution of Lentulus and his fellow-conspirators, who
were not allowed to make an appeal to the people, was unconstitutional.
Cicero's plea, that the passage of the <foreign lang="la">senatus consuttum ultimum</foreign>
suspended this privilege, and that Lentulus and the others, by conspiring
with the Allobroges, had lost their right as citizens, is not a sufficient
answer.  At all events, Cicero's cause was a hopeless one.
The senators and knights were powerless, the consuls would give no help, and
the triumvirs were not loath to have Cicero and Cato, who was at this time sent
to Cyprus on a difficult mission, removed from the city before Caesar's

remarkable change which Cicero's political attitude underwent in <date value="-56">56 B.C.</date>
Quintus had promised Pompey that his brother, if recalled, would not oppose the
triumvirs.  As a man of honor,
<pb n="xxvi"/>
Marcus could not but recognize the binding force of this promise made in his
behalf &mdash; made, though it was, in a moment of weakness and despair.  To this
consideration must also be added Cicero's positive gratitude for Pompey's
services in securing his recall, and his recognition of the power of the
triumvirs to punish him severely if he persisted in his independent course.
Cicero withdrew his motion,
<note anchored="yes" n="1"><bibl>Q. fr. 2.6.2</bibl>.</note>
and, for the next five years, gave up all
opposition to the plans of the triumvirs.  Other circumstances conspired to
make this the only feasible course for Cicero to pursue. The policy of the
Optimates was hopelessly selfish and headstrong, while they themselves showed
that petty jealousy of Cicero which had characterized their conduct on many
previous occasions
<note anchored="yes" n="2"><bibl n="Cic. Att. 4.2.5">Att. 4.2.5</bibl>.</note>; and finally, when Quintus Cicero took service with Caesar

<p>These circumstances may justify Cicero's failure to oppose the triumvirs, but

<p>41. At this point Cicero's active participation in the struggle with Antony
begins.  He saw the weak and the strong points of the senatorial cause.  His
judgment was unerring and his courage unfaltering.   He saw that Octavius must
be attached to the senatorial party, and Octavius was invested with the
<foreign lang="la">imperium</foreign> and authorized, in codperation with the consuls of <date value="-43">43 B.C.</date>, to
conduct the war against Antony.<note anchored="yes" n="8">Mon. Ancyran. I;  Appian <bibl n="Caes. Civ. 3.45">B. C. 3.45</bibl>.</note>

He appreciated that at all hazards
<pb n="xl"/>
D. Brutus must make a determined stand in Gallia Cisalpina, and that the
governors of the neighboring provinces must be induced to rally to his support.

Lepidus in southern Gaul, and to Poiho in Spain.<note anchored="yes" n="1">Cf. Fam. Bk. 10.</note>

Brutus and Cassius in the East were apprised of the course of events in Italy,<note anchored="yes" n="2">Cf. Fam. Bk. 12, and Epist. ad Brut.</note>

the senate repealed the law which assigned Gallia Cisalpina and

<p>The first step of the triumvirs was to remove their enemies at Rome, and Cicero's
name was included in the list of the proscribed, notwithstanding the protest
of Octavius.  Cicero at first thought of seeking refuge in the East, and
actually set sail from Astura for that purpose, but the unfavorable weather and
his own unwillingness to leave his native land held him back, and the
emissaries of Antony found him still in his Formian villa when they reached
that place, Dec. 7.  His faithful slaves attempted to save him even at the last
moment by hurrying him on board a ship which lay in the harbor, but he was
overtaken by his pursuers, and, forbidding his followers to make resistance,

Cicero did not apparently increase his property to any great extent by
productive investments.  A large part of it in fact was invested in houses and
villas in Rome and in the country districts of Italy. Besides his town house

Cicero owned villas at Arpinum, Tusculum, Antium, Astura, Formiae, Cumae, Puteoli, and Pompeii, and lodges along some of the more

or by the money-lenders at Rome.  With skilful management probably his fortune would have been sufficient to meet
the demands made upon it, but he was so much engrossed in politics, literature,
and the practice of his profession that he had little time or inclination for
business affairs. Then, too, during his exile and during his absence at the
outbreak of the civil war, his finances were wretchedly muddled by Terentia and
her untrustworthy steward Philotimus.<note anchored="yes" n="7">Fam.4.14.3;<bibl n="Cic. Att. 11.2.2">Att. 11.2.2</bibl>,etc.</note>

<p>47. In his financial dealings Cicero was honorable and high-minded.  He
declined to make money, as even his friends Atticus and M. Brutus did, by
loaning money at usurious rates.  His upright management of Cilicia was in
marked contrast to the almost universal practices of his contemporaries. He
paid his debts conscientiously, although not always with promptness, because of
his frequent financial embarrassment.  In some other points Cicero does not
show as strict a sense of honor: he did not scruple to open certain letters
from his brother Quintus to a third person, which fell into his hands, and
which, as he suspected, contained slanderous statements in regard to himself<note anchored="yes" n="1">
<bibl n="Cic. Att. 11.9.2">Att. 11.9.2</bibl>.	</note>;

It should be remembered in partial extenuation of these facts that the code of honor in such
matters was not so strict in Cicero's day as it is in our own, and that his lot
was cast in times when life and fortune hung by a slender thread.</p></div2>
<div2 id="intr.48" type="para">
<p>48. Cicero's enthusiastic study of Greek and Latin literature at Rome, and
later at Athens and Rhodes, has already been noted (&sect;&sect; 1, 2).  These habits of study continued throughout his life, and gave him
such a fund of general information as few of his contemporaries possessed.
Still he was not a man of profound learning, even in his chosen profession. He
was rather a man of cultivated tastes and broad sympathies.  Of his knowledge
of the literature, history, and antiquities of Greece and Rome, his letters,
<pb n="xlv"/>
especially those to Atticus, offer constant illustration.  He prided himself
upon the fluency with which he could use Greek in speaking and writing. He was
an insatiable book-buyer and a connoisseur in art (&sect; 45 n. 3).  The
circle of his friends included every one worth knowing at Rome, &mdash;politicians,
whether of the aristocratic or democratic factions, literary men, business men, and men of leisure.</p>
<p>No better proof could be desired of Cicero's sympathetic nature and
manysidedness than the fact that he drew to himself persons of all tastes,
beliefs, and ages.  He was a friend not only of the eminent jurist Servius
Sulpicius Rufus, and the learned antiquary Varro, but also of Caesar's witty
<foreign lang="fr">aide-de-camp</foreign> Trebatius, of the clever young politician Caelius, and
the accomplished Caerellia.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="intr.49" type="para">
<p>49. In his family relations Cicero was a true and courteous husband, a father
indulgent to his children, but wisely thoughtful for their interests.  In his
relations with his wife Terentia he stands in honorable contrast to many
prominent men of his time, and his divorce from her, which took place after a
married life of thirty years, was the almost inevitable result of the lack of
sympathy existing between two such opposite natures;  and a knowledge of the
great frequency of divorce in his day may properly modify the severity of our
judgment upon him in this matter.</p>
<p>His second wife Publilia, who was much younger than himself, he probably married for her money,<note anchored="yes" n="1">
<bibl n="Cic. Fam. 4.14.3">Fam. 4.14.3</bibl></note>

and the union proved utterly disagreeable to him.  All the
wealth of his affection was bestowed upon his daughter Tullia.  Her nature was
impressionable like his own, so that she understood her father and sympathized
with him in his periods of exaltation and depression, while the unhappiness
which followed her through life only served to bring out her father's tenderness.

No one could have been more unlike Cicero than his only son Marcus, and it
would be humorous, if it were not pathetic to see the orator hopefully
instructing the would-be soldier in the mysteries of philosophy and law.  But
when the boy had taken up the profession of arms under Brutus, and thus brought
to naught the father's hope that his son would succeed him at the bar and in
the senate, Cicero gracefully accepted the inevitable.  He followed his son's
movements with the liveliest interest, and heard with paternal pride the
reports of his prowess.<milestone unit="para"/>
To his brother Quintus, Cicero was always loyal and devoted.  Their friendly relations were broken but once,<note anchored="yes" n="1">
<bibl n="Cic. Att. 11.5.4">Att. 11.5.4</bibl>; 11.12.1.</note>

and then only for a brief period.  They were men of very different temperaments.  Marcus acted in general with deliberation;
sometimes, in fact, he hesitated too long. Quintus was nervous and impulsive.

One dwells, however, with most pleasure upon Cicero's treatment of his personal
dependents.  Not only his favorite freedman Tiro, but the very slaves of his
household enjoyed his kindness and generosity.</p></div2>
<div2 id="intr.50" type="para">
<p>50. This sympathetic sensitiveness in Cicero's nature gives to his character
its special charm, and constitutes at the same time its principal weakness.
Those moments of exaltation and of depression, those periods when he helplessly

find their explanation in this quality.  His humor is determined by the circumstances of the moment.  He
lacks, therefore, the calm poise of the less impressionable nature.  He fails
to give things their proper proportions, and consequently his forecasts of the
future are generally either too sanguine or too gloomy.  It was this quality,
of course, which made him an opportunist in politics.

<p>A man so constituted could find real pleasure only in Rome.  He was charmed for
a time with the new sensations which country life gave him, but it soon became
irksome. Of all his villas, the Tusculanum, perched upon one of the hills which
overlook Rome, and within easy reach of all the political and social news of
the city, was his favorite, and we are not surprised when he writes from
Cilicia:  <quote lang="la">urbem, urbem, mi Rufe, cole et in ista luce vive: omnis

and, hardest of all to bear, in <date value="-45">Feb., 45 B.C.</date>, his beloved daughter Tullia died.<note anchored="yes" n="4">Schmidt, <title>Briefw.</title> p.271.</note>

Cicero was overwhelmed with grief, and at his lonely villa upon a little island
in the river Astura, gave himself up to the perusal of such books as he thought
would help him to bear his loss 5; and as he gradually gained some control over
his feelings, he began the composition of works in a similar vein.  His purpose
gradually widened until it included the development of a complete philosophical
system, and for twelve months he wrote and published philosophical works with
incredible rapidity;  but the impulse to the work is to be found in the
domestic misfortunes which befell him in the autumn and winter of <dateRange from="-46" to="-45">46-45 B.C.</dateRange>,
and the personal element is noticeable in all of his philosophical work,
especially in the Tusculan Disputations.  We find also in studying his domestic
life the main factor which determined his philosophical attitude. He could not
accept the doctrines of either of the two
<pb n="xlviii"/>
most influential schools in his day, - the Epicurean and the Stoic, &mdash; because
his tender recollections of Tullia made him recoil from the materialism of the
one and the coldness of the other.  He became, therefore, an eclectic.

Terentia may be gained from the letters of Bk. 14, ad Fam. all of

expresses himself in most affectionate terms.  After this date, with the

matters, there are no letters to Terentia up to <date value="-49">49 B.C.</date>, although this
interval includes the period of his proconsulship, when he wrote so many
letters to his personal and political friends.  Even the letters of the year
49, when Cicero was in so much anxiety, are very infrequent.  The rest of the
letters of Bk. 14, belonging to the next two years, are brief and formal.  It
appears that an estrangement gradually grew up between them which culminated in
their divorce in the early part of <date value="-46">46 B.C.</date>  In December of the same year

<p>59. In Cicero's time letters were commonly written either upon wax tablets or
papyrus.  Reference is made in Cic. <bibl n="Cic. Catil. 3.5">Cat. 3.5</bibl> to a letter upon wax
tablets, and they were not infrequently used as late as <dateRange from="400" to="500">the fifth century A.D.</dateRange><note anchored="yes" n="3">Thompson, Greek and Latin Palaeography, p.22.</note>;
but the introduction into Italy of papyrus, which is mentioned as early as the time of Ennius,<note anchored="yes" n="4">Marquardt, Handbuch,  vol. VII. p.808, n. l.</note>

gradually restricted the use of wax tablets, so that, in so far as letters were concerned, they were in general used only in
writing to a correspondent near at hand, especially when one hoped for an
immediate answer upon the tablets sent.  Thus Cicero writes to Lepta:
<foreign lang="la">simul atque accepi a Seleuco tuo litteras, statim quaesivi e Balbo per
codicillos quid esset in lege.</foreign><note anchored="yes" n="5">

The stem of the plant was cut into thin strips, and these strips were laid parallel

these at right angles, and the two layers were glued together by the gum which

then hammered together into a single sheet, called a <foreign lang="la">plagula</foreign>, which was
exposed to the sun to dry.  The sheets were from 5 to 10 inches long, and

<div1 type="chapter"><head>Language and Style.</head>

<div2 id="intr.69" type="para">
<p>69. For a complete and scientific study of the language and style of Cicero's
correspondence an examination of the Latinity of the thirty-one writers from
whom letters are preserved would be necessary.  Some of these writers, e.g.
Caelius (Bk. 8, <foreign lang="la">ad Fam</foreign>.), have left us sufficient material upon which to
base a fair estimate of their individual characteristics;  but such a
discussion would be too extended for our purposes.  An examination, however, of
the letters reveals certain elements common to the correspondence as a whole
which differentiate epistolary Latin from the language used in more formal
writing.  Epistolary Latin is one of the forms of the <foreign lang="la">sermo cotidianus</foreign>,
the speech used in
<pb n="lxi"/>
the familiar intercourse of everyday life, as opposed to the more formal
diction adopted in literary compositions intended for a more general audience
or body of readers.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="intr.70" type="para">
<p>70. Formal and informal Latin, if they may be so designated, are in their
origin independent of one another.  At the moment when Latin literature began,
inasmuch as differences in culture did not exist, there was but one Latin
spoken by patrician and plebeian alike.  With the appearance of literature,
Latin developed along two different lines. The poets, especially Ennius, in
adapting Latin to literary purposes, adopted certain words and forms of
expression and rejected others.  On the other hand, the people, in their daily
life, were more conservative, retaining much of that which literature rejected,<note anchored="yes" n="1">Cf. note to <foreign lang="la">mi</foreign>, <ref target="ep.xciii.2n" targOrder="U">Epist. XCIII. 2</ref>.</note>

while at the same time they adopted many new forms of expression
which formal literature either did not employ at all or accepted at a later
date. In particular these literary pioneers, being steeped in Greek literature,
unconsciously sought to develop literary Latin in accordance with the genius of
the Greek language.  This latter influence acted only indirectly upon
colloquial speech.</p></div2>
<div2 id="intr.71" type="para">
<p>71. The cleft thus resulting continued to widen, until, in course of time,
certain distinct and interesting differences are noticeable between formal and
informal Latin.  Of course important differences are found only between the
extremes of these two forms of speech. Cicero himself intimates that we may
expect to find in his letters evidences of colloquialism, for he writes to his
friend Paetus (<bibl n="Cic. Fam. 9.21.1">Fam. 9.21.1</bibl>) <foreign lang="la">Quid tibi ego videor in epistulis? nonne plebeio sermone agere
tecum? . . . epistulas vero cotidianis verbis texere solemus</foreign>.<note anchored="yes" n="2">Cf. also note to <foreign lang="la">levia nostratia</foreign>, <ref target="ep.xxxvi.1n" targOrder="U">Epist. XXXVI. 1</ref>.</note>
</p></div2>
<div2 id="intr.72" type="para">
<p>72. A number of factors tend to vary the character of this
<foreign lang="la">sermo cotidianus</foreign> as it is used in letter writing.  Some
<pb n="lxii"/>
of these are the character of the person addressed and his relations to the
writer, the subject or subjects discussed, the occupation and culture of the
writer, the time and place in which the letter is written, and the other
circumstances attending the composition.
</p>
<p>With local differences in familiar speech and with those which time effects,
the student who confines his attention to Cicero's correspondence is not
concerned, as the letters fall within a period of twenty-five years, and were
written by men who spoke Latin as it was spoken in the city of Rome.  The other
factors are of interest.  One cannot fail to notice the freedom and informality
with which Cicero writes to his friend Atticus or his brother Quintus, as
compared with the tone which he adopts to those less intimately related to him.
It is in the letters addressed to these two persons that we find the greatest
divergence from formal standards.  The subject and purpose of a letter exert a
potent influence upon its character.  The 'open letter' to Lentulus (Fam.
1.9), for example, which was to serve as a political pamphlet, takes a tone
entirely different from that of the gossipy letters to Trebatius and Paetus.
Most of Cicero's correspondents were men of some culture, and there is
consequently a uniformity of style and a nearer approximation to formal Latin
than we should find in the letters of uncultivated men, but in Pompey and
Curius, for instance, we find little suggestion of literary training, but
rather the flavor of the camp and of mercantile life.  The circumstances under
which a letter is written influence perceptibly the character of its language
and style.  This is especially true of Cicero's own letters, because his nature
was peculiarly sensitive to the circumstances surrounding him at the moment; 
and the letters which he wrote while in exile (e.g. Att. Bk. 3.), offer,
in their laxity of style, striking illustrations of the way in which the
intensity
<pb n="lxiii"/>
of his feeling was reflected, not merely in the thought expressed, but in the
form in which it found expression. Cf., for instance, note to <foreign lang="la">ante oculos</foreign>,
<ref target="ep.xiii.3n" targOrder="U">Epist. XIII. 3</ref>, and note to <foreign lang="la">cuicuimodi</foreign>, <ref target="ep.xiv" targOrder="U">Epist. XIV.</ref>

<div2 id="intr.73" type="para">
<p>73. The student of Plautus, of Terence, of Horace in his Satires, and of
Petronius, will find, as might be expected, many points of contact between the
language of these writers and the language of the Letters, with such
differences in general as result from the influences just noted.  It is
interesting also to observe that many stylistic peculiarities which we
ordinarily recognize as the distinguishing characteristics of Silver Latin,
first come to the surface in Cicero's correspondence.  A full discussion of the
Latinity of the correspondence is impossible here, but a few epistolary
peculiarities of more or less frequency are noted in the following paragraphs.
Further remarks upon these points and upon similar ones will be found in the commentary.

<head>Lexicography and Orthography.</head>

<div3 id="intr.74" type="para"><head>74. New Formations</head>
<p>In general a fairly large number of words are found
in the Letters which do not occur elsewhere in Latin, but the majority of them
were probably not new. Still, such formations as <foreign lang="la">facteon</foreign>, <foreign lang="la">Sullaturit</foreign>,
<foreign lang="la">tocullio</foreign>, <foreign lang="la">Lentulitas</foreign>, <foreign lang="la">susurrator</foreign>, and <foreign lang="la">subrostrani</foreign>, which have a
genuine Plautine ring, must have resulted from the inspiration of the moment.
Cf. note to <foreign lang="la">facteon</foreign>, <ref target="ep.v.13n" targOrder="U">Epist. V. 13</ref>.</p></div3>
<div3 id="intr.75" type="para">
<head>75. Verbal Substantives</head>
<p>Of especial frequency are verbal substantives in <foreign lang="la">-tio</foreign>, etc., such as <foreign lang="la">denuntiatio</foreign> (Plancus, Fam.
10.8.4), and <foreign lang="la">praevaricator</foreign> (Caelius, <bibl n="Cic. Fam. 8.11.1">Fam. 8.11.1</bibl>).
These substantives condense an idea into a single word and thus secure the
brevity at which a letter-writer often aims.</p></div3>
<div3 id="intr.76" type="para">
<head>76. Diminutives.</head>
<p>Perhaps the most characteristic form in the Letters is the
diminutive.  The diminutive ending is
<pb n="lxiv"/>
added to substantives, to adjectives, to adverbs, and even to the comparative
form of the adjective and adverb, and suggests often some emotion on the part
of the writer. Cf. note to <foreign lang="la">pulchellus</foreign>, <ref target="ep.v.10n" targOrder="U">Epist. V. 10</ref>.</p></div3>
<div3 id="intr.77" type="para">
<head>77. Words compounded with <foreign lang="la">per-</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">sub-</foreign>. </head>
<p>Equally common is the use with adjectives, adverbs, and verbs of the prefixes <foreign lang="la">per-</foreign> and
<foreign lang="la">sub-</foreign>, which respectively strengthen and weaken the force of the words to
which they are attached; e.g. <foreign lang="la">perbenivolus</foreign> (<bibl n="Cic. Fam. 14.4">Fam. 14.4</bibl>. 6),
<foreign lang="la">subirascor</foreign>, 'I am a trifle provoked' (<bibl n="Cic. Att. 9.7.7">Att. 9.7.7</bibl>).  The use of
these prefixes is not by any means unknown in formal literature, but in
epistolary Latin it gives rise to many new and strange compounds, e.g.
<foreign lang="la">pervesperi</foreign> (<bibl n="Cic. Fam. 9.2.1">Fam. 9.2.1</bibl>), <foreign lang="la">subinanis</foreign> (<bibl n="Cic. Att. 2.17.2">Att. 2.17.2</bibl>), and
<foreign lang="la">subturpiculus</foreign> (<bibl n="Cic. Att. 4.5.1">Att. 4.5.1</bibl>).  It is in the freedom with which such
compounds were formed, and the frequency with which they were used, that
colloquial Latin was distinguished from formal Latin.  These compounds had gone
so far toward supplanting the simple words in familiar speech that in some
cases they differed in no wise from them, as is shown in the phrase
<foreign lang="la">quae parcius frater perscripserat</foreign> (Q. Cic., <bibl n="Cic. Fam. 16.27.1">Fam. 16.27.1</bibl>).  Cf. also
note to <foreign lang="la">pertumultuose</foreign>, <ref target="ep.xxxiv.3n" targOrder="U">Epist. XXXIV. 3</ref>.</p></div3>
<div3 id="intr.78" type="para">
<head>78. Verbs compounded with <foreign lang="la">ad-</foreign>, <foreign lang="la">con-</foreign>, etc.</head>
<p>In this connection mention may be made of verbs compounded with <foreign lang="la">ad-</foreign>, <foreign lang="la">con-</foreign>, <foreign lang="la">de-</foreign>,
and <foreign lang="la">dis-</foreign>, which are used in the Letters not only with great
frequency, but often when they do not apparently differ in meaning from the
simple verbs.  Compounds with <foreign lang="la">dis-</foreign> are especially noteworthy. Cf. note
to <foreign lang="la">discupio</foreign>, <ref target="ep.xlviii.2n" targOrder="U">Epist. XLVIII. 2</ref>.
</p></div3>
<div3 id="intr.79" type="para">
<head>79. Frequentatives.</head>
<p>Frequentatives are used with such freedom, and so
often in the double form (e.g. <foreign lang="la">ventito</foreign>, Matius, <bibl n="Cic. Fam. 11.28.7">Fam. 11.28.7</bibl>), or
with the addition of such words as <foreign lang="la">saepe</foreign> or <foreign lang="la">crebro</foreign>, as, for
instance, <foreign lang="la">ostentare crebro solebat</foreign> (Dolabella, <bibl n="Cic. Fam. 9.9">Fam. 9.9</bibl>. 2),
that one is at first inclined to think that the frequentative has lost its
characteristic force in such cases; but it is more probable that in the double
<pb n="lxv"/>
frequentative, and in the expressions just noted we have an illustration of the
colloquial fondness for unduly emphasizing a fact.</p></div3>
<div3 id="intr.80" type="para"><head>80. Hybrids.</head>
<p>A few hybrids are found in the Letters, but apparently
only in the more familiar letters to Atticus, e.g. <title>Pseudocato</title>, <bibl n="Cic. Att. 1.14.6">Att. 1.14.6</bibl>; <foreign lang="la">tocullio</foreign>, <bibl n="Cic. Att. 2.1">Att. 2.1</bibl>. 12; <foreign lang="la">facteon</foreign>, <bibl n="Cic. Att. 1.16.13">Att. 1.16.13</bibl>.
</p></div3>
<div3 id="intr.81" type="para"><head>81. Archaism.</head>
<p>As was remarked above, colloquial Latin was conservative in
retaining certain forms and expressions which became obsolete in formal Latin.
Instances in point are <foreign lang="la">dicier</foreign>, an obsolete infinitive form (Vatin.,
<bibl n="Cic. Fam. 5.9.1">Fam. 5.9.1</bibl>), <foreign lang="la">isto</foreign> = <foreign lang="la">istuc</foreign> (Cael., <bibl n="Cic. Fam. 8.15.2">Fam. 8.15.2</bibl> <foreign lang="la">et passim</foreign>),
<foreign lang="la">illi</foreign> = <foreign lang="la">illic</foreign> (Cael., <bibl n="Cic. Fam. 8.15.2">Fam. 8.15.2</bibl>), <foreign lang="la">qui</foreign> (abl.)
(<bibl n="Cic. Fam. 2.16.2">Fam. 2.16.2</bibl>), <foreign lang="la">ast</foreign> = <foreign lang="la">at</foreign> (<bibl n="Cic. Att. 1.16.17">Att. 1.16.17</bibl>; 3.15.6), and
<foreign lang="la">absque</foreign> = <foreign lang="la">sine</foreign> (<bibl n="Cic. Att. 1.19.1">Att. 1.19.1</bibl>). These forms, as might be expected, are more
frequent in the letters of the less cultivated or more colloquial of Cicero's
correspondents.  They are very rarely found in Cicero's own letters.  Cf. note
to <foreign lang="la">isto</foreign>, <ref target="ep.xlviii.2n" targOrder="U">Epist. XLVIII. 2</ref>,
and especially to <foreign lang="la">mi</foreign>, <ref target="ep.xciii.2n" targOrder="U">Epist. XCIII. 2</ref>.
</p></div3>
<div3 id="intr.82" type="para"><head>82. Contracted Forms.</head>
<p>Of most interest in this connection is the
occurrence in the tenses of the perfect system of syncopated forms, which are
used far more freely in epistolary than in formal Latin.  In fact, the
comparative frequency of such forms in a letter seems to depend upon its
informality. In the seventeen letters from Caelius (Bk. 8, <title>ad Fam.</title>),
which are very familiar in their tone, syncopation takes place in the
perfect tenses fifty-five times, while full forms occur but four times.
Typical examples from the Letters are <foreign lang="la">consuesti</foreign> (Caecina, <bibl n="Cic. Fam. 6.7.6">Fam. 6.7.6</bibl>),
<foreign lang="la">pugnarunt</foreign> (Cael.,<bibl n="Cic. Fam. 8.11.2">Fam. 8.11.2</bibl>), <foreign lang="la">peccasse</foreign> (Q. Cic., Fam. 16.26.1), and <foreign lang="la">decreram</foreign> (Plancus, <bibl n="Cic. Fam. 10.21.2">Fam. 10.21.2</bibl>).  About half
of the 140 syncopated verb forms which occur in the letters addressed to Cicero
belong to the first conjugation.  Cf. also notes to <foreign lang="la">decesse</foreign>, <ref target="ep.xix.2n" targOrder="U">Epist. XIX. 2</ref>,

consists in the use of the adverb with <foreign lang="la">esse</foreign>.  This usage is frequent in
colloquial Latin of all periods.  It is commonly found with adverbs of place
(<foreign lang="la">prope</foreign>, <foreign lang="la">praesto</foreign>, <foreign lang="la">procul</foreign>, etc.), and the general and particular adverbs
of manner (<foreign lang="la">ita</foreign>, <foreign lang="la">contra</foreign>, <foreign lang="la">aliter</foreign>, <foreign lang="la">bene</foreign>, <foreign lang="la">recte</foreign>, <foreign lang="la">tuto</foreign>, etc.);  e.g.,

something more than a simple copula.</p></div5>

<p>Formal literary compositions which are

intercourse between friends, whether carried on by conversation or

which passed between Cicero and his intimate friends, both in the use of single
words and complete statements, e.g. <foreign lang="la">immortalis</foreign> = <foreign lang="la">magnas</foreign> (Plancus, Fam.

Greek words and phrases generally appear in the Correspondence as technical terms in
philosophy, rhetoric, politics, medicine, and as slang phrases.  Doubtless,
also, as Cicero himself intimates, Greek was occasionally used as a possible
protection if a letter should fall into the hands of an enemy. The Greek
technical terms played the same part with reference to Latin that many of the
corresponding technical terms borrowed from Latin play in modern composition,
while the Greek popular expressions in the Letters may be compared with current
French phrases.  Cf. also note to <foreign lang="greek">parrhsi/an</foreign>, <ref target="ep.v" targOrder="U">Epist. V.</ref>8.

indicating activity, the latter inertia : e.g.
<foreign lang="la">illi rumores de comitiis Transpadanorum Cumarum tenus caluerunt</foreign> (Cael., <bibl n="Cic. Fam. 8.1.2">Fam. 8.1.2</bibl>);
<foreign lang="la">cum Romae a iudiciis forum refrixerit</foreign> (Att.
I. I. 2); <foreign lang="la">scripsi Curionem valde frigere, iam calet</foreign> (Cael.,
<bibl n="Cic. Fam. 8.6.5">Fam. 8.6.5</bibl>).  Commercial, legal, and popular expressions, in a
figurative sense, also occur in great variety.  Cf. also notes to
<foreign lang="la">quas ego pugnas et quantas strages edidi</foreign>, <ref target="ep.v" targOrder="U">Epist. V.</ref> i , and <foreign lang="la">medicinam</foreign>, Epist.
IX. 2.
</p></div3>
<div3 id="intr.100" type="para"><head>100. Polite Phrases.</head>
<p>Such polite phrases as <foreign lang="la">si me amas</foreign> (e.g.
Vatin., Fam., 5.9.1), <foreign lang="la">amabo te</foreign> (e.g. Cael., <bibl n="Cic. Fam. 8.6.5">Fam. 8.6.5</bibl>),
and such terms of endearment as <foreign lang="la">mel ac deliciae tuae</foreign> (Cael., Fam.
8.8.1), are naturally of frequent occurrence.  Apparently the Plautine
<foreign lang="la">sis</foreign> (<foreign lang="la">si vis</foreign>) and <foreign lang="la">sodes</foreign> are not used.  Cf. also notes to <foreign lang="la">nostri amores</foreign>,
<ref target="ep.vii" targOrder="U">Epist. VII.</ref> 2, <foreign lang="la">si me amas</foreign>, <ref target="ep.xiii" targOrder="U">Epist. XIII.</ref> 3, and <foreign lang="la">molestum</foreign>,
<ref target="ep.xviii" targOrder="U">Epist. XVIII.</ref>10.
</p></div3>
<div3 id="intr.101" type="para"><head>101. Pleonasm.</head>
<p>While aiming at brevity in some cases, in others
familiar speech indulges itself in duplicative or pleonastic expressions for
the sake of emphasis or distinctness, in much the same way as it employs
extravagant language.  Instances from the Letters are <foreign lang="la">rursus reducere</foreign>
(Balbus, <bibl n="Cic. Att. 8.15">Att. 8.15</bibl>a.1); <foreign lang="la">malle potius</foreign> (Cato, Fam.
15.5.2); <foreign lang="la">nostro iudicio . . . existimanius</foreign> (Balbus and Oppius,
<bibl n="Cic. Att. 9.7">Att. 9.7</bibl>a. 1), <foreign lang="la">ostentare crebro</foreign> (Dolabella, <bibl n="Cic. Fam. 9.9">Fam. 9.9</bibl>.

</p></div3>
<div3 id="intr.102" type="para"><head>102. Popular and Proverbial Expressions.</head>
<p>The informal character of the
Letters is shown, not so much by the frequent use of these expressions,
although their number in the aggregate is large, as by the fact that they are
unaccompanied by any such apologetic phrase as <foreign lang="la">ut aiunt</foreign>,

<pb n="lxxv"/>
by which Cicero commonly introduces proverbial expressions and popular sayings
in formal composition.  Instances of popular expressions are
<foreign lang="la">duo parietes de eadem fidelia dealbare</foreign> (Curius, <bibl n="Cic. Fam. 7.29.2">Fam. 7.29.2</bibl>);
<foreign lang="la">sus Minervam [docet]</foreign> (<bibl n="Cic. Fam. 9.18.3">Fam. 9.18.3</bibl>);
<foreign lang="la">pictus et politus</foreign> (<bibl n="Cic. Att. 2.21.4">Att. 2.21.4</bibl>);
<foreign lang="la">sciens prudensque</foreign> (Cael., <bibl n="Cic. Fam. 8.16.5">Fam. 8.16.5</bibl>).</p></div3>
<div3 id="intr.103" type="para">
<head>103. Play upon Words, etc.</head><p>In the same connection mention may be made
of the fondness which Cicero and some of his correspondents show for playing
upon words in their familiar letters.  Illustrations are
<foreign lang="la">tu istic te Hateriano iure</foreign> [jurisprudence]
<foreign lang="la">delectas, ego me hic Hirtiano</foreign> [<foreign lang="la">iure</foreign>,
'sauce'] (<bibl n="Cic. Fam. 9.18.3">Fam. 9.18.3</bibl>);
<foreign lang="la">tu, qui ceteris cavere didicisti, in Britannia ne ab essedariis decipiaris caveto</foreign>, <gloss>you who have learned how to
draw up securities for others, look out for your own security&mdash;
and don't be taken in by the <foreign lang="la">essedarii</foreign></gloss>, (<bibl n="Cic. Fam. 7.6.2">Fam. 7.6.2</bibl>). Cicero's letters
to his legal friend Trebatius (Fam. Bk. 7) are full of legal puns. Other
good instances of similar witticisms are to be found in<bibl n="Cic. Att. 1.16.10">Att. 1.16.10</bibl>
and in the letters to Paetus (Fam. Bk. 9).  Cf. also notes to
<foreign lang="la">honoris causa</foreign>, <ref target="ep.xix" targOrder="U">Epist. XIX.</ref> 2, and <foreign lang="la">occidione occisum</foreign>, XXXIV. 7.  Cicero had a
great reputation for wit of this sort (cf. <bibl n="Cic. Fam. 9.16.4">Fam. 9.16.4</bibl>), and after his
death his secretary Tiro edited his witty sayings.  Cf. <bibl n="Quint. 6.3.5">Quint. 6.3.5</bibl>;  Macrob.
Sat. 2.1.12.</p></div3>
<div3 id="intr.104" type="para">
<p>104. In conclusion it may be noted that in his discussion of public and private
affairs of a delicate character, Cicero often considered it discreet to express
himself in language which would be unintelligible to every one save the person
for wbom the letter in question was intended.  As he himself puts it in one
case : <foreign lang="la">sed haec scripsi properans et mehercule timide;  posthac ad te aut,
si perfidelem habebo cui dem, scribam plane omnia aut, si obscure
scribam, tu tamen intelleges;  in iis epistulis me Laelium, te Furium faciam; 
cetera erunt</foreign> <foreign lang="greek">e)n ai)nigmoi=s</foreign> (<bibl n="Cic. Att. 2.19.5">Att. 2.19.5</bibl>).  As a result of this policy there are some puzzling passages in the Letters which still frustrate
<pb n="lxxvi"/>
the efforts of commentators to explain them.  The difficulty of such
passages is often increased by the ill-founded conjectures of early editors, or
by the mistakes of copyists who were puzzled by obscure phrases or by
unfamiliar Greek words.  To these difficulties must be added the fact that in
general only one side of the correspondence is preserved to us, and that brief
reference is often made to persons and events about whose character our
information can only be conjectural.  In view of these facts, the success which
has attended the interpretation of the Letters is remarkable.</p></div3></div2></div1>

The letter is interesting for the light which it throws in general upon methods  of electioneering at Rome, and in particular upon Cicero's political plans and prospects a year before the elections at which he intended to be a candidate for the consulship. On the elections, cf. also Herzog, 1. pp. 654-661.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Cicero Attico sal.</lemma>: cf. <ref target="intr.62" targOrder="U">Intr. 62</ref>. This form of greeting, which precedes all the extant letters to Atticus, is probably not authentic.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">unus</lemma>: Antonius and Cornificius have not yet begun an active canvass, although their intentions are known. On P. Sulpicius Galba, cf. <bibl n="Cic. Ver. 1.1.30">Verr. 1.30</bibl>.</p>

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">a.d. xvi Kalend.

Cicero speaks of Caesonius in a very different way <bibl n="Cic. Ver. 1.1.29">in Verr. 1.29</bibl> <foreign lang="la">homo in rebus iudicandis spectatus et cognitus</foreign>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Aquilium</lemma>: sc. <foreign lang="la">competitorem fore</foreign>. C. Aquilius Gallus was praetor with Cicero in <date value="-66">66 B.C.</date></p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">iuravit morbum</lemma>: the simple acc. after <foreign lang="la">iurare</foreign> is rare.  The phrase is probably a legal one; cf. <bibl n="Cic. Fam. 8.8.3">Fam. 8.8.3</bibl> <foreign lang="la">cum calumniam iurasset</foreign>. <quote lang="la">Iurare morbum</quote> means <gloss>to take an oath that one is ill</gloss> as an excuse for the non-performance of some duty.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">regnum iudiciale</lemma>: Aquilius was a well-known jurist (<bibl n="Cic. Caec. 77"><title>pro Caec.</title> 77</bibl>), too much occupied with legal business to engage in politics. Cf. <foreign lang="la">regno forensi</foreign>, Ep. LXII.1.</p>

 Cicero's actual opponents at the polls were Galba and Catiline, patricians; C. Antonius, Q. Cornificius, L. Cassius Longinus, and C. Licinius Sacerdos, plebeians (cf. Ascon. <foreign lang="la">argum</foreign>. to <title>Or. in toga cand.</title>).
</p></div2>
<div2 id="ep.i.2n" type="section" n="2">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">qui nunc petunt</lemma>, <gloss>who are candidates this year</gloss>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Caesar</lemma>: L. Julius Caesar, uncle of Antony the triumvir, and, by the second marriage of his sister Julia, brother-in-law of Lentulus, the Catilinarian conspirator.  He tried unsuccessfully to mediate in <date value="-43">43 B.C.</date>
 between the senate and Antony (<bibl n="Cic. Phil. 8.1.">Phil. 8.1</bibl>).  He was placed by Antony upon the list of the proscribed in return for the consent of Octavius to the murder of Cicero, and escaped death only through the devotion of his sister Julia.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">certus</lemma>: here' sure to win.' This expectation was realized.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Thermus cum Silano</lemma>: the consuls for <date value="-64">64 B.C.</date>
 (cf. <bibl n="Cic. Att. 1.2">Ep. II.</bibl>) were L. Julius Caesar and C. Marcius Figulus, so that either another candidate than the three mentioned here came to the front and was elected, or else Thermus became Figulus by adoption and held the office under that name.  It was D. Junius Silanus who, as <foreign lang="la">consul designatus</foreign>,  and therefore  first speaker in the senate, proposed that Lentulus and his fellow-conspirators should be put to death (<bibl n="Cic. Catil. 4.7">Cat. 4.7</bibl>).</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Thermus <gap/> existimatur</lemma>: i.e. it is expected that there will be a hard fight between Thermus and Silanus.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">ab amicis </lemma>: <foreign lang="la">ab</foreign> is not infrequently used to introduce a limitation with adjectives which signify power, equipment, or their opposites, e.g. <foreign lang="la">ab equitatu firmus</foreign>, Ep. XCVIII. 2; <foreign lang="la">ab omni re sumus paratiores</foreign>, <bibl n="Cic. Fam. 10.8.6">Fam. 10.8.6</bibl>, and elsewhere.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Curium obducere</lemma>: i.e. <gloss>to run Curius in opposition</gloss>.  Curius, evidently a man held in light esteem, may have been the Quintus Curius who informed Cicero of Catiline's plans.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Thermum fieri</lemma>: sc. <foreign lang="la">consulem</foreign>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">si in nostrum annum reciderit</lemma>, <gloss>if he goes over to my year</gloss>, i.e. to the election for <date value="-63">63 B.C.</date></p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">viae Flaminiae</lemma>:  the great northern thoroughfare from Rome to the Adriatic. The completion (<foreign lang="la">absoluta</foreign>) of this road would, as Cicero thinks, give Thermus political prestige and influence, and therefore make him a dangerous opponent a year later, although at the time of writing he has few followers (<foreign lang="la">inopes ab amicis</foreign>). "The great Roman roads, such as the <foreign lang="la">via Appia, Flaminia</foreign>, etc., were called <foreign lang="la">viae praetoriae</foreign> or <foreign lang="la">consulares</foreign>, and were under the charge of <foreign lang="la">curatores</foreign>." Tyrrell from Momm. <title>St. R.</title> II 3. p.454.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">accuderim </lemma>: the conjecture of Boot (see Crit. App.); a Plautine word.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">informata cogitatio</lemma>, <gloss>general impression</gloss>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Gallia </lemma> (<foreign lang="la">Cispadana</foreign>): it possessed the right of suffrage; cf. <bibl n="Cic. Phil. 2.76">Phil. 2.76</bibl> <foreign lang="la">municipia coloniasque Galliae a qua nos <gap/> petere consulatum solebamus</foreign>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">cum <gap/> refrixerit</lemma>, <gloss>when the heat of business in the courts at Rome shall have cooled down</gloss>. On <foreign lang="la">refrixerit</foreign>, cf. <ref target="intr.99" targOrder="U">Intr. 99</ref>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">mense Septembri</lemma>: the <foreign lang="la">ludi Magni</foreign> or <foreign lang="la">Romani</foreign> began Sept. 4 and lasted 15 days, and later in the year came the <foreign lang="la">ludi Plebeii</foreign>, the <foreign lang="la">Saturnalia</foreign>, etc., so that little legal business could be done between Sept. 1 and Jan. 1.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">legati</lemma>: the reference is to a <foreign lang="la">legatio libera</foreign>, an unofficial embassy. Senators favored with such a privilege could travel for their own pleasure or profit with the title and the rights of a <foreign lang="la">legatus</foreign>, and receive supplies from government agents without performing any official duties.  The provinces found this senatorial junketing such a burden that Cicero in his consulship placed certain limitations upon it.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Pisonem</lemma>: proconsul in Gallia Narbonensis.  He was afterwards defended by Cicero against a charge of maladministration (<foreign lang="la">repetundae</foreign>) while governor of this province.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">voluntates nobilium</lemma>: the aristocracy were probably at this moment little inclined to support Cicero's candidacy, and voted for him the next year only because he was the candidate most likely to defeat Catiline and the democrats.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">his <gap/> competitoribus</lemma>, <gloss>provided that civilians are my only rivals</gloss>; for if some one returns from a successful military campaign to stand for the consulship, the result will be more uncertain.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">manum</lemma>: the support of Pompey.  By the provisions of the Manilian law, Pompey had the year before been given charge of the war against Mithridates. Cicero's advocacy of that bill would naturally secure for him Pompey's support in the consular election. Atticus, who was at this time in Athens, and therefore nearer than Cicero to Pompey, was asked to make sure of Pompey's assistance; or, perhaps, as Tyrrell thinks, <quote lang="la">manum</quote> refers to the followers of Pompey, some of whom might return to Rome in time for the election.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="ep.i.3n" type="section" n="3">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">pervelim</lemma>: cf. <ref target="intr.77" targOrder="U">Intr. 77</ref>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Caecilius</lemma>: for the relations existing between Caecilius and Atticus and the desire of Atticus to continue on good terms with his uncle, cf. Nepos, Att. 5 <foreign lang="la">habebat avunculum Q. Caecilium, equitem Romanum, familiarem L. Luculli, divitem, difficillima natura. Cuius sic asperitatem veritus est, ut, quem nemo ferre posset, huius sine offensione ad summam senectutem retinuerit benevolentiam. Quo facto tulit pietatis fructum. Caecilius enim moriens testamento adoptavit eum heredemque fecit ex dodrante; ex qua hereditate accepit circiter centiens sestertium</foreign>. Cf. also <ref target="intr.58" targOrder="U">Intr. 58</ref>. Cicero's dilemma is therefore a serious one.  If he accedes to the request of Caecilius, and appears against Satyrus, he will antagonize Satyrus and the latter's friend Domitius, who are at present very friendly to him and would be of great service to him politically. If he declines to accommodate Caecilius, he will offend the crabbed old gentleman and Atticus in some degree, and perhaps jeopardize the chances of Atticus for his uncle's property. Caecilius died five years later (<bibl n="Cic. Att. 3.20.3">Att. 3.20.3</bibl>).</p>

Off. 3.60">de Off. 3.60</bibl>).  In this case Varius would seem to have transferred his property to Satyrus, to save it from seizure by the creditors.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">mancipio accepisse</lemma>, <gloss>to have purchased</gloss>. mancipio (<foreign lang="la">manus + capio</foreign>) refers to the practice on the part of the purchaser of laying his hand upon the article purchased in the presence of five witnesses, as the binding act in his acquisition of the article.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">diceret</lemma>: 'by a carelessness of expression, the verb of saying or thinking is sometimes put in the subjunctive instead of the thing said' (Tyrrell).</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">L. Lucullus</lemma>: Pompey's predecessor in command of the army acting against Mithridates.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">P. Scipio</lemma>: best known as commander of the Pofilpeian forces at the battle of Thapsus in <date value="-46">46 B.C.</date>  Cf. <title>Bell. Afr.</title> 79-86.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">magistrum </lemma> (sc. <foreign lang="la">auctionis</foreign>): the bids at auctions were received and called out by the <foreign lang="la">praeco</foreign>, but the general management of such a sale was in the hands of a <foreign lang="la">magister auctionis</foreign>, who kept a record of the articles sold and in general was the legal representative of the owner.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">L. Pontius </lemma> (<foreign lang="la">Aquila</foreign>): in later years an active opponent of Caesar and one of the conspirators against him. He was killed near Mutina, in the battle against Antony, in which Hirtius fell (<bibl>Fam. 30.33.4</bibl>).</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">adessem</lemma>: in the legal sense of appearing as an <foreign lang="la">advocatus</foreign>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">L. Domitium </lemma> (<foreign lang="la">Ahenobarbum) </foreign>: best known as the commandant of the fortress of Corfinium in <date value="-49">49 B.C.</date>  The loss of this town through the irresolution and cowardice of Domitius removed the main obstacle in the way of Caesar's march to Rome. The intense interest felt by the Pompeians at that time in his fate is plainly indicated by <bibl n="Cic. Att. 8.12">Att. 8.12</bibl>c; <bibl n="Cic. Att. 8.7">8.7</bibl>; <bibl n="Cic.

<p>Rome, the latter part of <date value="-65">65 B.C.</date>
 The historical value of this letter springs from the fact that it fixes the date of the birth of Cicero's son (<date value="-65">65 B.C.</date>), that it contains the main point in the evidence with reference to Cicero's defense of Catiline against the charge of misappropriation of public money, and accounts for the absence of letters between Cicero and Atticus from <dateRange from="-64" to="-62">64-62 B.C.</dateRange> inclusive (cf. last sentence).</p>

The brevity and apparent lack of feeling in Cicero's announcement to his most intimate friend of the birth of his son has called forth severe criticisms from his enemies, and apologies from his friends (cf. Abeken, pp.33, 34) &mdash; quite without reason. Both parties have failed to see the gay humor of the passage which couples this important event in his family life with the most important event in the political world.  For an account of the new consuls, cf. Ep. l.</p>

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">hoc tempore <gap/> cogitamus</lemma>: it will never be certainly known whether Cicero did defend Catiline in <date value="-65">65 B.C.</date> or not, but this passage certainly indicates such an intention on his part, and there is no satisfactory reason for believing that he did not carry out his purpose.  The fact that Cicero believed in Catiline's guilt (cf. Ep. l. 3) would not, perhaps, have deterred him, as he in later years undertook the defense of Vatinius, Gabinius, and C. Antonius, equally notorious men, under still more questionable circumstances, when political considerations, as in this case, made it seem advisable. For the arguments in support of the opposite view, cf. Tyrrell, I. pp. 8-9.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">summa accusatoris voluntate</lemma>: the charge was brought by P. Clodius.  The accuser had the right of challenging peremptorily a certain number of jurors, and the phrase quoted above would indicate that Clodius had availed himself of this privilege in rejecting jurors who were likely to vote for a conviction. If this view be correct, Clodius was really acting in the interest of Catiline in bringing the charge, since if Catiline were acquitted, he could not be put on trial again. This method of protecting criminals, called <foreign lang="la">praevaricatio</foreign>, became commoner in later years (cf. Plin. Epist. 3.9.  33-35).  The method to be employed in securing an acquittal for Catiline casts more of a shadow upon Cicero's honor than the fact that he intended to undertake or did undertake the defense.</p></div2>

Besides the feeling of distrust which certain members of the aristocracy cherished toward this <foreign lang="la">novus homo</foreign>, many of them were offended by his previous democratic tendencies as shown, for instance, in the prosecution of Verres, and by his willingness to rob the oligarchy of its power for the benefit of Pompey in the case of the Manilian law.

  In <date value="-63">Dec., 63 B.C.</date> Cicero had sent to Pompey, who was in the East, a somewhat lengthy letter (now lost), in which he had given a resume of the achievements of his consulship. This letter, written probably in that egotistical vein which characterizes many of Cicero's utterances in regard to his consulship, apparently offended Pompey, who replied in a brief, unsympathetic letter.  At the same time, Pompey sent a letter to the senate containing no word of commendation for Cicero.  The letter before us was written upon the receipt of these two epistles.

  This letter tells the story of the trial of Clodius for sacrilege.  Cf. also <ref target="intr.10" targOrder="U">Intr. 10</ref> and Att. l. 13.3. Knowing the conclusive evidence against Clodius, the indignation of the <foreign lang="la">pontifices</foreign>, and the determined stand taken by the senate in ordering an inquiry, Atticus is surprised to hear of his acquittal, and has asked for an explanation. Cicero in this letter replies to that inquiry, and explains the condition of things in the commonwealth and his own attitude towards Clodius.  For further details of the sacrilege of Clodius, cf. <bibl n="Cic. Att. 1.12.3">Att. 1.12.3</bibl>; 1.14.5.  On Caesar's attitude during the trial, cf. Suet. <title>Iul.</title> 74 <foreign lang="la">testis citatus, negavit se quicquam comperisse, quamvis et mater Aurelia et soror Julia apud eosdem iudices omnia ex fide rettulissent</foreign>.

The conduct of criminal trials in a Roman court was entrusted to the <foreign lang="la">praetor</foreign>, his <foreign lang="la">consilium</foreign>, and the <foreign lang="la">iudices</foreign>.  The <foreign lang="la">praetor</foreign> passed upon questions of law, in the decision of which he was assisted by the <foreign lang="la">consilium</foreign>, a body of jurists called in to give legal advice, while questions of fact were relegated to the <foreign lang="la">iudices</foreign>. A list of several hundred <foreign lang="la">iudices</foreign>, chosen under the <foreign lang="la">lex Aurelia</foreign> of <date value="-70">70 B.C.</date>
 from the ranks of the senators, knights, and <foreign lang="la">tribuni aerarii</foreign> (fiscal officials of the tribes; cf. Momm. <title>St. R.</title> III.189-196), was published at the beginning of each year.   From this list the <foreign lang="la">iudices</foreign> for a particular trial were selected by lot.  A verdict rendered by a majority of them was valid.</p>
<div2 id="ep.v.1n" type="section" n="1">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">quaeris</lemma>: Atticus in his letter had asked Cicero two questions: (1) why the trial of Clodius resulted so unexpectedly in an acquittal; (2) why Cicero proved so poor a fighter.  Cicero replies to the second question first, the answer extending to the sentence, <foreign lang="la">itaque, si causam</foreign>, etc., 2, and then to the first one.  He applies to this inverted order the phrase <foreign lang="greek">u(/steron pro/teron, *(omhrikw=s</foreign>, because, in the first book of the Odyssey, Odysseus is introduced in the midst of his wanderings, his previous adventures being narrated in subsequent books.</p>

The word <quote lang="la">comperi</quote> Cicero had unfortunately used so often with reference to the movements of the Catilinarian conspirators (cf. <bibl n="Cic. Catil. 1.10">in Cat. 1.10</bibl> and 3.4) that it had evidently become a byword with his enemies, and was used by Clodius in taunting him; cf. also <bibl n="Cic. Fam. 5.5.2">Fam. 5.5.2</bibl>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">quas ego</lemma>, etc.: cf. also <foreign lang="la">proeliatus sum</foreign> above.

The <foreign lang="la">rogatio</foreign> was in this case to be submitted by a consul (<foreign lang="la">rogatio consularis</foreign>) in accordance with the resolution of the senate quoted above.  Cf. note to <foreign lang="la">senatus auctaritas</foreign>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">iudicum genus</lemma>: by the action of the senate, which was submitted to the people for confirmation, a special tribunal would have been established for the trial of Clodius, in which the presiding <foreign lang="la">praetor</foreign> would have chosen the <foreign lang="la">iudices</foreign>. Through the treachery of Piso and the use of force by Clodius this bill was not passed in the <foreign lang="la">comitia</foreign> (<bibl n="Cic. Att. 1.14.5">Att. 1.14.5</bibl>). About the middle of February, Fufius, acting in the interests of Clodius, and carrying out a compromise accepted by Hortensius, allowed the passage by the <foreign lang="la">comitia</foreign> of a bill which provided for a court of inquiry, but left the <foreign lang="la">iudices</foreign> to be chosen as usual by lot, since the friends of Clodius thought that in this way a venal jury could be secured more easily, as the defense would have the right under this arrangement to reject a certain number of jurors.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">nullis iudicibus</lemma>: the negation belongs logically with posse.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">contraxi vela</lemma>: Cicero is fond of figures drawn from ships or shipwreck; cf., for instance, <bibl>Fam. 12.25.5</bibl> <foreign lang="la">quam ob rem, mi Quinte, conscende nobiscum, et quidem ad puppim; una navis est iam bonorunt omnium, quam quidem nos damus operant ut rectam teneamus; utinam prospero cursu! sed, quicumque venti erunt, ars nostra certe non aberit</foreign>.  Cf. also the reference to the <foreign lang="la">shipwrecked</foreign> fortunes of Catiline's followers, and the comparison of the conspirators to <gloss>bilge-water in the ship of state</gloss> (<bibl n="Cic. Catil. 2.7">in Cat. 2.7</bibl>).</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">inopiam</lemma>: their poverty and probable venality.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">neque dixi <gap/> testatum</lemma>: Clodius tried to establish an Blibi by proving that on the night in question he was at Interamna, 90 miles from Rome, while Cicero testified that Clodius had visited his house that very day, within three hours of the time in question (cf. Att. 2. l. 5; Plut. Cic. 29).</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">pro\s to\ pro/teron</lemma>: to return to the first question, i.e. <foreign lang="la">quid accident de iudicio</foreign>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">infamia</lemma>, <gloss>disgrace</gloss>, not technically, 'loss of citizenship.'</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">sordibus</lemma>: the mourning worn by persons accused (Watson).</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">iugulatum in</lemma>: scarcely a literary word, but borrowed from colloquial Latin. Thus, cf. <cit><bibl n="Pl. St. 4.2">Plaut.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">reiectio</lemma>: the prosecution and the defense had, as with us, the privilege of 'peremptorily challenging' a certain number of <foreign lang="la">iudices</foreign>, whose places were then filled by new men. Cf. <foreign lang="la">voluntati</foreign>, Ep. 11.1 n.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">accusator</lemma>: L. Lentulus Crus.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">lanista</lemma>: an owner and trainer of bands of gladiators. As the kind-hearted <foreign lang="la">lanista</foreign> avoids sending his best gladiators into encounters where they will be sure to lose their lives, so the defendant avoids sending honest men into a jury-box where they will lose their reputation. For another explanation, see Tyrrell. The Correlation of <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">ut facta est</lemma> and <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">ut primum <gap/> consederunt</lemma> would not be found in careful prose.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">in ludo talario</lemma>: the <foreign lang="la">vestis talaris</foreign> reached to the ankles, and was not worn by respectable people (cf. <bibl n="Gel. 6">Gel. 6</bibl>. [7.] 12), and a <foreign lang="la">ludus talarius</foreign> was probably an entertainment of a low class where the performers wore this garment; cf. Fronto, Ep. p. 160 Naber <foreign lang="la">laudo censoris illud, qui ludos talarios (effugeret), quod semet ipsum diceret, cum en praeterisset, difficile dignitati servire, quin ad modum crotali aut cymbali pedem poneret</foreign>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U"> maculosi</lemma>: perhaps in its general sense, perhaps with special reference to men after whose names the censors had placed a <foreign lang="la">nota</foreign>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">nudi</lemma>, <gloss>destitute</gloss>; cf. <foreign lang="la">inopiam</foreign>, 2 n.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">tribuni <gap/> aerati</lemma>: this is difficult to understand. The common reading is, <foreign lang="la">non tam aerati <gap/> aerarii</foreign>. The term <foreign lang="la">aerarii</foreign> was sometimes applied to citizens of the lowest class, outside the limits of the centuries of the Servian constitution, the 'riff-raff' of the population; and the phrase is understood as meaning, 'not so much tribunes with money (<foreign lang="la">aerati</foreign>) as tribunes without money or reputation (<foreign lang="la">aerarii</foreign>).' The objections to this explanation are that the point is obscure, and that in a list of the three classes of people composing the jury, where the technical designations have been used in two instances, we expect to find the third term used, and used in the technical sense, i.e. we expect <foreign lang="la">senatores <gap/> equites, tribuni non tam aerarii</foreign>. The transposition by a copyist of <foreign lang="la">aerarii</foreign> (or <foreign lang="la">aerari</foreign>, as the MS. really reads) and <foreign lang="la">aerati</foreign> would not be unnatural. If we may adopt the reading <foreign lang="la">non tam aerarii <gap/> aerati</foreign>, the expression would mean 'not so much tribunes who <emph>have</emph> money (for the tribuni aerarii had money in their charge) as tribunes who are to be <emph>had</emph> for money (<foreign lang="la">aerati</foreign>).' This reading brings into relief the essential point, viz. the <emph>venality</emph> of the judges. This conjecture was first put forward by Muretus. Cicero is quoting one of those witticisms current in Rome which are so frequent in his letters; 'not so much <foreign lang="la">tribuni aerarii</foreign> as, to quote the current witticism, <foreign lang="la">tribuni aerati</foreign>.'</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">maesti <gap/> et maerentes</lemma>: maesti seems to refer rather to the sorrow shown by the looks and general aspect, maerentes to sorrow expressed in words (Tyrrell).  Possibly for maerentes we should read <foreign lang="la">mirantes</foreign>.</p></div2>
<div2 id="ep.v.4n" type="section" n="4">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">primis postulationibus</lemma>: the preliminary legal questions concerning the conduct of the trial. The term <foreign lang="la">consilium</foreign> was sometimes applied to the jury, but here and in 5 it refers to the body of jurists who were called in to give legal advice to the praetor (cf. Madvig, <title>Verf u. Verw. d. r&ouml;m. St.</title> 2.255, Momm. <title>St. R.</title> 2.307-319).  In the trial of Quinctius, the <foreign lang="la">consilium</foreign> was composed of three men (Cic. pro Quinct&lt;. 54).</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">quid quaeris?</lemma> <gloss>in a word</gloss>. Cf. <bibl n="Cic. Att. 2.1.4">Att. 2.1.4</bibl> <foreign lang="la">praeclare Metellus impedit et impediet. Quid quaeris? Est consul <foreign lang="greek">filo/patris</foreign> et, ut semper iudicavi, natura bonus</foreign>.  Such exclamatory questions are very frequent in Latin comedy (cf.  <bibl n="Pl. Mil. 2.3">Plaut. M. G. 322</bibl>, <bibl n="Pl. Mil. 2.5">472</bibl>, <bibl n="Pl. Mil. 3.2">818</bibl>, <bibl n="Pl. Mil. 3.2">834</bibl>; also <bibl n="Hor. Ep. 1.10.8">Hor. Ep. 1.10.8</bibl>, etc.), and their frequency and variety in Cicero's letters is a strong indication of the colloquial tone of the letters. Some of these familiar questions which are used to give animation to the narrative are <foreign lang="la">quid est</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">quid iam</foreign> (Ep. XLVIII. I), <foreign lang="la">quid ergo</foreign>  (<bibl>Fam. 8.12.2</bibl>), <foreign lang="la">cur hoc</foreign> (<bibl n="Cic. Fam. 8.17.2">Fam. 8.17.2</bibl>), and <foreign lang="la">quid dicam de</foreign>, etc. (Ep. XC. 4).  Cf. also <ref target="intr.98" targOrder="U">Intr. 98</ref>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">se vidisse tantum</lemma>, <gloss>that he had shown such foresight</gloss>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">nemo <gap/> arbitraretur</lemma>, <gloss>there was no one who thought of him as accused but rather as convicted a thousand times over</gloss>. The use of <foreign lang="la">miliens</foreign> harmonizes with the extravagant tone of the letter.  Cf. n. on <foreign lang="la">quas ego</foreign> above,and <ref target="intr.96" targOrder="U">Intr. 96</ref>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">ex acclamatione <gap/> facta sit</lemma>, <gloss>how the <foreign lang="la">iudices</foreign> in consequence of the outcry made by the supporters of Clodius rose in a body</gloss>. The laxity of the Roman court in allowing an expression of partisan feeling in the courtroom and in maintaining no surveillance over the jury during the trial (5) is noticeable.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Xenocratem</lemma>, <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Metelli Numidici</lemma>: both incidents are again mentioned in Cic. pro <bibl n="Cic. Balb. 11">Balb. 11</bibl>, 12, though without Xenocrates's name. Metellus was tried for misappropriation of public money while propraetor in Africa. Cicero's vanity is shown by his expression of pleasure at the complimentary action of a jury whose character he has just criticised so severely, and whose conduct he immediately proceeds to condemn with equal severity.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">tui cives</lemma>: the Athenians are called in jest the fellow-citizens of Atticus because of the fondness which Atticus had shown for Athens, as indicated by his long stay in the city. Perhaps Cicero has in mind also his friend's cognomen. The Athenians wished to bestow upon Atticus Athenian citixenship (Nepos, <bibl n="Cic. Att. 3.1">Att. 3.1</bibl>), but he declined it.</p>

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">ex Nanneianis</lemma>: if the reading is correct, a thrust at Crassus, understood by Atticus but unintelligible to us.</p>

The use of epistula (not <foreign lang="la">litterae</foreign>) harmonizes with the expression <foreign lang="la">quam nolo aliis legi</foreign>, and emphasizes, what is evident in the letter itself, its confidential character; <foreign lang="la">epistula</foreign> was usually applied to a personal letter.</p>

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U"> Catilinam</lemma>: tried on a charge of '<foreign lang="la">repetundae</foreign>' in <date value="-65">65 B.C.</date>

 against the Vestal Fabia, sister of Cicero's wife Terentia, in which Catiline was implicated.  Cicero regarded the charge as unfounded, and wished, furthermore, to spare the good name of Terentia's family.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">immissum</lemma>: properly used of wild beasts. Catiline is Compared to a wolf, Cic. <bibl n="Cic. Catil. 2.2">in Cat. 2.2</bibl>.</p>

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">exsilio privare</lemma>: if Clodius had been convicted, he would have been exiled.

<div2 id="ep.v.10n" type="section" n="0">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">pulchellus</lemma>: diminutive of <foreign lang="la">pulcher</foreign>, a parody upon Clodius's cognomen <foreign lang="la">Pulcher</foreign>, while at the same time it contains an ironical allusion to his lack of personal beauty, to which Cicero refers, <title>Or. in P. Clod. et C. Cur.</title>: <foreign lang="la">sed credo postquam speculum tibi adlatum est longe te a pulchris abesse sensisti</foreign>. Pulchellus may also be used in derision of the effeminacy of Clodius, for, speaking of the group of young men to whom Clodius belonged, Cicero says, <foreign lang="la">concursabant barbatuli iuvenes, totus ille grex Catilinae</foreign>, <bibl n="Cic. Att. 1.14.5">Att. 1.14.5</bibl>. Well-trimmed beards marked the climax of dandyism. Diminutives do not always indicate that the individual in question is smaller than others of its kind, but that the speaker feels affection, pity, or contempt for it.  Thus Cicero speaks of his daughter as <foreign lang="la">Tulliola</foreign> (my darling Tullia), <bibl n="Cic. Att. 4.1.4">Att. 4.1.4</bibl>; Servius, referring to the sad death of the same woman, speaks of her as a <foreign lang="la">muliercula</foreign>, <bibl n="Cic. Fam. 4.5.4">Fam. 4.5.4</bibl>; while the predominant feeling suggested by <foreign lang="la">pulchellus</foreign> is one of contempt. Such a use of the diminutive is especially common in colloquial language.  Diminutive adjectives and adverbs with this force are farther removed from formal language than diminutive nouns, and the very fact that these adjectives and adverbs are not infrequent in Cicero's letters is one of the strongest indications of the familiar character of the letters. Cf. <foreign lang="la">misellus</foreign> (<bibl n="Cic. Att. 3.23.5">Att. 3.23.5</bibl>), <foreign lang="la">vetulus</foreign> (<bibl n="Cic.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">ad Baias</lemma>: Clodius twits Cicero with living at the fashionable seaside resort Baiae, whose reputation for strictness of morals was a little questionable. Cicero, disdaining to defend himself, intimates  that Clodius had been found once in far more suspicious surroundings, i.e. at the festival of the Bona Dea.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">falsum, sed tamen quid huic</lemma> (sc. <foreign lang="la">falsum id esse responderem</foreign>): addressed to Atticus, not to Clodius.  One of Cicero's houses was at Puteoli, so that while he could technically deny having a villa at Baiae, he was within the circle of its influence, as he himself felt, for he refers to the place as <foreign lang="la">Cratera illum delicatum</foreign> (<gloss>Crater with its well-known allurements</gloss>), <bibl n="Cic.

Cicero replies, 'Make that remark to your patron (Curio) who was terribly anxious for the springs of a countryman from Arpinum.' The <foreign lang="la">Aquae Arpinatis</foreign> were medicinal springs upon an estate once belonging to C. Marius.  Cicero parries the thrust at his provincialism, therefore, by referring to the fact that one of Rome's most illustrious men lived in his native town Arpinum, and hits Clodius through Curio, for the latter had obtained the estate during the Sullan proscriptions, and therefore not in an honorable way.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">nosti enim marinas</lemma>: addressed to Atticus. These springs were perhaps called <foreign lang="la">marinae</foreign> because they were near the sea-coast.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">regem appellas, cum <gap/> fecerit</lemma>, <foreign lang="la">do you talk of a rex, when Rex made no mention of you</foreign>? Q. Marcius Rex was brother-in-law of Clodius, and at his death passed over the latter entirely in his will.</p>

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">domum</lemma>: Cicero's house was in the most fashionable part of the city, on the Palatine, and cost him $150,000 (<bibl n="Cic.

Clodius wishes to characterize Cicero as a <foreign lang="fr">parvenu</foreign>, and perhaps to suggest that the money had been obtained in a questionable way.

<p>Rome, Dec. 5, <date value="-61">61 B.C.</date>
 At this time there had been a disagreement of long standing between Quintus Cicero and his wife Pomponia, who was the sister of Atticus. On leaving Rome to assume the propraetorship of Asia in <date value="-61">61 B.C.</date>
, Quintus had invited Atticus to accompany him as <foreign lang="la">legatus</foreign>, and Atticus had declined the invitation  (cf. Ep. V. 14). This refusal and the suspicion of Quintus that Pomponia was abetted in her opposition by her brother (cf. <foreign lang="la">odiosas suspiciones</foreign>, 1), had led to such a serious breach between the two men that Quintus, as current rumor said, had expressed himself very unfavorably in regard to his brother-in-law at Rome, and had actually left the city without writing to him (cf. 4). Atticus naturally felt aggrieved, and in his letter to Marcus Cicero took occasion to remind his friend of the services which he had rendered him in the past (cf. 5). To avoid a misunderstanding with Atticus, and to put his brother's conduct in a more favorable light, without aggravating the quarrel between Quintus and Pomponia, and without putting Atticus in the wrong, constitute the delicate task which Cicero essays. With this letter, cf. Ep. XXX. 3, 4.</p>

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">ob iudicandum</lemma>: this senatorial investigation was directed particularly against the jury in the Clodian trial, the  majority of which was supposed to have been bribed (cf. Ep. V.5).  Cato, who proposed the investigation (cf. <bibl n="Cic. Att. 2.1.8">Att. 2.1.8</bibl>), was acting simply in the interests of justice; but, as many of the suspected jurors were <foreign lang="la">equi</foreign> tes, the equestrian order regarded the investigation as a covert attack upon themselves, which 'at the same time they could not oppose (neque aperte dicere) without appearing to defend crime. The incident offers an excellent opportunity to contrast the methods of Cato and of the political group to which he belonged, with those of Cicero and his school. Cato wishes to punish the offenders regardless of the political consequences, or, as Cicero puts it (<bibl n="Cic. Att. 2.1.8">Att. 2.1.8</bibl>), <foreign lang="la">dicit</foreign> tam quam in Platonis roXtreig, non tam quam in Romuli foece sententiam. Cicero abhors the deed, but does not wish to punish the evil-doers, for fear of alienating the class to which they belonged, and thus weakening the opposition to the democracy. Cf. <bibl n="Cic.

<p>Rome, July, <date value="-59">59 B.C.</date>
  In accordance with the Compact made in <date value="-60">60 B.C.</date>
 between Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus, who formed what is commonly called the First Triumvirate, Caesar had been elected consul for <date value="-59">59 B.C.</date>
, and the radical measures whose passage he had secured or was securing with the help of Pompey (cf. <bibl n="Cic. Att. 2.16.2">Att. 2.16.2</bibl>) opened Cicero's eyes to the character of Pompey, and to the danger which threatened the state. The letter presents a lively picture of the political turmoil in Rome, throws light upon the attitude of the populace toward Caesar and Pompey, as viewed from an aristocratic standpoint, and discloses Cicero's realization for a moment of the danger with which the designs of Clodius threaten him.</p>
<div2 type="section" n="1"><p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">sescenta</lemma>: cf. <foreign lang="la">miliens</foreign>, <ref target="ep.v.4n" targOrder="U">Ep. V.4n</ref>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Statium manu missum </lemma> (<foreign lang="la">esse</foreign>): Quintus Cicero had lately set his slave Statius free, and this action had given color to the rumor that Statius exerted too great an influence over Quintus. Cf. <bibl n="Cic. Q. Fr. 1.2.3">Q. fr. 1.2.3</bibl> <foreign lang="la">quod autem me maxisne movere solebat, cum audiebam illum plus apud te posse quam gravitas istius aetatis imperiprudentiae postularet</foreign>, etc.</p>

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">cetera</lemma>, etc.: pointing back to <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">multa me sollicitant</lemma>; 'my other troubles concern important matters.'</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">dignitatis <foreign lang="greek">a(/lis</foreign>, tamquam <foreign lang="greek">druo/s</foreign></lemma>, <gloss>quite enough of dignityy, as men said of the oak</gloss>. The proverbial expression, <foreign lang="greek">a(/lis druo/s</foreign>, refers to the time when men gave up a diet of acorns for one of bread. In general language, 'times are changed, and what suited the past is ill adapted to the present.' Jeans aptly cites the same proverb from Voltaire: '<foreign lang="fr">Le si&egrave;cle du gland est pass&eacute;, vous donnerez du pain aux hommes</foreign>.'

He opposed Caesar's plans to the best of his ability, but his opposition was rather obstinate than effective.  Cf. Mommsen, <title>R&ouml;m. Hist.</title> IV. 245.  Subsequently he was commander of Pompey's fleet in the Civil War.</p>

<div2 id="ep.vii.3n" type="section" n="3">

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">dominus</lemma>: this seems from the connection to refer to Pompey. As Tyrrell remarks, to the Roman at this time the figure in the foreground was Pompey, not Caesar. Pompey attended the gladiatorial show which was given by Gabinius (<bibl n="Cic. Att. 2.24.3">Att. 2.24.3</bibl>).</p>

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">mortuo plausu</lemma>, <gloss>as the applause</gloss> (for Caesar) <foreign lang="la">died away</foreign>. The contrast revealed Caesar's  unpopularity.  Allowance should be made for the fact that Cicero was sitting among the senators and knights, who favored Curio, and at a distance from the lower classes, who were in the rear of the theatre, and could not well compare the applause from the two sections, even if he were impartial.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Curio filius</lemma>: the younger Curio continued to be Caesar's most active and dangerous opponent until <date value="-50">50 B.C.</date>
, when Caesar purchased his support by the payment of a large sum of money. Cf. <bibl n="Cic. Fam. 2.1">Fam. 2.1</bibl>; 2.7; 8.10.3; 16.11.2, and Vell. Paterc. 2.48.3.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">litterae <gap/> erat susceptum</lemma>: the tenses in this paragraph are probably epistolary. Cf. <ref target="intr.84c" targOrder="U">Intr. 84c</ref>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">equitibus qui</lemma>, etc.: the hostility of the <foreign lang="la">equites</foreign> toward Caesar is hard to understand, as his legislation to relieve the <foreign lang="la">publicani</foreign> who had bid too high for the privilege of collecting the taxes (<bibl n="Cic. Att. 1.17.9">Att. 1.17.9</bibl>; 2.16.2) was calculated to win their favor.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Capuam</lemma>: Pompey was at Capua as a member of the commission appointed under Caesar's agrarian laws.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Rosciae legi</lemma>: the <foreign lang="la">lex Roscia</foreign>, proposed by L. Roscius Otho in <date value="-67">67 B.C.</date>
, set apart 14 rows of seats for the knights immediately behind the orchestra, where the senators sat.  This law had been threatened in Cicero's consulship also; cf. <bibl n="Cic. Att. 2.1.3">Att. 2.1.3</bibl> and Mommsen, <title>St. N.</title> III. 520.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">frumentariae</lemma>: the <foreign lang="la">lex Terentia et Cassia</foreign> passed in <date value="-73">73 B.C.</date>
 fixed a low price for corn. Cf. Cic. <title>Verr.</title> 2.3.163, 174. The repeal of this law would be aimed at the poor people, as the repeal of the Roscian law would injure the <foreign lang="la">equites</foreign>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">quam prae sidio</lemma>: i.e. than by power of resistance.</p></div2>
<div2 id="ep.vii.4n" type="section" n="4">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">noster</lemma>: the possessive is often thus used ironically in the letters of one whom the writer dislikes or despises. Cf. <ref target="intr.88b" targOrder="U">Intr. 88b</ref>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">impendet negotium</lemma>: Clodius wished to take vengeance upon Cicero for the latter's evidence on the trial for sacrilege, and for the discomfiture which he had suffered at his hands in the debate in the senate (cf. <ref target="ep.v.2n" targOrder="U">Ep. V.2n</ref>). Cf. <ref target="intr.14" targOrder="U">Intr. 14</ref>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">consularem exercitum</lemma>: i.e. the backing which Cicero's consulship won him.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">illum </lemma> (facturum): i.e. Clodius.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">in locum mortui</lemma>: Cosconius had been a member of Caesar's land commission.  Cicero is offended that, instead of making him an original member of the commission, the triumvirs should wait until a member died, and should then offer him the chance of stepping into a dead man's shoes, so to speak. The phrase implies also that one holding a place on the commission would be dead politically.   istam: Atticus had evidently recommended a conciliatory course; see above, '<foreign lang="la">saluti, Si me amas, consule</foreign>.'</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">apud bonos invidiosi</lemma>: the division of the public lands was always bittedy opposed by the Boni.</p></div2>
<div2 id="ep.vii.5n" type="section" n="5">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">legatum</lemma>:  as Caesar's legate during his proconsulship, Cicero might hope for protection against the attacks of Clodius. Cf. <bibl n="Cic. Att. 2.18.3">Att. 2.18.3</bibl>. Cicero's agitation shows itself in the abruptness of the style (Rillerbeck).</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">perfidelem</lemma>: cf. <ref target="intr.77" targOrder="U">Intr. 77</ref>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Laelium</lemma>: Cicero elsewhere (Ep. 111.3) compares himself to Laelius. In his next letter to Atticus (<bibl n="Cic. Att. 2.20.5">Att. 2.20.5</bibl>) he announces his intention of calling himself Laelius in the letters and leaving the name of Atticus unchanged.   The plan suggested here does not seem to have been carried out. Furius, consul <date value="-136">136 B.C.</date>
, was a friend of the younger Laelius.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">cetera erunt <foreign lang="greek">e)n ai)nigmoi=s</foreign></lemma>: numerous illustrations of this fact may be found in the care with which Cicero often avoids referring to people by their names.  He alludes also to delicate personal and political matters in a covert way.  Cf. <ref target="intr.104" targOrder="U">Intr. 104</ref>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Caecilium</lemma>: cf. Ep. 1.3.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">edicta Bibuli</lemma>: Bibulus, Caesar's colleague in the consulship, after ineffectual efforts to oppose Caesar's action, shut himself up in his own house and issued proclamations declaring Caesar's acts illegal. Cf. Mommsen, <title>Rom. Hist.</title> IV. 247.</p>

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">cum hoc</lemma>: i.e. <foreign lang="la">Clodio</foreign>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">alium testem</lemma>: this suggests a doubt of the truth of Pompey's statement. There can in fact be little doubt that Caesar and Pompey understood the designs of Clodius, and tacitly approved of his election to the tribuneship.  It was part of their plan to break down the prestige of the senate, and that could be accomplished in no better way than by degrading one of its leaders and discrediting its somewhat autocratic treatment of the Catilinarian conspiracy.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">cum . . passus esset</lemma>: Pompey actually took some part in the proceedings of the <foreign lang="la">comitia curiata</foreign> when Clodius was adopted; cf. <bibl n="Cic. Att. 2.12.1">Att. 2.12.1</bibl>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">fidem recepisse</lemma>, etc.: 'both Clodius and Appius have given him (Pompey) a promise not to attack me.' <foreign lang="la">Recipio</foreign> in this sense is colloquial.  The full expression is <foreign lang="la">in me recipio</foreign>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Appium</lemma>: Appius Claudius Pulcher, the brother of Clodius, had been Cicero's friend until the quarrel with Clodius occurred. He was in <date value="-52">52 B.C.</date>
 Cicero's predecessor as governor of Cilicia. The 13 letters of Bk. 3 ad Fam., are addressed to him.</p>

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Crasso urgente</lemma>: the dislike which Crassus felt for Cicero seems to date from <date value="-66">66 B.C.</date>
, when Cicero, in his speech for the Manilian law, by exaggerating the part which Pompey had played in certain matters, had belittled the achievements of Crassus. An apparent, not a real, reconciliation took place in the senate in <date value="-61">61 B.C.</date>

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">bow=pis</lemma>: Clodia, the sister of Clodius. This epithet of Hera as applied to her has a double meaning. On the one hand, as with Hera, the brilliancy of Clodia's eyes was one of her claims to beauty.  Cicero speaks of her <foreign lang="la">flagrantia oculorum</foreign>, pro <bibl n="Cic. Cael. 49">Cael. 49</bibl>. On the other hand, her will was imperious, and her fondness to control men and things as well marked as was that of Hera. She was the Lesbia of the poet Catullus, and the mistress of the young orator Caelius, by whom the letters of Bk. 8, ad Fam. were written. For a sketch of her life, cf. Boissier, <title>Cic&eacute;on et ses Amis</title>, 174-186. Cf. also Merrill's <title>Catullus</title>, <ref target="intr.18" targOrder="U">Intr. 18</ref> ff.

Cf. Ep. LXX.1.

Cicero's urgent requests for the presence of Atticus would seem to have been successful, as there is a break in the correspondence between the two men from November, 59, to March, 58, during which time Atticus was doubtless in Rome. The correspondence of the year <date value="-59">59 B.C.</date>
 reveals the utter helplessness of the senatorial party to cope with the triumvirs.  The former were without a 'platform' and without leaders.  The petulant opposition of Bibulus and the tactless obstinacy of Cato excited only ridicule and anger.  These letters as a whole disclose also Cicero's lack of political insight in failing utterly to appreciate the strength of the Triumvirate, and in failing to see up to the last moment the danger of his own position (cf. also <ref target="intr.14" targOrder="U">Intr. 14</ref>). In striking contrast to the letters of this year are those written six months later.

<div1 id="ep.x" type="letter" n="coll=A:book=3:letter=4"><head>Letter X:  ad Atticum 3.4</head>
<p>Vibo, about April 12,<date value="-58">58 B.C.</date>
 The letters of this third book, <title>ad Att.</title>, written in exile, expose perhaps more than any other portion of his correspondence, the weak side of Cicero's character. He is unmanly, selfish, and ungrateful.  In contrast the letters of 44 and <date value="-43">43 B.C.</date>
 breathe a spirit of unfailing courage and unselfish patriotism.  It is only when two such epochs in Cicero's life are placed side by side that the reader can discover the true key to his character, which is to be found in the fact that he was peculiariy sensitive to his surroundings, and was exalted or depressed by circumstances which would have had no abiding influence upon a more phlegmatic nature (cf. <ref target="intr.50" targOrder="U">Intr. 50</ref>). Without waiting to see what action would be taken upon the bill of Clodius, which did not mention him by name (<foreign lang="la">qui civem Romanum indemnatum interemisset, ei aqua et igni interdiceretur</foreign>, Vell. Paterc. 2.45), Cicero left Rome about March 20, <date value="-58">58 B.C.</date>
, and went to his friend Sica, near Vibo. Here news reached him of the amended bill directed against him personally. He therefore hastily left Vibo for Tarentum and Brundisium.  See <ref target="intr.15" targOrder="U">Intr. 15</ref> f.</p>

Cic. <foreign lang="la">de Domo</foreign>, 47.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">correctum</lemma>: the amended bill forbade Cicero to remain at any point within 400 miles of Italy.  After a bill had been brought forward an interval of 17 days, a <foreign lang="la">trinundinum</foreign> (cf. <bibl>Herzog, 1.1092, n. 2</bibl>; see, however, Momm. <title>St. N.</title> 111.376, n.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">mi Pomponi</lemma>: Cicero rarely addresses his correspondent by name in a letter.

The omission of the praenomen, as Tyrrell remarks, indicated intimacy; cf. <foreign lang="la">quod sine praenomine familiariter, at debebas, ad me epistulam misisti</foreign>, etc., <bibl n="Cic. Fam. 7.32.1">Fam. 7.32.1</bibl>.

  suis in the superscription is plural because it belongs to both the children.  For variations of this salutation, cf. Fam. '4. I, 3' and 6.  The possessive pronoun indicates familiarity, and Cicero uses it in addressing the members of his family only.  It is used in all the 24 letters to his wife, in Bk. 14, ad Fam., with one exception: in the fifteenth letter, Ep. LVIII., which is cold and formal, he writes, <foreign lang="la">Tullius s.d. Terentiae</foreign>. Upon the significance of the possessive in this use, cf. <bibl n="Cic. Fam. 16.18.1">Fam. 16.18.1</bibl>.  In a previous letter to his freedman Cicero had written, <foreign lang="la">Tullius Tironi sat</foreign>, omitting Tiro's praenomen.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">nec nimium diligentem</lemma>: this means in formal Latin, 'not too active,' but here it means, 'not very active,' without any idea of excess, or, as we say, 'none too active.'

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">impulsu Clodi</lemma>: B&ouml;ckel shows by a quotation from Asconius that there had been scarcity at Rome for three months.  Perhaps, however, the populace had been led by Cicero's friends to expect a return of prosperity upon his recall, and as they found that this result did not follow, there was a popular reaction against him, led by Clodius.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">id ipse </lemma> (sc. <foreign lang="la">Pompeius</foreign>) cuperet: in the latter part of <date value="-58">58 B.C.</date>
 Pompey and Clodius had a violent quarrel, and were still at enmity with each other. Atticus might therefore have supposed that the position, which was to be offered to Pompey, since it was the result of the agitation led by Clodius, was distasteful to Pompey.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">ut  id decernerem</lemma>, <gloss>that I should advocate that course</gloss>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">quod <gap/> dicere</lemma>: Cicero comments bitteriy upon the cowardice of the Optimates in an oration delivered a short time after this: <foreign lang="la">at enim non nulli propter timorem, quod se in senatu tuto non esse arbitrabantur, discesserunt.  Non reprehendo, nec quaero fueritne aliquid pertimescendum; puto sno quemque arbitratu timere oportere</foreign>, de Domo, 8.  The entire sentence beginning with <foreign lang="la">eo biduo</foreign>, with its rapid succession of temporal clauses, the rapidity of whose effect is heightened by the use of asyndeton, with its graphic description of the movements of the populace, is calculated to present the urgency of the popular demand in a forcible manner.  Cicero seems to feel that his action in coming forward as the champion of a measure which would give Pompey extraordinary power, and thereby offend the Optimates, may appear unwise, and therefore calls for justification.  Its unwisdom would consist in its tendency to  estrange the Optimates at the moment when Cicero needed their help in getting indemnification for the loss of his house on the Palatine.  It would also seem inconsistent with Cicero's political principles to advocate increasing the power of one of the triumvirs.  Cicero strives to meet these two objections by presenting the urgency of the case and the fact, if we may accept it as a fact, that Pompey's appointment was favored by the <foreign lang="la">Boni</foreign> (<foreign lang="la">verum etiam bonorum</foreign>). B&ouml;ckel acutely remarks that it may have been the purpose of Clodius to force Cicero to propose the grant of extraordinary powers, in order to compromise him in the eyes of the aristocracy and the <foreign lang="la">pontifices</foreign>. He certainly succeeded in putting him in a dilemma: to oppose the bill would have been to brave the wrath of the people and the enmity of Pompey, who had labored to secure his recall from exile; to favor the measure was to antagonize the aristocracy.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">quod <gap/> negarent</lemma>: on the subj., cf. <foreign lang="la">dicere</foreign>: Ep. 1.3 B.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Messallam</lemma>: M. Valerius Messalla Niger, consul in <date value="-61">61 B.C.</date>
  He is highly praised by Cicero, in<bibl n="Cic. Att. 1.14.6">Att. 1.14.6</bibl>, for his integrity.  Messalla and Afranius were supporters of Pompey.  On Afranius, cf. <foreign lang="la">Auli filius</foreign>, <ref target="ep.v.12n" targOrder="U">Ep. V.12n</ref>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">eam rem</lemma>: i.e. the procuring of corn.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">meo nomine</lemma>: Cicero had been a leading advocate of the bill, so that his name probably appeared in the list of those who put it into legal form; cf. note on <foreign lang="la">legem</foreign> conscripserunt below.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">recitando</lemma>: here, as frequently in Livy (e.g. 25.30. ~6) and occasionally in Tacitus, the ablative of the gerundive takes the place of the missing pres. part. pass.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">praetorem</lemma>: the praetor was Appius Claudius Pulcher, the brother of Clodius. Cf. Ep. VIII.2. The two tribunes, Sex. Atilius Serranus and Q. Numerius Rufus, had already opposed Cicero in other matters. Cf. Cic. pro <bibl n="Cic. Sest. 72">Sest. 72</bibl>, 94.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">dederunt </lemma>(sc. <foreign lang="la">contionem</foreign>): a <foreign lang="la">contio</foreign> was either an assembly of the people held to consider a question but not to vote upon it, or a speech delivered before such an assembly. Only a magistrate could give a private citizen the right of speaking in a <foreign lang="la">contio</foreign>, and the technical phrase for such permission was contionem dare or <foreign lang="la">in contionem producere</foreign>.</p></div2>

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">legem <gap/> conscripserunt</lemma>: the senate voted upon a general proposition or upon a number of propositions laid before it. If a motion was adopted, it was written out in legal form, after its passage, by a committee containing the leading representatives of the party which had supported it.  It contained, when thus drawn up, the title, the year, the day, the place of meeting, the name of the proposer and of those who witnessed the drawing up of the bill, and then the enacting clause or clauses, with sometimes an indication of the number present.  For a <foreign lang="la">senatus consultum</foreign> in legal form, cf. Allen, <title>Remnants of Early Latin</title>, Nos. 82, 105; Cic. <bibl n="Cic. Fam. 8.8.5">Fam. 8.8.5</bibl>. Cf. also Willems, 2.206-216.-Messius: a tribune and a follower of Pompey; cf. <bibl n="Cic. Att. 8.11">Att. 8.11</bibl> v.2.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">maius imperium in provinciis</lemma>, etc.: the bill of Messius would have subordinated Caesar to Pompey.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">consularis</lemma>: because action was proposed by a consul, not by a tribune, as in the case of the other law.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Pompeius <gap/> hanc</lemma>: a good illustration of Pompey's political methods.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Favonio</lemma>: a man of more energy than tact; an admirer and imitator of Cato. Although only a quaestor, the boldness with which he advocated the cause of the Optimates brought even the <foreign lang="la">consulares</foreign> to accept him as their leader.  He was praetor when the Civil War opened, took Pompey's side, and was pardoned by Caesar after the battle of Pharsalus. He fought on the side of the <foreign lang="la">liberatores</foreign> in the battle of Philippi, and was put to death after the battle by the order of Octavius.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">de domo nostra</lemma>: cf. <ref target="ep.xiii.3n" targOrder="U">Ep. XIII.3n</ref>. Either the pontifices may decide that the consecration by Clodius was void (<foreign lang="la">si sustulerint religionem</foreign>), return the site to Cicero, and reimburse him for the loss of his house; or they may consider the consecration legal (sin aliter) and indemnify him for the loss of both house and grounds.</p></div2>

The omission of Terentia's name here is very significant.  The reference to domestic troubles immediately after a statement concerning the unsatisfactory condition of his property lends color to the hypothesis that the reckless management of Cicero's property by Terentia and her steward was one of the causes of the misunderstanding.

<p>Arpinum, June, <date value="-56">56 B.C.</date>
 A thorough analysis of this letter to Lucceius, as B&ouml;ckel points out, will reveal the fact that it is as carefully constructed as any of Cicero's orations: <table> <row role="data"><cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">1</cell><cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">prooemium</cell></row> <row role="data"><cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">2-3</cell><cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">hortatio</cell></row> <row role="data"><cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">4-8</cell><cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">probatio</cell></row> <row role="data"><cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">10</cell><cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">conclusio</cell></row> </table> Yet, while the earnestness of his purpose is apparent throughout, by the light conversational tone which he gives the letter Cicero glosses over the 'impudence' of his request, puts the seriousness of the offense against historical truth in the background, and strives to secure the consent of Lucceius on the score of friendship.  For Cicero's own judgment of the epistle, cf. <bibl n="Cic. Att. 4.6.4">Att. 4.6.4</bibl> <foreign lang="la">epistulam, Lucceio nunc quam misi, qua meas res ut scribat rogo, fac ut ab eo sumas--valde bella est</foreign>. L. Lucceius was an orator and a man of some literary note.  In politics and military affairs he was less successful; he was a candidate with Caesar for the consulship in <date value="-60">60 B.C.</date>
 (cf. Ep. VI.11n), but was defeated, and in the Civil War was one of the intemperate leaders in Pompey's camp.</p>

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">ardeo commendari tuis</lemma>: B&ouml;ckel notes that the orator and the historian adopt the periodic form of construction with the verb at the end of the clause, as the one best fitted to impart dignity and force to what they say, while often in letters, as in this passage, a writer affects an apparent carelessness upon this point in order to convey the impression of spontaneity and sincerity.</p>

Timaeus published a history of his native land, Sicily, and also a sketch of the campaigns of Pyrrhus. Polybius wrote, besides his universal history, an account of the war of Numantia.  The last illustration is especially in point, for as Polybius was led to write a separate history of the Numantine War by his friendship for its hero Scipio, Cicero hopes that Lucceius may be induced by a similar sentiment to compose a special treatise.</p>

<p>Rome, Oct., <date value="-55">55 B.C.</date>
 Cicero's friend, M. Marius, to whom <bibl n="Cic. Fam. 7.1">Fam. 7.1</bibl>-4 are addressed, was confined to his villa at Stabiae by an attack of the gout (<bibl n="Cic. Fam. 7.4">Fam. 7.4</bibl>), and was therefore unable to witness the games at Rome which Pompey gave in honor of the dedication of his theatre and the temple of Venus Victrix. This theatre, which was erected on the Campus Martius, and would accommodate 40,000 people (Plin. N. H. 36.115), was the first permanent theatre constructed in Rome, and its opening was celebrated by gorgeous pageants and by combats between men and wild beasts, in which, according to Pliny, 20 elephants and 500 lions were killed. The distaste which Cicero shows for the vulgar display, and the pity which the slaughter of the unfortunate beasts excited in him, honorably distinguish him from his contemporaries. These particular <foreign lang="la">venationes</foreign> were so bloodthirsty that even the Roman populace was moved to pity when the elephants, seeing their escape cut off, seemed to beg for mercy: <foreign lang="la">amissa fugae spe, misericordiam vulgi inenarrabili habitu quaerentes supplicavere, quadam sese lamentatione complorantes, tanto populi dolore ut oblitus imperatoris ac munificentiae honori suo exquisitae flens universus consurgeret dirasque Pompeio poenas imprecaretur</foreign>, Plin. N. H.  8.21.</p>
<div2 id="ep.xix.1n" type="section" n="1">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Stabianum <gap/> sinum</lemma>: the Italians of the present day who have villas on the lakes or seashore, often cut down the trees in front of their houses, that they may obtain an unobstructed view across the water; so Marius would seem to have cut the trees down in a line through his Stabian estate (lit. &lt;<gloss>he bored through</gloss>) to the shore, and thus brought the bay into view.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">lectiunculis</lemma>, <gloss>by reading a bit here and a bit there</gloss>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">mimos</lemma>: the <foreign lang="la">mimus</foreign>, which was introduced into Rome from Tarentum in the third century B.C., was at the outset a character presentation by dancers, but, in the second century probably, dialogue and songs were introduced. Facial expression always played an important part in it, so that the performers did not wear masks.  In Cicero's time <foreign lang="la">mimi</foreign> were put on the stage only as afterpieces (cf. Ep. LXI. 7). The degraded taste of imperial times, however, preferred them to the drama proper, so that they practically drove the latter from the stage.  Cf. also Ribbeck, <title>R&ouml;mische Dichtung</title>, 1.217, 218.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">semisomni </lemma>: at this period dramatic performances began early in the day, and those for whom seats were not reserved found it necessary to be in their places several hours before the performance began.  Physical fatigue, therefore, and the stupidity of the performances made the audience listless.</p>

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">si sciens fallo</lemma>: the first words of an oath.  Cf. <bibl n="Liv. 1.24">Liv. 1.24</bibl>. Ribbeck (R&ouml;m. Trag. p. 49) suggests that perhaps Aesopus played the part of Sinon in the <title>Equus Troianus</title> of Naevius (or of Andronicus) and that this oath was introduced in some such speech as that put into the mouth of Sinon by Vergil in <bibl n="Verg. A. 2.154">Aen. 2.154</bibl>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">sescenti</lemma>: for an indefinitely large number; cf. <foreign lang="la">miliens</foreign>, Ep. V.4.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Clytaemestra</lemma>: one of the plays of L. Accius</p>

Compare with this whole passage the trenchant criticism which Horace passes upon the taste for realism and vulgar display upon the stage in his day (Ep. 2.1.189-207).</p></div2>

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">ne tu</lemma>: cf. <foreign lang="la">ne</foreign>, Ep. XVI [.2 n.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Graecos aut Oscos ludos</lemma>: comedy and tragedy were essentially of Greek origin, and Cicero speaks of them therefore as <foreign lang="la">ludi Graeci</foreign> in distinction from the <foreign lang="la">fobulae Atellanae</foreign> (<foreign lang="la">ludi Osci</foreign>), which were indigenous to Italian soil. These Atellan farces were comic representations of life with fixed characters. They were cast in dialogue form, varied by occasional songs.  The action was lively, and the language the vulgar Latin. After the conquest of Campania, in <date value="-211">211 B.C.</date>
, these farces were introduced into Rome, given in course of time a more distinctly dramatic form, and used as afterpieces on the stage. Cf. Ep. LXI. 7; also Ribbeck, <title>R&ouml;m. Dichtung</title>, 1.207-217.	</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">in senatu vestro</lemma>: Marius would seem to have been a <foreign lang="la">decurio</foreign>, or member of the town council, probably in Pompeii, and in the deliberations of his Oscan colleagues upon petty matters of town government, he could find all the elements of an 'Oscan burlesque' without taking the trouble to come to Rome for them.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">via Graeca</lemma>: perhaps a road leading to his villa which Marius did not use; but the point of the jest is obscure to us.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">athletas</lemma>: a term applied properly to those who took part in the five contests&mdash;running, wrestling, boxing, the <foreign lang="la">pentathlum</foreign> (made up of five distinct games), the <foreign lang="la">pancratium</foreign> (boxing <emph>and</emph> wrestling). As we may infer from the text, <foreign lang="la">in quibus</foreign>, etc., the Roman people showed little enthusiasm for these Greek games, and this continued to be the case until they gained an artificial stimulus by receiving the approval of certain emperors. Nero in particular was very fond of them (<bibl n="Tac. Ann. 14.20">Tac. Ann. 14.20</bibl>).</p>

) he was attacked on some political charge by the enemies of Pompey, and Cicero defended him, doubtless at Pompey's request.  With some two or three exceptions (e.g. Cic. <bibl n="Cic. de Orat. 2.253">de Or. 2.253</bibl>) the <foreign lang="la">cognomen</foreign> is never placed before the <foreign lang="la">nomen</foreign> in formal Latin in the Ciceronian period but this order is common enough in colloquial Latin e.g. <foreign lang="la">Bassus Caecilius</foreign>, Ep.

<p>Rome, <date value="-54">April, 54 B.C.</date>
 C. Trebatius Testa, the date of whose birth is uncertain, came as a boy to Rome to study law. He became attached to Cicero, and pleased the latter by both his wit and good-fellowship, and also assisted him by his knowledge of jurisprudence.   Being anxious, however, to see something of the world, to win his spurs, and to make a fortune, perhaps, in the provinces, Trebatius set out for the Roman camp in Gaul, carrying with him this letter of recommendation.  Cicero's relations with Trebatius were of a most intimate nature, as his seventeen letters to him (<bibl n="Cic. Fam. 7.6">Fam. 7.6</bibl>-22) prove.  Like most of the young men who served upon Caesar's staff in Gaul, Trebatius became his devoted admirer, and followed his fortunes in the Civil War. He was one of the few members of that coterie of young men about Caesar who survived the Civil War and lived to see Rome at peace under Augustus.  Horace introduces him as a speaker in Sat. 2.1.</p>
<div2 id="ep.xxi.1n" type="section" n="1">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">me alterum</lemma>: cf. <ref target="ep.xv.7n" targOrder="U">Ep. XV.7n</ref>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">quocumque exirem</lemma>: Pompey had named Cicero as one of his 15 <foreign lang="la">legati</foreign> on the corn commission in <date value="-57">57 B.C.</date>
 (Ep. XV. 7), and Cicero would naturally have gone to some province in connection with that matter, but as he preferred to stay at Rome, his place was taken by Quintus, who went to Sardinia (Ep. XVI. 7); or perhaps reference is made to the fact that the province of Spain was assigned to Pompey at the close of his consulship in <date value="-55">55 B.C.</date>
, and Cicero may have been invited to accompany him as his <foreign lang="la">legatus</foreign>, but, as we know, Pompey remained at Rome.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">dubitatio</lemma>: Cicero's hesitation to leave Rome was due perhaps partly to a fear that Clodius might attack him during his absence, and partly to a fondness for Rome. Cf. <foreign lang="la">si potes</foreign>, etc., <ref target="ep.xvii.2n" targOrder="U">Ep. XVII.2n</ref>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">exspectare <gap/> sperasset</lemma>: in the contrast between these two words lies a delicate compliment to Caesar.  The favor of the successful governor of the Gauls would insure to Trebatius what the friendship of a <foreign lang="la">legatus</foreign> to Spain could only make probable.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">prolixe</lemma>: not infrequently in the Letters with verbs of hoping, thinking, and promising, adverbs are used instead of the neut. acc. plur. of the adj. used substantively, e.g. <foreign lang="la">ut ipse facile animadverterem male</foreign> (for <foreign lang="la">mala</foreign>) <foreign lang="la">eum de me cogitare</foreign>, <bibl n="Cic. Fam. 8">Fam. 8</bibl>, 12.1; <foreign lang="la">non licuit diutius bene de eo sperare</foreign>, <bibl n="Cic. Fam. 10.21.1">Fam. 10.21.1</bibl>; <foreign lang="la">si humaniter et sapienter et amabiliter in me cogitare vis</foreign>, <bibl n="Cic. Att. 14.13">Att. 14.13</bibl>A. 2. This is a colloquial usage.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">promisi</lemma>: used of a formal agreement, while <foreign lang="la">polliceri</foreign> implies a voluntary promise.</p></div2>
<div2 id="ep.xxi.2n" type="section" n="2">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Balbo</lemma>: L. Cornelius Balbus, a native of Gades, who had received Roman citizenship for his services against Sertorius; cf. Cic. pro Balbo, 5 f. He attached himself closely to Caesar, and was often Caesar's confidential agent in Rome.  We have three of his letters to Cicero, <bibl n="Cic. Att. 9.7">Att. 9.7</bibl>A, 7B, and 13A.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">M. Iteium</lemma>: nothing is known of him. See Crit. Append.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Leptae</lemma>: Q. Lepta held some minor position under Caesar at this time. <bibl n="Cic. Fam. 6.18">Fam. 6.18</bibl> and 19 are addressed to him.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">sustulimus manus</lemma>: a gesture of surprise.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">invitatu</lemma>: apparently used nowhere else. Parallel forms, however, as Tyrrell remarks, are <foreign lang="la">involatus</foreign> (Ep. LXV. 7), <foreign lang="la">reflatus</foreign> (<bibl n="Cic. Att. 12.2.1">Att. 12.2.1</bibl>), <foreign lang="la">itus</foreign> (<bibl n="Cic. Att. 15.5.3">Att. 15.5.3</bibl>).</p></div2>
<div2 id="ep.xxi.3n" type="section" n="3">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">mi Caesar</lemma>: cf. <foreign lang="la">mi Pomponi</foreign>, Ep. X. n</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">non <gap/> Romano</lemma>, <gloss>not with that overworked phrase of <gap/> but in the</gloss> (hearty) <gloss>Roman fashion</gloss>. What the 'overworked phrase' was, or for what purpose Cicero wrote to Caesar concerning Milo, is unknown.  Milo wished to be a candidate for the consulship for <date value="-52">52 B.C.</date>
, and Cicero may have tried to secure for him Caesar's support, or at least his neutrality.  For <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">more Romano</lemma>, cf. <foreign lang="la">ego te Balbo, cum ad vos proficiscetur, more Romano commendabo</foreign>, Ep. XXVI. 3. See also Ep. XXIV. 3.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">familiam ducit</lemma>, <foreign lang="la">he leads the profession</foreign>, sc. as concerns memory and knowledge of jurisprudence. Trebatius was a special legal adviser of Augustus; cf. Justin. Inst. 2.25.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">tribunatum</lemma>: it was the fashion for young men of good family at Rome to go out to the provinces with the title of <foreign lang="la">tribunus militum</foreign>. Such men often had neither a taste for a military career nor the intention of adopting it, but desired the political and social prestige which such an experience would give them on their return to Rome (cf. <bibl n="Tac. Ag. 5">Tac. Agr. 5</bibl>).  Caesar has these military tyros in mind when he says: <foreign lang="la">hic (timor) primum ortus est a tribunis militum praefectis reliquisque, qui ex urbe amicitiae causa Caesarem secuti non magnum in re militari usum habebant</foreign>, <bibl n="Caes. Gal. 1.39">B. G. 1.39.2</bibl>.  Trebatius received the position of tribune from Caesar.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">gloriolae</lemma>: such positions, being purely honorary, indicated little with regard to a man's real merits, but carried a certain distinction along with them. Hence <foreign lang="la">gloriola</foreign>, not <foreign lang="la">gloria</foreign>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">de manu in manum</lemma>: a characteristic of colloquial language is its fondness for concrete phrases in expressing a thought which formal language  conveys  in  abstract phrase's. In such phrases <foreign lang="la">manus</foreign> is of frequent occurrence. Thus, in the language of everyday life 'generously' is often <foreign lang="la">manu plena</foreign> (<bibl n="Cic. Att. 2.25.1">Att. 2.25.1</bibl>), <gloss>to be present</gloss> <foreign lang="la">prae manu esse</foreign>, i.e. to be <gloss>on hand</gloss> (<bibl n="Pl. Bac. 4.3">Plaut. Bacch. 623</bibl>), <gloss>to assist</gloss> <foreign lang="la">manum dare</foreign>, i.e. <gloss>to lend a hand,</gloss> etc. Cf. also Otto, <title lang="de">Sprichw&ouml;rter der Redner</title>, p.210.6, Landgraf, 329, Krebs, <title>Antibarbarus</title> under <foreign lang="la">manus</foreign>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">putidiusculi</lemma>, <gloss>something of a bore</gloss>; cf. <foreign lang="la">pulchellus</foreign>, <ref target="ep.v.10n" targOrder="U">Ep. V.10n</ref>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">quamquam <gap/> licebit</lemma>: i.e. although it is scarcely pardonable to take advantage of one who is so generous, by laying upon him such a task as I do in turning Trebatius over completely to your care, yet I feel you will pardon the liberty.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">cura <gap/> ama</lemma>: cf. Ep. XVIII.10n. The generous spirit in which Caesar responded to the request of Cicero is indicated by his reply, the substance of which Cicero quotes in a letter to Quintus (2.13.3): <foreign lang="la">Trebatium quod ad se (i.e. Caesarem) miserim, persalse et humaniter etiam gratias mihi agit; negat enim in tanta multitudine eorum qui una essent quemquam fuisse, qui vadimonium concupere posset</foreign>.

The guilt or innocence of the accused party was, however, decided by a majority of <hi>all</hi> the <foreign lang="la">iudices</foreign>, and in this instance there was a majority of four for acquittal.

<div2 id="ep.xxiv.1n" type="section" n="1">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Equo Troiano</lemma>: cf. Ep. XIX. 2n.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">sero sapiunt</lemma>:  Cicero quotes here, as he did in Ep. XIX. 2 (<foreign lang="la">si sciens fallo</foreign>), the first words of a familiar passage, which had passed into a proverb.  The expression is thus explained by Festus, 1.510, de Pon.: <foreign lang="la">'sero sapiunt Phryges' proverbium est natum a Troianis qui decimo denique anno velle coeperunt Helenam quaeque cum ea erant rapta reddere</foreign>. Cf. also Ribbeck, <title>R&ouml;m. Trag.</title> 49.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">non sero</lemma>: Trebatius had gone to Caesar with such rose-colored ideas of a soldier's life and of the immediate wealth and distinction to be won in it, that the inevitable hardships and monotony made him discontented and homesick, so that Cicero had written him reprovingly: <foreign lang="la">primorum mensum littteris tuis vehementer commovebar, quod mihi interdum &mdash; pace tua dixerim &mdash; levis in urbis urbanitatisque desiderio, interdum piger, interdum timidus in labore militari, saepe autem etiam, quod a te alienissimum est, subimpudens videbare; tam quam enim syngrapham ad imperatorem, non epistulam attulisses</foreign>, etc., <bibl n="Cic. Fam. 7.17.1">Fam. 7.17.1</bibl>.  This letter evidently had the effect intended, for Cicero's words, <foreign lang="la">non sero</foreign>, as well as <foreign lang="la">mi vetule</foreign>, indicate that Trebatius had repented of his discontent.</p>

The phrase, <gloss>rabiosulas sat fatuas</gloss>, is probably quoted from some comic poet.  Cf., however, Ribbeck, <title>Com. Rom. Frag</title>. p. xliv.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U"><foreign lang="greek">tw=n *brettanw=n</foreign> minus <foreign lang="greek">filoqe/wron</foreign></lemma>, <gloss>not very fond of seeing the sights in Britain</gloss>. In the summer of <date value="-55">55 B.C.</date>
 Caesar made his first expedition to Britain, in which Trebatius did not care to join.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">in hibernis iniectus</lemma>: Cicero is writing toward the end of November.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">te commovere</lemma>, <gloss>to stir</gloss>; as of one crawling out from under a blanket in cold weather.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">usquequaque</lemma>, etc.: probably the words of Ulysses in the same play from which the quotation sero sapiunt was taken. Cf. Ribbeck, <title>R&ouml;m. Trag.</title> p.49, and <title>Trag. Rom. Frag.</title> p. 246.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">sapere</lemma>: perhaps with a double meaning, <gloss>to be wise</gloss> and <gloss>to be learned in the law</gloss>. Cf. Ep. XXV.1n.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">id erit telum acerrimum</lemma>: Mezger quotes Falstaff's words, 'Discretion is the better part of valor.'</p></div2>

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">cenitarem</lemma>: this frequentative is not found in Cicero outside of the Letters.</p>

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">mercules</lemma>: cf. <foreign lang="la">mercule</foreign>, Ep. XXV.3n.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">homo bellus</lemma>, <gloss>a good fellow</gloss>. See Martial, 3.63. <foreign lang="la">Bellus</foreign>, the diminutive of <foreign lang="la">bonus</foreign>, is used familiarly in the Letters with the peculiar, force which colloquial Latin often gave to the diminutive (cf. <foreign lang="la">pulchellus</foreign>, <ref target="ep.v.10n" targOrder="U">Ep.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">bene nummatum</lemma>: a colloquial  expression which Horace adopts for comic effect (Epp. 1.6.38) perhaps from this passage. Cf. also Cic. de leg. Agr. 2.59.</p>

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">sum <gap/> invitatus</lemma>: the letters of Trebatius were apparently written in a personal and humorous vein.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">subinvideo tibi</lemma>, <gloss>I envy you a trifle</gloss>. Cf. <ref target="intr.77" targOrder="U">Intr. 77</ref>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">accersitum</lemma>: sc. to give advice.</p></div2>
<div2 id="ep.xxv.2n" type="section" n="2">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">minori curae</lemma>:  colloquial Latin showed a fondness for the predicate dative after <foreign lang="la">esse</foreign>; and <foreign lang="la">curae</foreign>, often with an adjective, <foreign lang="la">magnae, minori, summae</foreign>, etc., is very frequently found in this construction.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">valde metuo</lemma>, etc., <gloss>I am very much afraid that you are suffering from cold in your winter quarters; so I advise you to keep a bright fire going on the hearth (Mucius and Manilius hold the same opinion), especially as you are not well supplied with clothing for a campaign, and yet I understand that you find it hot enough over there just at present</gloss>.  The humor of the passage consists in the rapid transition from the literal to the metaphorical meaning of certain words, and in the citation of learned authorities in support of self-evident conclusions. <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">frigeas in hibernis</lemma> is perhaps best taken literally, <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">sagis non abundares</lemma> with a double meaning, and <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">calere</lemma> figuratively.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Mucio</lemma>: Q. Mucius Scaevola, pontifex maximus, consul in <date value="-95">95 B.C.</date>
, an eminent jurist and Cicero's preceptor  Cf. Lael. I.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Manilio</lemma>: M'. Manilius, consul in <date value="-149">149 B.C.</date>
; an authority upon civil law often mentioned with Scaevola.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">placebat</lemma>: like <foreign lang="la">censeo</foreign> a technical legal word.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">sagis non abundares</lemma>: inasmuch as Trebatius is not well supplied with heavy garments, and the weather is cold, his only protection lies in keeping a good fire; but the <foreign lang="la">sagum</foreign> was the typical garment of a soldier, as the <foreign lang="la">toga</foreign> was the main article in the dress of a civilian (thus <foreign lang="la">sagati</foreign>, Non. 11.202, M&uuml;ll., is opposed to <foreign lang="la">togati</foreign>), and to say that Trebatius was not well supplied with <foreign lang="la">saga</foreign> implied that he avoided the dangers of the campaign.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">calere</lemma>: used metaphorically of the 'warm work' which the insurrection of the Gauls under Ambiorix (Caes. <bibl n="Caes. Gal. 5.23">B. G. 5.23</bibl>-53) gave the Romans. See <ref target="intr.99" targOrder="U">Intr. 99</ref>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">cautior</lemma>, <gloss>more discreet</gloss>. <foreign lang="la">Cavere</foreign> as a legal term means, <gloss>to provide for a person</gloss>, as his counsel. Cicero suggests that Trebatius showed more discretion as a soldier, in keeping out of range, than he did as a lawyer.  The same pun occurs in another letter to Trebatius (<bibl n="Cic. Fam. 7.6.2">Fam. 7.6.2</bibl>) <foreign lang="la">tu, qui ceteris cavere didicisti, in Britannia ne ab essedariis decipiaris caveto</foreign>. One of the main sources of humor in Cicero's letters to Trebatius lies in the double meaning which he gives to judicial terms ,&mdash; a form of wit which would appeal forcibly to the legal mind of Trebatius; cf. <foreign lang="la">placebat</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">censeo</foreign> above and <foreign lang="la">respondere</foreign> in the foregoing letter. Cf. also Cic. <bibl n="Cic. Phil. 2.7">Philipp. 2.7</bibl> <foreign lang="la">quam multa ioca solent esse in epistulis quae, prolata si sint, inepta videantur!</foreign></p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">qui <gap/> volueris</lemma>: a humorous way of saying that Trebatius avoided the dangers and hardships of the British campaign by staying in Gaul. See <foreign lang="la">in Britanniam</foreign>, 1 n.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">studiosissimus homo natandi</lemma>: Trebatius's fondness for swimming Horace wittily uses for his own purposes in Sat. 2.1.8.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">spectare </lemma>: cf. <foreign lang="greek">tw=n *brettanw=n</foreign>, <ref target="ep.xxiv.1n" targOrder="U">Ep. XXIV.1n</ref>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">andabata</lemma>: Trebatius had been so fond of combats in Rome that his friends had not been able to keep him away, even from the shows where blindfolded warriors fought on horseback.  It is strange, therefore, that he feels so little interest in seeing similar contests in Britain.  The <foreign lang="la">essedarii</foreign> were especially dreaded by the Roman soldiers.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">defraudare</lemma>: a colloquial word, which, though common enough in Plautus and Terence, Cicero uses elsewhere perhaps only in a proverbial expression, <bibl n="Cic. Orat. 221">Or. 221</bibl>.</p></div2>
<div2 id="ep.xxv.3n" type="section" n="3">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">mercule</lemma>: this oath is found in Cicero's correspondence in the forms, <foreign lang="la">hercules</foreign>, <foreign lang="la">mehercules</foreign> (or <foreign lang="la">mercules</foreign>), and <foreign lang="la">mehercule</foreign> (or <foreign lang="la">mercule</foreign>).  Cicero himself writes (<bibl n="Cic. Orat. 157">Or. 157</bibl>) <foreign lang="la">mehercule libentius dixerim quam mehercules</foreign>, and the more polished letter-writers of this period seem to have agreed with him.</p>

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">advoles</lemma>: Lorenz, on  <bibl n="Pl. Ps. 1.5">Plaut.

Cf. <bibl n="Cic. Att. 1.14.5">Att. 1.14.5</bibl>; Ep. LXIX. 1 .</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">fratres nostri Aedui</lemma>: a thrust at the absurdity of bestowing such complimentary titles upon remote barbarians, whose 'brotherhood' did not keep them from frequent treachery and insubordination. The grant of the title is mentioned in Caes. <bibl n="Caes. Gal. 1.33">B. G. 1.33</bibl>. With the sentiment, cf. <bibl n="Cic.

This letter, therefore, is a guaranty, with a Greek coloring to it, to be sure, of my support.</gloss> <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Graeculam</lemma> is very obscure, but in the diminutive force the key to the explanation seems to lie.  Cf. <title>Tusc.

Flac. 23">Flacc. 23</bibl> <foreign lang="la">motus quidam temerarius Graeculae contionis</foreign>.  The assembly showed the instability so characteristic of the Greeks.  The congratulations for Pompey were marked by that extravagance or lack of dignity which one is accustomed to look for in the Greeks.  With this explanation of <foreign lang="la">Graeculam</foreign> the meaning is: <gloss>I send you therefore in this letter, lacking as it may seem in seriousness, because of its light tone of raillery, a promise of my support.</gloss></p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">ignavissimo cuique</lemma>: Cicero cannot mean, as many suppose, that he would like the evidence of aspectator concerning the Gallic war, <foreign lang="la">because Caesar's Commentaries were thought to put mat ters in too rose-colored a ltght</foreign>.

<p>After leaving Rome, about Mar., <date value="-51">51 B.C.</date>
  Cicero's request, embodied in this letter, that Appius  Claudius  Pulcher, his predecessor in the proconsulship of Cilicia, should turn over the province to him in as satisfactory a condition as possible, was far from being fulfilled; and Cicero found himself under the necessity of changing many of the corrupt and tyrannous practices of the late governor, &mdash; a course which brought upon him the enmity of Appius. Upon his return to Rome, Appius was charged with misgovernment by Dolabella, Cicero's son-in-law, but escaped punishment with the help of Pompey. For the limits of Cicero's province, cf. <ref target="intr.23" targOrder="U">Intr. 23</ref>. The possession of the title <foreign lang="la">proconsul</foreign> (procos.), carrying along with it the <foreign lang="la">imperium</foreign>, indicates that Cicero wrote this letter at some point outside of Rome. Appius received the title of <foreign lang="la">imperator</foreign> (imp.) from his troops, because of a successful campaign against the mountaineers of his province.</p>
<div2 id="ep.xxix.1n" type="section" n="1">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">contra voluntatem <gap/> et praeter opinionem</lemma>: Cicero had declined a province both at the close of his praetorship and of his consulship. The words <foreign lang="la">contra voluntatem</foreign> indicate that in declining Macedonia in favor of C. Antonius in <date value="-63">63 B.C.</date>
 he did not show so much self-abnegation as he would lead us elsewhere to infer. Cf. Ep. XXXIV. 13 <foreign lang="la">si quisquam</foreign>, etc. His assignment to a province in this case was one of the results of a law passed rather unexpectedly; cf. <ref target="intr.22" targOrder="U">Intr. 22</ref>.</p>

<div1 id="ep.xxx" type="letter" n="coll=A:book=5:letter=1"><head>Letter XXX:  ad Atticum 5.1</head>
<p>Minturnae, about May 7, <date value="-51">51 B.C.</date>
 Cicero apparently left Rome May 1, spent a day at his Tusculan villa with Philotimus, his business agent, and Atticus (3), and went thence to Minturnae by the way of Arpinum and Aquinum (3). He reached his destination, Laodicea in Phrygia, July 31 (<bibl n="Cic. Att. 5.15.1">Att. 5.15.1</bibl>). With 3-5 of this letter, cf. Ep. VI.1.</p>
<div2 id="ep.xxx.1n" type="section" n="1">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">ego vero</lemma>: these words imply that Cicero has in mind a remark in the letter of Atticus. Cf. <bibl n="Cic. Fam. 16.10.1">Fam. 16.10.1</bibl>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">ut <gap/> ne</lemma>: <foreign lang="la">ut ne</foreign> is frequent in Latin comedy in clauses both of result and of purpose, and the explanation would seem to be that originally <foreign lang="la">ne</foreign> had purely a negative force in the combination, e.g. <cit><quote lang="la">faciemus ut, quod viderit, ne viderit,</quote> <bibl n="Pl. Mil. 2.1">Plaut. M. G. 149</bibl></cit>;  <cit><quote lang="la">merito ut ne dicant, id est (mi in manu),</quote> <bibl n="Pl. Trin. 1.2">Plaut. Trin. 105</bibl></cit>. Colloquial language, being conservative of old usages, retained this archaism and others after they had disappeared from general use in formal language. The separation of <foreign lang="la">ut</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">ne</foreign> is remarkable, but finds parallels, especially in Latin comedy: cf. <foreign lang="la">ut quom opus sit ne in mora nobis siet</foreign>, <bibl n="Ter. Ad. 3.2">Ter. Ad. 354</bibl>, and  <bibl n="Pl. Mil. 2.1">Plaut. M. G. 149</bibl> (above); in fact, the use of <foreign lang="la">ut ne</foreign> instead of <foreign lang="la">ne</foreign> makes it possible to put <foreign lang="la">ne</foreign> in the middle or near the end of the sentence, and thus secure the desired emphasis upon the negation.  According to Seyffert-Millier (on <title>Laelius</title>, 305), <foreign lang="la">ut ne</foreign> frequently appears in the language of the laws where we should expect <foreign lang="la">ne</foreign>.  This coincidence between the legal and colloquial style is due to the conservatism of each form of speech, and is especially noticeable in the letter from the jurist Sulpicius (Ep. LXXV.).</p></div2>

<div1 id="ep.xxxi" type="letter" n="coll=F:book=8:letter=1"><head>Letter XXXI:  ad familiares 8.1</head>
<p>Rome, about May 24, <date value="-51">51 B.C.</date>
 M. Caelius Rufus was born about <date value="-85">85 B.C.</date>
, and came to Rome when fifteen or sixteen years of age to study law and politics. He sympathized with Catiline, but took no active part in the conspiracy.  In <date value="-52">52 B.C.</date>
 as tribune he vigorously supported the aristocratic cause, but in later life he went over to Caesar.  In <date value="-51">51 B.C.</date>
, when his letters to Cicero begin, Caelius was a candidate for the curule aedileship. In January, 49, he opposed the senate, and fled with Curio to Caesar's camp. Disappointed with the 'spoils' which fell to his share, he joined Milo in an uprising in southern Italy, and was put to death by Caesar's troops in <date value="-48">48 B.C.</date>
 In the social world his intimacy with Clodia (Ep. VIII.5) gave him great notoriety.  The wit and beauty of Caelius attracted this <quote lang="la">Palatine Medea,</quote> and the banquets and revels at Rome and Baiae, in which Caelius and Clodia were the central figures, were the talk of Rome. At last they quarrelled, and many of the difficulties in which Caelius was subsequently involved could be traced directly to her, in one of which, a charge of murder, Cicero delivered in his defense the Or. pro Caelio. It was natural that Cicero, when setting out for a distant province at so critical a moment, should choose in preference to all others a man so familiar with the ins and outs of politics and society, to keep him informed of the course of events at Rome. The letters of Bk. 8, ad Fam. are not only of great interest on account of their intrinsic literary and historical value, but they offer sufficient material upon which to base a comparison between the epistolary style of Cicero and that of one of his contemporaries.</p>
<div2 id="ep.xxxi.1n" type="section" n="1">

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">peregrinantibus gratum</lemma>: so eager for news were the Romans in the provinces that certain persons in Rome drove a thriving trade by sending them reports of the news of the day.  In <date value="-59">59 B.C.</date>
 their task was lightened by the law of Caesar requiring the doings in the senate and the courts and in the field, together with some events of a private character, to be published officially in the <foreign lang="la">Acta diurna</foreign>, which were copied and sent in great numbers to the provinces.

<div1 id="ep.xxxii" type="letter" n="coll=F:book=13:letter=1"><head>Letter XXXII:  ad familiares 13.1</head>
<p>Athens, between June 25 and July 6, <date value="-51">51 B.C.</date>
  Gaius Memmius was praetor in <date value="-58">58 B.C.</date>
, and in <date value="-57">57 B.C.</date>
 went out as governor of Bithynia, where the poets Catullus and Helvius Cinna were members of his staff (cf. <bibl n="Catul. 10">Cat. 10</bibl> and 28, and for a sketch of Memmius as an orator, Cic. <bibl n="Cic. ad Brut. 247">Brut. 247</bibl>.) He belonged at that time to the party of the Optimates, but later he became a democrat, and in <date value="-54">54 B.C.</date>
 was supported by Caesar for the consulship, but having made a disgraceful political bargain with the consuls of that year (<bibl n="Cic. Att. 4.15.7">Att. 4.15.7</bibl>), was banished.  At this time he was living in Athens, and having become the owner of the garden and of the ruins of the house which had belonged to Epicurus, he proposed to pull the house down in order to put up a dwelling of his own. The Epicureans, greatly distressed, applied to Cicero through Atticus to intercede with Memmius in their behalf.  Cicero, although not on the best of terms with Memmius, acceded to their request. Nothing is known of the result of his intercession. <milestone unit="para"/>As an example of Cicero's skill in handling a delicate subject, this letter may be compared with the one to Lucceius (Ep. XVI II.). The case was beset with difficulties. Memmius had been banished, unjustly as he thought, at the moment when he was suing for the consulship.  He was now passing a disappointed life in exile, and was so far estranged from Cicero that he had gone to Mytilene to avoid him. He had been annoyed by the importunity of the Epicureans, for whom at the best he had apparently great contempt, in spite of the fact that Lucretius had dedicated to him the <title>de Rerum Natura</title>, and his selfish nature brooked no interference with his plans. Finally, Patro, the leader of the Epicurean school, was personally distasteful to him. <milestone unit="para"/>Cicero's itinerary from Minturnae to Athens was as follows: Cumae, Beneventum, May 11; Venusia, May 14; Tarentum, May 18; Brundisium, May 22; Actium, June 14; Athens, June 25.  The longest stop on the way was a halt of three weeks at Brundisium.</p>

<p>Cilicia, close of <date value="-51">51 B.C.</date>
 or early part of <date value="-50">50 B.C.</date>
  Cicero, having Completed a successful Campaign against the independent mountaineers of  his province, wrote this letter to secure Cato's support to his request for a <foreign lang="la">supplicatio</foreign>. Understanding the blunt and frank nature of his correspondent, he affects a similar style, and presents the facts without comment, but with much skill in bringing his best achievements into the foreground, and in making it appear that the retreat of the Parthians was due to their dread of his prowess.  The letter presents a side of Cicero's life which is brought out nowhere else. It has also many points of resemblance to Caesar's Commentaries on the Gallic War. The first part of it is essentially a military report without embellishment, addressed, it is true, to Cato, but to all intents and purposes an 'open letter.'  So Caesar's Commentaries are a soldier's diary, intended for the eye of the Roman people.  In these two documents, therefore, a comparison may fairiy be made between the styles of the two men. Cicero's campaign is also described at some length in<bibl n="Cic. Att. 5.20">Att. 5.20</bibl>; <bibl n="Cic. Fam. 2.10">Fam. 2.10</bibl>; and in two letters to the senate, <bibl n="Cic. Fam. 15.1">Fam. 15.1</bibl> and 2. For Cato's reply to this letter, cf. Ep. XXXVII.</p>
<div2 id="ep.xxxiv.2n" type="section" n="2">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Laodiceae</lemma>: for Cicero's itinerary to Athens, cf. Epp. XXX, XXXII., introd. notes. He set out from the Piraeus July 6, reached Ceos July 8, Gyarus July 9, Syrus July 10, Delos July 11, Ephesus July 22, and, after a halt of 4 days in that city, Tralles July 27, and Laodicea July 31.  Cf. <bibl n="Cic. Att. 5.12.1">Att. 5.12.1</bibl>; 5.13.1; <bibl n="Cic. Fam. 3.5.1">Fam. 3.5.1</bibl>; <bibl n="Cic. Att. 5.15.1">Att. 5.15.1</bibl>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">acerbissimis tributis </lemma>: Cicero's letters from Cilicia show the nature of these demands; e.g. the towns in Cilicia, already hopelessly in debt, were required at great expense to send envoys to Rome to thank the senate for the beneficent government of the monster Appius (<bibl n="Cic. Fam. 3.8.2">Fam. 3.8.2</bibl> f). Caelius had the hardihood to ask Cicero to levy a tax upon the provincials to pay for the games which he was to give at Rome as a candidate for the aedileship  (Ep. XXXV. 21).</p>

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">apud Iconium</lemma>: <gloss>apud</gloss> with the acc. for the locative or <foreign lang="la">in</foreign> with the abl. is archaic; cf. e.g. <foreign lang="la">apud aedem Duelonai</foreign> in the <foreign lang="la">senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus</foreign>. The expression is here used as a set form of speech for a military report; cf. <foreign lang="la">apud Issum</foreign>, <bibl n="Cic. Fam. 2.10.3">Fam. 2.10.3</bibl>. It is also preserved with certain words in colloquial Latin. In this case, as in many others, colloquial Latin and official Latin preserved forms of expression after they had disappeared elsewhere, as colloquial and official (especially legal) English preserve certain otherwise obsolete phrases. Silver Latin, straining after novelties, brought this, as well as many other archaisms, into use again; cf. Nipperdey on <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 1.5">Tac. Ann. 1.5</bibl>; R&ouml;nsch, <title>Itala u.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">cuius salutem</lemma>, etc.: the disclosure in this letter of the relations which existed between Rome and Ariobarzanes, throws a sidelight upon the attitude which the Roman Republic assumed toward her provinces.

Att. 6.1.3">Att. 6.1.3</bibl>).  Knowing that the deposition of Ariobarzanes would mean the loss of their money, Pompey and Brutus secured a decree of the senate through the influence of Cato, the uncle of Brutus (<lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">te auctore</lemma>), to the effect that Cicero should maintain him upon his throne.</p>

Cf. also the first part of this section. A perusal of the letter, indeed, fails to reveal the fact that any one else than Cicero was acting against the Parthians. In reality the scene of the struggle lay entirely outside of Cicero's province.  The Parthians, emboldened by the defeat of Crassus, began just before this time to threaten Syria. The proquaestor C. Cassius checked their advance upon Antioch, defeated them in a pitched battle, and forced them to retreat in disorder.  In a similar vein Cicero writes to Atticus: <foreign lang="la">rumore adventus nostri et Cassio, qui Antiochia tentbatur, animus accessit et Parthis timor iniectus est.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">de statua Africani Metelli</lemma>: in his <title>de Re Pub.</title> Cicero had made Laelius lament the fact that no statue had been erected to the memory of Scipio Nasica Serapion (cf. Macr. Comment. 1.4). Q. Caecilius Metellus Scipio, a descendant of Nasica, called the attention of Atticus to what he considered Cicero's error, as he himself had set up a gilded equestrian statue in honor of his ancestor (cf. <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">quas <gap/> posuit</lemma>), to say nothing of the ancient statue of Serapion already standing near the temple of Ops.  But the statue standing near the temple of Ops has CENSOR inscribed upon it, and cannot therefore represent Serapion, who never held that office. Furthermore, the two ancient statues, standing ad Opis and ad <foreign lang="greek">*polukle/ous</foreign> Herculem, represent the same person, as a comparison of the two shows.  Now the statue <foreign lang="la">ad <gap/> Herculem</foreign> is a likeness of Africanus.  Therefore the other ancient statue (<lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">ad Opis</lemma>) must represent the same person, and consequently the reproduction which Metellus has had made, and upon whose base he has put the name of Serapion, is in reality a reproduction of an ancient likeness of Africanus.</p>

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">P. Vedio</lemma>: Vedius Pollio is said to have caused slaves who had offended him to be thrown to the lampreys in his fish-pond. His name became, like that of Lucullus, a synonym for extravagance; cf. <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 1.10">Tac. Ann. 1.10</bibl>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">nebulone</lemma>: a word of contempt for a worthless fellow.  In general in colloquial Latin personal nouns in <foreign lang="la">o</foreign> carry with them a contemptuous force, and indicate one who is proficient in a questionable accomplishment; thus <foreign lang="la">erro</foreign> (<gloss>a tramp</gloss>), <bibl n="Hor. S. 2.7.113">Hor. Sat. 2.7.113</bibl>; <foreign lang="la">popino</foreign> (<gloss>a glutton</gloss>), Sat. 2.7.39, etc.; and in the Letters, <foreign lang="la">combibo</foreign> (<gloss>a crony</gloss>), <bibl n="Cic. Fam. 9.25.2">Fam. 9.25.2</bibl>; <foreign lang="la">salaco</foreign> (<gloss>a braggart</gloss>), Ep. LXXXI. 2; <foreign lang="la">verbero</foreign> (<gloss>a rascal</gloss>), <bibl n="Cic. Att. 14.6.1">Att. 14.6.1</bibl>; <foreign lang="la">baro</foreign> (<gloss>a blockhead</gloss>), 5.11.6. Cf. also R. Fisch, in <title>Arch. f. lat. Lex.</title> V. 56-89, and W. Meyer, <title>ibid.</title> 223-234.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">cum duobus essedis</lemma>: the use of the <foreign lang="la">essedum</foreign> by people in private life was a mark of extreme affectation. Even in the case of an official it was very repugnant to Roman taste.  Cf. Cicero's account of Antony's official progress: <foreign lang="la">vehebatur in essedo tribunus plebis; lictores laureati antecedebant</foreign>, etc., <bibl n="Cic. Phil. 2.58">Phil. 2.58</bibl>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">raeda</lemma>: a light four-wheeled travelling wagon,such as Horace used during one stage of his journey to Brundisium; cf. Sat. 1.5.86.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">legem</lemma>: reference is made to some sumptuary law, the provisions of which we do not know, imposing a tax either upon <foreign lang="la">familiae</foreign> or the equipages of travellers. The <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">cynocephalus</lemma> and <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">onagri</lemma> had no other value than that they were rare and therefore expensive.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">ad Magnum Pompeium</lemma>: the cognomen, which is the distinguishing part of this name, when compared with <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Pompeium Vindullum</lemma>, is put first for the sake of emphasis. Vindullus had died intestate and without an heir, so that his property seemed likely to come to his patron Pompey.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">in his</lemma>, etc.: as Vedius was a noted rake, the incident occasioned much gossip, but, strange to say, Brutus kept up his friendly relations with Vedius (<lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">qui hoc utatur</lemma>), and Lepidus treated the affair with indifference.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">sumus belle curiosi</lemma>, <gloss>we are both awfully fond of gossip</gloss>. The statement is emphasized by the position of sumus. On <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">belle</lemma>, cf. <ref target="ep.xxiv.2n" targOrder="U">Ep. XXIV.2n</ref>. 26.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">pro/pulon</lemma>: an inscription found at Eleusis in 1860, and quoted by Boot, throws light upon this passage: <foreign lang="la">AP: CLAVDIVS: AP: F: PVLCHER: PROPYLVM: CERERI: ET: PROSERPINAE: COS: VOVIT:  IMPERATOR : COEPIT : PVLCHER : CLAVDIVS : ET : REX : MARCIVS : FECERVNT</foreign> (<title>C.L.L.</title>. 1.1 619).</p>

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Academiae</lemma>: sc. <foreign lang="greek">pro/pulon</foreign>.</p>

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">monumentum</lemma>: i.e. something to commemorate himself in connection with Athens, although he cannot endure the thought of having his name attached to some one of the famous statues of other men in Athens, a practice which some Romans had followed.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">mysteria </lemma>: the festival of the <foreign lang="la">Bona Dea</foreign>, which occurred in May. The mention of <foreign lang="la">Bona dea</foreign> brings up to Cicero's mind the celebrated sacrilege of Clodius (cf. Ep. V.), with its long train of disasters for him, and leads him to date his letter from the day of Clodius's murder by Milo.  To this event Cicero jestingly gives the name of <foreign lang="la">pugna Leuctrica</foreign>, for, as Greece had been freed from the tyranny of the Spartans by the battle of Leuctra, so Rome was relieved of the domination of its tyrant Clodius by the street-fight in which he fell.  Cf. <bibl n="Cic. Att. 5.13.1">Att. 5.13.1</bibl> <foreign lang="la">Ephesum venimus a. d. XI Kal. Sext. sexagesimo et quingentesimo post pugnam Bovillanam</foreign> (Clodius was killed at Bovillae).  Clodius was murdered Jan. 18, <date value="-52">52 B.C.</date>

<div1 id="ep.xxxvii" type="letter" n="coll=F:book=15:letter=15"><head>Letter XXXVII:  ad familiares 15.15</head>
<p>Rome, the end of April or the early part of May, <date value="-50">50 B.C.</date>
  This is Cato's reply to Ep. XXXIV.  It is interesting as the only thing we have from his pen.  The blunt manner, the brevity of the letter, and the rigidity of its style not only seem characteristic of the writer, but make the letter an excellent foil to the epistle of Cicero, which is remarkably guarded in referring to the matter at issue, is circumstantial in its statements, and varied in its style. The <foreign lang="la">supplicatio</foreign> was decreed by the senate, but Cato voted against it. For Cicero's opinion of Cato's course, cf. <bibl n="Cic. Att. 7.2">Att. 7.2</bibl>. 7 <foreign lang="la">qui (i.e. Cato) quidem in me turpiter fuit malevolus: dedit integritatis iustitiae clementiae fidei mihi testimonium, quod non quaerebam; quod postulabam, id negavit</foreign>.</p>
<div2 id="ep.xxxvii.1n" type="section" n="1">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">quod <gap/> me <gap/> hortatur</lemma>: the use of two accusatives is very common in archaic Latin after verbs of <hi>seeking</hi>, <hi>warning</hi>, etc., especially when one of the accusatives is a neuter pronoun (cf. e.g. <bibl n="Ter. An. 5.4">Ter. And. 918</bibl>; Heaut. 353); and this construction, which is perhaps a colloquial survival in the prose of the Ciceronian period (cf. Reisig-Schmalz, <title>Lat. Syn.</title> note 562), is frequent in the Letters; cf. <foreign lang="la">multa deos venerati sunt</foreign>, <bibl n="Cic. Fam. 6.7.2">Fam. 6.7.2</bibl>;  <foreign lang="la">illud te peto</foreign>, Ep. LII. 2.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">virtutem <gap/> administrari </lemma>: this would be a very harsh expression for Cicero, but is perhaps not to be changed in a letter fromfato.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">togati</lemma>: in agreement with the genitive implied in <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">tuam</lemma>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">ut innocentia</lemma>, etc.: in his summary of Cicero's achievements, Cato bluntly disregards his claim that he has barred the progress of the Parthians and driven them back (cf. Ep. XXXIV. 7), and in fact practically ignores his military exploits in general.  <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">innocentia</lemma> refers to abstinence from corrupt use of power for personal gain.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Ariobarzanis</lemma>: cf. Ep. XXXIV. 6.</p>

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">referre acceptum</lemma>: a business expression, meaning, <gloss>to set down to one's credit.</gloss></p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">praerogativam</lemma>: the vote of the first century in the comitia, the <foreign lang="la">centuria praerogativa</foreign>, was a pretty sure indication of the result of the entire election, so that <foreign lang="la">praerogativa</foreign> means often, as here, <gloss>sure indication.</gloss></p>

<p>Near Rome, Jan. 12, <date value="-49">49 B.C.</date>
  Cicero reached Rome, after his absence in Cilicia, Jan. 4, <date value="-49">49 B.C.</date>
 (cf. 2), but, being anxious to obtain a triumph, remained without the city.  This enabled him to avoid participating in the exciting debates which took place in the senate Jan. 1-2 and 5-6, and left him free to negotiate for peace between Caesar and Pompey.  On Jan. 1 Curio, Caesar's representative, laid before the senate a proposition to the effect that Caesar should be allowed to sue for the consulship while absent from the city, in accordance with the special law passed in <date value="-52">52 B.C.</date>
 granting him that privilege (cf. <ref target="intr.26" targOrder="U">Intr. 26</ref>), or if it should be considered necessary for him to give up his army and provinces, that Pompey should be required to do the same. Although this document was read in the senate, the consuls refused to allow a vote upon it, and after fiery speeches by Lentulus, Scipio, and others, it was voted <foreign lang="la">uti ante certam diem</foreign> (July 1, 49) <foreign lang="la">Caesar exercitum dimittat; si non faciat, eum adversus rem publicam facturum videri</foreign> (<bibl n="Caes. Civ. 1.2">Caes. B. C. 1.2</bibl>). After consultations with Pompey, whose <foreign lang="la">imperium</foreign>, as he was still governor of Spain, did not allow him to enter the city, on Jan. 7 the senate passed the <foreign lang="la">senatus consultum ultimum</foreign>: <foreign lang="la">dent operam consules praetores tribuni plebis quique pro consulibus sint ad urbem, ne quid res publica detrimenti capiat</foreign> (<bibl n="Caes. Civ. 1.5">Caes. B. C. 1.5</bibl>).</p>

<div2 id="ep.xlii.1n" type="section" n="1">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">doleo <gap/> valere</lemma>: that while the course of political events was of such absorbing interest at Rome, Cicero's thoughts are first directed towards Tiro and Tiro's illness, affords a striking proof of his affection for his faithful freedman.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">quartanam</lemma>: the appearance of the <foreign lang="la">febris quartana</foreign> indicated convalescence.  Cf. Juv. 4.57 <foreign lang="la">quartanam sperantibus aegris</foreign>.</p>

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">obviam mihi</lemma>: cf. Cicero's account of his reception on returning from exile in Ep. XV. 5.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">mederi</lemma>: Cicero's absence from Italy while civil war was brewing, his absence from the senate during the stormy debates of the first week in January, as well as his well-known opportunism in politics, and his friendly relations with both Caesar and Pompey, seemed to make him the natural mediator between the opposing factions. That he hoped to effect a compromise is clear from many remarks in the Letters (cf., e.g., Ep. LXV. 5).  What many condemn as cowardice in his course during the Civil War finds at least partial justification in his desire to keep a neutral attitude, which would enable him to negotiate a peace.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">ex utraque parte </lemma>: among others Cicero is thinking of the Pompeians Scipio and Lentulus, and the Caesarians Antony and Cassius; cf. <bibl n="Caes. Civ. 1.1">Caes. B. C. 1.1</bibl>-4, and see Ep. LXV. 6 <foreign lang="la">victa est</foreign>, etc.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">minacis <gap/> litteras </lemma>: the letter read by Curio in the senate Jan. 1 (see introd. note). Caesar (<bibl n="Caes. Civ. 1.5">B. C. 1.5</bibl>) characterizes the propositions contained in his letter as <foreign lang="la">lenissima postulata</foreign>. Cicero's characterization of the letter would seem to be justified, however, by Caesar's own statement of his purpose in <bibl n="Caes. Civ. 1.22">B. C. 1.22</bibl> <foreign lang="la">ut se et populum Romanum factione paucorum oppressum in libertatem vindicaret</foreign>. See also Dio Cass. 41.1.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">provinciam</lemma>: Caesar was proconsul of Gallia Cisalpina, Illyricum, and Gallia Narbonensis.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Curio meus</lemma>: cf. <ref target="ep.vii.3n" targOrder="U">Ep. VII.3n</ref>.  He advised Caesar to advance upon Rome at once, without waiting to offer a compromise.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">nulla vi expulsi</lemma>: Antonius and Q. Cassius, two of the tribunes, vetoed the <foreign lang="la">senatus consultum ultimum</foreign> (cf. introd. note), and although such action was strictly within the limits of their power, serious threats were made against them in the senate. Cf. <bibl n="Caes. Civ. 1.2">Caes. B. C. 1.2</bibl> <foreign lang="la">refertur confestim de intercessione tribunorum. Dicuntur sententiae graves: ut quisque acerbissime crudelissimeque dixit, ita maxime ab inimicis Caesaris collaudatur</foreign>, and according to Dio Cassius 41.3 the consul Lentulus went so far as to summon them <foreign lang="greek">u(pecelqei=n pri\n ta\s yh/fous dienexqh=nai</foreign>. The principle that the tribune could not be held responsible for his official acts seems to have been first called into question in the year <date value="-98">98 B.C.</date>
, in the case of C. Furius, who had been tribune in the preceding year, and similar prosecutions occurred in the years <date value="-94">94 B.C.</date>

, <date value="-74">74 B.C.</date>

, and <date value="-65">65 B.C.</date>
 (cf. <bibl>Herzog, 1.1167 ff.</bibl>; Madvig, <title>Verf. u. Verw.</title> 1.467). The case before us would seem to have been the first instance when an attempt was made to hold a tribune accountable during his term of office.  As Caesar puts it, <foreign lang="la">de sua salute septimo die</foreign> (of the calendar year) <foreign lang="la">cogitare coguntur</foreign>, <bibl n="Caes. Civ. 1.5">B. C. 1.5</bibl>.  Cf. also Appian, Bell. Civ. 2.33. Cicero's words, therefore, <foreign lang="la">nulla vi expulsi</foreign>, while technically true, misrepresent the real state of the case.  It was this infringement of the rights of the tribune which Caesar urged in justification of his advance upon Rome.</p>

<p>Luceria, Feb.17, <date value="-49">49 B.C.</date>
 Caesar crossed the boundary of his province Jan. 10, <date value="-49">49 B.C.</date>
 (Nov. 22, <date value="-50">50 B.C.</date>
, according to the Julian calendar), with a force of five cohorts, which had increased to 40,000 men by Feb.14, when he arrived before Corfinium. In this town and its vicinity there were thirty-one cohorts (cf. <bibl n="Cic. Att. 8.12">Att. 8.12</bibl>A. 1), mainly under the command of L. Domitius Ahenobarbus (cf. Ep. 1.3 n.), designated as Caesar's successor in Transalpine Gaul. Confidently expecting the arrival of Pompey, to whom he had sent letters describing his imminent danger, Domitius had neglected all preparations for defense. This letter from Pompey, declining to come to his relief, decided the fate of the town, which was delivered over to Caesar after a siege of seven days.  Thus the last obstacle in the way of Caesar's advance into southern Italy was removed.  The intense interest with which the Pompeians watched the course of events at Corfinium indicates the supreme importance which they attached to that struggle, and makes this letter one of the most important documents relating to the Civil War. <foreign lang="la">Di immortales, qui me horror perfudit! quam sum sollicitus quidnam futurum sit</foreign>, writes Cicero (<bibl n="Cic. Att. 8.6.3">Att. 8.6.3</bibl>), upon hearing that Corfinium was besieged by Caesar.  For the details of the siege, cf. <bibl n="Caes. Civ. 1.19">Caes. B. C. 1.19</bibl> ff.</p>
<div2 id="ep.xliv.1n" type="section" n="1">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">implicet</lemma>: the letters of Pompey contain, as we might expect, many technical military words and expressions.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">optimorum civium</lemma>: the troops at Corfinium were made up of recruits from the Alban, Marsian, and Paelignian territory, and represented the most reliable force in Pompey's Italian army.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">his legionibus</lemma>: in <date value="-50">50 B.C.</date>
 the senate required Pompey and Caesar to furnish one legion each for use in the Parthian war. Caesar obeyed, and Pompey complied by demanding of Caesar a legion which he had previously lent him. Both legions were drawn, therefore, from Caesar's army. They were not used in the Parthian war, but were stationed in Italy. Before their departure from Caesar's camp they had received the gifts of money which soldiers received in case of a triumph. This fact, coupled with their admiration for their former commander, made their devotion to the Pompeian cause  doubtful.</p>

 Cicero had received a letter from Pompey (<bibl n="Cic. Att. 8.11">Att. 8.11</bibl> A) directing him to proceed to Luceria at once and join the other Pompeians. He accordingly left Formiae on Feb. 17 (cf. <bibl n="Cic. Att. 8.11">Att. 8.11</bibl>D. 1 ) and advanced to Cales, from which place this letter was written, apparently in the night of Feb. 18.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">nulla causa</lemma>: Cicero recognized now the fact that the plans of Pompey were as selfish as those of Caesar; cf. <bibl n="Cic.

The perfect infinitive passive, usually as here without <foreign lang="la">esse</foreign>, after verbs of wishing (especially after <foreign lang="la">volo</foreign>) is commoner in Cicero, in whose writings it occurs at least 26 times (cf. Ziemer, <title>Junggrammat. Streifz&uuml;ge</title>, pp.76 ff.), than in any other author.  It indicates the impatience with which the realization of a wish is awaited.</p>

Individuals of the most broken reputation, notorious personages like Quintus Hortensius, Gaius Curio, Marcus Antonius -- the latter the stepson of the Catilinarian Lentulus, who was executed by the orders of Cicero--were the most prominent actors in it; the highest posts of trust were bestowed on men who had long ceased even to reckon up their debts.</quote> Cf. also <bibl n="Cic.

 The phrase <foreign lang="la">essem in itinere</foreign> indicates that this letter was written while Caesar was hastening to Brundisium to intercept Pompey if possible, before he should escape from Italy. Caesar reached Brundisium Mar. 9 (<bibl n="Cic. Att. 9.13">Att. 9.13</bibl> A.1). Cicero sent this letter to Atticus with one of his own (cf. <bibl n="Cic. Att. 9.6.6">Att. 9.6.6</bibl>).

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">praeterire</lemma>: Cicero was still at Formiae.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">tuo consilio <gap/> ope</lemma>: Caesar made strenuous efforts to induce Cicero to return to Rome and lend him the benefit of his influence, and Cicero kept up a correspondence with him in the hope of terminating the Civil War.  Three weeks later a conference took place between them (cf. <ref target="intr.29" targOrder="U">Intr. 29</ref> f.) which led Cicero to give up all hope of a peaceful settlement of the difficulty.  Cf. <foreign lang="la">consilio</foreign>, Ep. XLIX.1n. The proposal which Caesar made in this letter was left unanswered, since Cicero was at this moment waiting for some decisive news from Brundisium (cf. <bibl n="Cic. Att. 9.7.5">Att. 9.7.5</bibl>), and also distrusted Caesar's purposes; cf. <bibl n="Cic.

, of the old calendar, but as the time of year was really late autumn, the season was not in itself unfavorable to military operations; but his troops had been obliged to make a difficult passage over the Apennines.

Cicero allows such compounds, when not applied to physical matters, only in his more informal writings (cf. <foreign lang="la">discrucio</foreign>, <bibl n="Cic. Att. 14.6.1">Att. 14.6.1</bibl>;  <foreign lang="la">dilaudo</foreign>, Att.4.17.5),but in Latin comedy a considerable list of them is found, &mdash; <foreign lang="la">discaveo</foreign>, <foreign lang="la">discrucio</foreign>, <foreign lang="la">discupio</foreign>, <foreign lang="la">disperdo</foreign>, <foreign lang="la">dispereo</foreign>, <foreign lang="la">dispudet</foreign>, <foreign lang="la">distaedet</foreign>.</p>

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">ad Alpis versus</lemma>: the combination <foreign lang="la">ad <gap/> versus</foreign> occurs in Caesar, Sallust, and Livy, but not in Cicero.  <foreign lang="la">Versus</foreign> is to be taken adverbially with the preposition.  It emphasizes the direction.</p>

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Psacade natus</lemma>: i.e. Bellienus. <foreign lang="la">Psacas</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">*yaka/s</foreign>) means a <gloss>crumb</gloss>, <gloss>morsel</gloss>, or anything insignificant.   <foreign lang="la">Psacade natus</foreign> would therefore mean <gloss>the son of a nobody</gloss>, and is coined by Caelius to offset <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Venere prognatus</lemma>. He wishes that Caesar had shown as much sternness in putting Domitius Ahenobarbus to death after the capture of Corfinium as Bellienus had shown in the case of the other Domitius.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">f. s. d.</lemma>: for <foreign lang="la">filio salutem dices</foreign>; cf. <foreign lang="la">nos diliges</foreign>, Ep. XVIII. (end) n. and <ref target="intr.62" targOrder="U">Intr. 62</ref>. The admiration which Caelius felt for Caesar, and his enthusiasm for the latter's brilliant campaign, give to the letter an extravagant and unconventional tone, which naturally finds expression in the use of colloquial and archaic words and phrases.

The style of the letter confirms the judgment of Tacitus in regard to Caelius (Dial. 21): <foreign lang="la">Sordes autem illae verborum et hians compositio et inconditi sensus redolent antiquitatem, nec quemquam adeo antiquarium puta ut Caelium ex ea parte laudet qua antiquus est</foreign>.

<p>Formiae, March 19 (or 20), <date value="-49">49 B.C.</date>
 Cicero's reply to Ep. XLVII. A copy of it was forwarded to Atticus with <bibl n="Cic. Att. 9.11">Att. 9.11</bibl> (cf. <bibl n="Cic. Att. 9.11">Att. 9.11</bibl>, end). Cicero still cherishes the hope that he may be able to effect a reconciliation between Caesar and Pompey, and with that object in view, and perhaps also to present himself in a favorable light before Caesar, he emphasizes the neutrality of his course thus far, and condemns the radical steps taken by the Pompeians. Caesar's definite request that Cicero should come to Rome and assist him in restoring public order is not answered categorically.  This letter was published, and called forth some unfavorable criticism. For Cicero's own interpretation of certain parts of it, cf. <bibl n="Cic. Att. 8.9.1">Att. 8.9.1</bibl>f.</p>

 Cicero went to meet Caesar on his arrival at Tarentum, Sept. 24, and received permission to remain in Italy.  He accordingly set out two days later for his Tusculan villa, and wrote this letter on his way thither.  It is the last one extant to Terentia and makes an appropriate climax to the series of cold, formal letters which Cicero wrote to her during the course of this year. At the moment of meeting his wife after an absence of more than two years, he merely gives certain instructions in regard to the arrangement of the house, in a tone almost brutal, and quite at variance with the extreme politeness shown everywhere else, even in writing to his enemies. They were divorced a few months later.

<p>Rome, close of <date value="-47">47 B.C.</date>
 or early part of 46.  M. Terentius Varro is a fine type of the old Roman character, and one of the most picturesque figures in the later years of the republic. While better known to us for his literary work, he was by no means without ability in politics and the art of war. He espoused the cause of the senate in the Civil War, and was sent to Spain as Pompey's legate. After the defeat of Afranius and Petreius he was compelled to leave Spain, but Caesar pardoned him, and chose him to take charge of the library which he intended to found.  Having incurred the enmity of Antony, he was put on the list of the proscribed, but rescued by a friend. He died in <date value="-27">27 B.C.</date>
, in his 90th year.  He was a most fruitful writer of both prose and poetry, leaving behind him 74 works, containing some 620 books, dealing with almost all the departments of human knowledge,--with literature,  history,  jurisprudence, grammar, philosophy, geography, and agriculture. Cf. <bibl n="Quint. 10.1.95">Quint. 10.1.95</bibl>.

 L. Papirius Paetus, to whom are addressed <bibl n="Cic. Fam. 9.15">Fam. 9.15</bibl>-26, was a friend of long standing.  We first hear of him through a collection of books which he presented to Cicero in <date value="-60">60 B.C.</date>
 (<bibl n="Cic. Att. 1.20.7">Att. 1.20.7</bibl>; 2.1.12).  Like Atticus, he was an Epicurean and held himself aloof from politics. The large fortune which he had inherited made it unnecessary for him to engage in business, and he was able to give himself up to the pleasures of a literary and social life. Cicero's letters to him testify to their intimate relations, and offer the best commentary upon his character and tastes. No better specimens of the <foreign lang="la">sermo urbanus</foreign> and no better proof of Cicero's wit and brilliancy as a letter-writer can be found than in the letters to Paetus.</p>

Cicero's object in giving his time to these aspirants for oratorical honors seems to have been largely a desire to secure through them the friendship of Caesar, for he writes to Atticus two years later: <foreign lang="la">haud amo vel hos designatos<note anchored="yes">i.e. Hirtius and Pansa</note> qui etiam declamare me coigerunt, ut ne apud aquas quidem acquiescere liceret; sed hoc meae nimiae facilitatis; nam id erat quondam quasi necesse</foreign>, <bibl n="Cic.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">bona perdas</lemma>: as a partial relief to the debtor class, Caesar appointed arbitrators to estimate the value which certain property had before the Civil War began, and this property creditors were obliged to take at its estimated value; cf. <bibl n="Caes.

The sentence would then mean: <quote>there is <foreign lang="la">sal</foreign> (i.e. <quote>salt</quote> and <quote>material for jests</quote>) enough already, but few who are in the mood of jesting.</quote> With <foreign lang="la">sanorum</foreign> or <foreign lang="la">saniorum</foreign> (both gen. plur. neut.), which some editors read, the meaning would be nearly the same. If salis is used in a metaphorical sense, and without a double meanmg, Cicero must have in mind the statements made in 3 f. See Crit. Append.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">scurram velitem</lemma>: the <foreign lang="la">scurra</foreign> was the professional wit and diner-out, whose object in life was to secure a good dinner, and whose stock in trade was flattery, wit, and buffoonery, -- the character which has been immortalized by Terence in the person of Phormio, and by Plautus in Peniculus.  The <foreign lang="la">veles</foreign> was a skirmisher.  Therefore a <foreign lang="la">scurra veles</foreign> would be a wit who carried on a guerilla warfare, taking a shot at every one and everything about him.  The comparison is made more apt by the fact that in these very letters (e.g. Ep. LXI. 7) Cicero has been threatening to dine with Paetus whether he wishes him or not. The opportunity of the <foreign lang="la">scurra</foreign> at a dinner came with the <foreign lang="la">secunda mensa</foreign>, when the company gave itself up to conversation and jest, but the <foreign lang="la">mala</foreign> (apples), which were brought on at this point, lent themselves as ready missiles to be used against the jester. In a similar way, to the volley of wit which Cicero had aimed at Paetus in his letters Paetus replies with <foreign lang="la">mala</foreign> (raillery). Upon the military metaphor, cf. <foreign lang="la">quas ego</foreign>, etc., Ep. V. 1n.</p>

In this day's programme no mention is made of law practice or public business, although in earlier days Cicero has told us that he was compelled by press of business to forego even the siesta which all Romans were supposed to take at midday.

<p>Rome, Nov. 26 (Sept. 23 of the Julian calendar), <date value="-46">46 B.C.</date>
 Q. Ligarius was in <date value="-50">50 B.C.</date>
 legate in charge of the province of Africa. When in <date value="-49">49 B.C.</date>
 the Pompeian P. Attius Varus, who had formerly been propraetor of Africa, appeared in the province, Ligarius delivered it over to him, and assisted him later in maintaining his position against L. Aelius Tubero, who had been sent out by the senate as governor. After the battle of Thapsus, in which Ligarius took part against Caesar, he was captured by the Caesarians, and in <date value="-46">46 B.C.</date>
 was living in exile. The combined efforts of Cicero and the relatives of Ligarius had thus far failed to secure his recall. To prevent the success of the movement in his behalf, Q. Tubero, son of Aelius Tubero, brought a charge <foreign lang="la">de vi</foreign> against him.  In his defense Cicero delivered an oration (still extant), which made so deep an impression upon Caesar, who presided at the trial (cf. pro <bibl n="Cic. Lig. 37">Lig. 37</bibl>), that Ligarius was ultimately recalled. He joined later the conspiracy against Caesar, and was probably put to death under the Second Triumvirate.</p>

Cicero was about to visit Atticus, and had asked him to have a little fire for him in the morning.  This request Atticus makes the basis of a sally at his expense, upon which Cicero retorts; for, as he goes on to say, he had written to Atticus that he should spend with him the third day before the Kalends, but Atticus had forgotten the day, and thought Cicero was to be with him on the fifth day before the Kalends.</p>

Att. 12.9">Att. 12.9</bibl>-44), and receiving letters of condolence from Sulpicius, Dolabella, and others. Cf. also <ref target="intr.51" targOrder="U">Intr. 51</ref>, 53.</p>

<p>Athens, March, <date value="-45">45 B.C.</date>
 Servius Sulpicius Rufus, who was of about the same age as Cicero, was for a time his rival in oratory, but, soon recognizing his friend's matchless oratorical powers, he turned his attention to the study of jurisprudence, and was for many generations a leading authority in that subject.  His opinions are frequently quoted in the Digest.  In politics he was, like Cicero, a conservative and a lover of peace, and, as such, strove during his consulship in <date value="-51">51 B.C.</date>
 to avert the impending struggle between Caesar and Pompey.  When the other Pompeians left Rome at the outbreak of the Civil War, Sulpicius was prevented by illness from accompanying them, and, like Cicero, he hesitated long whether to maintain a neutral position or to join them.  A lively correspondence upon this point passed between the two in <date value="-49">49 B.C.</date>
 (cf. <bibl n="Cic. Fam. 4.1">Fam. 4.1</bibl>, 2).  In 46 he was made governor of Achaia by Caesar (cf. Ep. LXV. 10).  After the death of Caesar, in the struggle between Antony and D. Brutus, his sympathies were again upon the side of peace and compromise, and he was sent by the senate, in <date value="-43">43 B.C.</date>
, upon a peace embassy to Antony, who was laying siege to Mutina. While on his way thither he died.  Cicero's ninth Philippic is a eulogy on him.  This epistle, like the letters from Caesar, Lucceius, and Dolabella (<ref target="intr.53" targOrder="U">Intr. 53</ref>), was called forth by the death of Tullia, and is perhaps the most widely known of all the letters in the correspondence of Cicero.</p>

Such forms as <foreign lang="la">confieri</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">defieri</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">confici</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">defici</foreign> are found only in colloquial and archaic Latin.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">provincia</lemma>: i.e. Achaia. While the letter reveals the real sorrow of Sulpicius at Cicero's loss, he seeks to comfort his friend, not so much by assuring him of his sympathy, as by setting before him certain philosophical considerations. The training of Sulpicius as a lawyer and a jurist goes far to explain the peculiarities in his style and Latinity. The epistle will illustrate how closely allied legal, archaic, and colloquial Latin are; in fact, the expressions which have been noted as common in colloquial speech, are really legal archaisms as used by Sulpicius.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Pomponius</lemma>: i.e. Atticus.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">partis Antiochinas</lemma>: Cicero composed the <title>Academica</title> at first in two books, with Q.

When he learned from Atticus that Varro wished to have a work dedicated to him, he reconstructed the <title>Academica</title>, divided it into four books, and dedicated the whole work to Varro, making him a mouthpiece for the opinions of Antiochus of Ascalon. Cf. <bibl n="Cic. Att. 13.19.3">Att. 13.19.3</bibl>; <bibl n="Cic. Att. 13.12.3">Att. 13.12.3</bibl>; <bibl n="Cic. Att. 13.25.3">Att. 13.25.3</bibl>.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Cipius <gap/> dormio</lemma>: Cipius, as the story goes (cf. Festus), was in the habit of feigning sleep, but when on a certain occasion a slave attempted to steal one of his master's cups, Cipius started up, saying, <quote lang="la">non omnibus dormio</quote>.</p>

Contr. 7.4.7). The different tendencies in oratory which Cicero and Calvus represented led apparently to a correspondence between them (cf. Tac. Dial. 18).  As a poet, Calvus belonged to the <foreign lang="greek">new/teroi</foreign>, (<bibl n="Cic. Att. 7.2">Att. 7.2</bibl>. 1), and was an intimate friend of Catullus, the leading representative of that school.  He died about <date value="-47">47 B.C.</date>
; cf. <bibl n="Cic. Fam. 15.21.4">Fam. 15.21.4</bibl>.  Calvus had assailed Tigellius in a poem, the first verse of which, preserved by Porphyrio (<bibl n="Hor. S. 1.3.4">Hor.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Phameae</lemma>: cf. <ref target="ep.lxi.8n" targOrder="U">Ep. LXI.8n</ref>.

And. 475</bibl>) seems to be found with no other adj. than <foreign lang="la">bonus</foreign> in classical prose; cf. <bibl n="Cic. S. Rosc. 89">pro Rosc.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">unctorem</lemma>: the reference is obscure.  Manutius suggests <foreign lang="la">cantorem</foreign>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Sardos venalis</lemma>: the Sardinian slaves were weak and sickly because of the unhealthful climate of their native country.  Hence the proverb: '<foreign lang="la">Sardi venales; alius alio nequior</foreign>.'  Cf. Otto, <title>Sprichw&ouml;rter der R&ouml;mer</title>, 308.</p>

Att. 13.49">Att. 13.49</bibl> may be read with profit in connection with this letter. The influence of Tigellius with Caesar and Cicero's fear of Caesar's anger prevented Cicero from maintaining long the manly position which he assumes in this and the following letter, for about a month later he writes to Atticus: <foreign lang="la">miror te nihildum cum Tigellio; velut hoc ipsum quantum acceperit, prorsus aveo scire nec tamen flocci facio</foreign> (<bibl n="Cic.

<div2 id="ep.lxxxii.1n" type="section" n="1">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">quod <gap/> salva est</lemma>: apparently Gallus had destroyed Ep. LXXXI. after reading it, for fear that it might fall into the hands of Tigellius or of his friends. Cicero seems to assure Gallus, however, that he has preserved a copy.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">quod</lemma>, etc.: cf. <ref target="intr.91" targOrder="U">Intr. 91</ref> and <bibl n="Cic. Fam. 7.32">Fam. 7.32</bibl>, 33.</p>

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ge/lwta sarda/nion</lemma>: a bitter laugh of anger or secret triumph.  But perhaps we should read, with Ernesti, <foreign lang="greek">sardo/nion</foreign> was a poisonous plant of Sardinia, which caused death when eaten, and which so distorted the faces of those who ate it that they seemed to be laughing.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">manum de tabula</lemma>: sc. <foreign lang="la">tolle</foreign>. The schoolmaster (Caesar) has been away (in Spain), but suddenly returns, and those under him (like Cicero and Gallus) had better stop the pranks they have been playing in his absence, or they will suffer for it (cf. <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">in Catonium Catoninos</lemma>).  Cicero is probably thinking of a roomful of schoolboys, who, instead of giving their attention to the task set them, have aroused themselves during the master's absence by scribbling upon their <foreign lang="la">tabulae</foreign>. The master suddenly appears, and the order comes <foreign lang="la">manum de tabula</foreign> (<foreign lang="la">tollite</foreign>).  The scribbling which Cicero and Gallus have been guilty of during Caesar's absence, is in writing political biographies of Cato. Cf. <foreign lang="la">Catonem tuum</foreign>, <ref target="ep.lxxxi.2n" targOrder="U">Ep. LXXXI.2n</ref>.  Or the reference may be general: 'No more indiscretions.' Cf. Otto, <title>Sprichw&ouml;rter</title>, 210.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">citius quam putaramus</lemma>: Caesar arrived from Spain Sept., <date value="-45">45 B.C.</date>

The term <foreign lang="la">Catonium</foreign> for the lower world was, according to Schmidt (Briefw. p. 355), a current witticism in the last days of the Republic, originating in a mime of Laberius; cf. <bibl n="Gel. 16.7">Gel. 16.7</bibl>. 4.  Cf. also Hertz, <bibl n="Gel. 11.281">Gel. 11.281</bibl>.  It has a double meaning: as a comic derivative from Cato, it means <gloss>the abode of Cato</gloss>; as a hybrid formation from <foreign lang="greek">ka/tw</foreign> (cf. <ref target="intr.80" targOrder="U">Intr. 80</ref>), it means <gloss>the world below.</gloss>  On Catoninos, cf. <title>Archiv f. lat.

  This letter describes a visit which Caesar, accompanied by his bodyguard, made at Cicero's villa near Puteoli.</p>

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">tam gravem</lemma>: so formidable because he had been a political enemy. <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">mihi tam gravem</lemma> is to be taken parenthetically, and a contrast is intended between gravem and <foreign lang="greek">a)metame/lhton</foreign>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">fuit enim periucunde</lemma>: sc. Caesar. Cf. <ref target="intr.85" targOrder="U">Intr. 85</ref>.  Cicero addresses almost the same words to Caesar (<bibl n="Cic.

On the force of <foreign lang="la">per-</foreign>, cf. <ref target="intr.77" targOrder="U">Intr. 77</ref>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">sed</lemma>, <gloss>but</gloss> (to my tale). Breaking off his general comments upon the incident, he proceeds to describe it in detail.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">secundis Saturnalibus</lemma>: i.e. Dec. 18.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Philippum</lemma>: cf. Ep. LXXII. n.</p>

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">in balneum</lemma>: sc. <foreign lang="la">ivit</foreign>. This was doubtless at Cicero's villa.  With these words the account of the visit proper begins, and since no reference is made to Caesar's arrival or to his reception by Cicero, Boot suggests with probability that one or more lines have fallen out after <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">post h.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">de Mamurra</lemma>: Mamurra had been Caesar's <foreign lang="la">praefectus fabrum</foreign> in Gaul and Britain.  It is he against whom Catullus directs his fierce invectives, <bibl n="Catul. 29">Catul. 29</bibl> and <bibl n="Catul. 57">57</bibl>. The reference here is possibly to the death of Mamurra, but probably, as Manutius suggests, Cicero has in mind his conviction under the sumptuary laws; cf. also Riese on Catull. Car. 29.</p>

Emetics were regularly prescribed by physicians in order that patients might escape the effects  resulting  from  eating elaborate dinners. They were taken in the morning, after the bath or after the <foreign lang="la">cena</foreign>. The use of them was, however, by no means confined to men of a gluttonous disposition;  cf. <bibl n="Cic.

It is a significant fact that Caesar was  assassinated three months after the incident described in this letter.  The spectacle which Caesar presented when making a progress through Italy attended by a disorderly bodyguard of 2000 men, may well have crystallized the sentiment forming against him.

  With these words Cicero salutes L. Minucius Basilus, one of Caesar's murderers, on the day of the assassination and after its  occurrence. Basilus had been praetor in <date value="-45">45 B.C.</date>

<div1 id="ep.lxxxvi" type="letter" n="coll=F:book=11:letter=1"><head>Letter LXXXVI:  ad familiares 11.1</head>
<p>Rome, Mar. 17, <date value="-44">44 B.C.</date>
 The 17th and 18th of March were taken up with meetings of the senate (cf. <bibl n="Cic. Phil. 2.89">Phil. 2.89</bibl>). Mar. 19 was a holiday (<foreign lang="la">Quinquatrus</foreign>), on which a burial could not take place, so that the burning of Caesar's body and Antony's address in the Forum cannot have taken place before Mar. 20. On the other hand, seven days seem to have been the extreme interval allowed between death and burial amongst the Romans (cf. Herodian, 4.2.4, with note by Marquardt, Handbuch, VII. 348).  The burial must have taken place, therefore, on or before Mar. 22, i.e. Mar. 20-22 (Ruete, 16). As for the date of this letter, there is no mention in it of Caesar's burial, so that it was probably written before Mar. 21-22. In fact, the remarks in 6 make it highly probable that it was written on the morning of Mar. 17.  Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus had served under Caesar with distinction in the campaigns against the Veneti in <date value="-56">56 B.C.</date>
 (cf. <bibl n="Caes. Gal. 3.11">B. G. 3.11.5</bibl>), and against Vercingetorix in 52 (cf. <bibl n="Caes. Gal. 7.9">B. G. 7.9.1</bibl>). He followed Caesar in the Civil War (cf. <bibl n="Caes. Civ. 1.56">Caes. B. C. 1.56</bibl>-58 et passim), and later served  twice as  governor of Gallia Vlterior.  In spite of these favors from Caesar, he was one of the three most active and prominent leaders of the conspiracy (cf. <bibl n="Suet. Jul. 80">Suet. Jul. 80</bibl>; Vell. Paterc. 2.56), and induced Caesar to go to the <foreign lang="la">curia</foreign> on the Ides of March. Caesar had designated him as one of his second heirs and as governor of Gallia Cisalpina (cf. <ref target="intr.40" targOrder="U">Intr. 40</ref>).  M. Junius Brutus, who is addressed (cf. <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">Bruto suo</lemma>), had espoused the cause of Pompey in the Civil War (cf. <bibl>Att. 11.4.2</bibl>), but was subsequently pardoned by Caesar and made governor of Gallia Cisalina (cf. <ref target="ep.lxv.10n" targOrder="U">Ep. LXV.10n</ref>.). At the time of Caesar's assassination he was praetor.  C. Cassius Longinus (cf. Cassio), as proquaestor of Syria, while Cicero was governor of Cilicia, carried on a brilliant campaign against the Parthians (cf. <foreign lang="la">quo <gap/> recesstsse</foreign>, <ref target="ep.xxxiv.7n" targOrder="U">Ep. XXXIV.7n</ref>.). He supported Pompey in <date value="-49">49 B.C.</date>

<p>Pompeii, May 3, <date value="-44">44 B.C.</date>
  One of the many demagogues in Rome at this time, Herophilus or Amatius by name, who claimed to be descended from Gaius Marius, took advantage of the excitement to erect an altar to Caesar in the Forum, on the spot where Caesar's body had been burned. Although Herophilus was put to death as an instigator of riot, the altar which he had erected remained, and a column in Caesar's honor was soon after set up. Dolabella, Cicero's former son-ln-law, who was one of the consuls for 44, during the absence from Rome of his colleague Antony, had the altar and column destroyed, and those concerned in the movement put to death (cf. <bibl n="Cic. Att. 14.15.1">Att. 14.15.1</bibl>). It was this action on Dolabella's part which called forth this enthusiastic letter from Cicero. The extravagant tone of the letter has been condemned by many, but Cicero's real purpose was not so much to compliment Dolabella for the vigor of his action, although he appreciated that, as to attach him definitely to the cause of Brutus and Cassius. This hope of Cicero was short-lived. Dolabella's action had been merely a bid for a bribe from the Caesarians, and when this was forthcoming, he ceased to pose as a republican; cf. <ref target="intr.56" targOrder="U">Intr. 56</ref>.</p>

<p>Athens, July-Oct., <date value="-44">44 B.C.</date>
 On young Marcus, cf. <ref target="intr.54" targOrder="U">Intr. 54</ref>. The young man had been pursuing his studies at Athens for about a year and a half, but he was fonder of the pleasures of life than of study, and the reports which came to the father from Leonides (cf. <bibl n="Cic. Att. 14.16.3">Att. 14.16.3</bibl>; <bibl n="Cic. Att. 15.16">Att. 15.16</bibl> A.), under whose special care he had been put, were so unfavorable that Cicero had considered the advisability of going to Athens to investigate the matter. In view of this alarming possibility, the young man wrote this letter to Cicero's confidential secretary, Tiro. This and <bibl n="Cic. Fam. 16.25">Fam. 16.25</bibl> are the only letters extant from a rather large correspondence, known to  the ancients, of the young Marcus with his father and with Tiro. Most of the stylistic peculiarities of the letter may be classified under the following categories: (1) extravagance of statement; (2) the use of Greek words; (3) a tendency to use certain expressions otherwise rarely found outside the writings of the elder Cicero;  (4) colloquialisms. On <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">dulcissimo</lemma>, cf. <ref target="intr.88a" targOrder="U">Intr. 88a</ref>.</p>
<div2 id="ep.xc.1n" type="section" n="1">
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">post <gap/> sextum</lemma>: the distance from Rome to Athens could be covered in 21 days (cf. <ref target="intr.64" targOrder="U">Intr. 64</ref>) under favorable  circumstances. Possibly young Marcus had delayed in replying and wished to conceal that fact.  The archaic form <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">quadragensimum</lemma> is sufficiently supported by <foreign lang="la">tricensima</foreign> (<bibl n="Cic. Fam. 10.31.5">Fam. 10.31.5</bibl>) and <foreign lang="la">quadragensimo</foreign> (<bibl n="Cic. Fam. 10.33.5">Fam. 10.33.5</bibl>).  Cf. also <title>CIL.</title> 1.198.21 and 199.27. See also Crit.

The infin. after <foreign lang="la">non dubito</foreign> is not found in Cicero (cf., however, a scarcely parallel passage in Cic. <bibl n="Cic. Fin. 3.38">de Fin. 3.38</bibl>).  In all the cases cited the dependent verb precedes <foreign lang="la">non dubito</foreign>, and the writer in using the acc. and infin. has in mind a verb of thinking in general, and not the special phrase <foreign lang="la">non dubito</foreign>. When <foreign lang="la">non dubito</foreign> precedes, <foreign lang="la">quin</foreign> with the subj. is always used; cf. 7 of this letter. See also Schmalz, <title>Ueber d. Sprachgebrauch d.

<p>Tusculum, Aug. 23-30, <date value="-44">44 B.C.</date>
  C. Matius Calvena, to whom this is written, was probably a little younger than Cicero; cf. 2 n.; <ref target="ep.xcii.5n" targOrder="U">Ep. XCII.5n</ref>. In recognition of his accomplishments Cicero calls him <foreign lang="la">doctissimus</foreign> (Ep. XXVIII. 2 and this letter, 8). Later in life Matius wrote a book upon gastronomy (Columella, 12.4.2).  He belonged to that group of men who attached themselves closely to the fortunes of Caesar, but not, like many of his comrades, with the hope of personal gain.  He followed Caesar out of pure friendship and admiration.  When Caesar was killed, therefore, he found no common point of sympathy either with those who rejoiced in the death of a tyrant, as did Cicero, or with those who used Caesar's name to conjure with, as did Antony. His grief at Caesar's death and his superintendence  of the public games in his name called forth unfriendly criticism from Cicero. The sorrow of Matius upon hearing this fact was disclosed to Cicero by their common friend Trebatius (cf. Ep. XXI. introd. note), who had made the acquaintance of Matius nine years before in Gaul (cf. Ep. XXVIII. 2), and led to the writing of this letter.</p>

  In the correspondence of Cicero perhaps there is no letter written more strongly, more skilfully constructed, and better calculated to accomplish its purpose than Cicero's letter to Matius.  It is a work of art&mdash;but in that very fact lies its defect, and in that respect it is in contrast to the reply of Matius. The latter reveals that <quote lang="la">fides in amicitia,</quote> which the name of Matius always suggests, while the sincerity of his statements and the simplicity of his style make this one of the most admirable of the non-Ciceronian letters.  Upon Matius and this letter, cf. Schmalz in <title>Commentationes W&ouml;lffiinianae</title> (Lips. 1891), 269 ff.</p>

His efforts seemed to have accomplished their purpose, as the senate had just received a letter from Plancus (<bibl n="Cic. Fam. 10.8">Fam. 10.8</bibl>), avowing his fidelity. The letter before us was written upon the arrival of this document, and in response to a letter from Plancus (<bibl n="Cic.

 The course of events immediately after the defeat of Antony near Mutina was as follows (cf. Mendelssohn, 458, n. 3): on April 22 Antony retired from the vicinity of Mutina, and May 3 he and Ventidius Bassus (Ep. XCVII. 1) formed a junction at Vada Sabatia; on May 8 L. Antonius, with the cavalry and a few cohorts, reached Forum Iuli in Gallia Narbonensis, and on the 15th M. Antonius came to the same place.  As for D. Brutus, April 24 he left Mutina, and came April 25 to Regium, where he remained up to April 29. He reached Dertona May 5. Plancus was at Cularo, about 350 Roman miles from Mutina. After hearing of Antony's defeat, and getting a favorable reply to certain proposals which he had made to Lepidus, he crossed the Isara May 12, and sent his brother forward to intercept L. Antonius.</p>

 On May 29, Lepidus, forced by his soldiers, as he claimed in his letter to the senate (<bibl n="Cic. Fam. 10.35">Fam. 10.35</bibl>; cf. also <bibl n="Cic. Fam. 10.21.4">Fam. 10.21.4</bibl>), joined his forces with those of Antony at Pons Argenteus, and June 30 was declared an <foreign lang="la">hostis</foreign> by the senate (<bibl n="Cic. Fam. 12.10.1">Fam. 12.10.1</bibl>).  Plancus had not carried out the plan of campaign against Antony, which he had outlined in a previous letter (Ep. XCVIII.), but, after the union of the forces of Antony and Lepidus, recrossed the Isara to wait for D. Brutus, who probably joined him June 12 at Cularo. Octavius, who was slighted by the transfer of Pansa's troops to D. Brutus, pursued a policy of inaction. This is the last extant letter in Cicero's correspondence.

It is the epithet which Antony applied with special fondness to Caesar's assassins.  Cf. Cicero's words to Cassius (<bibl n="Cic. Fam. 12.3.1">Fam. 12.3.1</bibl>): <foreign lang="la">primum in statua quam posuit in rostris inscripsit <quote>parenti optime  merito</quote> ut non modo sicarii sed iam etiam parricidae iudicemini</foreign>.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">propius</lemma>, etc.: i.e. <gloss>that success was easier of accomplishment (lit., nearer) with Caesar's support than with that of the African army.</gloss> The phrase <lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">quod <gap/> attinet</lemma> seems very awkward, but is perhaps not objectionable enough to warrant a textual change in a letter from Plancus.  See Crit. Append.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">venire</lemma>: the present to indicate that he will arrive in the immediate future. This usage is found mainly with the first person, and with the infin. in the <foreign lang="la">orat. obl.</foreign> representing the first person (Andresen).</p>

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">quoad potui</lemma>: Plancus can scarcely have known the nineteen-year-old Octavius personally.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">illius et vestro iudicio</lemma>: Julius Caesar had in his will made Octavius his adopted son. <foreign lang="la">vestro</foreign> refers by anticipation to the action of the <foreign lang="la">comitia curiata</foreign> in confirming the adoption.

<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">necessaria </lemma>: Octavius and Antony were rival representatives of the Caesarian tradition and interests.  Both had felt the truth of that fact the year before at Rome, so that the destruction of Antony seemed necessary to the full success of Octavius.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">bimestris</lemma>: Octavius was actually elected consul <date>Aug. 19</date>, but Plancus could scarcely expect that he would be elected so soon, and, in general, is speaking sarcastically of the short-lived honor.  Manutius and O. E. Schmidt would, however, read <foreign lang="la">quinquemestris</foreign>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="la" targOrder="U">efflagitatione</lemma>: the centurion Cornelius, at the head of a deputation of the troops of Octavius, went to Rome to demand the consulship for their leader; cf. <bibl n="Suet. Aug. 26">Suet. Aug. 26</bibl>.</p>
