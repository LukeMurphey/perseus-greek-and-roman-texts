            <head>The Argument</head>
            <p>Caius Quinctius and Sextus Naevius, one of the public criers, had been partners,
              having their chief business in Gallia Narbonensis&mdash;Caius died, and left his
              brother Publius his heir, between whom and Naevius there arose disputes concerning the
              division of the property of the partnership. Caius had left some debts, and Publius
              proposed to sell some lands which his brother had acquired as private property near
                <placeName key="tgn,7008368">Narbonne</placeName>, for the purpose of liquidating
              them. Naevius interposed difficulties in the way of his doing so, and by various
              artifices tried to make it appear that Quinctius had forfeited his recognizances;
              which would have given a different complexion to the whole case, as to forfeit one's
              recognizances was a crime liable to the punishment of <foreign lang="la"
                >infamia</foreign> at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. Cicero
              undertook the defence of Quinctius at the request of Roscius the
              actor&mdash;Naevius's cause was conducted by Hortensius, the greatest advocate at
                <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. It is doubtful whether this really
              was the first cause in which Cicero was engaged, as many think that he himself speaks
              in this oration of having been concerned in other trials previously, and that the
              speech for Sextus Roscius was his first. Quinctius gained the verdict. </p>

          <p>The two things which have the greatest influence in a state,&mdash;namely, the
            greatest interest, and eloquence, are both making against us at the present moment; and
            while I am awed <note anchored="yes">The Latin is <foreign lang="la">quorum alteram
                  <emph>vereor</emph>, alteram <emph>metuo</emph></foreign>, <foreign lang="la"
                >vereor</foreign> expressing a slighter degree of alarm than <foreign lang="la"
                >metuo</foreign> or <foreign lang="la">timeo</foreign>, and also one arising rather
              from the character and dignity of the adversary, than from any apprehension of
              consequences to oneself.</note> by the one, O Caius Aquillius, I am in fear of the
            other:&mdash;I am somewhat awed, apprehending that the eloquence of Quinctius
            Hortensius may embarrass me in speaking; but I am in no slight fear lest the interest of
            Sextus Naevius may injure Publius Quinctius. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>And yet it
            would not seem so disastrous for us that these things should exist in the highest degree
            in the other party, if they existed also to a moderate extent in us; but the fact is,
            that I, who have neither sufficient experience nor much ability, am brought into
            comparison with a most eloquent advocate; and that Publius Quinctius, who has but small
            influence, no riches, and few friends, is contending with a most influential adversary.
              <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> And, moreover, we have this additional disadvantage,
            that Marcus Junius, who has several times pleaded this cause before you, O Aquillius, a
            man practised in the conduct of other causes also, and much and frequently concerned in
            this particular one, is at this moment absent, being engaged on his new commission;
              <note anchored="yes">It is not known what this <foreign lang="la">legatio</foreign>
              was.</note> and so they have had recourse to me, who, even if I had all other
            requisite qualifications in ever so high a degree, have certainly scarcely had time
            enough to be able to understand so important a business, having so many points of
            dispute involved in it <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>so that also, which has been
            used to be an assistance to me in other causes, is wanting to me in this one; for in
            proportion to my want of ability, have I endeavoured to make amends for that want by
            industry, and unless time and space be given to one, it cannot be seen how great his
            industry is. But the greater our disadvantages, O Caius Aquillius, are, with so much the
            more favourable a disposition ought you, and those who are your colleagues in this
            trial, to listen to our words, that the truth, though weakened by many disadvantages,
            may be at last reestablished by the equity of such men as you. <milestone n="5"
              unit="section"/> But if you, being the judge, shall appear to be no protection to a
            desolate and helpless condition against power and influence; if before this tribunal the
            cause is found to depend on interest, not on truth; then indeed there is nothing any
            longer holy and uncontaminated in the state&mdash;no hope that the firmness and
            virtue of the judge may counterbalance the lowly condition of any one. But undoubtedly
            before you and your colleagues truth will prevail, or else, if it be driven from this
            place by power and influence, it will not be able to find any place where it can stand.
              <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/></p>
          <p>I do not say this, O Caius Aquillius, because I have any doubt of your own good faith
            and constancy, or because Publius Quinctius ought not to have the greatest hopes from
            those whom you have called in as your assessors, being, as they are, among the most
            eminent <note anchored="yes">Their names were Lucius Lucilius, Publius Quintilius, and
              Marcus Marcellus; &ldquo;The <foreign lang="la">judex</foreign> was generally
              aided by advisers learned in the law, (<foreign lang="la">jurisconsulti</foreign>,)
              who were said <foreign lang="la">in concilio adesse</foreign>, but the <foreign
                lang="la">judex</foreign> alone was empowered to give judgment.&rdquo; Smith,
              Dict. Ant. v. <foreign lang="la">Judex</foreign>.</note> men in the state. <milestone
              n="6" unit="section"/> What then? In the first place, the magnitude of the danger
            causes a man the greatest fear, because he is staking all his fortunes on one trial; and
            while he is thinking of this, the recollection of your power does not occur to his mind
            less frequently than that of your justice; because all men whose lives are in another's
            hand more frequently think of what he, in whose power and under whose dominion they are,
            can do, than of what he ought to do,&mdash;<milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
            Secondly, Publius Quinctius has for his adversary, in name indeed, Sextus Naevius, but
            in reality, the most eloquent, the most gallant, the most accomplished men of our state,
            who are defending Sextus Naevius with one common zeal, and with all their power: if,
            indeed, defending means so to comply with the desire of another, that he may the more
            easily be able to overwhelm whomsoever he chooses by an unjust trial; <milestone n="8"
              unit="section"/> for what, O Caius Aquillius, can be mentioned or spoken of more
            unjust or more unworthy than this, that I who am defending the liberties, <note
              anchored="yes">The Latin has <foreign lang="la">caput</foreign>, which in a legal
              sense expresses not only a man's life, but also his status or civil condition; to be
              registered in the census was <foreign lang="la">caput habere</foreign>; to change
              one's rank, <foreign lang="la">capite, &amp;c. diminuere</foreign>. And so a trial
              which affected not only a citizen's life, but his rank or liberty, was called <foreign
                lang="la">judicium capitale</foreign>.</note> the fame, and fortunes of another
            should be compelled to open the cause, especially when Quintus Hortensius, who in this
            trial fills the part of the accuser, is to speak against me; a man to whom nature has
            given the greatest possible fluency and energy in speaking? Matters are so managed, that
            I, who ought rather to ward off the darts of our adversary and to heal the wounds he has
            inflicted, am compelled to do so now, even when the adversary has cast no dart; and that
            that time is given to them to attack us when the power of avoiding their attacks is to
            be taken from us; and if in any particular they should (as they are well prepared to do)
            cast any false accusation like a poisoned arrow at us, there will be no opportunity for
            applying a remedy. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> That has happened through the
            injustice and wrong-doing of the praetor; first, because, contrary to universal custom,
            he has chosen that the trial as to honour or infamy <note anchored="yes">Because if it
              were decided that Quinctius had forfeited his recognizances, <foreign lang="la"
                >infamia</foreign> was the consequence.</note> should take place before the one
            concerning the fact; secondly, because he has so arranged this very trial, that the
            defendant is compelled to plead his cause before he has heard a word of the accuser's;
            and this has been done because of the influence and power of those men who indulge the
            violence and covetousness of Sextus Naevius as eagerly as if their own property or
            honour were at stake, and who make experiment of their influence in such matters as
            this, in which the more weight they have through their virtue and nobility, the less
            they ought to make a parade of what influence they have. <milestone n="10"
              unit="section"/> Since Publius Quinctius, involved in and overwhelmed by such numerous
            and great difficulties, has taken refuge, O Caius Aquillius, in your good faith, in your
            truth, in your compassion; when, up to this time , owing to the might of his
            adversaries, no equal law could be found for him, no equal liberty of pleading, no just
            magistrate, when, through the greatest injustice, everything was unfavourable and
            hostile to him; he now prays and entreats you, O Caius Aquillius, and all of you who are
            present as assessors, to allow justice, which has been tossed about and agitated by many
            injuries, at length to find rest and a firm footing in this place. <milestone n="3"
              unit="chapter"/><milestone n="11" unit="section"/></p>
          <p>And that you may the more easily do this, I will endeavour to make you understand how
            this matter has been managed and carried out. Caius Quinctius was the brother of this
            Publius Quinctius; in other respects a sufficiently prudent and attentive head of a
            family, but in one matter a little less wise, inasmuch as he formed a partnership with
            Sextus Naevius, a respectable man, but one who had not been brought up so as to be
            acquainted with the rights of partnership, or with the duties of a head of an
            established family. <note anchored="yes">The office of <foreign lang="la"
                >praeco</foreign> was so little reputable that before Cicero's death a law was
              passed to prevent all persons who had been <foreign lang="la">praecones</foreign> from
              becoming <foreign lang="la">decuriones</foreign> in the <foreign lang="la"
                >municipia</foreign>. Under the emperors, however it became very profitable.</note>
            Not that he was wanting in abilities; for Sextus Naevius as a buffoon was never
            considered without wit, nor as a crier was he reckoned unmannerly. What followed? As
            nature had given him nothing better than a voice, and his father had left him nothing
            besides his freedom, he made gain of his voice, and used his freedom for the object of
            being loquacious with impunity. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> So there was no
            reason in the world for your taking him as a partner, except that he might learn with
            your money what a harvest money can produce. Nevertheless, induced by acquaintance and
            intimacy with the man, Quinctius, as I have said, entered into a partnership with him as
            to those articles which were procured in <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>.
            He had considerable property in cattle, and a well-cultivated and productive farm.
            Naevius is carried off from the halls of Licinius, <note anchored="yes">The Hall of
              Licinius, i.e. Licinius Crassus, was the celebrated one where he erected four columns
              of Hymettian marble, for the theatrical shows in his aedileship, and was one of the
              common resorts of auctioneers and criers.</note> and from the gang of criers, into
              <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> and across the <placeName
              key="tgn,2066659">Alps</placeName>; there is a great change in his situation, <note
              anchored="yes"><foreign lang="la">Coelum non animum mutant qui trans mare
                currunt.</foreign> &mdash;<bibl n="Hor. Ep. 1.2.27">;Hor. Epist. 1, ii.
                27</bibl>.</note> none in his disposition; for he who from his boyhood had been
            proposing to himself gain without any outlay, as soon as he spent anything himself and
            brought it to the common stock, could not be content with a moderate profit. <milestone
              n="13" unit="section"/> Nor is it any wonder if he, who had his voice for sale,
            thought that those things which he had acquired by his voice would be a great profit to
            him; so that without much moderation, he carried off whatever he could from the common
            stock to his private house for himself. And in this he was as industrious as if all who
            behaved in a partnership with exact good faith, were usually condemned in a trial before
            an arbitrator. <note anchored="yes">The Latin has &ldquo;arbitrium pro socio
              condemnari,&rdquo; on which Graevius says, &ldquo;<foreign lang="la">Arbitrium
                pro socio</foreign>, is a formula of law, by which is signified an action and trial
              in a case of partnership if any one had cheated his partner; and Cicero means that
              Naevius was as industrious in cheating his partner, as if those who did not cheat were
              liable to be condemned, and not those who did cheat.&rdquo;</note> But concerning
            these matters I do not consider it necessary to say what Publius Quinctius wishes me to
            mention; although the cause calls for it: yet as it only calls for it, and does not
            absolutely require it, <note anchored="yes">The Latin has <foreign lang="la">quia
                  <emph>postulat</emph> non <emph>flagitat</emph></foreign>, both words being nearly
              synonymous, but <foreign lang="la">flagito</foreign> being evidently a stronger word
              than <foreign lang="la">postulo</foreign>.</note> I will pass it over. <milestone
              n="4" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="14" unit="section"/></p>
          <p>When this partnership had now subsisted many years, and when Naevius had often been
            suspected by Quinctius, and was not able conveniently to give an account of the
            transactions which he had carried on according to his caprice, and not on any system,
            Quinctius dies in <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, when Naevius was there
            too, and dies suddenly. By his will he left this Publius Quinctius his heir, in order
            that, as great grief would come to him by his death, great honour should also accrue to
            him. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> When he was dead, Publius Quinctius soon after
            goes into <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>. There he lives on terms of
            intimacy with that fellow Naevius. There they are together nearly a year, during which
            they had many communications with one another about their partnership, and about the
            whole of their accounts and their estate in <placeName key="tgn,1000070"
              >Gaul</placeName>; nor during that time did Naevius utter one single word about either
            the partnership owing him anything, or about Quinctius having owed him anything on his
            private account. As there was some little debt left behind, the payment of which was to
            be provided for at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, this Publius
            Quinctius issues notices that he shall put up to auction in <placeName key="tgn,1000070"
              >Gaul</placeName>, at <placeName key="tgn,7008368">Narbonne</placeName>, those things
            which were his own private property. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> On this, this
            excellent man, Sextus Naevius, dissuades the man by many speeches from putting the
            things up to auction, saying that he would not be able at that time to sell so
            conveniently what he had advertised. That he had a sum of money at <placeName
              key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, which if Quinctius were wise he would consider
            their common property, from their brotherly intimacy, and also from his relationship
            with himself; for Naevius has married the cousin of Publius Quinctius, and has children
            by her. Because Naevius was saying just what a good man ought, Quinctius believed that
            he who imitated the language of good men, would imitate also their actions. He gives up
            the idea of having an auction; he goes to <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
            >Rome</placeName>; at the same time Naevius also leaves <placeName key="tgn,1000070"
              >Gaul</placeName> for <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. <milestone

            Quinctius referred it to you, O Caius Aquillius, to decide what he should pay his
            children. He preferred submitting to your decision in this matter, because, on account
            of the difference in the exchange, it was not sufficient to look in his books and see
            how much was owed, unless he had inquired at the temple of Castor <note anchored="yes"

              unit="section"/></p>
          <p>All these things Quinctius did by the advice and at the instigation of Naevius: nor is
            there anything strange in his adopting the advice of the man whose assistance he thought
            at his service. For not only had he promised it in <placeName key="tgn,1000070"
              >Gaul</placeName>, but every day he kept on saying at <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
              >Rome</placeName> that he would pay the money as soon as he gave him a hint to do so.
            Quinctius moreover saw that he was able to do so. He knew that he ought; he did not
            think that he was telling lies, because there was no reason why he should tell lies. He
            arranged, therefore, that he would pay the Scapulae as if he had the money at home. He
            gives Naevius notice of it, and asks him to provide for the payment as he had said he
            would. <milestone n="19" unit="section"/> Then that worthy man&mdash;I hope he will
            not think I am laughing at him if I call him again a most worthy man&mdash;as he
            thought that he was brought into a great strait, hoping to pin him down to his own terms
            at the very nick of time, says that he will not pay a penny, unless a decision is first
            come to about all the affairs and accounts of the partnership, and unless he knew that
            there would be no dispute between him and Quinctius. We will look into these matters at
            a future time, says Quinctius, but at present I wish you to provide, if you please, what
            you said you would. He says that he will not do so on any other condition; and that what
            he had promised no more concerned him, than it would if when he was holding a sale by
            auction, he had made any bidding at the command of the owner. <milestone n="20"
              unit="section"/> Quinctius being perplexed at this desertion, obtains a few days'
            delay from the Scapulae; he sends into <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> to
            have those things sold which he had advertised; being absent, he sells them at a less
            favourable time than before; he pays the Scapulae with more disadvantage to himself than
            he would have done. Then of his own accord he calls Naevius to account, in order, since
            he suspected that there would be a dispute about something, to provide for the
            termination of the business as soon as possible, and with the smallest possible trouble.
              <milestone n="21" unit="section"/> He appoints as his umpire his friend Marcus
            Trebellius; we name a common friend, a relation of our own, Sextus Alphenus, who had
            been brought up in his house, and with whom he was exceedingly intimate. No agreement
            could be come to; because the one was willing to put up with a slight loss, but the
            other was not content with a moderate booty. <milestone n="22" unit="section"/> So from
            that time the matter was referred to legal decision. <note anchored="yes">Lit.
              &ldquo;recognizances were entered into.&rdquo; When the praetor had granted an

            been wasted in that business, and nothing had been done, Naevius appeared before the
            judge. <milestone n="6" unit="chapter"/></p>
          <p>I beseech you, O Caius Aquillius, and you the assessors in this suit, to observe
            carefully, in order that you may be able to understand the singular nature of this
            fraud, and the new method of trickery employed. <milestone n="23" unit="section"/> He
            says that he had had a sale by auction in <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>;
            that he had sold what he thought fit; that he had taken care that the partnership should
            owe him nothing; that he would have no more to do with summoning any one, or with giving
            security; if Quinctius had any business to transact with him, he had no objection. He,
            as he was desirous to revisit his farm in <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>,
            does not summon the man at present; so he departs without giving security. After that,
            Quinctius remains at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> about thirty days.
            He gets any securities which he had given other people respited, so as to be able to go
            without hindrance into <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>. <milestone n="24"
              unit="section"/> He goes; he leaves <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> on
            the twenty-ninth of January, in the Consulship of Scipio and Norbanus;&mdash;I beg
            of you to remember the day. Lucius Albius the son of Sextus of the Quirine tribe, a good
            man and of the highest reputation for honour, set out with him. When they had come to
            the place called the fords of Volaterra, they see a great friend of Naevius, who was
            bringing him some slaves from <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> to be sold,
            Lucius Publicius by name, who when he arrived in <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
              >Rome</placeName> told Naevius in what place he had seen Quinctius; and unless this
            had been told Naevius by Publicius, the matter would not so soon have come to trial.
              <milestone n="25" unit="section"/> Then Naevius sends his slaves round to his friends;
            he summons himself all his associates from the halls of Licinius and from the jaws of
            the shambles, and entreats them to come to the booth of Sextus by the second hour of the
            next day. They come in crowds; he makes oath that Publius Quinctius has not appeared to
            his bail, and that he has appeared to his. A long protest to this effect is sealed with
            the seals of noble men. They depart: Naevius demands of Burrienus the praetor, that by
            his edict he may take possession of Quinctius's goods. <note anchored="yes">If either
              party did not appear on the appointed day, he was said <foreign lang="la">vadimonium
                deserere</foreign>, and the praetor gave to the other party the <foreign lang="la"
                >bonorum possessio</foreign>. Vide Smith's Dict. Ant. p. 9. v. <foreign lang="la"
                >Actio</foreign>.</note> He urged the confiscation of the property of that man with
            whom he had had intimacy, with whom he actually was in partnership, between whom and
            himself there was a relationship, which while his children lived could not possibly be
            annulled. <milestone n="26" unit="section"/> From which act it could easily be perceived
            that there is no bond so holy and solemn, that avarice is not in the habit of weakening
            and violating it. In truth, if friendship is kept up by truth, society by good faith,
            relationship by affection, it is inevitable that he who has endeavoured to despoil his
            friend, his partner, and his relation of fame and fortune, should confess himself
            worthless and perfidious and impious. <milestone n="27" unit="section"/> Sextus
            Alphenus, the agent of Publius Quinctius, the intimate friend and relation of Sextus
            Naevius, tears down the bills; carries off one little slave whom Naevius had laid hold
            of; gives notice that he is the agent, and that it is only fair that that fellow should
            consult the fame and fortunes of Publius Quinctius, and await his arrival. But if he
            would not do so, and believed that by such methods he could bring him into the
            conditions which he proposed, then he asked nothing as a favour, and if Naevius chose to
            go to law, he would defend him at the trial. <milestone n="28" unit="section"/> While
            this is being done at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, meantime
            Quinctius, contrary to law and to custom, and to the edicts of the praetors, is driven
            by force by the slaves which belonged to both him and Naevius, as partners, from their
            common lands and estates. <milestone n="7" unit="chapter"/></p>
          <p>Think, O Caius Aquillius, that Naevius did everything at <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
              >Rome</placeName> with moderation and good sense, if this which was done in <placeName
              key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> in obedience to his letters was done rightly and
            legally. Quinctius being expelled and turned out of his farm, having received a most
            notorious injury, flies to Caius Flaccus the general, who was at that time in the
            province; whom I name to do him honour as his dignity demands. How strongly he was of
            opinion that that action called for punishment you will be able to learn from his
            decrees. <milestone n="29" unit="section"/> Meantime Alphenus was fighting every day at
              <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> with that old gladiator. He had the
            people indeed on his side, because that fellow never ceased to aim at the head. <note
              anchored="yes">There is an allusion here to the fights of gladiators, in which the
              people disapproved of that gladiator who aimed too constantly at the vital parts of
              his adversary, so as to make the combat short. There is a pun here, <foreign lang="la"
                >caput</foreign> meaning the head or life of the gladiator, and also the condition
              of a citizen.</note> Naevius demanded that the agent should give security for payment
            on judgment being given. Alphenus says that it is not reasonable for an agent to give
            security, because the defendant would not be bound to give security if he were present
            himself. The tribunes are appealed to, and as a positive decision was demanded from
            them, the matter is terminated on the footing of Sextus Alphenus undertaking that
            Publius Quinctius should answer to his bail by the thirteenth of September. <milestone
              n="8" unit="chapter"/></p>
          <p><milestone n="30" unit="section"/>Quinctius comes to <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
              >Rome</placeName>; he answers to his bail. That fellow, that most energetic man, the
            seizer of other men's goods, that invader, that robber, for a year and a half asks for
            nothing, keeps quiet, amuses Quinctius by proposals as long as he can, and at last
            demands of Cnaeus Dolabella, the praetor, that Quinctius should give security for
            payment on judgment being given, according to the formula, &ldquo;Because he demands
            it of him whose goods he has taken possession of for thirty days, according to the edict
            of the praetor.&rdquo; Quinctius made no objection to his ordering him to give
            security, if his goods had been possessed, in accordance with the praetor's edict. He
            makes the order; how just a one I do not say&mdash;this alone I do say, it was
            unprecedented: and I would rather not have said even this, since any one could have
            understood both its characters. He orders Publius Quinctius to give security to Sextus
            Naevius, to try the point whether his goods had been taken possession of for thirty
            days, in accordance with the edict of the praetor. The friends who were then with
            Quinctius objected to this: they showed that a decision ought to be come to as to the
            fact, so that either each should give security to the other, or else that neither
            should; that there was no necessity for the character of either being involved in the
            trial. <milestone n="31" unit="section"/> Moreover, Quinctius himself cried out that he
            was unwilling to give security, lest by so doing he should seem to admit that his goods
            had been taken possession of in accordance with the edict: besides, if he gave a bond in
            that manner, he should be forced (as has now happened) to speak first in a trial
            affecting himself capitally. Dolabella (as high-born men are wont to do, who, whether
            they have begun to act rightly or wrongly, carry either conduct to such a height that no
            one born in our rank of life can overtake them) perseveres most bravely in committing
            injustice: he bids him either give security or give a bond; and meantime he orders our
            advocates, who objected to this, to be removed with great roughness. <milestone n="9"
              unit="chapter"/><milestone n="32" unit="section"/></p>
          <p>Quinctius departs much embarrassed; and no wonder, when so miserable a choice was
            offered him, and one so unjust, that he must either himself convict himself of a capital
            offence if he gave security, <note anchored="yes">Because the giving security now would
              be an admission that he had forfeited his recognizances before; which was liable to be
              punished with <foreign lang="la">infamia</foreign></note> or open the cause himself in
            a capital trial if he gave a bond. As in the one case there was no reason why he should
            pass an unfavourable sentence on himself (for sentence passed by oneself is the hardest
            sentence of all), but in the other case there was hope of coming before such a man as a
            judge, as would show him the more favour the more without interest he was, he preferred
            to give a bond. He did so. He had you, O Caius Aquillius, for the judge; he pleaded
            according to his bond; in what I have now mid consists the sum and the whole of the
            present trial. </p>
          <p>
            <milestone n="33" unit="section"/> You see, O Caius Aquillius, that it is a trial
            touching not the property of Publius Quinctius, but his fame and fortunes. Though our
            ancestors have determined that he who is pleading for his life should speak last, you
            see that we, owing to this unprecedented accusation of the prosecutor's, are pleading
            our cause first. Moreover, you see that those who are more accustomed <note
              anchored="yes">He means Hortensius.</note> to defend people are today acting as
            accusers; and that those talents are turned to do people injury, which have hitherto
            been employed in ministering to men's safety, and in assisting them. There remained but
            one thing more, which they put in execution yesterday,&mdash;namely, to proceed
            against you for the purpose of compelling you to limit the time allowed us for making
            our defence; and this they would easily have obtained from the praetor if you had not
            taught him what your rights and duties and business were. <milestone n="34"
              unit="section"/> Nor was there any longer any assistant left to us but yourself by
            whose means we could obtain our rights against them. Nor was it even enough for them to
            obtain that which might be justified to everybody; so trifling and insignificant a thing
            do they think power to be which is not exercised with injustice. <milestone n="10"

          <p>But since Hortensius urges you to come to a decision, and requires of use that I should
            not waste time in speaking, and complains that when the former advocate was defending
            this action it never could be brought to a conclusion, I will not allow that suspicion
            to continue to exist, that we are unwilling for the matter to be decided, nor will I
            arrogate to myself a power of proving the case better than it has been proved before;
            nor yet will I make a long speech, because the cause has already been explained by him
            who has spoken before, and brevity, which is exceedingly agreeable to me, is required of

              <milestone n="35" unit="section"/> I will do what I have often observed you do, O

            You always do so, because you are always able. I will do so in this cause, because in
            this cause I think I can. That power which nature gives you of being always able to do
            so, this cause gives me, so that I am able to do so today. I will appoint myself certain
            bounds and limits, out of which I cannot stray if I ever so much wish; so that both I
            may have a subject on which I may speak, and Hortensius may have allegations which he
            may answer, and you, O Caius Aquillius, may be able to perceive beforehand what topics
            you are going to hear discussed. We say, O Sextus Naevius, that you did not take
            possession of the goods of Publius Quinctius in accordance with the edict of the
            praetor. <milestone n="36" unit="section"/> On that point the security was given. I will
            show first, that there was no cause why you should require of the praetor power to take
            possession of the goods of Publius Quinctius; in the second place, that you could not
            have taken possession of them according to the edict; lastly, that you did not take
            possession of them. I entreat you, O Caius Aquillius, and you too the assessors, to
            preserve carefully in your recollections what I have undertaken. You will more easily
            comprehend the whole business if you recollect this; and you will easily recall me by
            the expression of your opinion if I attempt to overstep those barriers to which I have
            confined myself. I say that there was no reason why he should make the demand; I say
            that he could not have taken possession according to the edict; I say that he did not
            take possession. When I have proved thee three things, I will sum up the whole.
              <milestone n="11" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="37" unit="section"/></p>
          <p>There was no reason why you should make the demand, How can this be proved? Because
            Quinctius owed nothing whatever to Sextus Naevius, neither on account of the
            partnership, nor from any private debt. Who is a witness of this? Why, the same man who
            is our most bitter enemy. In this matter I will cite you&mdash;you, I say, O
            Naevius, as our witness Quinctius was with you in <placeName key="tgn,1000070"

            Prove that you ever demanded of him this vast sum of money, I know not how much; prove
            that you ever mentioned it, ever said it was owing, and I will admit that he owed it.
              <milestone n="38" unit="section"/>Caius Quinctius dies; who, as you say, owed you a
            large sum for some particular articles. His heir, Publius Quinctius, comes into
              <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> to you, to your joint
            estate&mdash;comes to that place where not only the property was, but also all the
            accounts and all the books. Who would have been so careless in his private affairs, who
            so negligent, who so unlike you, O Sextus, us not, when the effects were gone from his
            hands who had contracted the debt, and had become the property of his heir, to inform
            the heir of it as soon as he saw him? to apply for the money? to give in his account?
            and if anything were disputed, to arrange it either in a friendly manner, or by the
            intervention of strict law? Is it not so? that which the best men do, those who wish
            their relations and friends to be affectionate towards them and honourable, would Sextus
            Naevius not do that, he who so burns, who is so hurried away by avarice, that he is
            unwilling to give up any part of his own property, lest he should leave some fraction to
            be any credit or advantage to this his near relation. <milestone n="39" unit="section"/>
            And would he not demand the money, if any were owing, who , because that was not paid
            which was never owed, seeks to take away not the money only, but even the life of his
            relation? You were unwilling, I suppose, to be troublesome to him whom you will not
            allow even to live as a free man! You were unwilling at that time modestly to ask that
            man for money, whom you now will nefariously to murder! I suppose so. You were
            unwilling, or you did not dare, to ask a man who was your relation, who had a regard for
            you, a good man, a temperate man, a man older than yourself. Often (as sometimes happens
            with men), when you had fortified yourself, when you had determined to mention the
            money, when you had come ready prepared and having considered the matter, you being a
            nervous man, of virgin modesty, on a sudden checked yourself, your voice failed you, you
            did not dare to ask him for money whom you wished to ask, lest he should be unwilling to
            hear you. No doubt that was it. <milestone n="12" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="40"

          <p>Let us believe this, that Sextus Naevius spared the ears of the man whose life he is
            attacking! If he had owed you money, O Sextus, you would have asked for it at once; if
            not at once, at all events soon after; if not soon after, at least after a time; in six
            months I should think; beyond all doubt at the close of the year: but for a year and a
            half, when you had every day an opportunity of reminding the man of the debt, you say
            not one word about it; but now, when nearly two years have passed, you ask for the
            money. What profligate and extravagant spendthrift, even before his property is
            diminished, but while it is still abundant, would have been so reckless as Sextus
            Naevius was? When I name the man, I seem to myself to have said enough. <milestone
              n="41" unit="section"/> Caius Quinctius owed you money; you never asked for it: he
            died; his property came to his heir; though you saw him every day, you did not ask for
            it for two years; will any one doubt which is the more probable, that Sextus Naevius
            would instantly have asked for what was owed to him, or that be would not have asked for
            two years? Had he no opportunity of asking? Why, he lived with you more than a year:
            could no measures be taken in <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>? But there
            was law administered in the province, and trials were taking place at <placeName
              key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. The only alternative remaining is, either extreme
            carelessness prevented you, or extraordinary liberality. If you call it carelessness, we
            shall wonder; if you call it kindness, we shall laugh; and what else you can call it I
            know not; it is proof enough that nothing was owing to Naevius, that for such a length
            of time he asked for nothing. <milestone n="13" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="42"
              unit="section"/></p>
          <p>What if I show that this very thing which he is now doing is a proof that nothing is
            due? For what is Sextus Naevius doing now? About what is there a dispute? What is this
            trial on which we have now been occupied two years? What is the important business with
            which he is wearying so many eminent men? He is asking for his money. What now, at last?
            But let him ask; let us hear what he has to say. <milestone n="43" unit="section"/> He
            wishes a decision to be come to concerning the accounts and disputes of the partnership.
            It is very late. However, better late than never; let us grant it. Oh, says be, I do not
            want that now, O Caius Aquillius; and I am not troubling myself about that now: Publius
            Quinctius has had the use of my money for so many years; let him use it, I do not ask
            anything. What then are you contending for? is it with that object that you have often
            announced in many places&mdash;that he may no longer be a citizen? that he may not
            keep that rank which hitherto he has most honourably preserved? that be may not be
            counted among the living? that he may be in peril of his life and all his honours? that
            he may have to plead his cause before the plaintiff speaks, and that when he has ended
            his speech he may then hear the voice of his accuser? What? What is the object of this?
            That you may the quicker arrive at your rights? But if you wished that might be already
            done. That you may contend according to a more respectable form of procedure? <milestone
              n="44" unit="section"/> But you cannot murder Publius Quinctius your own relation,
            without the greatest wickedness. That the trial may be facilitated I But neither does
            Caius Aquillius willingly decide on the life of another, nor has Quintus Hortensius been
            in the habit of pleading against a man's life. But what reply is made by us, O Caius
            Aquillius? He asks for his money: we deny that it is due. Let a trial take place
            instantly; we make no objection; is there anything more? If he is afraid that the money
            will not be forth coming when the decision is given let him take security that it shall
            be; and let him give security <note anchored="yes">In many cases both plaintiff and

            for what I demand in the very same terms in which we give security. <milestone n="45"
              unit="section"/> The matter can be terminated at once, O Caius Aquillius You can at
            once depart, being delivered from an annoyance, I had almost said, no less than that
            Quinctius is exposed to. What are we doing, Hortensius? what are we to say of this
            condition? Can we, some time or other, laying aside our weapons, discuss the money
            matter without hazard of any one's fortunes? Can we so prosecute our business, as to
            leave the life of our relation in safety? Can we adopt the character of a plaintiff, and
            lay aside that of an accuser? Yes, says he, I will take security from you, but I will
            not give you security. <milestone n="14" unit="chapter"/></p>
          <p>But who is it that lays down for us these very reasonable conditions? who determines
            this&mdash;that what is just towards Quinctius is unjust towards Naevius? The goods
            of Quinctius, says he, were taken possession of in accordance with the edict of the
            praetor. You demand then, that I should admit that; that we should establish by our own
            sentence, as having taken place, that which we go to trial expressly to prove never did
            take place. <milestone n="46" unit="section"/> Can no means be found, O Caius Aquillius,
            for a man's arriving at his rights as expeditiously as maybe without the disgrace and
            infamy and ruin of any one else? Forsooth, if anything were owed, he would ask for it:
            he would not prefer that all sorts of trials should take place, rather than that one
            from which all these arise. He, who for so many years never even asked Quinctius for the
            money, when he had an opportunity of transacting business with him every day; he who,
            from the time when he first began to behave ill, has wasted all the time in adjournments
            and respiting the recognizances; he who, after he had withdrawn his recognizance drove
            Quinctius by treachery and violence from their joint estate; who, when he had ample
            opportunity, without any one's making objection, to try a civil action, <note

            heart's blood of his adversary;&mdash;does he not openly say, &ldquo;if anything
            were owing to me, I should demand it, and I should long ago have obtained it; <milestone

            legal proceeding, and such a band of favourers of my cause, if I had to make a just
            demand; I have got to extort money from one unwilling, and in spite of him; I have got
            to tear and squeeze out of a man what he does not owe; Publius Quinctius is to be cast
            down from all his fortune; every one who is powerful, or eloquent, or noble, must be
            brought into court with me; a force must be put upon truth, threats must be bandied
            about, dangers must be threatened; terrors must be brandished before his eyes, that
            being cowed and overcome by these things, he may at last yield of his own
            accord.&rdquo; And, in truth, all these things, when I see who are striving against
            us, and when I consider the party sitting opposite to me, seem to be impending over, and
            to be present to us, and to be impossible to be avoided by any means. But when, O Caius
            Aquillius, I bring my eyes and my mind back to you, the greater the labour and zeal with
            which all these things are done, the more trifling and powerless do I think them.
            Quinctius then owed nothing, as you prove yourself. <milestone n="48" unit="section"/>
            But what if he had owed you anything? would that have at once been a reason for your
            requiring leave from the praetor to take possession of his goods? I think that was
            neither according to law, nor expedient for any one. What then does he prove? He says
            that he had forfeited his recognizances. <milestone n="15" unit="chapter"/></p>
          <p>Before I prove that he had not done so, I choose, O Caius Aquillius, to consider both
            the fact itself and the conduct of Sextus Naevius, with reference to the principles of
            plain duty, and the common usages of men. He, as you say, had not appeared to his
            recognizances; he with whom you were connected by relationship, by partnership, by every
            sort of bond and ancient intimacy. Was it decent for you to go at once to the praetor?
            was it fair for you at once to demand to be allowed to take possession of his goods
            according to the edict? Did you betake yourself to these extreme measures and to these
            most hostile laws with such eagerness as to leave yourself nothing behind which you
            might be able to do still more bitter and cruel? <milestone n="49" unit="section"/> For,
            what could happen more shameful to any human being, what more miserable or more bitter
            to a man; what disgrace could happen so heavy, what disaster can be imagined so
            intolerable? If fortune deprived any one of money, or if the injustice of another took
            it from him, still while his reputation is unimpeached, honour easily makes amends for
            poverty. And some men, though stained with ignominy, or convicted in discreditable
            trials, still enjoy their wealth; are not forced to dance attendance (which is the most
            wretched of all states) on the power of another; and in their distresses they are
            relieved by this support and comfort; but he whose goods have been sold, who has seen
            not merely his ample estates, but even his necessary food and clothing put up under the
            hammer, with great disgrace to himself; he is not only erased from the list of men, but
            he is removed out of sight, if possible, even beneath the dead. An honourable <note

            life, but a dishonoured life leaves no room to hope for even an honourable death.
              <milestone n="50" unit="section"/> Therefore, in truth, when a man's goods are taken
            possession of according to the praetor's edict, all his fame and reputation is seized at
            the same time with his goods. A man about whom placards are posted in the most
            frequented places, is not allowed even to perish in silence and obscurity; a man who has
            assignees and trustees appointed to pronounce to him on what terms and conditions he is
            to be ruined; a man about whom the voice of the crier makes proclamation and proclaims
            his price,&mdash;he has a most bitter funeral procession while he is alive, if that
            may be considered a funeral in which men meet not as friends to do honour to his
            obsequies, but purchasers of his goods as executioners, to tear to pieces and divide the
            relics of his existence. <milestone n="16" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="51"

          <p>Therefore our ancestors determined that such a thing should seldom happen; the praetors
            have taken care that it should only happen after deliberation; good men, even when fraud
            is openly committed, when there is no opportunity of trying the case at law, still have
            recourse to this measure timidly and hesitatingly; not till they are compelled by force
            and necessity, unwillingly, when the recognizances have often been forfeited, when they
            have been often deceived and outwitted. For they consider how serious a matter it is to
            confiscate the property of another. A good man is unwilling to slay another, even
            according to law; for he would rather say that he had saved when he might have
            destroyed, than that he had destroyed when he could have saved. Good men behave so to
            the most perfect strangers, aye, even to their greatest enemies, for the sake both of
            their reputation among men, and of the common rights of humanity; in order that, as they
            have not knowingly caused inconvenience to another, no inconvenience may lawfully befall
            them. He did not appear to his recognizances. Who? Your own relation. If that matter
            appeared of the greatest importance in itself, yet its magnitude would be lessened by
            the consideration of your relationship. He did not appear to his recognizances. Who?
            Your partner. You might forgive even a greater thing than this, to a man with whom
            either your inclination had connected you, or fortune had associated you. <milestone
              n="52" unit="section"/> He did not appear to his recognizances. Who? He who was always
            in your company. You therefore have hurled upon him, who allowed it to happen once that
            he was not in your company, all those weapons which have been forged against those who
            have done many things for the sake of malversation and fraud. <milestone n="53"

            you were afraid of some trick, would you not have at once run off to Caius Aquillius, or
            to some other counsel? When the rights of friendship, of partnership, of relationship
            are at stake, when regard should have been had to your duty and your character, at that
            time you not only did not refer it to Caius Aquillius or to Lucius Lucilius, but you did
            not even consult yourself; you did not even say this to
            yourself&mdash;&ldquo;The two hours are passed; Quinctius has not appeared to
            his recognizances; what shall I do?&rdquo; If, in truth, you had said but these four
            words to yourself &ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo; your covetousness and avarice
            would have had breathing time; you would have given some room for reason and prudence;
            you would have recollected yourself; you would not have come to such baseness as to be
            forced to confess before such men that in the same hour in which he did not appear to
            his recognizances you took counsel how utterly to ruin the fortunes of your relation.

          <p>I now on your behalf consult these men, after the time has passed, and in an affair
            which is not mine, since you forgot to consult them in your own affair, and when it was
            the proper time. I ask of you, Caius Aquillius, Lucius Lucilius, Publius Quintilius, and
            Marcus Marcellus;&mdash;A certain partner and relation of mine has not appeared to
            his recognizances; a man with whom I have a long standing intimacy, but a recent dispute
            about money matters. Can I demand of the praetor to be allowed to take possession of his
            goods? Or must I, as he has a house, a wife, and children at <placeName

            opinion in this matter? If, in truth, I have rightly understood your kindness and
            prudence, I am not much mistaken what you will answer if you are consulted. You will say
            at first that I must wait; then, if he seems to be shirking the business and to be
            trifling with it too long, that I must have a meeting of our friends; must ask who his
            agent is; must give notice at his house. It can hardly be told how many steps there are
            which you would make answer ought to be taken before having recourse to this extreme and
            unnecessary course. <milestone n="55" unit="section"/> What does Naevius say to all
            this? Forsooth, he laughs at our madness in expecting a consideration of the highest
            duty, or looking for the practices of good men in his conduct. What have I to do, says
            he, with all this sanctimoniousness and punctiliousness? Let good men, says he, look to
            these duties, but let them think of me thus; let them ask not what I have, but by what
            means I have acquired it, and in what rank I was born, and in what manner I was brought
            up. I remember, there is an old proverb about a buffoon; &ldquo;that it is a much
            easier thing for him to become rich than to become the head of a family.&rdquo;
              <milestone n="56" unit="section"/> This is what he says openly by his actions, if he
            does not dare to say it in words. If in truth he wishes to live according to the
            practices of good men, he has many things to learn and to unlearn, both which things are
            difficult to a man of his age. <milestone n="18" unit="chapter"/></p>
          <p>I did not hesitate, says he, when the recognizances were forfeited, to claim the
            confiscation of his goods. It was wickedly done; but since you claim this for yourself;
            and demand that it be granted to you, let us grant it. What if he has not forfeited his
            recognizances? if the whole of that plea has been invented by you with the most extreme
            dishonesty and wickedness? if there had actually been no securities given in any cause
            between you and Publius Quinctius? What shall we call you? Wicked? why, even if the
            recognizances had been forfeited, yet in making such a demand and confiscation of his
            goods, you were proved to be most wicked. Malignant? you do not deny it. Dishonest? you
            have already claimed that as your character, and you think it a fine thing. Audacious?
            covetous? perfidious? those are vulgar and worn-out imputations, but this conduct is
            novel and unheard-of. <milestone n="57" unit="section"/> What then are we to say? I fear
            forsooth lest I should either use language severer than men's nature is inclined to

            forfeited. Quinctius the moment he returned to <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
              >Rome</placeName> asked you on what day the recognizances were drawn. You answered at

            /> What then? how can this be found out? Lucius Albius went with him, a man of the
            highest honour; he shall give his evidence. Some friends accompanied both Albius and
            Quinctius; they also shall give their evidence. Shall the letters of Publius Quinctius,
            shall so many witnesses, all having the most undeniable reason for being able to know
            the truth, and no reason for speaking falsely, be compared with your witness to the
            recognizance? <milestone n="59" unit="section"/> And shall Publius Quinctius be harassed
            in a cause like this? and shall he any longer be subjected to the misery of such fear
            and danger? and shall the influence of an adversary alarm him more than the integrity of
            the judge comforts him? For he always lived in an unpolished and uncompanionable manner;
            he was of a melancholy and unsociable disposition; he has not frequented the Forum, or
            the Campus, or banquets. He so lived as to retain his friends by attention, and his
            property by economy; he loved the ancient system of duty, all the splendour of which has
            grown obsolete according to present fashions. But if, in a cause where the merits were
            equal, he seemed to come off the worse, that would be in no small degree to be
            complained of; but now, when he is in the right, he does not even demand to come off
            best; he submits to be worsted, only with these limitations, that he is not to be given
            up with his goods, his character, and all his fortunes, to the covetousness and cruelty
            of Sextus Naevius. <milestone n="19" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="60" unit="section"
            /></p>
          <p>I have proved what I first promised to prove, O Caius Aquillius, that there was
            absolutely no cause why he should make this demand; that neither was any money owed, and
            that if it were owed ever so much, nothing had been done to excuse recourse being had to
            such measures as these. Remark now, that the goods of Publius Quinctius could not
            possibly have been taken possession of in accordance with the praetor's edict. Recite
            the edict. &ldquo;He who for the sake of fraud has lain hid.&rdquo; That is not
            Quinctius, unless they be hid who depart on their own business, leaving an agent behind
            them. &ldquo;The man who has no heir.&rdquo; Even that is not he. &ldquo;The
            man who leaves the country in exile.&rdquo; At what time, O Naevius, do you think
            Quinctius ought to have been defended in his absence, or how? Then, when you were
            demanding leave to take possession of his goods? No one was present, for no one could
            guess that you were going to make such a demand; nor did it concern any one to object to
            that which the praetor ordered not to be done absolutely, but to be done according to
            his edict. <milestone n="61" unit="section"/> What was the first opportunity, then,
            which was given to the agent of defending this absent man? When you were putting up the
            placards. Then Sextus Alphenus was present: he did not permit it; he tore down the
            notices. That which was the first step of duty was observed by the agent with the
            greatest diligence. Let us see what followed on this. You arrest the servant of Publius
            Quinctius in public: you attempt to take him away. Alphenus does not permit it; he takes
            him from you by force; he takes care that he is led home to Quinctius. Here too is seen
            in a high degree the attention of an illustrious agent. You say that Quinctius is in
            your debt; his agent denies it. You wish security to he given; he promises it. You call
            him into court; he follows you. You demand a trial; he does not object. What other could
            be the conduct of one defending a man in his absence I do not understand. <milestone
              n="62" unit="section"/> But who was the agent? I suppose it was some insignificant
            man, poor, litigious, worthless, who might be able to endure the daily abuse of a
            wealthy buffoon. Nothing of the sort: he was a wealthy Roman knight; a man managing his
            own affairs well: he was, in short, the man whom Naevius himself as often as he went
            into <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, left as his agent at <placeName
              key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. <milestone n="20" unit="chapter"/></p>
          <p>And do you dare, O Sextus Naevius, to deny that Quinctius was defended in his absence,
            when the same man defended him who used to defend you? and when he accepted the trial on
            behalf of Quinctius, to whom when departing you used to recommend and entrust your own
            property and character? Do you attempt to say that there was no one who defended
            Quinctius at the trial? <milestone n="63" unit="section"/> &ldquo;I
            demanded,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;that security should be given.&rdquo; You
            demanded it unjustly. &ldquo;The order was made.&rdquo; Alphenus objected.
            &ldquo;He did, but the praetor made the decree.&rdquo; Therefore the tribunes
            were appealed to. &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have you: that is
            not allowing a trial, nor defending a man at a trial, when you ask assistance from the
            tribunes.&rdquo; When I consider how prudent Hortensius is, I do not think that he
            will say this; but when I hear that he has said so before, and when I consider the cause
            itself I do not see what else he can say; for he admits that Alphenus tore down the
            bills, undertook to give security, did not object to go to trial in the very terms which
            Naevius proposed; but on this condition, that according to custom and prescription, it
            should be before that magistrate who was appointed in order to give assistance.
              <milestone n="64" unit="section"/> You must either say that these things are not so;
            or that Caius Aquillius, being such a man as he is, on his oath, is to establish this
            law in the state: that he whose agent does not object to every trial which any one
            demands against him, whose agent dares to appeal from the praetor to the tribunes, is
            not defended at all, and may rightly have his goods taken possession of; may properly,
            while miserable, absent, and ignorant of it, have all the embellishments of his
            fortunes, all the ornaments of his life, taken from him with the greatest disgrace and
            ignominy. And this seems reasonable to no one. <milestone n="65" unit="section"/> This
            certainly must be proved to the satisfaction of every one, that Quinctius while absent
            was defended at the trial. And as that is the ease, his goods were not taken possession
            of in accordance with the edict. But then, the tribunes of the people did not even hear
            his cause. I admit, if that be the case, that the agent ought to have obeyed the decree
            of the praetor. What; if Marcus Brutus openly said that he would intercede <note
              anchored="yes"><foreign lang="la">Intercedo</foreign> was the technical word for the
              interposition of the tribunes.</note> unless some agreement was come to between
            Alphenus himself and Naevius; does not the appeal to the tribunes seem to have been
            interposed not for the sake of delay but of assistance? <milestone n="21" unit="chapter"
              /><milestone n="66" unit="section"/></p>
          <p>What is done next? Alphenus, in order that all men might see that Quinctius was
            defended at the trial, that no suspicion might exist unfavourable either to his own
            duty, or to his principal's character, summons many excellent men, And, in the hearing
            of that fellow, calls them to witness that he begs this of him, in the first place, out
            of regard to their common intimacy, that he would not attempt to take any severe steps
            against Quinctius in his absence without cause; but if lie persevered in carrying on the
            contest in a most spiteful and hostile manner, that he is prepared by every upright and
            honourable method to defend him, and to prove that what he demanded was not owed, and
            that he accepted the trial which Naevius proposed. <milestone n="67" unit="section"/>
            Many excellent men signed the document setting forth this fact and these conditions.
            While all matters are still unaltered, while the goods are neither advertised nor taken
            possession of, Alphenus promises Naevius that Quinctius should appear to his
            recognizances. Quinctius does appear to his recognizances. The matter lies in dispute
            while that fellow is spreading his calumnies for two years, until he could find out by
            what means the affair might be diverted out of the common course of proceeding, and the
            whole cause he confined to this single point to which it is now limited. <milestone
              n="68" unit="section"/>What duty of an agent can possibly be mentioned, O Caius
            Aquillius, which seems to have been overlooked by Alphenus? What reason is alleged why
            it should be denied that Publius Quinctius was defended in his absence? Is it that which
            I suppose Hortensius will allege, because he has lately mentioned it, and because
            Naevius is always harping on it, that Naevius was not contending on equal terms with
            Alphenus, at such a time, and with such magistrates? And if I were willing to admit
            that, they will, I suppose, grant this, that it is not the case that no one was the
            agent of Publius Quinctius, but that he had one who was popular. But it is quite
            sufficient for me to prove that there was an agent, with whom he could have tried the
            matter. What sort of man he was, as long as he defended the man in his absence,
            according to law and before the proper magistrate, I think has nothing to do with the
            matter. <milestone n="69" unit="section"/> &ldquo;For he was,&rdquo; says he,
            &ldquo;a man of the opposite party.&rdquo; No doubt; a man who had been brought
            up in your house, whom you from a youth had so trained up as not to favour any one of
            eminence, not even a gladiator. <note anchored="yes">The text is undoubtedly corrupt
              here. Some read <foreign lang="la">haereret</foreign>, some <foreign lang="la"
                >cederet</foreign>. I have adopted the text of Orellius; but the meaning is not very
              plain.</note> If Alphenus had the same wish as you always especially entertained, was
            not the contest between you on equal terms in that matter? &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;
            says he, &ldquo;he was an intimate friend of Brutus, and therefore he
            interposed.&rdquo; You on the other hand were an intimate friend of Burrienus, who
            gave an unjust decision; and, in short, of all those men who at that time were both very
            powerful with violence and wickedness, and who dared do all that they could. Did you
            wish to overcome those men, who now are labouring with such zeal that you may be
            victorious? Dare to say that, not openly, but to these very men whom you have brought
            with you. <milestone n="70" unit="section"/> Although I am unwilling to bring that
            matter up again by mentioning it, every recollection of which I think ought to be
            entirely effaced and destroyed. <milestone n="22" unit="chapter"/></p>
          <p>This one thing I say, if Alphenus was an influential man because of his party zeal,
            Naevius was most influential; if Alphenus, relying on his personal interest, made any
            rather unjust demand; Naevius demanded, and obtained too, things much more unjust. Nor
            was there, as I think, any difference between your zeal. In ability, in experience, in
            cunning, you easily surpassed him. To say nothing of other things, this is sufficient:
            Alphenus was ruined with those men, and for the sake of those men to whom he was
            attached; you, after those men who were your friends could not get the better, took care
            that those who did get the better should be your friends. <milestone n="71"
              unit="section"/> But if you think you had not then the same justice as Alphenus,
            because it was in his power to appeal to some one against you; because a magistrate was
            found before whom the cause of Alphenus could be fairly heard; what is Quinctius to
            determine on at this time I&mdash;a man who has not as yet found any just
            magistrate, nor been able to procure the customary trial; <note anchored="yes"
              >&ldquo;Because the matter in dispute was really a money matter, but the praetor
              ordered the trial to proceed <foreign lang="la">de
              probro</foreign>.&rdquo;&mdash;Hottoman.</note> in whose case no condition, no
            security, no petition has been interposed,&mdash;I do not say a just one, but none
            at all that had ever been heard of before that time. I wish to try an action about
            money. You cannot. But that is the point in dispute. It does not concern me; you must
            plead to a capital charges. Accuse me then, if it must be so. No says be, not unless
            you, in an unprecedented manner, first make your defence. You must plead; the time must
            be fixed at our pleasure; the judge himself shall be removed. <milestone n="72"
              unit="section"/>What then? Shall you be able to find any advocate, a man of such
            ancient principles of duty as to despise our splendour and influence? Lucius Philippus
            will be my advocate; in eloquence, in dignity, and in honour, the most flourishing man
            in the states. Hortensius will speak for me; a man eminent for his genius, and nobility,
            and reputation; and other most noble and powerful men will accompany me into court, the
            number and appearance of whom may alarm not only Publius Quinctius, who is defending
            himself on a capital charge, but even any one who is out of danger. <milestone n="73"
              unit="section"/> This really is what an unequal contest is; not that one in which you
            were skirmishing against Alphenus. You did not leave him any place where he could make a
            stand against you. You must therefore either prove that Alphenus denied he was his
            agent, did not tear down the bills, and refused to go to trial; or, if all this was
            done, you must admit that you did not take possession of the goods of Publius Quinctius
            in accordance with the edict. <milestone n="23" unit="chapter"/></p>
          <p>If, indeed, you did take possession of the things according to the edict, I ask you why
            they were not sold&mdash;why the others who were his securities and creditors did
            not meet together? Was there no one to whom Quinctius owed money? There were some, there
            were many such; because Caius, his brother, had left some amount of debt behind him.
            What then was the reason? They were all men entirely strangers to him, and he owed them
            money, and yet not one was found so notoriously infamous as to dare to attack the
            character of Publius Quinctius in his absences. <milestone n="74" unit="section"/> There
            was one man, his relation, his partner, his intimate friend, Sextus Naevius, who, though
            he himself was in reality in debt to him, as if some extraordinary prize of wickedness
            was proposed to him, strove with the greatest eagerness to deprive his own relation,
            oppressed and ruined by his means, not only of property which he had honestly acquired,
            but even of that light which is common to all men. Where were the rest of the creditors?
            Even now at this very time where are they? Who is there who says he kept out of the way
            for the sake of fraud? Who is there who denies that Quinctius was defended in his
            absence? <milestone n="75" unit="section"/> Not one is found But, on the other hand, all
            men who either have or have had any transactions with him are present on his behalf and
            are defending him; they are labouring that his good faith, known in many places, may not
            now be disparaged by the perfidy of Sextus Naevius. In a trial of this nature Naevius
            ought to have brought some witnesses out of that body, who could say; &ldquo;He
            forfeited his recognizances in my case; he cheated me, he begged a day of me for the
            payment of a debt which he had denied; could not get him to trial; he kept out of the
            way; he left no agent:&rdquo; none of all these things is said. Witnesses are being
            got ready to say it But we shall examine into that, I suppose, when they have said it:
            but let them consider this one thing, that they are of weight only so far, that they can
            preserve that weight, if they also preserve the truth; if they neglect that, they are so
            insignificant that all men may see that influence is of avail not to support a lie, but
            only to prove the truth. <milestone n="24" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="76"
              unit="section"/></p>
          <p>I ask these two questions. First of all, on what account Naevius did not complete the
            business he had undertaken; that is, why he did not sell the goods which he had taken
            possession of in accordance with the edict: Secondly, why out of so many other creditors
            no one reinforced his demand; so that you must of necessity confess that neither was any
            one of them so rash, and that you yourself were unable to persevere in and accomplish
            that which you had most infamously begun. What if you yourself, O Sextus Naevius,
            decided that the goods of Publius Quinctius had not been taken possession of according
            to the edict? I conceive that your evidence, which in a matter which did not concern
            yourself would be very worthless, ought to be of the greatest weight in an affair of
            your own when it makes against you. You bought the goods of Sextus Alphenus when Lucius
            Sulla, the dictator, sold them. You entered Quinctius in your books as the partner in
            the purchase of these goods.<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="la">Nomen</foreign> is
              especially used in reference to debts, because not only the amount of the debts, but
              also the name of the debtor is entered in the account books. Riddle's Dict. in v.
                <foreign lang="la">Nomen</foreign>.</note> I say no more. Did you enter into a
            voluntary partnership with that man who had cheated in a partnership to which he had
            succeeded by inheritance; <milestone n="77" unit="section"/>and did you by your own
            sentence approve of the man who you thought was stripped of his character and of all his
            fortunes? I had fears indeed, O Caius Aquillius, that I could not stand my ground in
            this cause with a mind sufficiently fortified and resolute. I thought thus, that, as
            Hortensius was going to speak against me, and as Philip was going to listen to me
            carefully, I should through fear stumble in many particulars. I said to Quintus Roscius
            here, whose sister is the wife of Publius Quinctius, when he asked of me, and, with the
            greatest earnestness, entreated me to defend his relation, that it was very difficult
            for me, not only to sum up a cause against such orators, but even to attempt to speak at
            all. When he pressed it more eagerly, I said to the man very familiarly, as our
            friendship justified, that a man appeared to me to have a very brazen face, who, while
            he was present, could attempt to use action in speaking, but those who contended with
            him himself, even though before that they seemed to have any skill or elegance, lost it,
            and that I was afraid lest something of the same sort would happen to me when I was
            going to speak against so great an artist. <milestone n="25" unit="chapter"/><milestone
              n="78" unit="section"/></p>
          <p>Then Roscius said many other things with a view to encourage me, and in truth, if he
            were to say nothing he would still move any one by the very silent affection and zeal
            which he felt for his relation. In truth, as he is an artist of that sort that he alone
            seems worthy of being looked at when he is on the stage, so he is also a man of such a
            sort that he alone seems to deserve never to go thither. &ldquo;But what,&rdquo;
            says he, &ldquo;if you have such a cause as this, that you have only to make this
            plain, that there is no one in two or three days at most can walk seven hundred miles?
            Will you still fear that you will not be able to argue this point against
            Hortensius?&rdquo; <milestone n="79" unit="section"/> &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said
            I. &ldquo;But what is that to the purpose?&rdquo; &ldquo;In
            truth,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that is what the cause turns upon.&rdquo;
            &ldquo;How so?&rdquo; He then explains to me an affair of that sort, and at the
            same time an action of Sextus Naevius, which, if that alone were alleged, ought to be
            sufficient. And I beg of you, O Caius Aquillius, and of you the assessors, that you will
            attend to it carefully. You will see, in truth, that on the one side there were engaged
            from the very beginning covetousness and audacity, that on the other side truth and
            modesty resisted as long as they could. You demand to be allowed to take possession of
            his goods according to the edict. On what day I wish to hear you yourself, O Naevius. I
            want this unheard-of action to be proved by the voice of the very man who has committed
            it. Mention the day, Naevius. The twentieth of February. Right, how far is it from hence
            to your estate in <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>? I ask you, Naevius.
            Seven hundred miles. Very well: Quinctius is driven off the estate. On what day? May we
            hear this also from you? Why are you silent? Tell me the day, I say.&mdash;He is
            ashamed to speak it. I understand; but he is ashamed too late, and to no purpose. He is
            driven off the estate on the twenty-third of February, O Caius Aquillius. Two days
            afterwards, or, even if any one had set off and run the moment he left the court, in
            under three days, he accomplishes seven hundred miles. <milestone n="80" unit="section"
            /> O incredible thing! O inconsiderate covetousness! O winged messenger! The agents and
            satellites of Sextus Naevius come from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>,
            across the <placeName key="tgn,2066659">Alps</placeName>, among the Segusiani in two
            days. O happy man who has such messengers, or rather Pegasi. <milestone n="26"
              unit="chapter"/></p>
          <p>Here I, even if all the Crassi were to stand forth with all the Antonies, if you, O
            Lucius Philippus, who flourished among those men, choose to plead this cause, with
            Hortensius for your colleague, yet I must get the best of it. For everything does not
            depend, as you two think it does, on eloquence. There is still some truth so manifest
            that nothing can weaken it. <milestone n="81" unit="section"/> Did you, before you made
            the demand to be allowed to take possession of his goods, send any one to take care that
            the master should be driven by force off the estate by his own slaves? Choose whichever
            you like; the one is incredible; the other abominable; and both are unheard-of before
            this time. Do you mean that any one ran over seven hundred miles in two days? Tell me.
            Do you deny it? Then you sent some one beforehand. I had rather you did. For if you were
            to say that, you would be seen to tell an impudent lie: when you confess this, you admit
            that you did a thing which you cannot conceal even by a lies. Will such a design, so
            covetous, so audacious, so precipitate, be approved of by Aquillius and by such men as
            he is? <milestone n="82" unit="section"/> What does this madness, what does this baste,
            what does this precipitation intimate? Does it not prove violence? does it not prove
            wickedness? does it not prove robbery? does it not, in short, prove everything rather
            than right, than duty, or than modesty? You send some one without the command of the
            praetor. With what intention? You knew he would order it. What then? When he had ordered
            it, could you not have sent then? You were about to ask him. When? Thirty days after.
            Yes, if nothing hindered you; if the same intention existed; if you were well; in short,
            if you were alive. The praetor would have made the order, I suppose, if he chose, if he
            was well, if he was in court, if no one objected, by giving security according to his
            decree, and by being willing to stand a trial. <milestone n="83" unit="section"/> For,
            by the immortal gods, if Alphenus, the agent of Publius Quinctius, were then willing to
            give security and to stand a trial, and in short to do everything which you chose, what
            would you do? Would you recall him whom you had sent into <placeName key="tgn,1000070"
              >Gaul</placeName>? But this man would have been already expelled from his farm,
            already driven headlong from his home, already (the most unworthy thing of all)
            assaulted by the hands of his own slaves, in obedience to your messenger and command.
            You would, forsooth, make amends for these things afterwards. Do you dare to speak of
            the life of any man, you who must admit this,&mdash;that you were so blinded by
            covetousness and avarice, that, though you did not know what would happen afterwards,
            but many things might happen, you placed your hope from a present crime in the uncertain
            event of the future? And I say this, just as if, at that very time when the praetor had
            ordered you to take possession according to his edict, you had sent any one to take
            possession, you either ought to, or could have ejected Publius Quinctius from
            possession. <milestone n="27" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="84" unit="section"/></p>
          <p>Everything, O Caius Aquillius, is of such a nature that any one may be able to perceive
            that in this cause dishonesty and interest are contending with poverty and truth. How
            did the praetor order you to take possession? I suppose, in accordance with his edict.
            In what words was the recognizance drawn up? &ldquo;If the goods of Publius
            Quinctius have been taken possession of in accordance with the praetor's
            edict.&rdquo; Let us return to the edict. How does that enjoin you to take
            possession? Is there any pretence, O Caius Aquillius, if he took possession in quite a
            different way from that which the praetor enjoined, for denying that then he did not
            take possession according to the edict, but that I have beaten him in the trial? None, I
            imagine. Let us refer to the edict.&mdash;&ldquo;They who in accordance with my
            edict have come into possession.&rdquo; He is speaking of you, Naevius, as you
            think; for you say that you came into possession according to the edict. He defines for
            you what you are to do; he instructs you; he gives you precepts. &ldquo;It seems
            that those ought to be in possession.&rdquo; How? &ldquo;That which they can
            rightly secure in the place where they now are, let them secure there; that which they
            cannot, they may carry or lead away.&rdquo; What then? &ldquo;It is not
            right,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;to drive away the owner against his
            will.&rdquo; The very man who with the object of cheating is keeping out of the way,
            the very man who deals dishonestly with all his creditors, he forbids to be driven off
            his farm against his will. <milestone n="85" unit="section"/> As you are on your way to
            take possession, O Sextus Naevius, the praetor himself openly says to
            you&mdash;&ldquo;Take possession in such manner that Naevius may have possession
            at the same time with you; take possession in such a manner that no violence may be
            offered to Quinctius.&rdquo; What? how do you observe that? I say nothing of his not
            having been a man who was keeping out of the way, of his being a man who had a house, a
            wife, children, and an agent at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>; I say
            nothing of all this: I say this, that the owner was expelled from his farm; that hands
            were laid on their master by his own slaves, before his own household gods; I say <gap
              desc="*****"/>
            <milestone n="28" unit="chapter"/></p>
          <p>I say too that Naevius never even asked Quinctius for the money, when he was with him,
            and might have sued him every day; because he preferred that all the most perplexing
            modes of legal proceedings should take place, to his own great discredit, and to the
            greatest danger of Publius Quinctius, rather than allow of the simple trial about money
            matters which could have been got through in one day; from which one trial he admits
            that all these arose and proceeded. On which occasion I offered a condition, if he was
            determined to demand the money, that Publius Quinctius should give security to submit to
            the decision, if he also, if Quinctius had any demands upon him, would submit to the
            like conditions. <milestone n="86" unit="section"/> I showed how many things ought to be
            done before a demand was made that the goods of a relation should be taken possession
            of; especially when he had at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> his house,
            his wife, his children, and an agent who was equally an intimate friend of both. I
            proved that when he said the recognizances were forfeited, there were actually no
            recognizances at all; that on the day on which he says he gave him the promise, he was
            not even at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. I promised that I would make
            that plain by witnesses, who both must know the truth, and who had no reason for
            speaking falsely. I proved also that it was not possible that the goods should have been
            taken possession of according to the edict; because he was neither said to have kept out
            of the way for the purpose of fraud, nor to have left the country in banishment.
              <milestone n="87" unit="section"/> The charge remains, that no one defended him at the
            trial. In opposition to which I argued that he was most abundantly defended, and that
            not by a man unconnected with him, nor by any slanderous or worthless person, but by a
            Roman knight, his own relation and intimate friend, whom Sextus Naevius himself had been
            accustomed previously to leave as his own agent. And that even if he did appeal to the
            tribunes, he was not on that account the less prepared to submit to a trial; and that
            Naevius had not had his rights wrested from him by the powerful interest of the agent;
            that on the other hand he was so much superior to us in interest that he now scarcely
            gives us the liberty of breathing. <milestone n="29" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="88"
              unit="section"/></p>
          <p>I asked what the reason was why the goods had not been sold, since they had been taken
            possession of according to the edict. Secondly, I asked this also, on what account not
            one of so many creditors either did the same thing then, why not one speaks against him
            now, but why they are all striving for Publius Quinctius? Especially when in such a
            trial the testimonies of creditors are thought exceedingly material. After that, I
            employed the testimony of the adversary, who lately entered as his partner the man who,
            according to the language of his present claim, <note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="la"
                >Intentio</foreign> was the technical legal term for the claim made by the
              plaintiff.</note> he demonstrates was at that time not even in the number of living
            men. Then I mentioned that incredible rapidity, or rather audacity of his. I showed that
            it was inevitable, either that seven hundred miles had been run over in two days, or
            that Sextus Naevius had sent men to take possession many days before he demanded leave
            so to seize his goods. <milestone n="89" unit="section"/> After that I recited the
            edict, which expressly forbade the owner to be driven off his by which it was plain that
            Naevius had not taken possession according to the edict, as he confessed that Quinctius
            had been driven off his farm by force. But I thoroughly proved that the goods had
            actually not been taken possession of, because such a seizure of goods is looked at not
            as to part but with respect to everything which can be seized or taken possession of. I
            said that he had a house at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> which that
            fellow never even made an attempt on; that he had many slaves, of which he neither took
            possession of any, and did not even touch any; that there was one whom he attempted to
            touch; that he was forbidden to, and that he remained quiet. <milestone n="90"
              unit="section"/> You know also that Sextus Naevius never came on to the private farms
            of Quinctius even in <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>. Lastly I proved that
            the private servants of Quinctius were not all driven away from that very estate which
            he took possession of, having expelled his partner by force. From which, and from all
            the other sayings, and actions, and thoughts of Sextus Naevius, any one can understand
            that that fellow did nothing else, and is now doing nothing, but endeavouring by
            violence, by injustice, and by unfair means at this trial, to make the whole farm his
            own which belongs to both partners in common. <milestone n="30" unit="chapter"
              /><milestone n="91" unit="section"/></p>
          <p>Now that I have summed up the whole cause the affair itself and the magnitude of the
            danger, O Caius Aquillius, seem to make it necessary for Publius Quinctius to solicit
            and entreat you and your colleagues, by his old age and his desolate condition, merely
            to follow the dictates or your own nature and goodness; so that as the truth is on his
            side, his necessitous state may move you to pity rather than the influence of the other
            party to cruelty. <milestone n="92" unit="section"/> From the self same day when we came
            before you as judges, we began to disregard all the threats of those men which before we
            were alarmed at. If cause was to contend with cause we are sure that we could easily
            prove ours to any one but as the course of life of the one was to be contested with the
            course of life of the other, we thought we had on that account even more need of you as
            our judge. For this is the very point now in question, whether the rustic and unpolished
            economy of my client can defend itself against the luxury and licentiousness of the
            other or whether, homely as it is, and stripped of all ornaments, it is to lie handed
            over naked to covetousness and wantonness. <milestone n="93" unit="section"/> Publius
            Naevius does not compare himself with you, O Sextus Naevius, he does not vie with you in
            riches or power. He gives up to you all the arts by which you are great; he confesses
            that he does not speak elegantly; that he is not able to say pleasant things to people;
            that he does not abandon a friendship when his friend is in distress, and fly off to
            another which is in flourishing circumstances; that he does not give magnificent and
            splendid banquets; that he has not a house closed against modesty and holiness, but open
            and as it were exposed to cupidity and debauchery; on the other hand he says that duty,
            good faith, industry and a life which has been always austere and void of pleasure has
            been his choice; he knows that the opposite course is more fashionable, and that by such
            habits people have more influence. What then shall be done? <milestone n="94"
              unit="section"/> They have not so much more influence, that those who, having
            abandoned the strict discipline of virtuous men, have chosen rather to follow the gains
            and extravagance of Gallonius,<note anchored="yes">Gallonius was a crier also, branded
              by Horace as notorious for extravagance and luxury. <quote lang="la">
                <l>Galloni praeconis erat acipensere mensa </l>

              </quote>&mdash;<bibl n="Hor. Carm. 2.2.47">Hor. Sat. 2.2.47</bibl>.</note> and
            have even spent their liven in audacity and perfidy which were no part of his character,
            should have absolute dominion over the lives and fortunes of honourable men. If he may
            be allowed to live where Sextus Naevius does not wish to, if there is room in the city
            for an honest man against the will of Naevius; if Publius Quinctius may be allowed to
            breathe in opposition to the nod and sovereign power of Naevius; if under your
            protection, he can preserve in opposition to the insolence of his enemy the ornaments
            which he has acquired by virtue, there is hope that this unfortunate and wretched man
            may at last be able to rest in peace. But if Naevius is to have power to do everything
            he chooses, and if he chooses what is unlawful, what is to be done? What God is to be
            appealed to? The faith of what man can we invoke? What complaints, what lamentations can
            be devised adequate to so great a calamity. <milestone n="31" unit="chapter"/><milestone
              n="95" unit="section"/></p>
          <p>It is a miserable thing to be despoiled of all one's fortunes; it is more miserable
            still to be so unjustly. It is a bitter thing to be circumvented by any one, more bitter
            still to be so by a relation. It is a calamitous thing to be stripped of one's goods,
            more calamitous still if accompanied by disgrace. It is an intolerable injury to be
            slain by a brave and honourable man, more intolerable still to be slain by one whose
            voice has been prostituted to the trade of a crier. It is an unworthy thing to be
            conquered by one's equal or one's superior, more unworthy still by one's inferior, by
            one lower than oneself. It is a grievous thing to be handed over with one's goods to
            another, more grievous still to be handed over to an enemy. It is a horrible thing to
            have to plead to a capital charge, more horrible still to have to speak in one's own
            defence before one's accuser speaks. <milestone n="96" unit="section"/> Quinctius has
            looked round on all sides, has encountered every danger. He was not only unable to find
            a praetor from whom he could obtain a trial, much less one from whom he could obtain one
            on his own terms, but he could not even move the friends of Sextus Naevius, at whose
            feet he often lay, and that for a long time, entreating them by the immortal Gods either
            to contest the point with him according to law, or at least, if they must do him
            injustice, to do it without ignominy. <milestone n="97" unit="section"/> Last of all he
            approached the haughty countenance of his very enemy; weeping he took the hand of Sextus
            Naevius, well practised in advertising the goods of his relations. He entreated him by
            the ashes of his dead brother by the name of their relationship, by his own wife and
            children to whom no one is a nearer relation than Publius Quinctius, at length to take
            pity on him, to have some regard, if not for their relationship, at least for his age,
            if not for a man, at least for humanity, to terminate the matter on any conditions as
            long as they were only endurable, leaving his character unimpeached. <milestone n="98"
              unit="section"/> Being rejected by him, getting no assistance from his friends being
            passed and frightened by every magistrate he has no one but you whom he can appeal to
            you he commends himself to you he commends all his property and fortunes to you he
            commends his character and his hopes for the remainder of his life. Harassed by much
            contumely suffered in under many injuries he flies to you not unworthy but unfortunate;
            driven out of a beautiful farm with his enemies attempting to fix every possible mark of
            ignominy on him, seeing his adversary the owner of his paternal property, while he
            himself is unable to make up a dowry for his marriageable daughter, he has still done
            nothing inconsistent with his former life. <milestone n="99" unit="section"/> Therefore
            be begs this of you, O Caius Aquillius, that he may be allowed to carry with him out of
            this place the character and the probity which, now that his life is nearly come to an
            end, he brought with him before your tribunal. That he, of whose virtue no one ever
            doubted, may not in his sixtieth year be branded with disgrace, with stigma, and with
            the most shameful ignominy; that Sextus Naevius may not array himself in all his
            ornaments as spoils of victory; that it may not be owing to you that the character,
            which has accompanied Publius Quinctius to his old age, does not attend him to the

            <p>Cicero himself in this speech calls this trial the first public, that is criminal
              cause in which he was engaged; and many critics consider it an earlier speech than the
              preceding one for Quinctius. The case was this: The father of Sextus Roscius had been
              slain during the proscriptions of Sulla, and his estate, which was very large, had
              been sold for a very trifling sum to Lucius Cornelius Chrysogonus, a favourite slave
              to whom Sulla had given his freedom; and Chrysogonus, to secure possession of it,
              persuaded a man named Caius Erucius to accuse Roscius of having killed his father
              himself. Many lawyers refused to defend him, being afraid of Sulla, whose influence
              was openly used for his freedman. Roscius was acquitted. Cicero often refers with
              great complacency to his conduct in this suit, as a proof of his intrepidity, and of
              his resolute honesty in discharging the duties of an advocate without being dismayed
              at the opposition of the greatest men in <placeName key="perseus,Rome"

          <p>I imagine that you, O judges, are marvelling why it is that when so many most eminent
            orators and most noble men are sitting still, I above all others should get up, who
            neither for age, nor for ability, nor for influence, am to be compared to those who are
            sitting still. For all these men whom you see present at this trial think that a man
            ought to be defended against all injury contrived against him by unrivalled wickedness;
            but through the sad state of the times they do not dare to defend him themselves. So it
            comes to pass that they are present here because they are attending to their business,
            but they are silent because they are afraid of danger. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
            What then? Am I the boldest of all these men? By no means. Am I then so much more
            attentive to my duties than the rest? I am not so covetous of even that praise, as to
            wish to rob others of it. What is it then which has impelled me beyond all the rest to
            undertake the cause of Sextus Roscius? Because, if any one of those men, men of the
            greatest weight and dignity, whom you see present, had spoken, had said one word about
            public affairs, as must be done in this case, he would be thought to have said much more
            than he really had said. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> But if I should say all the
            things which must be said with ever so much freedom, yet my speech will never go forth
            or be diffused among the people in the same manner. Secondly, because anything said by
            the others cannot be obscure, because of their nobility and dignity, and cannot be
            excused as being spoken carelessly, on account of their age and prudence; but if I say
            anything with too much freedom, it may either be altogether concealed, because I have
            not yet mixed in public affairs, or pardoned on account of my youth; although not only
            the method of pardoning, but even the habit of examining into the truth is now
            eradicated from the State. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> There is this reason, also,
            that perhaps the request to undertake this cause was made to the others so that they
            thought they could comply or refuse without prejudice to their duty; but those men
            applied to me who have the greatest weight with me by reason of their friendship with
            me, of the kindnesses they have done me, and of their own dignity; whose kindness to me
            I could not be ignorant of whose authority I could not despise, whose desires I could
            not neglect. <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
          <p>On these accounts I have stood forward as the advocate in this cause, not as being the
            one selected who could plead with the greatest ability, but as the one left of the whole
            body who could do so with the least danger; and not in order that Sextus Roscius might
            he defended by a sufficiently able advocacy, but that he might not be wholly abandoned.
            Perhaps you may ask, What is that dread, and what is that alarm which hinders so many,
            and such eminent men, from being willing, as they usually are, to plead on behalf of the
            life and fortunes of another? And it is not strange that you are as yet ignorant of
            this, because all mention of the matter which has given rise to this trial has been
            designedly omitted by the accusers. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> What is that
            matter? The property of the father of this Sextus Roscius, which is six millions of
              <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign>, which one of the most powerful young men of
            our city at this present time, Lucius Cornelius Chrysogonus, says he bought of that most
            gallant and most illustrious man Lucius Sulla, whom I only name to do him honour, for
            two thousand <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign>. He, O judges, demands of you that,
            since he, without any right, has taken possession of the property of another, so
            abundant and so splendid, and as the life of Sextus Roscius appears to him to stand in
            the way of and to hinder his possession of that property, you will efface from his mind
            every suspicion, and remove all his fear. He does not think that, while this man is
            safe, he himself can keep possession of the ample and splendid patrimony of this
            innocent man; but if he be convicted and got rid of, he hopes he may be able to waste
            and squander in luxury what he has acquired by wickedness. He begs that you will take
            from his mind this uneasiness which day and night is pricking and harassing him, so as
            to profess yourselves his assistants in enjoying this his nefariously acquired booty.
              <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> If his demand seems to you just and honourable, O
            judges, I, on the other hand, proffer this brief request, and one, as I persuade myself,
            somewhat more reasonable still. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/></p>
          <p>First of all, I ask of Chrysogonus to be content with our money and our fortunes, and
            not to seek our blood and our lives. In the second place, I beg you, O judges, to resist
            the wickedness of audacious men; to relieve the calamities of the innocent, and in the
            cause of Sextus Roscius to repel the danger which is being aimed at every one.
              <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> But if any pretence for the accusation&mdash;if
            any suspicion of this act&mdash;if, in short, any, the least thing be
            found,&mdash;so that in bringing forward this accusation they shall seem to have had
            some real object,&mdash;if you find any cause whatever for it, except that plunder
            which I have mentioned, I will not object to the life of Sextus Roscius being abandoned
            to their pleasure. But if there is no other object in it, except to prevent anything
            being wanting to those men, whom nothing can satisfy, if this alone is contended for at
            this moment, that the condemnation of Sextus Roscius may be added as a sort of crown, as
            it were, to this rich and splendid booty,&mdash;though many things be infamous,
            still is not this the most infamous of all things, that you should be thought fitting
            men for these fellows now to expect to obtain by means of your sentences and your oaths,
            what they have hitherto been in the habit of obtaining by wickedness and by the sword;
            that though you have been chosen out of the state into the senate because of your
            dignity, and out of the senate into this body because of your inflexible love of
            justice&mdash;still assassins and gladiators should ask of you, not only to allow
            them to escape the punishment which they ought to fear and dread at your hands for their
            crimes, but also that they may depart from this court adorned and enriched with the
            spoils of Sextus Roscius? <milestone n="4" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="9"

          <p>Of such important and such atrocious actions, I am aware that I can neither speak with
            sufficient propriety, nor complain with sufficient dignity, nor cry out against with
            sufficient freedom. For my want of capacity is a hindrance to my speaking with
            propriety; my age, to my speaking with dignity; the times themselves are an obstacle to
            my speaking with freedom. To this is added great fear, which both nature and my modesty
            cause me, and your dignity, and the violence of our adversaries, and the danger of
            Sextus Roscius. On which account, I beg and entreat of you, O judges, to hear what I
            have to say with attention, and with your favourable construction. <milestone n="10"
              unit="section"/> Relying on your integrity and wisdom, I have undertaken a greater
            burden than, I am well aware, I am able to bear. If you, in some degree, lighten this
            burden, O judges, I will bear it as well as I can with zeal and industry. But if, as I
            do not expect, I am abandoned by you, still I will not fail in courage, and I will bear
            what I have undertaken as well as I can. But if I cannot support it, I had rather be
            overwhelmed by the weight of my duty, than either through treachery betray, or through
            weakness of mind desert, that which has been once honestly entrusted to me. <milestone
              n="11" unit="section"/> I also, above all things, entreat you, O Marcus Fannius, to
            show yourself at this present time both to us and to the Roman people the same man that
            you formerly showed yourself to the Roman people when you before presided at the trial
            in this same cause. <note anchored="yes">Fannius had been praetor, and before a cause
              came to actual trial, in came before the praetor, who decided whether there were
              sufficient grounds for allowing the trial to proceed; much as our grand jury does
              now.</note>
            <milestone n="5" unit="chapter"/></p>
          <p>You see how great a crowd of men has come to this trial. You are aware how great is the
            expectation of men, and how great their desire that the decisions of the courts of law
            should be severe and impartial. After a long interval, this is the first cause about
            matters of bloodshed which has been brought into court, though most shameful and
            important murders have been committed in that interval. All men hope that while you are
            praetor, these trials concerning manifest crimes, and the daily murders which take
            place, will be conducted with no less severity than this one. <milestone n="12"
              unit="section"/> We who are pleading this cause adopt the exclamations which in other
            trials the accusers are in the habit of using. We entreat of you, O Marcus Fannius, and
            of you, O judges, to punish crimes with the greatest energy; to resist audacious men
            with the greatest boldness; to consider that unless you show in this cause what your
            disposition is, the covetousness and wickedness, and audacity of men will increase to
            such a pitch that murders will take place not only secretly, but even here in the forum,
            before your tribunal, O Marcus Fannius; before your feet, O judges, among the very
            benches of the court. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> In truth, what else is aimed at
            by this trial, except that it may be lawful to commit such acts? They are the accusers
            who have invaded this man's fortunes. He is pleading his cause as defendant, to whom
            these men have left nothing except misfortune. They are the accusers, to whom it was an
            advantage that the father of Sextus Roscius should be put to death. He is the defendant,
            to whom the death of his father has brought not only grief, but also poverty. They are
            the accusers, who have exceedingly desired to put this man himself to death. He is the
            defendant who has come even to this very trial with a guard, lest he should be slain
            here in this very place, before your eyes. Lastly, they are the accusers whom the people
            demand punishment on, as the guilty parties. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> He is
            the defendant, who remains as the only one left after the impious slaughter committed by
            them. And that you may be the more easily able to understand, O judges, that what has
            been done is still more infamous than what we mention, we will explain to you from the
            beginning how the matter was managed, so that you may the more easily be able to
            perceive both the misery of this most innocent man, and their audacity, and the calamity
            of the republic. <milestone n="6" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="15" unit="section"/></p>
          <p>Sextus Roscius, the father of this man, was a citizen <note anchored="yes">A <foreign

            of great influence, from the affection and the ties of hospitality by which he was
            connected with the most noble men of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. For
            he had not only connections of hospitality with the Metelli, the Servilii, and the
            Scipios, but he had also actual acquaintance and intimacy with them; families which I
            name, as it is right I should, only to express my sense of their honour and dignity. And
            of all his property he has left this alone to his son,&mdash;for domestic robbers
            have possession of his patrimony, which they have seized by force the fame and life of

            /> As he had at all times been a favourer of the side of the nobility, so, too, in this
            last disturbance, when the dignity and safety of all the nobles was in danger, he,
            beyond all others in that neighbourhood, defended that party and that cause with all his
            might, and zeal, and influence. He thought it right, in truth, that he should fight in
            defence of their honour, on account of whom he himself was reckoned most honourable
            among his fellow-citizens. After the victory was declared, and we had given up arms,
            when men were being proscribed, and when they who were supposed to be enemies were being
            taken in every district, he was constantly at <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
              >Rome</placeName>, and in the Forum, and was daily in the sight of every one; so that
            he seemed rather to exult in the victory of the nobility, than to be afraid lest any
            disaster should result to him from it. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> He had an
            ancient quarrel with two Roscii of <placeName key="perseus,Ameria">Ameria</placeName>,
            one of whom I see sitting in the seats of the accusers, the other I hear is in
            possession of three of this man's farms; and if he had been as well able to guard
            against their enmity as he was in the habit of fearing it, he would be alive now. And, O
            judges, he was not afraid without reason. In these two Roscii, (one of whom is surnamed
            Capito; the one who is present here is called Magnus,) are men of this sort. One of them
            is an old and experienced gladiator, who has gained many victories, but this one here
            has lately betaken himself to him as his tutor: and though, before this contest, he was
            a mere tyro in knowledge, he easily surpassed his tutor himself in wickedness and
            audacity. <milestone n="7" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="18" unit="section"/></p>
          <p>For when this Sextus Roscius was at <placeName key="perseus,Ameria">Ameria</placeName>,
            but that Titus Roscius at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>; while the
            former, the son, was diligently attending to the farm, and in obedience to his father's
            desire had given himself up entirely to his domestic affairs and to a rustic life, but
            the other man was constantly at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, Sextus
            Roscius, returning home after supper, is slain near the <placeName key="tgn,3000935"
              >Palatine</placeName> baths. I hope from this very fact, that it is not obscure on
            whom the suspicion of the crime falls; but if the whole affair does not itself make
            plain that which as yet is only to be suspected, I give you leave to say my client is
            implicated in the guilt. <milestone n="19" unit="section"/> When Sextus Roscius was
            slain, the first person who brings the news to <placeName key="perseus,Ameria"
              >Ameria</placeName>, is a certain Mallius Glaucia, a man of no consideration, a
            freedman, the client and intimate friend of that Titus Roscius; and he brings the news
            to the house, not of the son, but of Titus Capito, his enemy, and though he had been
            slain about the first hour of the night, this messenger arrives at <placeName
              key="perseus,Ameria">Ameria</placeName> by the first dawn of day. In ten hours of the
            night he travelled fifty-six miles in a gig; not only to be the first to bring his enemy
            the wished-for news, but to show him the blood of his enemy still quite fresh, and the
            weapon only lately extracted from his body. <milestone n="20" unit="section"/> Four days
            after this happened, news of the deed is brought to Chrysogonus to the camp of Lucius
            Sulla at Volaterra. The greatness of his fortune is pointed out to him, the excellence
            of his farms,&mdash;for he left behind him thirteen farms, which nearly all border
            on the Tiber&mdash;the poverty and desolate condition of his son is mentioned they
            point out that, as the father of this, man, Sextus Roscius a man so magnificent and so
            popular, was slain without any trouble this man, imprudent and unpolished as he was and
            unknown at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, might easily be removed. They
            promise their assistance for this business; not to detain you longer, O judges, a
            conspiracy is formed. <milestone n="8" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="21" unit="section"
            /></p>
          <p>As at this time there was no mention of a proscription, and as even those who had been
            afraid of it before, were returning and thinking themselves now delivered from their
            dangers, the name of Sextus Roscius, a man most zealous for the nobility, is proscribed
            and his goods sold; Chrysogonus is the purchaser; three of his finest farms, are given
            to Capito for his own, and he possesses them to this day; all the rest of his property
            that fellow Titus Roscius seizes in the name of Chrysogonus, as he says himself. This
            property, worth six millions of <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign>, is bought for
            two thousand. I well know, O judges, that all this was done without the knowledge of
            Lucius Sulla; <milestone n="22" unit="section"/> and it is not strange that while he is
            surveying at the same time both the things which are past, and those which seem to be
            impending; when he alone has, the authority to establish peace, and the power of
            carrying on war; when all are looking to him alone, and he alone is directing all
            things; when he is occupied incessantly by such numerous and such important affairs that
            he cannot breathe freely, it is not strange, I say, if he fails to notice some things;
            especially when so many men are watching his, busy condition, and catch their
            opportunity of doing something of this sort the moment he looks away. To this is added,
            that although he is fortunate, as indeed he is, yet no man can have such good fortune,
            as in a vast household to have no one, whether slave or freedman, of worthless
            character. <milestone n="23" unit="section"/> In the meantime Titus Roscius, excellent
            man, the agent of Chrysogonus, comes to <placeName key="perseus,Ameria"
              >Ameria</placeName>; he enters on this man's farm; turns this miserable man,
            overwhelmed with grief, who had not yet performed all the ceremonies of his father's
            funeral, naked out of his house, and drives him headlong from his paternal hearth and
            household gods; he himself becomes the owner of abundant wealth. He who had been in
            great poverty when he had only his own property, became, as is usual, insolent when in
            possession of the property of another; he carried many things openly off to his own
            house; he removed still more privily; he gave no little abundantly and extravagantly to
            his assistants; the rest he sold at a regular auction. <milestone n="9" unit="chapter"
              /><milestone n="24" unit="section"/></p>
          <p>Which appeared to the citizens of <placeName key="perseus,Ameria">Ameria</placeName> so
            scandalous, that there was weeping and lamentation over the whole city. In truth, many
            things calculated to cause grief were brought at once before their eyes; the most cruel
            death of a most prosperous man, Sextus Roscius, and the most scandalous distress of his
            son; to whom that infamous robber had not left out of so rich a patrimony even enough
            for a road to his father's tomb; the flagitious purchase of his property, the flagitious
            possession of it; thefts, plunders, largesses. There was no one who would not rather
            have had it all burnt, than see Titus Roscius acting as owner of and glorying in the
            property of Sextus Roscius, a most virtuous and honourable man. <milestone n="25"
              unit="section"/> Therefore a decree of their senate is, immediately passed, that the
            ten chief men <note anchored="yes">The <foreign lang="la">decuriones</foreign> were the
              senators in a colony. Only a <foreign lang="la">decuric</foreign> could be a
              magistrate, and their body possessed whatever power had once belonged to the
              community. Smith, Dict. Ant. v. <foreign lang="la">Colonia</foreign>.</note> should go
            to Lucius Sulla, and explain to him what a man Sextus Roscius had been; should complain
            of the wickedness and outrages of those fellows, should entreat him to see to the
            preservation both of the character of the dead man, and of the fortunes of his innocent
            son, And observe, I entreat you, this decree&mdash; [here the decree is read]
            &mdash;The deputies come to the camp. It is now seen, O judges, as I said before,
            that these crimes and atrocities were committed without the knowledge of Lucius Sulla.
            For immediately Chrysogonus himself comes to them, and sends some men of noble birth to
            them too, to beg them not to go to Sulla, and to promise them that Chrysogonus, will do
            everything which they wish. <milestone n="26" unit="section"/> But to such a degree was
            he alarmed, that he would rather have died than have let Sulla be informed of these
            things. These old-fashioned men, who judged of others by their own nature, when he
            pledged himself to have the name of Sextus Roscius removed from the lists of
            proscription, and to give up the farms unoccupied to his son, and when Titus Roscius
            Capito, who was one of the ten deputies, added his promise that it should be so,
            believed him; they returned to <placeName key="perseus,Ameria">Ameria</placeName>
            without presenting their petition. And at first those fellows began every day to put the
            matter off and to procrastinate; then they began to be more indifferent; to do nothing
            and to trifle with them; at last, as was easily perceived, they began to contrive plots
            against the life of this Sextus Roscius, and to think that they could no longer keep
            possession of another man's property while the owner was alive. <milestone n="10"

          <p>As soon as he perceived this, by the advice of his friends and relations he fled to

            daughter of Nepos, (whom I name to do her honour,) with whom his father had been
            exceedingly intimate; a woman in whom, O judges, even now, as all men are of opinion, as
            if it were to serve as a model, traces of the old-fashioned virtue remain. She received
            into her house Sextus Roscius, helpless, turned and driven out of his home and property,
            flying from the weapons and threats of robbers, and she assisted her guest now that he
            was overwhelmed and now that his safety was despaired of by every one. By her virtue and
            good faith and diligence it has been caused that he now is rather classed as a living
            man among the accused, than as a dead man among the proscribed. <milestone n="28"
              unit="section"/> For after they perceived that the life of Sextus Roscius was
            protected with the greatest care, and that there was no possibility of their murdering
            him, they adopted a counsel full of wickedness and audacity, namely, that of accusing
            him of parricide; of procuring some veteran accuser to support the charge, who could say
            something even in a case in which there was no suspicion whatever; and lastly, as they
            could not have any chance against him by the accusation, to prevail against him on
            account of the time; for men began to say, that no trial had taken place for such a
            length of time, that the first man who was brought to trial ought to be condemned; and
            they thought that he would have no advocates because of the influence of Chrysogonus;
            that no one would say a word about the sale of the property and about that conspiracy;
            that because of the mere name of parricide and the atrocity of the crime he would be put
            out of the way, without any trouble, as he was defended by no one. <milestone n="29"
              unit="section"/> With this plan, and urged on to such a degree by this madness, they
            have handed the man over to you to be put to death, whom they themselves, when they
            wished, were unable to murder. <milestone n="11" unit="chapter"/></p>
          <p>What shall I complain of first? or from what point had I best begin, O judges? or what
            assistance shall I seek, or from whom? Shall I implore at this time the aid of the
            immortal gods, or that of the Roman people, or of your integrity, you who have the
            supreme power? <milestone n="30" unit="section"/> The father infamously murdered; the
            house besieged; the property taken away, seized and plundered by enemies; the life of
            the son, hostile to their purposes, attacked over and over again by sword and treachery.
            What wickedness does there seem to be wanting in these numberless atrocities? And yet
            they crown and add to them by other nefarious deeds, they invent an incredible
            accusation; they procure witnesses against him and accusers of him by bribery; they
            offer the wretched man this alternative, whether he would prefer to expose his neck to
            Roscius to be assassinated by him, or, being sewn in a sack, to lose his life with the
            greatest infamy. They thought advocates would be wanting to him; they are wanting. There
            is not wanting in truth, O judges, one who will speak with freedom, and who will defend
            him with integrity, which is quite sufficient in this cause, (since I have undertaken
            it). <milestone n="31" unit="section"/> And perhaps in undertaking this cause I may have
            acted rashly, in obedience to the impulses of youth; but since I have once undertaken
            it, although forsooth every sort of terror and every possible danger were to threaten me
            on all sides, yet I will support and encounter them. I have deliberately resolved not
            only to say everything which I think is material to the cause, but to say it also
            willingly, boldly, and freely. Nothing can ever be of such importance in my mind that
            fear should be able to put a greater constraint on me than a regard to good faith.
              <milestone n="32" unit="section"/> Who, indeed, is of so profligate a disposition, as,
            when he sees these things, to be able to be silent and to disregard them? You have
            murdered my father when he had not been proscribed; you have classed him when murdered
            in the number of proscribed persons; you have driven me by force from my house; you are
            in possession of my patrimony. What would you more? have you not come even before the
            bench with sword and arms, that you may either convict Sextus Roscius or murder him in
            this presence? <milestone n="12" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="33" unit="section"/></p>
          <p>We lately had a most audacious man in this city, Caius Fimbria, a man, as is well known
            among all except among those who are mad themselves, utterly insane. He, when at the
            funeral of Caius Marius, had contrived that Quintus Scaevola, the most venerable and
            accomplished man in our city, should be wounded;&mdash;(a man in whose praise there
            is neither room to say much here, nor indeed is it possible to say more than the Roman
            people preserves in its recollection)&mdash;he, I say, brought an accusation against
            Scaevola, when he found that he might possibly live. When the question was asked him,
            what he was going to accuse that man of, whom no one could praise in a manner
            sufficiently suitable to his worth, they say that the man, like a madman as he was,
            answered, for not having received the whole weapon in his body. A more lamentable thing
            was never seen by the Roman people, unless it were the death of that same man, which was
            so important that it crushed and broke the hearts of all his fellow-citizens; for
            endeavouring to save whom by an arrangement, he was destroyed by them. <note
              anchored="yes">Scaevola was trying to effect an accommodation between the parties of
              Sulla and Marius when he was murdered by them. </note>
            <milestone n="34" unit="section"/> Is not this case very like that speech and action of
            Fimbria? You are accusing Sextus Roscius. Why so? Because he escaped out of your hands;
            because he did not allow himself to be murdered. The one action, because it was done
            against Scaevola, appears scandalous; this one, because it is done by Chrysogonus, is
            intolerable. For, in the name of the immortal gods, what is there in this cause that
            requires a defence? What topic is there requiring the ability of an advocate, or even
            very much needing eloquence of speech? Let us, O judges, unfold the whole case, and when
            it is set before our eyes, let us consider it; by this means you will easily understand
            on what the whole case turns, and on what matters I ought to dwell, and what decision
            you ought to come to. <milestone n="13" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="35" unit="section"
            /></p>
          <p>There are three things, as I think, which are at the present time hindrances to Sextus
            Roscius:&mdash;the charge brought by his adversaries, their audacity, and their
            power. Erucius has taken on himself the pressing of this false charge as accuser; the
            Roscii have claimed for themselves that part which is to be executed by audacity; but
            Chrysogonus, as being the person of the greatest influence, employs his influence in the
            contest. On all these points I am aware that I must speak. <milestone n="36"
              unit="section"/> What then am I to say? I must not speak in the same manner on them
            all; because the first topic indeed belongs to my duty, but the two others the Roman
            people have imposed on you. I must efface the accusations; you ought both to resist the
            audacity, and at the earliest possible opportunity to extinguish and put down the
            pernicious and intolerable influence of men of that sort. <milestone n="37"
              unit="section"/> Sextus Roscius is accused of having murdered his father. O ye
            immortal gods! a wicked and nefarious action, in which one crime every sort of
            wickedness appears to be contained. In truth, if, as is well said by wise men, affection
            is often injured by a look, what sufficiently severe punishment can be devised against
            him who has inflicted death on his parent, for whom all divine and human laws bound him
            to be willing to die himself, if occasion required? <milestone n="38" unit="section"/>
            In the case of so enormous, so atrocious, so singular a crime, as this one which has
            been committed so rarely, that, if it is ever heard of, it is accounted like a portent
            and prodigy&mdash;what arguments do you think, O Caius Erucius, you as the accuser
            ought to use? Ought you not to prove the singular audacity of him who is accused of it?
            and his savage manners, and brutal nature, and his life devoted to every sort of vice
            and crime, his whole character, in short, given up to profligacy and abandoned? None of
            which things have you alleged against Sextus Roscius, not even for the sake of making
            the imputation. <milestone n="14" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="39" unit="section"/></p>
          <p>Sextus Roscius has murdered his father. What sort of man is he? is he a young man,
            corrupted, and led on by worthless men? He is more than forty years old. Is he forsooth
            an old assassin, a bold man, and one well practised in murder? You have not heard this
            so much as mentioned by the accuser. To be sure; then, luxury, and the magnitude of his
            debts, and the ungovernable desires of his disposition, have urged the man to this
            wickedness? Erucius acquitted him of luxury, when he said that he was scarcely ever
            present at any banquet. But he never owed anything Further what evil desires could exist
            in that man who as his accuser himself objected to him has always lived in the country
            and spent his time in cultivating his land, a mode of life which is utterly removed from
            covetousness, and inseparably allied to virtue? <milestone n="40" unit="section"/> What
            was it then which inspired Sextus Roscius with such madness as that? Oh, says he, he did
            not please his father. He did not please his father? For what reason? for it must have
            been both a just and an important and a notorious reason. For as this is incredible,
            that death should be inflicted on a father by a son, without many and most weighty
            reasons; so this, too, is not probable, that a son should be hated by his father,
            without many and important and necessary causes. <milestone n="41" unit="section"/> Let
            us return again to the same point, and ask what vices existed in this his only son of
            such importance as to make him incur the displeasure of his father. But it is notorious
            he had no vices. His father then was mad to bate him whom he had begotten, without any
            cause. But he was the most reasonable and sensible of men. This, then, is evident, that,
            if the father was not crazy, nor his son profligate, the father had no cause for
            displeasure, nor the son for crime. <milestone n="15" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="42"
              unit="section"/></p>
          <p>I know not, says he, what cause for displeasure there was; but I know that displeasure
            existed; because formerly, when he had two sons, he chose that other one, who is dead;
            to be at all times with himself, but sent this other one to his farms in the country.
            The same thing which happened to Erucius in supporting this wicked and trifling charge,
            has happened to me in advocating a most righteous cause. He could find no means of
            supporting this trumped-up charge; I can hardly find out by what arguments I am to
            invalidate and get rid of such trifling circumstances. <milestone n="43" unit="section"
            /> What do you say, Erucius? Did Sextus Roscius entrust so many farms, and such fine and
            productive ones to his son to cultivate and manage, for the sake of getting rid of and
            punishing him? What can this mean? Do not fathers of families who have children,
            particularly men of that class of municipalities in the country, do they not think it a
            most desirable thing for them that their sons should attend in a great degree to their
            domestic affairs, and should devote much of their labour and attention to cultivating
            their farms? <milestone n="44" unit="section"/> Did he send him off to those farms that
            he might remain on the land and merely have life kept in him at this country seat? that
            he might be deprived of all conveniences? What? if it is proved that he not only managed
            the cultivation of the farms, but was accustomed himself to have certain of the farms
            for his own, even during the lifetime of his father? Will his industrious and rural life
            still be called removal and banishment? You see, O Erucius, how far removed your line of
            argument is from the fact itself, and from truth. That which fathers usually do, you
            find fault with as an unprecedented thing; that which is done out of kindness, that you
            accuse as having been done from dislike; that which a father granted his son as an
            honour, that you say he did with the object of punishing him. <milestone n="45"
              unit="section"/> Not that you are not aware of all this, but you are so wholly without
            any arguments to bring forward, that you think it necessary to plead not only against
            us, but even against the very nature of things, and against the customs of men, and the
            opinion of every one. <milestone n="16" unit="chapter"/></p>
          <p>Oh but, when he had two sons, he never let one be away from him, and he allowed the
            other to remain in the country. I beg you, O Erucius, to take what I am going to say in
            good part; for I am going to say it, not for the sake of finding fault, but to warn you.
              <milestone n="46" unit="section"/> If fortune did not give to you to know the father
            whose son you are, so that you could understand what was the affection of fathers
            towards their children; still, at all events, nature has given you no small share of
            human feeling. To this is added a zeal for learning, so that you are not unversed in
            literature. Does that old man in Caecilius, (to quote a play,) appear to have less
            affection for Eutychus, his son, who lives in the country, than for his other one
            Chaerestratus? for that, I think, is his name; do you think that he keeps one with him
            in the city do him honour, and sends the other into the country in order to punish him?
              <milestone n="47" unit="section"/> Why do you have recourse to such trifling? you will
            say. As if it were a hard matter for me to bring forward ever so many by name, of my own
            tribe, or my own neighbours, (not to wander too far off,) who wish those sons for whom
            they have the greatest regard, to be diligent farmers. But it is an odious step to quote
            known men, when it is uncertain whether they would like their names to be used; and no
            one is likely to be better known to you than this same Eutychus; and certainly it has
            nothing to do with the argument, whether I name this youth in a play, or some one of the
            country about <placeName key="perseus,Veii">Veii</placeName>. In truth, I think that
            these things are invented by poets in order that we may see our manners sketched under
            the character of strangers, and the image of our daily life represented under the guise
            of fiction. <milestone n="48" unit="section"/> Come now; turn your thoughts, if you
            please, to reality, and consider not only in <placeName key="tgn,7003125"
              >Umbria</placeName> and that neighbourhood, but in these old municipal towns, what
            pursuits are most praised by fathers of families. You will at once see that, from want
            of real grounds of accusation, you have imputed that which is his greatest praise to
            Sextus Roscius as a fault and a crime. <milestone n="17" unit="chapter"/></p>
          <p>But not only do children do this by the wish of their fathers, but I have myself known
            many men (and so, unless I am deceived, has every one of you) who are inflamed of their
            own accord with a fondness for what relates to the cultivation of land, and who think
            this rural life, which you think ought to be a disgrace to and a charge against a man,
            the most honourable and the most delightful. <milestone n="49" unit="section"/> What do
            you think of this very Sextus Roscius? How great is his fondness for, and shrewdness in
            rural affairs! As I hear from his relations, most honourable men, you are not more
            skillful in this your business of an accuser, than he is in his. But, as I think, since
            it seems good to Chrysogonus, who has left him no farm, he will be able now to forget
            this skill of his, and to give up this taste. And although that is a sad and a
            scandalous thing, yet he will bear it, O judges, with equanimity, if, by your verdict,
            he can preserve his life and his character; but this is intolerable, if he is both to
            have this calamity brought upon him on account of the goodness and number of his farms,
            and if that is especially to be imputed to him as a crime that he cultivated them with
            great care; so that it is not to be misery enough to have cultivated them for others not
            for himself, unless it is also to be accounted a crime that he cultivated them at all.
              <milestone n="18" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="50" unit="section"/></p>
          <p>In truth, O Erucius, you would have been a ridiculous accuser, if you had been born in
            those times when men were sent for from the plough to be made consuls. Certainly you,
            who think it a crime to have superintended the cultivation of a farm, would consider
            that Atilius, whom those who were sent to him found sowing seed with his own hand, a
            most base and dishonourable man. But, forsooth, our ancestors judged very differently
            both of him and of all other such men. And therefore from a very small and powerless
            state they left us one very great and very prosperous. For they diligently cultivated
            their own lands, they did not graspingly desire those of others; by which conduct they
            enlarged the republic, and this dominion, and the name of the Roman people, with lands
            and conquered cities, and subjected nations. <milestone n="51" unit="section"/> Nor do I
            bring forward these instances in order to compare them with these matters which we are
            now investigating; but in order that that may be understood: that, as in the times of
            our ancestors, the highest and most illustrious men, who ought at all times to have been
            sitting at the helm of the republic, yet devoted much of their attention and time to the
            cultivation of their lands; that man ought to be pardoned, who avows himself a rustic,
            for having lived constantly in the country, especially when be could do nothing which
            was either more pleasing to his father, or more delightful to himself, or in reality
            more honourable. <milestone n="52" unit="section"/> The bitter dislike of the father to
            the son, then, is proved by this, O Erucius, that he allowed him to remain in the
            country. Is there anything else? Certainly, says he, there is. For he was thinking of
            disinheriting him. I hear you. Now you are saying something which may have a bearing on
            the business, for you will grant, I think, that those other arguments are trifling and
            childish. He never went to any feasts with his father. Of course not, as he very seldom
            came to town at all. People very seldom asked him to their houses. No wonder, for a man
            who did not live in the city, and was not likely to ask them in return. <milestone
              n="19" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="53" unit="section"/></p>
          <p>But you are aware that these things too are trifling. Let us consider that which we
            began with, than which no more certain argument of dislike can possibly be found. The
            father was thinking of disinheriting his son. I do not ask on what account. I ask how
            you know it? Although you ought to mention and enumerate all the reasons. And it was the
            duty of a regular accuser, who was accusing a man of such wickedness, to unfold all the
            vice and sins of a son had exasperated the father so as to enable him to bring his mind
            to subdue nature herself&mdash;to banish from his mind that affection so deeply
            implanted in it&mdash;to forget in short that he was a father; and all this I do not
            think could have happened without great errors on the part of the son. <milestone n="54"
              unit="section"/> But I give you leave to pass over those things, which, as you are
            silent, you admit have no existence. At all events you ought to make it evident that he
            did intend to disinherit him. What then do you allege to make us think that that was the
            case? You can say nothing with truth. Invent something at least with probability in it;
            that you may not manifestly be convicted of doing what you are openly
            doing&mdash;insulting the fortunes of this unhappy man, and the dignity of these
            noble judges. He meant to disinherit his son. On what account? I don't know. Did he
            disinherit him? No. Who hindered him? He was thinking of it. He was thinking of it? Who
            did he tell? No one. What is abusing the court of justice, and the laws, and your
            majesty, O judges, for the purposes of gain and lust, but accusing men in this manner,
            and bringing imputations against them which you not only are not able to prove, but
            which you do not even attempt to? <milestone n="55" unit="section"/> There is not one of
            us, O Erucius, who does not know that you have no enmity against Sextus Roscius. All men
            see on what account you come here as his adversary. They know that you are induced to do
            so by this man's money. What then? Still you ought to have been desirous of gain with
            such limitations as to think that the opinion of all these men, and the Remmian <note

          <p>It is a useful thing for there to be many accusers in the city, in order that audacity
            may be kept in check by fear; but it is only useful with this limitation, that we are
            not to be manifestly mocked by accusers. A man is innocent. But although he is free from
            guilt he is not free from suspicion. Although it is a lamentable thing, still I can, to
            some extent, pardon a man who accuses him. For when be has anything which he can say,
            imputing a crime, or fixing a suspicion, he does not appear knowingly to be openly
            mocking and calumniating. On which account we all easily allow that there should be as
            many accusers as possible; because an innocent man, if he be accused, can be acquitted;
            a guilty man, unless or he be accused cannot be convicted. But it is more desirable that
            an innocent man should be acquitted, than that a guilty man should not be brought to
            trial. Food for the geese is contracted for at the public expense, and dogs are
            maintained in the Capitol, to give notice if thieves come. But they cannot distinguish
            thieves. Accordingly they give notice if any one comes by night to the Capitol; and
            because that is a suspicious thing, although they are but beasts, yet they oftenest err
            on that side which is the more prudent one. But if the dogs barked by day also, when any
            one came to pay honour to the gods, I imagine their legs would be broken for being
            active then also, when there was no suspicion. The notion of accusers is very much the
            same. <milestone n="57" unit="section"/> Some of you are geese, who only cry out, and
            have no power to hurt, some are dogs who can both bark and bite. We see that food is
            provided for you; but you ought chiefly to attack those who deserve it. This is most
            pleasing to the people; then if you will, then you may bark on suspicion when it seems
            probable that some one has committed a crime. That may be allowed. But if you act in
            such a way as to accuse a man of having murdered his father, without being able to say
            why or how; and if you are only barking without any ground for suspicion, no one,
            indeed, will break your legs; but if I know these judges well, they will so firmly affix
            to your heads that letter <note anchored="yes">The letter was K, which was branded on

          <p>What have you given me to defend my client against, my good accuser? And what ground
            have you given these judges for any suspicion? He was afraid of being disinherited. I
            hear you. But no one says what ground he had for fear. His father had it in
            contemplation. Prove it. There is no proof; there is no mention of any one with whom he
            deliberated about it&mdash;whom he told of it; there is no circumstance from which
            it could occur to your minds to suspect it. When you bring accusations in this manner, O
            Erucius, do you not plainly say this? &ldquo;I know what I have received, but I do
            not know what to say. I have had regard to that alone which Chrysogonus said, that no
            one would be his advocate; that there was no one who would dare at this time to say a
            word about the purchase of the property, and about that conspiracy.&rdquo; This
            false opinion prompted you to this dishonesty. You would not in truth have said a word
            if you had thought that any one would answer you. <milestone n="59" unit="section"/> It
            were worth while, if you have noticed it, O judges, to consider this man's carelessness
            in bringing forward his accusations. I imagine, when he saw what men were sitting on
            those benches, that he inquired whether this man or that man was going to defend him;
            that he never even dreamt of me, because I have never pleaded any public cause before.
            After he found that no one was going to defend him of those men who have the ability and
            are in the habit of so doing, he began to be so careless that, when it suited his fancy
            he sat down, then he walked about, sometimes he even called his boy, I suppose to give
            him orders for supper, and utterly overlooked your assembly and all this court as if it
            had been a complete desert. <milestone n="22" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="60"
              unit="section"/></p>
          <p>At length he summed up. He sat down. I got up. He seemed to breathe again because no
            one else rose to speak other than I. I began to speak. I noticed, O judges, that he was
            joking and doing other things, up to the time when I named Chrysogonus; but as soon as I
            touched him, my man at once raised himself up. He seemed to be astonished. I knew what
            had pinched him. I named him a second time, and a third. After, men began to run hither
            arid thither, I suppose to tell Chrysogonus that there was some one who dared to speak
            contrary to his will, that the cause was going on differently from what he expected,
            that the purchase of the goods was being ripped up; that the conspiracy was being
            severely handled; that his influence and power was being disregarded; that the judges
            were attending diligently; that the matter appeared scandalous to the people. <milestone
              n="61" unit="section"/> And since you were deceived in all this, O Erucius, and since
            you see that everything is altered; that the cause on behalf of Sextus Roscius is
            argued, if not as it should be, at all events with freedom, since you see that be is
            defended whom you thought was abandoned, that those who you expected would deliver him
            up to you are judging impartially, give us again, at last, some of your old skill and
            prudence; confess that you came hither with the hope that there would he a robbery here,
            not a trial. A trial is held on a charge of parricide, and no reason is alleged by the
            accuser why the son has slain his father. <milestone n="62" unit="section"/> That which,
            in even the least offences and in the more trifling crimes, which are more frequent and
            of almost daily occurrence, is asked most earnestly and as the very first question,
            namely what motive there was for the offence; that Erucius does not think necessary to
            be asked in a case of parricide. A charge which, O judges, even when many motives appear
            to concur, and to be connected with one another, is still not rashly believed, nor is
            such a case allowed to depend on slight conjecture, nor is any uncertain witness
            listened to, nor is the matter decided by the ability of the accuser. Many crimes
            previously committed must be proved, and a most profligate life on the part of the
            prisoner, and singular audacity, and not only audacity, but the most extreme frenzy and
            madness. When all these things are proved, still there must exist express traces of the
            crime: where, in what manner, by whose means, and at what time the crime was committed.
            And unless these proofs are numerous and evident&mdash;so wicked, so atrocious, so
            nefarious a deed cannot be believed. <milestone n="63" unit="section"/> For the power of
            human feeling is great; the connection of blood is of mighty power; nature herself cries
            out against suspicions of this sort; it is a most undeniable portent and prodigy, for
            any one to exist in human shape, who so far outruns the beasts in savageness, as in a
            most scandalous manner to deprive those of life by whose means he has himself beheld
            this most delicious light of life; when birth, and bringing up, and nature herself make
            even beasts friendly to each other. <milestone n="23" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="64"

          <p>Not many years ago they say that Titius Cloelius, a citizen of <placeName
              key="tgn,7006704">Terracina</placeName>, a well-known man, when, having supped, he had
            retired to rest in the same room with his two youthful sons, was found in the morning
            with his throat cut: when no servant could be found nor any free man, on whom suspicion
            of the deed could be fixed, and his two sons of that age lying near him said that they
            did not even know what had been done; the sons were accused of the parricide. What
            followed? it was, indeed, a suspicious business; that neither of them were aware of it,
            and that some one had ventured to introduce himself into that chamber, especially at
            that time when two young men were in the same place, who might easily have heard the
            noise and defended him. Moreover, there was no one on whom suspicion of the deed could
            fall. <milestone n="65" unit="section"/> Still as it was plain to the judges that they
            were found sleeping with the door open, the young men were acquitted and released from
            all suspicion. For no one thought that there was any one who, when he had violated all
            divine and human laws by a nefarious crime, could immediately go to sleep; because they
            who have committed such a crime not only cannot rest free from care, but cannot even
            breathe without fear. <milestone n="24" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="66" unit="section"
            /></p>
          <p>Do you not see in the case of those whom the poets have handed down to us, as having,
            for the sake of avenging their father, inflicted punishment on their mother, especially
            when they were said to have done so at the command and in obedience to the oracles of
            the immortal gods, how the furies nevertheless haunt them, and never suffer them to
            rest, because they could not be pious without wickedness. And this is the truth, O
            judges. The blood of one's father and mother has great power, great obligation, is a
            most holy thing, and if any stain of that falls on one, it not only cannot be washed
            out, but it drips down into the very soul, so that extreme frenzy and madness follow it.
              <milestone n="67" unit="section"/> For do not believe, as you often see it written in
            fables, that they who have done anything impiously and wickedly are really driven about
            and frightened by the furies with burning torches. It is his own dishonesty and the
            terrors of his own conscience that especially harassed each individual; his own
            wickedness drives each criminal about and affects him with madness; his own evil
            thoughts, his own evil conscience terrifies him. These are to the wicked their incessant
            and domestic furies which night and day exact from wicked sons punishment for the crimes
            committed against their parents. <milestone n="68" unit="section"/> This enormity of the
            crime is the cause why, unless a parricide is proved in a manner almost visible, it is
            not credible, unless a man's youth has been base, unless his life has been stained with
            every sort of wickedness, unless his extravagance has been prodigal and accompanied with
            shame and disgrace, unless his audacity has been violent, unless his rashness has been
            such as to be not far removed from insanity. There must be, besides a hatred of his
            father, a fear of his father's reproof&mdash;worthless friends, slaves privy to the
            deed, a convenient opportunity, a place fitly selected for the business. I had almost
            said the judges must see his hands stained with his father's blood, if they are to
            believe so monstrous, so barbarous, so terrible a crime. <milestone n="69"
              unit="section"/> On which account, the less credible it is unless it be proved, the
            more terribly is it to be punished if it be proved. <milestone n="25" unit="chapter"
            /></p>
          <p>Therefore, it may be understood by many circumstances that our ancestors surpassed
            other nations not only in arms, but also in wisdom and prudence; and also most
            especially by this, that they devise a singular punishment for the impious. And in this
            matter consider how far they surpassed in prudence those who are said to have been the
            wisest of all nations. <milestone n="70" unit="section"/> The state of the Athenians is
            said to have been the wisest while it enjoyed the supremacy. Moreover of that state they
            say that Solon was the wisest man, he who made the laws which they use even to this day.
            When he was asked why he had appointed no punishment for him who killed his father, he
            answered that he had not supposed that any one would do so. He is said to have done
            wisely in establishing nothing about a crime which had up to that time never been
            committed, lest he should seem not so much to forbid it as to put people in mind of it.
            How much more wisely did our ancestors act! for as they understood that there was
            nothing so holy that audacity did not sometimes violate it, they devised a singular
            punishment for parricides in order that they whom nature herself had not been able to
            retain in their duty, might be kept from crime by the enormity of the punishment. They
            ordered them to be sown alive in a sack, and in that condition to be thrown into the
            river. <milestone n="26" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="71" unit="section"/></p>
          <p>O singular wisdom, O judges! Do they not seem to have cut this man off and separated
            him from nature; from whom they took away at once the heaven, the sun, water and earth,
            so that he who had slain him, from whom he himself was horn, might be deprived of all
            those things from which everything is said to derive its birth. They would not throw his
            body to wild beasts, lest we should find the very beasts who had touched such
            wickedness, more savage; they would not throw them naked into the river, lest when they
            were carried down into the sea, they should pollute that also, by which all other things
            which have been polluted are believed to be purified. There is nothing in short so vile
            or so common that they left them any share in it. <milestone n="72" unit="section"/>
            Indeed what is so common as breath to the living, earth to the dead, the sea to those
            who float, the shore to those who are cast up by the sea? These men so live, while they
            are able to live at all, that they are unable to draw breath from heaven; they so die
            that earth does not touch their bones; they are tossed about by the waves so that they
            are never washed; lastly, they are cast up by the sea so, that when dead they do not
            even rest on the rocks. Do you think, O Erucius, that you can prove to such men as these
            your charge of so enormous a crime, a crime to which so remarkable a punishment is
            affixed, if you do not allege any motive for the crime? If you were accusing him before
            the very purchasers of his property, and if Chrysogonus were presiding at that trial,
            still you would have come more carefully and with more preparation. <milestone n="73"
              unit="section"/> Is it that you do not see what the cause really is, or before whom it
            is being pleaded? The cause in question is parricide; which cannot be undertaken without
            many motives; and it is being tried before very wise men, who are aware that no one
            commits the very slightest crime without any motive whatever. <milestone n="27"
              unit="chapter"/></p>
          <p>Be it so; you are unable to allege any motive. Although I ought at once to gain my
            cause, yet I will not insist on this, and I will concede to you in this cause what I
            would not concede in another, relying on this man's innocence. I do not ask you why
            Sextus Roscius killed his father; I ask you how he killed him? So I ask of you, O Caius
            Erucius, how, and I will so deal with you, that I will on this topic give you leave to
            answer me or to interrupt me, or even, if you wish to at all, to ask me questions.
              <milestone n="74" unit="section"/> How did he kill him? Did he strike him himself, or
            did he commit him to others to be murdered? If you say he did it himself, he was not at
              <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>; if you say he did it by the
            instrumentality of others, I ask you were they slaves or free men? who were they? Did
            they come from the same place, from <placeName key="perseus,Ameria">Ameria</placeName>,
            or were they assassins of this city? If they came from Ameria, who are they, why are
            they not named? If they are of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, how did
            Roscius make acquaintance with them? who for many years had not come to <placeName
              key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and who never was there more than three days.
            Where did he meet them? with whom did he speak? how did he persuade them? Did he give
            them a bribe? to whom did he give it? by whose agency did he give it? whence did he get
            it, and how much did he giver? Are not these the steps by which one generally arrives at
            the main fact of guilt? And let it occur to you at the same time how you have painted
            this man's life; that you have described him as an unpolished and country-mannered man;
            that he never held conversation with any one, that he had never dwelt in the city.
              <milestone n="75" unit="section"/> And in this I pass over that thing which might be a
            strong argument for me to prove his innocence, that atrocities of this sort are not
            usually produced among country manners, in a sober course of life, in an unpolished and
            rough sort of existence. As you cannot find every sort of crop, nor every tree, in every
            field, so every sort of crime is not engendered in every sort of life. In a city, luxury
            is engendered; avarice is inevitably produced by luxury; audacity must spring from
            avarice, and out of audacity arises every wickedness and every crime. But a country
            life, which you call a clownish one, is the teacher of economy, of industry, and of
            justice. <milestone n="28" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="76" unit="section"/></p>
          <p>But I will say no more of this. I ask then by whose instrumentality did this man, who,
            as you yourself say, never mixed with men, contrive to accomplish this terrible crime
            with such secrecy, especially while absent? There are many things, O judges, which are
            false, and which can still be argued so as to cause suspicion. But in this matter, if
            any grounds for suspicion can be discovered, I will admit that there is guilt. Sextus
            Roscius is murdered at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, while his son is
            at his farm at <placeName key="perseus,Ameria">Ameria</placeName>. He sent letters, I
            suppose, to some assassin, he who knew no one at <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
              >Rome</placeName>. He sent for some one&mdash;but when? He sent a
            messenger&mdash;whom? or to whom? Did he persuade any one by bribes, by influence,
            by hope, by promises? None of these things can even be invented against him, and yet a
            trial for parricide is going on. <milestone n="77" unit="section"/> The only remaining
            alternative is that he managed it by means of slaves. Oh ye immortal gods, how miserable
            and disastrous is our lot. That which under such an accusation is usually a protection
            to the innocent, to offer his slaves to the question, that it is not allowed to Sextus
            Roscius to do. You, who accuse him, have all his slaves. There is not one boy to bring
            him his daily food left to Sextus Roscius out of so large a household. I appeal to you
            now, Publius Scipio, to you Metellus, while you were acting as his advocates, while you
            were pleading his cause, did not Sextus Roscius often demand of his adversaries that two
            of his father's slaves should be put to the question? Do you remember that you, O Titus
            Roscius, refused it? What? Where are those slaves? They are waiting on Chrysogonus, O
            judges; they are honoured and valued by him. Even now I demand that they be put to the
            question; he begs and entreats it. <milestone n="78" unit="section"/> What are you
            doing? Why do you refuse? Doubt now, O judges, if you can, by whom Sextus Roscius was
            murdered; whether by him, who, on account of his death, is exposed to poverty and
            treachery, who has not even opportunity allowed him of making inquiry into his father's
            death; or by those who shun investigation, who are in possession of his property, who
            live amid murder, and by murder. Everything in this cause, O judges, is lamentable and
            scandalous; but there is nothing which can be mentioned more bitter or more iniquitous
            than this. The son is not allowed to put his father's slaves to the question concerning
            his father's death. He is not to be master of his own slaves so long as to put them to
            the question concerning his father's death. I will come again, and that speedily, to
            this topic. For all this relates to the Roscii; and I have promised that I will speak of
            their audacity when I have effaced the accusations of Erucius. <milestone n="29"
              unit="chapter"/><milestone n="79" unit="section"/></p>
          <p>Now, Erucius, I come to you. You must inevitably agree with me, if he is really
            implicated in this crime, that he either committed it with his own hand, which you deny,
            or by means of some other men, either freemen or slaves. Were they freemen? You can
            neither show that he had any opportunity of meeting them, nor by what means he could
            persuade them, nor where he saw them, nor by what agency he trafficked with them, nor by
            what hope, or what bribe he persuaded them. I show, on the other hand, not only that
            Sextus Roscius did nothing of all this, but that he was not even able to do anything,
            because he had neither been at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> for many
            years, nor did he ever leave his farm without some object. The name of slaves appeared
            to remain to you, to which, when driven from your other suspicions, you might fly as to
            a harbour, when you strike upon such a rock that you not only see the accusation rebound
            back from it, but perceive that every suspicion falls upon you yourselves. <milestone
              n="80" unit="section"/> What is it, then? Whither has the accuser betaken himself in
            his dearth of arguments? The time, says he, was such that men were constantly being
            killed with impunity; so that you, from the great number of assassins, could effect this
            without any trouble. Meantime you seem to me, O Erucius, to be wishing to obtain two
            articles for one payment; to blacken our characters in this trial, and to accuse those
            very men from whom you have received payment. What do you say? Men were constantly being
            killed? By whose agency? and by whom? Do you not perceive that you have been brought
            here by brokers? What next? Are we ignorant that in these times the same men were
            brokers of men's lives as well as of their possessions? <milestone n="81" unit="section"
            /> Shall those men then, who at that time used to run about armed night and day, who
            spent all their time in rapine and murder, object to Sextus Roscius the bitterness and
            iniquity of that time? and will they think that troops of assassins, among whom they
            themselves were leaders and chiefs, can be made a ground of accusation against him? who
            not only was not at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, but who was utterly
            ignorant of everything that was being done at <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
              >Rome</placeName>, because he was continually in the country, as you yourself admit.
              <milestone n="82" unit="section"/> I fear that I may be wearisome to you, O judges, or
            that I may seem to distrust your capacity, if I dwell longer on matters which are so
            evident. The whole accusation of Erucius, as I think, is at an end; unless perhaps you
            expect me to refute the charges which he has brought against us of peculation and of
            other imaginary crimes of that sort; charges unheard of by us before this time, and
            quite novel; which he appeared to me to be spouting out of some other speech which he
            was composing against some other criminal; so wholly were they unconnected with either
            the crime of parricide, or the man who is now on his trial. But as he accuses us of
            these things with his bare word, it is sufficient to deny them with our bare word. If
            there is any point which he is keeping back to prove by witnesses, there also, as in
            this cause, he shall find us more ready than he expected. <milestone n="30"
              unit="chapter"/><milestone n="83" unit="section"/></p>
          <p>I come now to that point to which my desire does not lead me, but good faith towards my
            client. For if I wished to accuse men, I should accuse those men rather by accusing whom
            I might become more important, which I have determined not to do, as long as the
            alternatives of accusing and defending are both open to me. For that man appears to me
            the most honourable who arrives at a higher rank by his own virtue, not he who rises by
            the distress and misfortunes of another. Let us cease for awhile to examine into these
            matters which are unimportant; let us inquire where the guilt is, and where it can be
            detected. By this time you will understand, O Erucius, by how many suspicious
            circumstances a real crime must be proved, although I shall not mention every thing, and
            shall touch on every thing slightly. And I would not do even that if it were not
            necessary, and it shall be a sign that I am doing it against my will, that I will not
            pursue the point further than the safety of Roscius and my own good faith requires.
              <milestone n="84" unit="section"/> You found no motive in Sextus Roscius; but I do
            find one in Titus Roscius For I have to do with you now, O Titus Roscius, since you are
            sitting there and openly professing yourself an enemy. We shall see about Capito
            afterwards, if he comes forward as a witness as I hear he is ready to do then he shall
            hear of other victories of his, which he does not suspect that I ever even heard. That
            Lucius Cassius, whom the Roman people used to consider a most impartial and able judge,
            used constantly to ask at trials, &ldquo;to whom it had been any
            advantage?&rdquo; The life of men is so directed that no one attempts to proceed to
            crime without some hope of advantage. <milestone n="85" unit="section"/> Those who were
            about to be tried avoided and dreaded him as an investigator and a judge; because,
            although he was afraid of truth, he yet seemed not so much inclined by nature to mercy,
            as drawn by circumstances to severity. I, although a man is presiding at this trial who
            is both brave against audacity, and very merciful to innocence, would yet willingly
            suffer myself to speak in behalf of Sextus Roscius either before that very acute judge
            himself, or before other judges like him, whose very name those who have to stand a
            trial shudder at even now. <milestone n="31" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="86"
              unit="section"/></p>
          <p>For when those judges saw in this cause that those men are in possession of abundant
            wealth, and that he is in the greatest beggary, they would not ask who had got advantage
            from the deed, but they would connect the manifest crime and suspicion of guilt rather
            with the plunder than with the poverty. What if this be added to that consideration that
            you were previously poor? what if it be added that you are avaricious? what if it be
            added that you are audacious? what if it be added that you were the greatest enemy of
            the man who has been murdered? need any further motive be sought for, which may have
            impelled you to such a crime? But which of all these particulars can be denied?
              <milestone n="87" unit="section"/> The poverty of the man is such that it cannot be
            concealed, and it is only the more conspicuous the more it is kept out of sight. Your
            avarice you make a parade of when you form an alliance with an utter stranger against
            the fortunes of a fellow-citizen and a relation. How audacious you are (to pass over
            other points), all men may understand from this, that out of the whole troop, that is to
            say, out of so many assassins, you alone were found to sit with the accusers, and not
            only to show them your countenance, but even to volunteer it. You must admit that you
            had enmity against Sextus Roscius, and great disputes about family affairs. <milestone
              n="88" unit="section"/> It remains, O judges, that we must now consider which of the
            two rather killed Sextus Roscius; did he to whom riches accrued by his death, or did he
            to whom beggary was the result? Did he who, before that, was poor, or he, who after that
            became most indigent? Did he, who burning with avarice rushes in like an enemy against
            his own relations, or he who has always lived in such a manner as to have no
            acquaintance with exorbitant gains, or with any profit beyond that which he procured
            with toil? Did he who, of all the brokers <note anchored="yes">There is a pun here on
              the word <foreign lang="la">sector</foreign>, which means not only a broker, but also
              a cut-throat, a murderer.</note> is the most audacious, or he who, because of the
            insolence of the forum and of the public courts, dreads not only the bench, but even the
            city itself? Lastly, O judges, what is most material of all to the argument in my
            opinion did his enemy do it or his son? <milestone n="32" unit="chapter"/><milestone

          <p>If you, O Erucius, had so many and such strong arguments against a criminal, how long
            you would speak; how you would plume yourself,&mdash;time indeed would fail you
            before words did. In truth, on each of these topics the materials are such that you
            might spend a whole day on each. And I could do the same; for I will not derogate so
            much from my own claims, though I arrogate nothing, as to believe that you can speak
            with more fluency than I can. But I, perhaps, owing to the number of advocates, may be
            classed in the common body; the battle of <placeName key="perseus,Cannae"
              >Cannae</placeName>
            <note anchored="yes">There is a little dispute as to Cicero's exact meaning here. Some

              is intended to the destruction of Cinna's army, in which a great number of Roman
              knights were slain. Facciolati thinks that the battle of <placeName

            going to battle. There are now six hundred men, whom nobody even mentions by name
            because of their meanness, who are accusers of men on charges of murdering and
            poisoning; all of whom, as far as I am concerned, I hope may find a livelihood. For
            there is no harm in there being as many dogs as possible, where there are many men to be
            watched, and many things to be guarded. <milestone n="91" unit="section"/> But, as is
            often the case, the violence and tumultuous nature of war brings many things to pass
            without the knowledge of the generals. While he who was administering the main
            government was occupied in other matters, there were men who in the meantime were curing
            their own wounds; who rushed about in the darkness and threw everything into confusion
            as if eternal night had enveloped the whole Republic. And by such men as these I wonder
            that the courts of justice were not burnt, that there might be no trace left of any
            judicial proceedings; for they did destroy both judges and accusers. There is this
            advantage, that they lived in such a manner that even if they wished it, they could not
            put to death all the witnesses; for as long as the race of men exists, there will not be
            wanting men to accuse them: as long as the state lasts, trials will take place. But as I
            began to say, both Erucius, if he had these arguments to use which I have mentioned, in
            any cause Of his, would be able to speak on them as long as he pleased, and I can do the
            same. But I choose, as I said before, to pass by them lightly, and only just to touch on
            each particular, so that all men may perceive that I am not accusing men of my own
            inclination, but only defending my own client from a sense of duty. <milestone n="33"
              unit="chapter"/><milestone n="92" unit="section"/></p>
          <p>I see therefore that there were many causes which urged that man to this crime. Let us
            now see whether he had any opportunity of committing it. Where was Sextus Roscius
            slain?&mdash;at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. What of you, O
            Roscius? Where were you at that time?&mdash;at <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
              >Rome</placeName>. But what is that to the purpose? many other men were there too. As
            if the point now were, who of so vast a crowd slew him, and as if this were not rather
            the question, whether it is more probable that he who was slain at <placeName
              key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> was slain by that man who was constantly at
              <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> at that time, or by him who for many
            years had never come to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> at all?
              <milestone n="93" unit="section"/> Come, let us consider now the other circumstances
            which might make it easy for him. There was at that time a multitude of assassins, as
            Erucius has stated, and men were being killed with impunity. What!&mdash;what was
            that multitude? A multitude, I imagine, either of those who were occupied in getting
            possession of men's property, or of those who were hired by them to murder some one. If
            you think it was composed of those who coveted other men's property, you are one of that
            number,&mdash;you who are enriched by our wealth; if of those whom they who call
            them by the lightest name call slayers, inquire to whom they are bound, and whose
            dependents they are, believe me you will find it is some one of your own confederacy,
            whatever you say to the contrary, compare it with our defence, and by this means the
            cause of Sextus Roscius will be most easily contrasted with yours. <milestone n="94"

            &ldquo;But I was never there at all.&rdquo; &ldquo;I confess that I am a
            broker, but so are many other men also.&rdquo; &ldquo;But I, as you yourself
            accuse me of being, am a countryman and a rustic.&rdquo; &ldquo;It does not
            follow at once, because I have been present with a troop of assassins, that I am an
            assassin myself.&rdquo; &ldquo;But at all events I, who never had even the
            acquaintance of assassins, am far removed from such a crime.&rdquo; There are many
            things which may be mentioned, by which it may be understood that you had the greatest
            facilities for committing this crime, which I pass over, not only because I do not
            desire to accuse, but still more on this account,&mdash;because if I were to wish to
            enumerate all the murders which were then committed on the same account as that on which
            Sextus Roscius was slain, I fear lest my speech would seem to refer to others also.

          <p>Let us examine now briefly, as we have done in the other particulars, what was done by
            you, O Titus Roscius, after the death of Sextus Roscius; and these things are so open
            and notorious, that by the gods, O judges, I am unwilling to mention them. For whatever
            your conduct may be, O Titus Roscius, I am afraid of appearing to be so eager to save my
            client, as to be quite regardless whether I spare you or not. And as I am afraid of
            this, and as I wish to spare you in some degree, as far as I can, saving my duty to my
            client, I will again change my purpose. For the thoughts on your countenance present
            here occur to my mind, that you when all the rest of your companions were flying and
            hiding themselves in order that this trial might appear to be not concerning their
            plunder, not concerning this man's crime, should select this part above all others for
            yourself, to appear at the trial and sit with the accuser, by which action you gain
            nothing beyond causing your impudence and audacity to be known to all mortals.
              <milestone n="96" unit="section"/> After Sextus Roscius is slain, who is the first to
            take the news to <placeName key="perseus,Ameria">Ameria</placeName>? Mallius Glaneia,
            whom I have named before, your own client and intimate friend. What did it concern him
            above all men to bring the news of what, if you had not previously formed some plan with
            reference to his death and property, and had formed no conspiracy with any one else,
            having either the crime or its reward for its object, concerned you least of all men?
            Oh, Mallius brought the news of his own accord! What did it concern him, I beg? or, as
            he did not come to <placeName key="perseus,Ameria">Ameria</placeName> on account of this
            business, did it happen by chance that he was the first to tell the news which he had
            heard at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>? On what account did he come to
              <placeName key="perseus,Ameria">Ameria</placeName>? I cannot conjecture, says he. I
            will bring the matter to such a point that there shall be no need of conjecture. On what
            account did he announce it first to Roscius Capito? When the house, and wife, and
            children of Sextus Roscius were at <placeName key="perseus,Ameria">Ameria</placeName>;
            when he had so many kinsmen and relations on the best possible terms with himself, on
            what account did it happen that that client of yours, the reporter of your wickedness,
            did it to Titus Roscius Capito above all men? <milestone n="97" unit="section"/> He was
            slain returning home from supper. It was not yet dawn when it was known at <placeName
              key="perseus,Ameria">Ameria</placeName>. Why was this incredible speed? What does this
            extraordinary haste and expedition intimate? I do not ask who struck the blow; you have
            nothing to fear, O Glaucia. I do not shake you to see if you have any weapon about you.
            I am not examining that point; I do not think I am at all concerned with that. Since I
            have found out by whose design he was murdered, by whose hand he was murdered I do not
            care. I assume one point, which your open wickedness and the evident state of the case
            gives me. Where, or from whom, did Glaucia hear of it? Who knew it so immediately?
            Suppose he did hear of it immediately; what was the affair which compelled to take so
            long a journey in one night? What was the great necessity which pressed upon him, so as
            to make him, if he was going to <placeName key="perseus,Ameria">Ameria</placeName> of
            his own accord, set out from <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> at that time
            of night, and devote no part of the night to sleep? <milestone n="35" unit="chapter"
              /><milestone n="98" unit="section"/></p>
          <p>In a case so evident as this must we seek for arguments, or hunt for conjectures? Do
            you not seem, O judges, actually to behold with your own eyes what you have been
            hearing? Do you not see that unhappy man, ignorant of his fate, returning from supper?
            Do you not see the ambush that is laid? the sudden attack? Is not Glaucia before your
            eyes, present at the murder? Is not that Titus Roscius present? Is he not with his own
            hands placing that Automedon in the chariot, the messenger of his most horrible
            wickedness and nefarious victory? Is he not entreating him to keep awake that night? to
            labour for his honour? to take the news to <placeName key="tgn,2038075"
              >Capito</placeName> as speedily as possible? <milestone n="99" unit="section"/> Why

            that volume of his which I can prove that Erucius wrote for him, which they say that he
            displayed to Sextus Roscius, and threatened that he would mention everything contained
            in it in his evidence. O the excellent witness, O judges; O gravity worthy of being
            attended to; O honourable course of life! such that you may with willing minds make your
            oaths depend upon his testimony! In truth we should not see the crimes of these men so
            clearly if cupidity, and avarice, and audacity, did not render them blind. <milestone

          <p>One of them sent a swift messenger from the very scene of murder to Ameria, to his
            partner and his tutor; so that if every one wished to conceal his knowledge of whom the
            guilt belonged to, yet he himself placed his wickedness visibly before the eyes of all
            men. The other (if the immortal gods will only let him) is going to give evidence also
            against Sextus Roscius. As if the matter now in question were, whether what he said is
            to be believed, or whether what he did is to be punished. Therefore it was established
            by the custom of our ancestors, that even in the most insignificant matters, the most
            honourable men should not be allowed to give evidence in their own cause. <milestone
              n="103" unit="section"/> Africanus, who declares by his surname that he subdued a
            third part of the whole world, still, if a case of his own were being tried, would not
            give evidence. For I do not venture to say with respect to such a man as that, if he did
            give evidence he would not be believed. See now everything is altered and changed for
            the worse. When there is a trial about property and about murder, a man is going to give
            evidence, who is both a broker and an assassin; that is, he who is himself the purchaser
            and possessor of that very property about which the trial is taking place, and who
            contrived the murder of the man whose death is being inquired into. <milestone n="104"
              unit="section"/> What do you want, O most excellent man? Have you anything to say?
            Listen to me. Take care not to be wanting to yourself; your own interest to a great
            extent is at stake. You have done many things wickedly, many things audaciously, many
            things scandalously; one thing foolishly, and that of your own accord, not by the advice
            of Erucius. There was no need for you to sit there. For no man employs a dumb accuser,
            or calls him as a witness, who rises from the accuser's bench. There must be added to
            this, that that cupidity of yours should have been a little more kept back and
            concealed. Now what is there that any one of you desire to hear, when what you do is
            such that you seem to have done them expressly for our advantage against your own
            interest? <milestone n="105" unit="section"/> Come now, let us see, O judges, what
            followed immediately after. <milestone n="37" unit="chapter"/></p>
          <p>The news of the death of Sextus Roscius is carried to Volaterra, to the camp of Lucius
            Sulla, to Chrysogonus, four days after he is murdered. I now again ask who sent that
            messenger. Is it not evident that it was the same man who sent the news to Ameria?
            Chrysogonus takes care that his goods shall be immediately sold; he who had neither his
            own the man nor his estate. But how did it occur to him to wish for the farms of a man
            who was unknown to him, whom he had never seen in his life? You are accustomed, O
            judges, when you hear anything of this sort to say at once, some fellow-citizen or
            neighbour must have told him; they generally tell these things; most men are betrayed by
            such. Here there is no ground for your entertaining this suspicion. <milestone n="106"
              unit="section"/> I will not argue thus. It is probable that the Roscii gave
            information of that matter to Chrysogonus, for there was of old, friendship between them
            and Chrysogonus; for though the Roscii had many ancient patrons and friends hereditarily
            connected with them, they ceased to pay any attention and respect to them, and betook
            themselves to the protection and support of Chrysogonus. <milestone n="107"
              unit="section"/> I can say all this with truth; for in this case I have no need to
            rely on conjecture. I know to a certainty that they themselves do not deny that
            Chrysogonus made the attack on this property at their instigation. If you see with your
            own eyes who has received a part of the reward for the information, can you possibly
            doubt, O judges, who gave the information? Who then are in possession of that property;
            and to whom did Chrysogonus give a share in it? The two Roscii!&mdash;Any one else?
            No one else, O judges. Is there then any doubt that they put this plunder in
            Chrysogonus's way, who have received from him a share of the plunder? <milestone n="108"
              unit="section"/> Come now let us consider the action of the Roscii by the judgment of
            Chrysogonus himself. If in that contest the Roscii had done nothing which was worth
            speaking of, on what account were they presented with such rewards by Chrysogonus? If
            they did nothing more than inform him of the fact, was it not enough for him to thank
            them? Why are these farms of such value immediately given to <persName><surname>Capito</surname></persName>? Why does that fellow Roscius possess all the
            rest in common property with Chrysogonus? Is it not evident, O judges, that Chrysogonus,
            understanding the whole business, gave them as spoils to the Roscii? <milestone n="38"
              unit="chapter"/><milestone n="109" unit="section"/></p>
          <p><persName><surname>Capito</surname></persName> came as a deputy to the camp, as one of
            the ten chief men of Ameria. Learn from his behaviour on this deputation the whole life
            and nature and manners of the man. Unless you are of opinion, O judges, that there is no
            duty and no right so holy and solemn that his wickedness and perfidy has not tampered
            with and violated it, then judge him to be a very excellent man. <milestone n="110"
              unit="section"/> He is the hindrance to Sulla's being informed of this affair; he
            betrays the plans and intentions of the other deputies to Chrysogonus; he gives him
            warning to take care that the affair be not conducted openly; he points out to him, that
            if the sale of the property be prevented, he will lose a large sum of money, and that he
            himself will be in danger of his life. He proceeds to spur him on, to deceive those who
            were joined in the commission with him; to warn him continually to take care; to hold
            out treacherously false hopes to the others; in concert with him to devise plans against
            them, to betray their counsels to him; with him to bargain for his share in the plunder,
            and, relying constantly on some delay or other, to cut off from his colleagues all
            access to Sulla. Lastly, owing to his being the prompter, the adviser, the go-between,
            the deputies did not see Sulla; deceived by his faith, or rather by his perfidy, as you
            may know from themselves, if the accuser is willing to produce them <note anchored="yes"
              >In a question of fact the accuser alone was permitted to submit witnesses; the
              defendant could not do so.</note> as witnesses, they brought back home with a false
            hope instead of a reality. <milestone n="111" unit="section"/> In private affairs if any
            one had managed a business entrusted to him, I will not say maliciously for the sake of
            his own gain and advantage, but even carelessly, our ancestors thought that he had
            incurred the greatest disgrace. Therefore, legal proceedings for betrayal of a
            commission are established, involving penalties no less disgraceful than those for
            theft. I suppose because, in cases where we ourselves cannot be present, the vicarious
            faith of friends is substituted; and he who impairs that confidence, attacks the common
            bulwark of all men, and as far as depends on him, disturbs the bonds of society. For we
            cannot do everything ourselves; different people are more capable in different matters.
            On that account friendships are formed, that the common advantage of all may be secured
            by mutual good offices. <milestone n="112" unit="section"/> Why do you undertake a
            commission, if you are either going to neglect it or to turn it to your own advantage?
            Why do you offer yourself to me, and by feigned service hinder and prevent my advantage?
            Get out of the way, I will do my business by means of some one else. You undertake the
            burden of a duty which you think you are able to support; a duty which does not appear
            very heavy to those who are not very worthless themselves. <milestone n="39"
              unit="chapter"/></p>
          <p>This fault therefore is very base, because it violates two most holy things, friendship
            and confidence; for men commonly do not entrust anything except to a friend, and do not
            trust any one except one whom they think faithful. It is therefore the part of a most
            abandoned man, at the same time to dissolve friendship and to deceive him who would not
            have been injured unless he had trusted him. <milestone n="113" unit="section"/> Is it
            not so? In the most trifling affairs be who neglects a commission, must be condemned by
            a most dishonouring sentence; in a matter of this importance, when he to whom the
            character of the dead, the fortunes of the living have been recommended and entrusted,
            loads the dead with ignominy and the living with poverty, shall he be reckoned among
            honourable men, shall he even be reckoned a man at all? In trifling affairs, in affairs
            of a private nature, even carelessness is accounted a crime, and is liable to a sentence
            branding a man with infamy; because, if the commission be properly executed, the man who
            has given the commission may feel at his ease and be careless about it: he who has
            undertaken the commission may not. In so important an affair as this, which was done by
            public order and so entrusted to him, what punishment ought to be inflicted on that man
            who has not hindered some private advantage by his carelessness, but has polluted and
            stained by his treachery the solemnity of the very commission itself? or by what
            sentence shall he be condemned? <milestone n="114" unit="section"/> If Sextus Roscius
            had entrusted this matter to him privately to transact and determine upon with
            Chrysogonus, and to involve his credit in the matter if it seemed to him to be
            necessary&mdash;if he who had undertaken the affair had turned ever so minute a
            point of the business to his own advantage, would he not, if convicted by the judge,
            have been compelled to make restitution, and would he not have lost all credit?
              <milestone n="115" unit="section"/> Now it is not Sextus Roscius who gave him this
            commission, but what is a much more serious thing, Sextus Roscius himself, with his
            character, his life, and all his property, is publicly entrusted by the senators to
            Roscius; and, of this trust, Titus Roscius has converted not some small portion to his
            own advantage, but has turned him entirely out of his property; he has bargained for
            three farms for himself; he has considered the intention of the senators and of all his
            fellow-citizens of just as much value as his own integrity. <milestone n="40"
              unit="chapter"/><milestone n="116" unit="section"/></p>
          <p>Moreover, consider now, O judges, the other matters, that you may see that no crime can
            be imagined with which that fellow has not disgraced himself. In less important matters,
            to deceive one's partner is a most shameful thing, and equally base with that which I
            have mentioned before. And rightly; because he who has communicated an affair to another
            thinks that he has procured assistance for himself. To whose good faith, then, shall a
            man have recourse who is injured by the want of faith in the man whom he has trusted?
            But these offences are to be punished with the greatest severity which are guarded
            against with the greatest difficulty. We can be reserved towards strangers; intimate
            friends must see many things more openly; but how can we guard against a companion? for
            even to be afraid of him is to do violence to the rights of duty. Our ancestors
            therefore rightly thought that he who had deceived his companion ought not to be
            considered in the number of good men. <milestone n="117" unit="section"/> But Titus
            Roscius did not deceive one friend alone in a money matter, (which, although it be a
            grave offence, still appears possible in some degree to be borne) but he led on,
            cajoled, and deserted nine most honourable men, betrayed them to their adversaries, and
            deceived them with every circumstance of fraud and perfidy. They who could suspect
            nothing of his wickedness, ought not to have been afraid of the partner of their duties;
            they did not see his malice, they trusted his false speech. Therefore these most
            honourable men are now, on account of his treachery, thought to have been incautious and
            improvident He who was at the beginning a traitor, then a deserter&mdash;who at
            first reported the counsels of his companions to their adversaries, and then entered
            into a confederacy with the adversaries themselves, even now terrifies us, and threatens
            us, adorned with his three farms, that is, with the prizes of his wickedness. In such a
            life as his, O judges, amid such numerous and enormous crimes, you will find this crime
            too, with which the present trial is concerned. <milestone n="118" unit="section"/> In
            truth you ought to make investigation on this principle; where you see that many things
            have been done avariciously, many audaciously, many wickedly, many perfidiously, there
            you ought to think that wickedness also lies hid among so many crimes; although this
            indeed does not lie hid at all, which is so manifest and exposed to view, that it may be
            perceived, not by those vices which it is evident exist in him, but even if any one of
            those vices be doubted of, he may be convicted of it by the evidence of this crime. What
            then, I ask, shall we say, O judges? Does this gladiator seem entirely to have thrown
            off his former character? or does that pupil of his seem to yield but little to his
            master in skill? Their avarice is equal, their dishonesty similar, their impudence is
            the same; the audacity of the one is twin-sister to the audacity of the other.
              <milestone n="41" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="119" unit="section"/></p>
          <p>Now forsooth, since you have seen the good faith of the master, listen to the justice
            of the pupil. I have already said before, that two slaves have been continually begged
            of them to be put to the question. You have always refused it, O Titus Roscius. I ask of
            you whether they who asked it were unworthy to obtain it? or had he, on whose behalf
            they asked it, no influence with you? or did the matter itself appear unjust? The most
            noble and respectable men of our state, whom I have named before, made the request, who
            have lived in such a manner, and are so esteemed by the Roman people, that there is no
            one who would not think whatever they said reasonable. And they made the request on
            behalf of a most miserable and unfortunate man, who would wish even himself to be
            submitted to the torture, provided the inquiry into his father's death might go on.
              <milestone n="120" unit="section"/> Moreover, the thing demanded of you was such that
            it made no difference whether you refused it or confessed yourself guilty of the crime.
            And as this is the case, I ask of you why you refused it? When Sextus Roscius was
            murdered they were there. The slaves themselves, as far as I am concerned, I neither
            accuse nor acquit; but the point which I see you contending for, namely, that they be
            not submitted to the question, is full of suspicion. But the reason of their being held
            in such horror by you, must be that they know something, which, if they were to tell,
            will be pernicious to you. Oh, say you, it is unjust to put questions to slaves against
            their masters. Is any such question meant to be put? For Sextus Roscius is the
            defendant, and when inquiry is being made into his conduct, you do not say that you are
            their masters. Oh, they are with Chrysogonus. I suppose so; Chrysogonus is so taken with
            their learning and accomplishments, that be wishes these men&mdash;men little better
            than labourers from the training of a rustic master of a family at Ameria, to mingle
            with his elegant youths, masters of every art and every refinement&mdash;youths
            picked out of many of the politest households. <milestone n="121" unit="section"/> That
            cannot be the truth, O judges; it is not probable that Chrysogonus has taken a fancy to
            their learning or their politeness, or that he should be acquainted with their industry
            and fidelity in the business of a household. There is something which is hidden; and the
            more studiously it is bidden and kept back by them, so much the more is it visible and
            conspicuous. <milestone n="42" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="122" unit="section"/></p>
          <p>What, then, are we to think? Is Chrysogonus unwilling that these men shall be put to
            the question for the sake of concealing his own crime? Not so, O judges; I do not think
            that the same arguments apply to every one. As far as I am concerned, I have no
            suspicion of the sort respecting Chrysogonus, and this is not the first time that it has
            occurred to me to say so. You recollect that I so divided the cause at the beginning;
            into the accusation, the whole arguing of which was entrusted to Erucius; and into
            audacity, the business of which was assigned to the Roscii;&mdash;whatever crime,
            whatever wickedness, whatever bloodshed there is, all that is the business of the
            Roscii. We say that the excessive interest and power of Chrysogonus is a hindrance to
            us, and can by no means be endured; and that it ought not only to be weakened, but even
            to be punished by you, since you have the power given to you. <milestone n="123"
              unit="section"/> I think as follows; that he who wishes these men to be put to the
            question, whom it is evident were present when the murder was committed, is desirous to
            find out the truth; that he who refuses it, though he does not dare admit it in words,
            yet does in truth by his actions, confesses himself guilty of the crime. I said at the
            beginning, O judges, that I was unwilling to say more of the wickedness of those men
            than the cause required, and than necessity itself compelled me to say. For many
            circumstances can be alleged, and every one of them can be discussed with many
            arguments. But I cannot do for any length of time, nor diligently, what I do against my
            will, and by compulsion. Those things which could by no means be passed over, I have
            lightly touched upon, O judges; those things which depend upon suspicion, and which, if
            I begin to speak of them, will require a copious discussion, I commit to your capacities
            and to your conjectures. <milestone n="43" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="124"

          <p>I come now to that golden name of Chrysogonus, <note anchored="yes">This is a pun on
              the name of Chrysogonus, all derived from the Greek word <foreign lang="greek"

            under which name the whole confederacy is set up, concerning whom, O judges, I am at a

            great part of my argument, and if I speak, I fear that not he alone (about whom I am not
            concerned), but others also may think themselves injured; although the case is such that
            it does not appear necessary to say much against the common cause of the brokers. For
            this cause is, in truth, a novel and an extraordinary cause. Chrysogonus is the
            purchaser of the property of Sextus Roscius. <milestone n="125" unit="section"/> Let us
            see this first, on what pretence the property of that man was sold, or how they could be
            sold. And I will not put this question, O judges, so as to imply that it is a scandalous
            thing for the property of an innocent man to be sold at all. For if these things are to
            be freely listened to and freely spoken, Sextus Roscius was not a man of such importance
            in the state as to make us complain of his fortune more than of that of others. But I
            ask this, how could they be sold even by that very law which is enacted about
            prescriptions, whether it be the Valerian <note anchored="yes">Valerius Flaccus had been
              created Interrex on the death of the two consuls, Marius and <persName><surname>Carbo</surname></persName>. He appointed Sulla dictator, and passed a law
              that whatever Sulla had done should be ratified; so that Cicero's meaning here is,
              that he does not know which was the nominal author of the law he is quoting, Valerius
              or Sulla.</note> or <placeName key="tgn,2257061">Cornelian</placeName>
            law,&mdash;for neither know nor understand which it is&mdash;but by that very
            law itself how could the property of Sextus Roscius be sold? <milestone n="126"
              unit="section"/> For they say it is written in it, &ldquo;that the property of
            those men who have been proscribed is to be sold&rdquo;; in which number Sextus
            Roscius is not one: &ldquo;or of those who have been slain in the garrisons of the
            opposite party.&rdquo; While there, were any garrisons, he was in the garrisons of
            Sulla; after they laid down their arms, returning from supper, he was slain at
              <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> in a time of perfect peace. If he was
            slain by law, I admit that his property was sold by law too; but if it is evident that
            he was slain contrary to all laws, not merely to old laws, but to the new ones also,
            then I ask by what right, or in what manner, or by what law they were sold? <milestone
              n="44" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="127" unit="section"/></p>
          <p>You ask, against whom do I say this, O Erucius. Not against him whom you are meaning
            and thinking of; for both my speech from the very beginning, and also I is own eminent
            virtue, at all times has acquitted Sulla. I say that Chrysogonus did all this in order
            to tell lies; in order to make out Roscius to have been a bad citizen; in order to
            represent him as slain among the opposite party; in order to prevent Lucius Sulla from
            being rightly informed of these matters by the deputies from Ameria. Last of all, I
            suspect that this property was never sold at all; and this matter I will open presently,
            O judges, if you will give me leave. <milestone n="128" unit="section"/> For I think it
            is set down in the law on what day these proscriptions and sales shall take place,
            forsooth on the first of January. Some months afterwards the man was slain, and his
            property is said to have been sold. Now, either this property has never been returned in
            the public accounts, and we are cheated by this scoundrel more cleverly than we think,
            or, if they were returned, then the public accounts have some way or other been tampered
            with, for it is quite evident that the property could not have been sold according to
            law. I am aware, O judges, that I am investigating this point prematurely, and that I am
            erring as greatly as if, while I ought to be curing a mortal sickness of Sextus Roscius,
            I were mending a whitlow; for he is not anxious about his money; he has no regard to any
            pecuniary advantage; he thinks he can easily endure his poverty, if he is released from
            this unworthy suspicion, from this false accusation. <milestone n="129" unit="section"/>
            But I entreat you, O judges, to listen to the few things I have still to say, under the
            idea that I am speaking partly for myself, and party for Sextus Roscius. For the things
            which appear to me unworthy and intolerable, and which I think concern all men unless we
            are prudent, those things I now mention to you for my own sake, from the real feelings
            and indignation of my mind. What relates to the misfortunes of the life, and to the
            cause of my client, and what he wishes to be said for him, and with what condition he
            will be content, you shall hear, O judges, immediately at the end of my speech. I ask
            this of Chrysogonus of my own accord, leaving Sextus Roscius out of the question.
              <milestone n="45" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="130" unit="section"/></p>
          <p>First of all, why the property of a virtuous citizen was sold? Next, why the property
            of a man who was neither proscribed, nor slain in the garrisons of the opposite party,
            were sold; when the law was made against them alone? Next, why were they sold long after
            the day which is appointed by the law? Next, why were they sold for go little! And if he
            shall choose, as worthless and wicked freedmen are accustomed to do, to refer all this
            to his patrons, he will do himself no good by that For there is no one who does not know
            that on account of the immensity of his business, many men did many things of which
            Lucius Sulla knew very little. <milestone n="131" unit="section"/> Is it right, then,
            that in these matters anything should be passed over without the ruler knowing it? It is
            not right, O judges, but it is inevitable. In truth, if the great and kind <persName><surname>Jupiter</surname></persName>, by whose will and command the heaven, the
            earth, and the seas are governed, has often by too violent winds, or by immoderate
            tempests, or by too much heat, or by intolerable cold, injured men, destroyed cities, or
            ruined the crops; nothing of which do we suppose to have taken place, for the sake of
            causing injury, by the divine intention, but owing to the power and magnitude of the
            affairs of the world; but on the other hand we see that the advantages which we have the
            benefit of, and the light which we enjoy, and the air which we breathe, are all given to
            and bestowed upon us by him; how can we wonder that Lucius Sulla, when he alone was
            governing the whole republic, and administering the affairs of the whole world, and
            strengthening by his laws the majesty of the empire, which he had recovered by arms,
            should have been forced to leave some things unnoticed? Unless this is strange that
            human faculties have not a power which divine might is unable to attain to. <milestone
              n="132" unit="section"/> But to say no more about what has happened already, cannot
            any one thoroughly understand from what is happening now, that Chrysogonus alone is the
            author and contriver of all this, and that it is he who caused Sextus Roscius to be
            accused? this trial in which Erucius says that he is the accuser out of regard for

            palace on the <placeName key="tgn,2118187">Palatine</placeName>; he has for the purposes
            of relaxation to his mind a pleasant suburban villa, and many farms besides, and not one
            which is not beautiful and contiguous; a house filled with Corinthian and Delian
            vessels, among which is that celebrated stove which he has lately bought at so great a
            price, that passers by, who heard the money being counted out, thought that a farm was
            being sold. What quantities besides of embossed plate, of embroidered quilts; of
            paintings, of statues, and of marble, do you think he has in his house? All, forsooth,
            that in a time of disturbance and rapine can be crammed into one house from the plunder
            of many magnificent families. But why should I mention how vast a household too was his,
            and in what various trades was it instructed? <milestone n="134" unit="section"/> I say
            nothing of those ordinary arts, cooks, bakers, and litter-bearers; he has so many slaves
            to gratify his mind and ears, that the whole neighbourhood resounds with the daily music
            of voices, and stringed instruments, and flutes. In such a life as this, O judges, how
            great a daily expense, and what extravagance do you think there must be? And what
            banquets? Honourable no doubt in such a house; if that is to be called a house rather
            than a workshop of wickedness, and a lodging for every sort of iniquity. <milestone

            his hair curled and perfumed, and with a great retinue of citizens, you yourselves
            behold, O judges; in truth you see how he despises every one, how he thinks no one a
            human being but himself, how he thinks himself the only happy, the only powerful man.
            But if I were to wish too mention what he does and what he attempts, O judges, I am
            afraid that some ignorant people would think that I wish to injure the cause of the
            nobility, and to detract from their victory; although I have a right to find fault if
            anything in that party displeases me. For I am not afraid that any one will suppose that
            I have a disposition disaffected to the cause of the nobility. <milestone n="47"

          <p>They who know me, know that I, to the extent of my small and insignificant power, (when
            that which I was most eager for could not be brought about, I mean an accommodation
            between the parties) laboured to ensure the victory of that party which got it. For who
            was there who did not see that meanness was disputing with dignity for the highest
            honours? a contest in which it was the part of an abandoned citizen not to unite himself
            to those, by whose safety dignity at home and authority abroad would be preserved. And
            that all this was done, and that his proper honour and rank was restored to every one, I
            rejoice, O judges, and am exceedingly delighted; and I know that it was all done by the
            kindness of the gods, by the zeal of the Roman people, by the wisdom and government, and
            good fortune <note anchored="yes">Cicero dwells on the <foreign lang="la"

            fault with punishment having been inflicted on those who laboured with all their
            energies on the other side; and I approve of honours having been paid to the brave men
            whose assistance was eminent in the transaction of all these matters. And I consider
            that the struggle was to a great extent with this object, and I confess that I shared in
            that desire in the part I took. But if the object was, and if arms were taken with the
            view of causing the lowest of the people to be enriched with the property of others, and
            of enabling them to make attacks on the fortunes of every one, and if it is unlawful not
            only to hinder that by deed, but even to blame it in words, then the Roman people seems
            to me not to have been strengthened and restored by that war, but to have been subdued
            and crushed. <milestone n="138" unit="section"/> But the ease is totally different:
            nothing of this, O judges, is the truth: the cause of the nobility will not only not be
            injured if you resist these men, but it will even be embellished. <milestone n="48"
              unit="chapter"/></p>
          <p>In truth, they who are inclined to find fault with this complain that Chrysogonus has
            so much influence; they who praise it, declare that he has not so much allowed him. And
            now it is impossible for any one to be either so foolish or so worthless as to say:
            &ldquo;I wish it were allowed me, I would have said...&rdquo; You may say...
            &ldquo;I would have done...&rdquo; You may do... No one hinders you.
            &ldquo;I would have decreed...&rdquo; &ldquo;Decree, only decree rightly,
            every one will approve.&rdquo; &ldquo;I should have judged...&rdquo; All
            will praise you if you judge rightly and properly. <milestone n="139" unit="section"/>
            While it was necessary and while the ease made it inevitable, one man had all the power,
            and after he created magistrates and established laws, his own proper office and
            authority was restored to every one. And if those who recovered it wish to retain it,
            they will be able to retain it for ever. But if they either participate in or approve of
            these acts of murder and rapine, these enormous and prodigal expenses&mdash;I do not
            wish to say anything too severe against them; not even as an omen; but this one thing I
            do say; unless those nobles of ours are vigilant, and virtuous, and brave, and merciful,
            they must abandon their honours to those men in whom these qualities do exist.
              <milestone n="140" unit="section"/> Let them, therefore, cease at least to say that a
            man speaks badly, if he speaks truly and with freedom; let them cease to make common
            cause with Chrysogonus; let them cease to think, if he be injured, that any injury has
            been done to them; let them see how shameful and miserable a thing it is that they, who
            could not tolerate the splendour of the knights, should be able to endure the domination
            of a most worthless slave&mdash;a domination, which, O judges, was formerly exerted
            in other matters, but now you see what a road it is making for itself, what a course it
            is aiming at, against your good faith, against your oaths, against your decisions,
            against almost the only thing which remains uncorrupted and holy in the state.
              <milestone n="141" unit="section"/> Does Chrysogonus think that in this particular too
            he has some influence? Does her even wish to be powerful in this? O miserable and bitter
            circumstance! Nor, in truth, am I indignant at this, because I am afraid that he may
            have some influence; but I complain of the mere fact of his having dared this, of his
            having hoped that with such men as these he could have any influence to the injury of an
            innocent man. <milestone n="49" unit="chapter"/></p>
          <p>Is it for this that the nobility has roused itself, that it has recovered the republic
            by arms and the sword&mdash;in order that freedmen and slaves might be able to
            maltreat the property of the nobles, and all your fortunes and ours, at their pleasure?
              <milestone n="142" unit="section"/> If that was the object, I confess that I erred in
            being anxious for their success. I admit that I was mad in espousing their party,
            although I espoused it, O judges, without taking up arms. But if the victory of the
            nobles ought to be an ornament and an advantage to the republic and the Roman people,
            then, too, my speech ought to be very acceptable to every virtuous and noble man. But if
            there be any one who thinks that he and his cause is injured when Chrysogonus is found
            fault with, he does not understand his cause, I may almost say he does not know himself.
            For the cause will be rendered more splendid by resisting every worthless man. The
            worthless favourers of Chrysogonus, who think that his cause and theirs are identical,
            are injured themselves by separating themselves from such splendour. <milestone n="143"
              unit="section"/> But all this that I have been now saying, as I mentioned before, is
            said on my own account, though the republic, and my own indignation, and the injuries
            done by these fellows, have compelled me to say it. But Roscius is indignant at none of
            these things; he accuses no one; he does not complain of the loss of his patrimony; he,
            ignorant of the world, rustic and down that he is, thinks that all those things which
            you say were done by Sulla were done regularly, legally and according to the law of
            nations. If he is only exempted from blame and acquitted of this nefarious accusation,
            he will be glad to leave the court. <milestone n="144" unit="section"/> If he is freed
            from this unworthy suspicion, he says that he can give up all his property with
            equanimity. He begs and entreats you, O Chrysogonus, if he has converted no part of his
            father's most ample possessions to his own use; if he has defrauded you in no
            particular; if he has given up to you and paid over and weighed out to you all his
            possessions with the most scrupulous faith; if he has given up to you the very garment
            with which he was clothed, and the ring off his finger; if he has stripped himself bare
            of everything, and has excepted nothing&mdash;he entreats you, I say, that he may be
            allowed to pass his life in innocence and indigence, supported by the assistance of his
            friends. <milestone n="50" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="145" unit="section"/></p>
          <p>&ldquo;You are in possession of my farms,&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;I am
            living on the charity of others; I do not object to that, both because I have a calm
            mind, and because it is inevitable. My own house is open to you, and is closed against
            myself. I endure that. You are master of my numerous household; I have not one slave. I
            submit to that, and think it is to be borne.&rdquo; What would you have more? What
            are you aiming at? Why are you attacking me now? In what point do you think your desires
            injured by me? In what point do I stand in the way of your advantage? In what do I
            hinder you? If you wish to slay the man for the sake of his spoils, you have despoiled
            him. What do you want more? If you want to slay him out of enmity, what enmity have you
            against him whose farms you took possession of before you knew himself? If you fear him,
            can you fear anything from him who you see is unable to ward off so atrocious an injury
            from himself? If, because the possessions which belonged to Roscius have become yours,
            on that account you seek to destroy his son, do you not show that you are afraid of that
            which you above all other men ought not to be afraid of; namely, that sometime or other
            their father's property may be restored to the children of proscribed persons?
              <milestone n="146" unit="section"/> You do wrong, O Chrysogonus, if you place greater
            hope of being able to preserve your purchase, than in those exploits which Lucius Sulla
            has performed But if you have no cause for wishing this unhappy man to be afflicted with
            such a grievous calamity; if he has given up to you everything but his life, and has
            reserved to himself nothing of his paternal property, not even as a memorial of his
            father&mdash;then, in the name of the gods, what is the meaning of this cruelty, of
            this savage and inhuman disposition? What bandit was ever so wicked, what pirate was
            ever so barbarous, as to prefer stripping off his spoils from his victim stained with
            his blood, which he might possess his plunder unstained, without blood? <milestone

            can take away from him&mdash;unless you are indignant at this, that you see him
            sitting with his clothes on in this court whom you turned naked out of his patrimony, as

              here, which is probably the case. According to Graevius, she was a woman held in such
              esteem that, in the Marsic war, the temple of Juno Sospita was restored by a decree of
              the senate in compliance with a dream seen by her, as Cicero records in the treatise
                <title>De Divinatione</title>.</note> the sister of Nepos, a most incomparable
            woman, who, though she had a most illustrious father, most honourable uncles, a most
            accomplished brother, yet, though she was a woman, carried her virtue so far, as to
            confer on them no less honour by her character than she herself received from their
            dignity. <milestone n="51" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="148" unit="section"/></p>
          <p>Does it appear to you a shameful thing that he is defended with earnestness? Believe
            me, if, in return for the hospitality and kindness of his father, all his hereditary
            friends were to choose to be present and dared to speak with freedom, he would be
            defended numerously enough; and if because of the greatness of the injury, and because
            the interests of the whole republic are imperilled by his danger, they all were to
            punish this conduct, you would not in truth be able to sit in that place. Now he is
            defended so that his adversaries ought not to be indignant at it, and ought not to think
            that they are surpassed in power. <milestone n="149" unit="section"/> What is done at
            home is done by means of Caecilia; the management of what takes place in the forum and

            age and strength equal to it, he would speak himself for Sextus Roscius. But since his
            age is an obstacle to his speaking, and also his modesty which sets off his age, he has
            entrusted the cause to me, who he knew was desirous of it for his sake, and who ought to
            be so, He himself, by his assiduity, by his wisdom, by his influence, and by his
            industry, has taken care that the life of Sextus Roscius, having been saved out of the
            bands of assassins, should be committed to the decisions of the judges. Of a truth, O
            judges, it was for this nobility that the greatest part of the city was in arms; this
            was all done that the nobles might be restored to the state, who would act as you see
            Messala acting; who would defend the life of an innocent man; who would resist injury;
            who would rather show what power they had in procuring the safety than the destruction
            of another. And if all who were born in the same rank did the same, the republic would
            be less harassed by them, and they themselves would be less harassed by envy. <milestone

          <p>But if, O judges, we cannot prevail with Chrysogonus to be content with our money, and
            not to aim at our life; if he cannot be induced, when he has taken from us everything
            which was our private property, not to wish to take away this light of life also which
            we have in common with all the world; if he does not consider it sufficient to glut his
            avarice with money, if he be not also dyed with blood cruelly shed&mdash;there is
            one refuge, O judges; there is one hope left to Sextus Roscius, the same which is left
            to the republic&mdash;your ancient kindness and mercy; and if that remain, we can
            even yet be saved. But if that cruelty which at present stalks abroad in the republic
            has made your dispositions also more harsh and cruel, (but that can never be the case,)
            then there is an end of everything, O judges; it is better to live among brute beasts
            than in such a savage state of things as this. <milestone n="151" unit="section"/> Are
            you reserved for this? Are you chosen for this? to condemn those whom cut-throats and
            assassins have not been able to murder? Good generals are accustomed to do this when
            they engage in battle&mdash;to place soldiers in that spot where they think the
            enemy will retreat, and then if any escape from the battle they make an onset on them
            unexpectedly. I suppose in the same way those purchasers of property think that you,
            that such men as you, are sitting here to catch those who have escaped out of their
            hands. God forbid, O judges, that this which our ancestors thought fit to style the
            public council should now be considered a guard to brokers! <milestone n="152"
              unit="section"/> Do not you perceive, O judges, that the sole object of all this is to
            get rid of the children of proscribed persons by any means; and that the first step to
            such a proceeding is sought for in your oaths and in the danger of Sextus Roscius? Is
            there any doubt to whom the guilt belongs, when you see on one side a broker, an enemy,
            an assassin, the same being also now our accuser, and on the other side a needy man, the
            son of the murdered man, highly thought of by his friends, on whom not only no crime but
            no suspicion even can be fixed? Do you see anything else whatever against Roscius except
            that his father's property has been sold? <milestone n="53" unit="chapter"/></p>
          <p><milestone n="153" unit="section"/> And if you also undertake that cause; if you offer
            your aid in that business; if you sit there in order that the children of those men
            whose goods have been sold may be brought before you; beware, in God's name, O judges,
            lest a new and much more cruel proscription shall seem to have been commenced by you.
            Though the former one was directed against those who could take arms, yet the Senate
            would not adopt it lest anything should appear to be done by the public authority more
            severe than had been established by the usages of our ancestors. And unless you by your
            sentence reject and spurn from yourselves this one which concerns their children and the
            cradles of their infant babes, consider, in God's name, O judges, to what a state you
            think the republic will arrive. <milestone n="154" unit="section"/>
          </p>
          <p>It behoves wise men, and men endowed with the authority and power with which you are
            endowed, to remedy especially those evils by which the republic is especially injured.
            There is not one of you who does not understand that the Roman people, who used formerly
            to be thought extremely merciful towards its enemies, is at present suffering from
            cruelty exercised towards its fellow-citizens. Remove this disease out of the state, O
            judges! Do not allow it to remain any longer in the republic; having not only this evil
            in itself, that it has destroyed so many citizens in a most atrocious manner, but that
            through habituating them to sights of distress, it has even taken away clemency from the
            hearts of most merciful men. For when every hour we see or hear of something very cruel
            being done, even we who are by nature most merciful, through the constant repetition of
            miseries, lose from our minds every feeling of humanity. </p>

          <argument>
            <head>THE ARGUMENT</head>
            <p>After the last speech which was delivered A. U. C. 674, Cicero went to <placeName
                key="tgn,7001393">Athens</placeName>, where he remained eighteen months, and after
              his return he did not employ himself at first as an advocate but devoted himself
              rather to philosophical studies. But in the third year, A. U. C. 677, when his friend
              Roscius, the comic actor, was interested in a cause, he returned to the bar. The
              subject of the action in which this speech was this: A man of the name of Fannius
              Chaerea had articled a young slave to Roscius on condition that Roscius was to teach
              him the art of acting, and that he and Fannius were afterwards to share his earnings.
              The slave was afterwards killed and Roscius brought an action against the man who had
              killed him, Quintus Flavius by name and received as damages a farm worth 100,000
                <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign>&mdash;for his half share in the slave,
              according to his own account, but as the full value of the slave according to Fannius
              but the fact was that Fannius also had brought an action against Flavius and had
              recovered similar damages. Fannius sued Roscius for 50,000 <foreign lang="la"
                >sesterces</foreign>, as his share of the damages which he (Roscius) had received
              from Flavius, suppressing the fact of his having obtained a similar sum himself. The
              beginning of this speech is lost, and also a considerable portion at the end. </p>

          <p>... He, forsooth, excellent man, and of singular integrity, endeavours in his own cause
            to bring forward his account-books as witnesses. Men are accustomed to say.... <note
              anchored="yes">There is a hiatus here so that though there are some words more in the
              Latin text, which I have omitted, it is impossible to make an sense of them.</note>
            Did I endeavour to corrupt such a man as that, so as to induce him to make a false
            entrance for my sake? I am waiting till Chaerea uses this argument. Was I able to induce
            this hand to be full of falsehood, and these fingers to make a false entry? But if he
            produces his accounts, Roscius will also produce his. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
            These words will appear in the books of the one, but not in those of the other. Why
            should you trust one rather than the other? Oh, would he ever have written it if he had
            not borne this expense by his authority? No, says the other, would he not have written
            it if he had given the authority? For just as it is discreditable to put down what is
            not owed, so it is dishonest not to put down what you do owe. For his accounts are just
            as much condemned who omits to make an entry of the truth, as his who puts down what is
            false. But see now to what, relying on the abundance and cogency of my arguments, I am
            now coming. If Caius Fannius produces in his own behalf his accounts of money received
            and paid, written at his own pleasure, I do not object to your giving your decision in
            his favour. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> What brother would show so much indulgence
            to a brother, what father to a son, as to consider whatever he entered in this manner
            proof of a fact? Oh, Roscius will ratify it. Produce your books; what you were convinced
            of, he will be convinced of; what was approved of by you, will be approved of by him. A
            little while ago we demanded the accounts of Marcus Perperna, and of Publius Saturius.
            Now, O Caius Fannius Chaerea, we demand your accounts alone, and we do not object to the
            action being decided by them&mdash;Why then do you not produce them? <milestone
              n="4" unit="section"/> Does he not keep accounts? Indeed he does most carefully. Does
            he not enter small matters in his books? Indeed be does everything. Is this a small and
            trifling sum? It is 100,000 <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign>. How is it that such
            an extraordinary sum us omitted?&mdash;how is it that a hundred thousand <foreign
              lang="la">sesterces</foreign>, received and expended, are not down in the books? Oh,
            ye immortal gods that there should be any one endued with such audacity, as to dare to
            demand a sum which he is afraid to enter in his account-books; not to hesitate to swear
            before the court to what, when not on his oath, he scrupled to put on paper; to
            endeavour to persuade another of what he is unable to make out to his own satisfaction.
              <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
          <p>He says that I am indignant, and sent the accounts too soon; he confesses that he has
            not this sum entered in his book of money received and expended; but he asserts that it
            does occur in his memoranda. Are you then so fond of yourself, have you such a
            magnificent opinion of yourself, as to ask for money from us on the strength, not of
            your account-books, but of your memoranda? To read one's account-books instead of
            producing witnesses, is a piece of arrogance; but is it not insanity to produce mere
            notes of writings and scraps of paper? <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> If memoranda
            have the same force and authority, and are arranged with the same care as accounts,
            where is the need of making an account-book? of making out careful lists? of keeping a
            regular order? of making a permanent record of old writings? But if we have adopted the
            custom of making account-books, because we put no trust in flying memoranda, shall that
            which, by all individuals, is considered unimportant and not to be relied on, be
            considered important and holy before a judge? <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Why is
            it that we write down memoranda carelessly, that we make up account-books carefully? For
            what reason? Because the one is to last a month, the other for ever; these are
            immediately expunged those are religiously preserved; these embrace the recollection of
            a short time, those pledge the good faith and honesty of a man for ever; these are
            thrown away, those are arranged in order. Therefore, no one ever produced memoranda at a
            trial; men do produce accounts, and read entries in books. <milestone n="3"
              unit="chapter"/></p>
          <p>You, O Caius Piso, a man of the greatest good faith, and virtue, and dignity, and
            authority, would not venture to demand money on the strength of memoranda. <milestone
              n="8" unit="section"/> I need not say any more about matters in which the custom is so
            notorious; but I ask you this, which is very material to the question, How long ago is
            it, O Fannius, that you made this entry in your memoranda? He blushes; he does not know
            what to answer; he is at a loss for anything to invent off-hand. &ldquo;It is two
            months ago,&rdquo; you will say; yet it ought to have been copied into the
            account-book of money received and paid. &ldquo;It is more than six
            months.&rdquo; Why then is it left so long in the memorandum-book? What if it is
            more than three years ago? How is it that, when every one else who makes up
            account-books transfers his accounts every month almost into his books you allow this
            sum to remain among your memoranda more than three years? <milestone n="9"
              unit="section"/> Have you all other sums of money received and expended regularly
            entered, or not? If not, how is it that you make up your books? If you have, how is it
            that, when you were entering all other items in regular order, you leave this sum, which
            was one of the greatest of all in amount, for more than three years in your memoranda?
            &ldquo;You did not like it to be known that Roscius was in your debt.&rdquo; Why
            did you put it down at all? &ldquo;You were asked not to enter it.&rdquo; Why
            did you put it down in your memoranda? But, although I think this is strong enough, yet
            I cannot satisfy myself unless I get evidence from Caius Fannius himself that this money
            is not owed to him. It is a great thing which I am attempting; it is a difficult thing
            which I am undertaking; yet I will agree that Roscius shall not gain the verdict unless
            he has the same man both for his adversary and for his witness. <milestone n="4"
              unit="chapter"/><milestone n="10" unit="section"/></p>
          <p>A definite sum of money was owed to you, which is now sought to be recovered at law;
            and security for a legitimate portion of it has been given. In this case, if you have
            demanded one sesterce more than is owed to you, you have lost your cause; because trial
            before a judge is one thing, arbitration is another. <note anchored="yes">Professor
              Long's explanation of the difference here laid down is little more than a translation
              of and comment on this passage. He says, &ldquo;The following is the distinction
              between <foreign lang="la">arbitrium</foreign> and <foreign lang="la"
                >judicium</foreign> according to Cicero (<bibl n="Cic. Q. Rosc. 4">Pro Rosc. Com.
                4</bibl>). In a <foreign lang="la">judicium</foreign> the demand was of a certain or
              definite amount, <foreign lang="la">pecuniae certae</foreign>).; in an <foreign
                lang="la">arbitrium</foreign> the amount was not determined (<foreign lang="la"
                >incertae</foreign>.) In a <foreign lang="la">judicium</foreign> the plaintiff
              obtained all that he claimed or nothing, as the words of the formula show,
                &ldquo;<foreign lang="la">si paret H. S. 1000 dari
              oportere.</foreign>&rdquo; (Compare <bibl n="Gaius Inst. 4.50">Gaius, iv.
                50.</bibl>) The corresponding words in the formula arbitraria were
                &ldquo;<foreign lang="la">Quantum aequius melius, id dari</foreign>&rdquo;;
              and their equivalents were &ldquo;<foreign lang="la">ex fide bona; ut inter bonos
                bene agier.</foreign>&rdquo; (Top. 17)... If the matter was brought before a
                <foreign lang="la">judex</foreign>, properly so called, the <foreign lang="la"
                >judicium</foreign> was constituted with a <foreign lang="la">poena</foreign>, that
              is <foreign lang="la">per sponsionem</foreign>; there was no <foreign lang="la"
                >poena</foreign> when an arbiter was demanded, and the proceeding was by the formula
                <foreign lang="la">arbitraria</foreign>. The proceeding by the <foreign lang="la"
                >sponsio</foreign> then was the strict one, &ldquo;<foreign lang="la"
                >Angustissima formula sponsionis</foreign>,&rdquo; (<bibl n="Cic. Q. Rosc. 14"
                >Cic. pro Rosc. Com. 14</bibl>); that of the <foreign lang="la">arbitrium</foreign>
              was <foreign lang="la">ex fide bona</foreign>, and the arbiter, though he was bound by
              the instructions of the formula, was allowed a greater latitude by its terms. The
              engagement between the parties who accepted an arbiter, by which they bound themselves
              to abide by his <foreign lang="la">arbitrium</foreign>, was <foreign lang="la"
                >compromissum</foreign>. (<bibl n="Cic. Q. Rosc. 40">Pro Rosc. Com. 40</bibl>) But
              this term was also employed, as it appears, to express the engagement by which parties
              agreed to settle their differences by arbitration, without the intervention of the
                <foreign lang="la">praetor</foreign>. Smith, Dict. Ant. v. 530 v. <foreign lang="la"
                >Judex</foreign>. </note> Trial before a judge is about a definite sum of money;
            arbitration about one which is not determined. We come before a judge so as either to
            gain the whole suit or to lose it; we go before an arbiter on the understanding that we
            may not get all we asked, and on the other hand may not get nothing. <milestone n="11"
              unit="section"/> Of that the very words of the formula are a proof. What is the
            formula in a trial before a judge? Direct severe, and simple; &ldquo;if it be plain
            that fifty thousand <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign> ought to be paid.&rdquo;
            Unless he makes it plain that fifty thousand <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign> to a
            single farthing are due to him, he loses his cause. What is the formula in a cause
            brought before an arbiter? &ldquo;That whatever is just and right shall be
            given.&rdquo; But that man confesses that he is asking more than is owed to him, but
            that he will be satisfied and more than satisfied with what is given him by the arbiter.
            Therefore the one has confidence in his case, the other distrusts his. <milestone n="12"
              unit="section"/> And as this is the case, I ask you why you made an agreement to abide
            by arbitration in a matter involving this sum, this very fifty thousand <foreign
              lang="la">sesterces</foreign>, and the credit of your own account-books? why you
            admitted an arbitrator in such a case to decide what it was right and proper should be
            paid to you; or secured to you by bond, if it so seemed good to him? Who was the
            arbitrator in this matter? I wish he were at <placeName key="tgn,7013962"
              >Rome</placeName>. He is at <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>. I wish he
            were in court. He is. I wish he were sitting as assessor to Caius <persName><surname>Piso</surname></persName>. He is Caius Piso himself. Did you take the same
            man for both arbitrator, and judge? Did you permit to the same man unlimited liberty of
            varying his decision, and also limit him to the strictest formula of the bond? Who ever
            went before an arbitrator and got all that he demanded? No one; for he only got all that
            it was just should be given him. You have come before a judge for the very same sum for
            which you had recourse to an arbiter. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> Other men, when
            they see that their cause is failing before a judge, fly to an arbitrator. This man has
            dared to come from an arbiter to a judge, who when he admitted an arbitrator about this
            money, and about the credit due to his account-books, gave a plain indication that no
            money was owing to him. Already two-thirds of the cause are over. He admits that he has
            not set down the sum as due, and he does not venture to say that he has entered it as
            paid, since he does not produce his books. The only alternative remaining, is for him to
            assert that he had received a promise of it; for otherwise I do not see how he can
            possibly demand a definite sum of money. <milestone n="5" unit="chapter"/></p>
          <p>Did you receive a promise of it? When? On what day? At what time? In whose presence?
              <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> Who says that I made such a promise? No one. If I
            were to make an end of speaking here, I appear to have said enough to acquit myself as
            far as my good faith and diligence are at stake&mdash;to have said enough for the
            cause and dispute, enough for the formula and bond; I seem to have said enough to
            satisfy the judge why judgment ought to pass for Roscius. A definite sum of money has
            been demanded; security is given for a third part of it; this money must either have
            been given, or set down as paid, or promised. Fannius admits it was not given; the books
            of Fannius prove that it has not been set down as paid; the silence of witnesses proves
            that it was never promised. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> What do we want more?
            Because the defendant is a man to whom money has always seemed of no value, but
            character of the very highest, and the judge is a man whom we are no less anxious to
            have think well of us than to decide favourably for us, and the bar present is such,
            that on account of its extraordinary brilliancy we ought to feel almost as much respect
            for it as for another judge, we will speak as if every regular trial, every honorary
            arbitration, every domestic duty were included and comprehended in the present formula.
            That former oration was necessary, this shall be a voluntary one; the other was
            addressed to the judge, this is addressed to Caius Piso; that was on behalf of a
            defendant, this is on behalf of Roscius; the one was prepared to gain a victory, this
            one to preserve a good character. <milestone n="6" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="16"
              unit="section"/></p>
          <p>You demand, O Fannius, a sum of money from Roscius. What sum? Is it money which is owed
            to you from the partnership? or money which has been promised and assured to you by his
            liberality? One demand is important and odious, the other is more trifling and easy to
            be got rid of. Is it a sum which is owing from the partnership? What are you saying?
            This is neither to be borne lightly nor to be defended carelessly. For if there are any
            private actions of the greatest, I may almost say, of capital importance, they are these
            three&mdash;the actions about trust, about guardianship, and about partnership. For
            it is equally perfidious and wicked to break faith, which is the bond of life, and to
            defraud one's ward who has come under one's guardianship, and to deceive a partner who
            has connected himself with on. in business. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> And as
            this is the case, let us consider who. it is who in this instance has deceived and
            cheated his partner. For his past life shall silently give us a trustworthy and
            important testimony one way or other. Is it Quintus Roscius? What do you say? Does not,
            as fire dropped upon water is immediately extinguished and cooled, so, does not, I say,
            a false accusation, when brought in contact with a most pure and holy life, instantly
            fall and become extinguished? Has Roscius cheated his partner? Can this guilt belong to
            this man? who, in truth, (I say it boldly,) has more honesty than skill, more truth than
            learning; whom the Roman people think even a better man than he is an actor; who is as
            worthy of the stage because of his skill, as he is wholly of the senate on account of
            his moderation. <milestone n="18" unit="section"/> But why am I so foolish as to say
            anything about Roscius to Piso? I suppose I am recommending an unknown man in many
            words. Is there any man in the whole world of whom you have a better opinion? Is there
            any man who appears to you more pure, more modest, more humane, more regardful of his
            duty, more liberal? Have even you, O Saturius, who appear against him, have you a
            different opinion? Is it not true that as often as you have mentioned his name in the
            cause, you have said that he was a good man, and have spoken of him with expressions of
            respect? which no one is in the habit of doing except in the case of either a most
            honorable man, or of a most dear friend. <milestone n="19" unit="section"/> While doing
            so, in truth, you appeared to me ridiculously inconstant in both injuring and praising
            the same man; in calling him at the same time a most excellent man and a most dishonest
            man. You were speaking of the man with respect, and calling him a most exemplary man,
            and at the same time you were accusing him of having cheated his partner. But I imagine
            the truth is, your praise was prompted by truth; the accusation by your duty to your
            client. You were speaking of Roscius as you really thought; you were conducting the
            cause according to the will of Chaerea. Roscius cheated him. <milestone n="7"
              unit="chapter"/></p>
          <p>This, in truth, seems absurd to the ears and minds of men. What? If he had got hold of
            some man, rich, timid, foolish and indolent, who was unable to go to law with him, still
            it would Be incredible. <milestone n="20" unit="section"/> But let us see whom he has
            cheated. Roscius has cheated Caius Fannius Chaerea. I beg and entreat you, who know them
            both, compare the lives of the two men together; you who do not know them, compare the
            countenance of both. Does not his very head, and those eye-brows entirely shaved off,
            seem to smell of wickedness, and to proclaim cunning? Does he not from his toe-nails to
            his head, if the voiceless figure of a man's person can enable men to conjecture his
            character, seem wholly made up of fraud, and cheating, and lies? He who has his head and
            eyebrows always shaved that he may not be said to have one hair of an honest man about
            him. And Roscius has been accustomed to represent his figure admirably on the stage, and
            yet he does no meet with the gratitude due to such kindness. For when he acts Ballio,
            that most worthless and perjured pimp, he represents Chaerea. That foul, and impure, and
            detestable character is represented in this man's manners, and nature, and life. And why
            he should have thought Roscius like himself in dishonesty and wickedness, I do not know;
            unless, perhaps, because he observed that he imitated himself admirably in the character
            of the pimp. <milestone n="21" unit="section"/> Wherefore consider over and over again,
            O Caius Piso, who is said to have cheated, and who to have been cheated. Roscius is said
            to have cheated Fannius? What is that? The honest man is said to have cheated the rogue;
            the modest man, the shameless one; the chaste man, the perjurer; the unpractised man,
            the cunning one; the liberal man is said to have cheated the covetous one. It is
            incredible how, if Fannius were said to have cheated Roscius, each fact would appear
            probable from the character of each man; both that Fannius had acted wickedly, and that
            Roscius had been cheated by his imprudence. So when Roscius is accused of having cheated
            Fannius, both parts of the story are incredible, both that Roscius should have sought
            anything covetously, and that Fannius should have lost anything by his good-nature.
              <milestone n="8" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="22" unit="section"/></p>
          <p>Such is the beginning. Let us see what follows. Quintus Roscius has cheated Fannius of
            50,000 <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign>. On what account? Saturius smiles; a
            cunning fellow, as he seems to himself. He says, for the sake of the fifty thousand
              <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign>. I see; but yet I ask why he was so exceedingly
            desirous of this particular fifty thousand <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign>? For
            certainly, O Marcus Perperna and Caius Piso, they would not have been of such
            consequence to either of you, as to make you cheat your partner. I ask, then, why they
            were of such consequence to Roscius! Was he in want of money? No, he was even a rich
            man. Was he in debt? On the contrary, he was living within his income. Was he
            avaricious? far from it; even before he was a rich man he was always most liberal and
            munificent. <milestone n="23" unit="section"/> Oh, in the name of good faith, of gods,
            and men! he who once refused to make a gain of three hundred thousand <foreign lang="la"
              >sesterces</foreign>&mdash;for he certainly both could and would have earned three
            hundred thousand <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign> if Dionysia <note anchored="yes"
              >Dionysia was a celebrated dancer.</note> can earn two hundred thousand,&mdash;did
            he seek to acquire fifty thousand by the greatest dishonesty, and wickedness and
            treachery? And that sum was immense, this trifling; that was honourable, this sordid;
            that was pleasant, this bitter; that would have been his own, this must have been stated
            on an action and a trial. In these last ten years he might have earned six millions of
              <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign> most honourably. He would not; he undertook the
            labour entitled to gain, but refused the gain of his labour. He did not yet desist from
            serving the Roman people; he has long since ceased to benefit himself. <milestone n="24"
              unit="section"/> Would you even do this, O Fannius? And if you were able to receive
            such profits, would you not act with all your gestures, and even at the risk of your
            life? Say now that you have been cheated of fifty thousand <foreign lang="la"
              >sesterces</foreign> by Roscius, who has refused such enormous sums, not because he
            was too indolent to labour for them, but out of a magnificence of liberality. What now
            shall I say of these things which I know to a certainty occur to your minds, O judges?
            Roscius cheated you in a partnership. There are laws, there are formularies <note
              anchored="yes">&ldquo;As the <foreign lang="la">formulae</foreign> comprehended,
              or were supposed to comprehend, every possible form of action that could be required
              by a plaintiff; it was presumed that he could find among all the <foreign lang="la"
                >formulae</foreign> some one which was adapted to his case; and he was accordingly
              supposed to be without excuse if he did not take pains to select the proper
                formula.&rdquo;&mdash;<bibl>Cic. pro Rosc. Com. 8</bibl>. <bibl>Smith, Dict.
                Ant. p. 9, v. <foreign lang="la">Actio</foreign></bibl>.</note> established for
            every case, that no one may make a blunder, either as to the legal description of injury
            which he has suffered, or as to the sort of action he should bring; for public formulae
            have been given by the praetor to suit every evil, or vexation, or inconvenience, or
            calamity, or injury which any one can suffer and to them each private action is adapted.
              <milestone n="9" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="25" unit="section"/></p>
          <p>And as this is the case, I ask why you have not Roscius as your partner before an
            arbitrator? Did you not know the formula? It was most notorious. Were you unwilling to
            adopt severe proceedings? Why so? On account of your ancient intimacy? Why then do you
            injure him now? On account of the integrity of the man? Why then do you accuse him now?
            On account of the magnitude of the crime? Is it so? The man whom you could not
            circumvent before an arbitrator, to whose decision such a matter properly belonged, will
            you seek to convict before a judge, who has no power of arbitrating in it? Either, then,
            bring this charge where it may be discussed, or do not bring it where it may not:
            although the charge is already done away with by your own evidence; for when you
            declined to adopt that formula, you showed that he had committed no fraud against the
            partnership. Oh, he made a covenant. Has he account-books, or not? If he has not, how is
            the covenant shown? If he has, why do you not tell us? <milestone n="26" unit="section"
            /> Say now, if you dare, that Roscius begged of you to appoint his own intimate friend
            arbitrator. He did not beg you to. Say that he made a covenant in order to procure his
            acquittal. He made no covenant. Ask why then he was acquitted? Because he was a man of
            the most perfect innocence and integrity. For what happened? You came of your own accord
            to the house of Roscius; you apologised to him; you begged him to announce to the judge
            that you had acted hastily, and to pardon you; you said that you would not appear
            against him; you said loudly that he owed you nothing on account of the partnership. He
            gave notice to the judge; he was acquitted. And still do you dare to mention dishonesty
            and theft? He persists in his impudence. I did all this, says he, for he had made a
            covenant with me. Yes, I suppose to procure his acquittal. What reason had he to fear
            that he would be condemned? <milestone n="27" unit="section"/> Oh, the matter was
            evident, the theft was undeniable. A theft of what? He begins, in a manner to create
            great expectations, to relate his partnership with the old actor. <milestone n="10"
              unit="chapter"/></p>
          <p>Panurgus, says he, was a slave of Fannius. He had an equal share in him with Roscius.
            Here in the first place Saturius began to complain bitterly that Roscius had had a in
            him given to him for nothing, when he had become the property of Fannius by purchase.
            That liberal man, forsooth, that extravagant man, that man overflowing with kindness,
            made a present of his share to Roscius? No doubt of it. <milestone n="28" unit="section"
            /> Since he rested on this point for a while, it is necessary for me also to dwell a
            little on it. You say, O Saturius, that Panurgus was the private property of Fannius.
            But I say that the whole of him belonged to Roscius, for how much of him belonged to
            Fannius? His body. How much to Roscius? His education. His person was of no value; his
            skill was valuable. As far as he belonged to Fannius, he was not worth fifty thousand
              <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign>; as far as he belonged to Roscius, he was worth
            more than a hundred thousand. For no one looked at him because of his person; but people
            estimated him by his skill as a comic actor. For those limbs could not earn by
            themselves more than twelve <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign>; owing to the
            education which was given him by Roscius, he let himself out for not less than a hundred
            thousand. <milestone n="29" unit="section"/> Oh, tricky and scandalous partnership, when
            the one brings what is worth fifty thousand <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign> into
            the partnership, the other what is worth a hundred thousand; unless you are indignant at
            this, that you took the fifty thousand out of your strong box, and Roscius got his
            hundred thousand out of his learning and skill. For what was it that Panurgus brought
            with him on the stage? What was the expectation formed of him why was there such zeal
            for him, such partiality to him? Because he was the pupil of Roscius. They who loved the
            one, favoured the other; they who admired the one, approved of the other; lastly, all
            who had heard the name of the one, thought the other well-trained and accomplished. And
            this is the way with the common people; they estimate few things by the real truth, many
            things by prejudice. <milestone n="30" unit="section"/> Very few observed what he knew,
            but every one asked where he had been taught; they thought that nothing poor or had
            could be produced by him. If he had come from Statilius, even if he had surpassed
            Roscius in skill, no one would have been able to see it. For just as no one supposes
            that a good son can be born to a worthless father, so no one would suppose that a good
            Comedian could be formed by a very bad actor; but because he came from Roscius, he
            appeared to know more than he really did know. <milestone n="11" unit="chapter"/></p>
          <p>And this lately did actually happen in the case of Eros the comedian, for he, after he
            was driven off the stage, not merely by hisses, but even by reproaches, took refuge, as
            at an altar, in the house, and instruction, and patronage, and name of Roscius.
            Therefore, in a very short time he who had not been even one of the lowest class of
            actors, came to be reckoned among the very first comedians. <milestone n="31"
              unit="section"/> What was it that raised him? This man's commendation alone who not
            only took this Panurgus home that he might have the name of a pupil of Roscius, but who
            also instructed him with the greatest pains and energy and patience. For the more
            skillful and ingenious any one is, the more vehement and laborious is he in teaching his
            art; for that which he himself caught quickly, he is tortured by seeing slowly
            comprehended by another. My speech has extended itself to some length, in order that you
            may thoroughly understand the conditions of this partnership. <milestone n="32"
              unit="section"/> What then followed? A man of <placeName key="tgn,7006776"
              >Tarquinii</placeName>, Quintus Flavius by name, knew this Panurgus, the common slave
            of Roscius and Fannius, and you appointed me as the advocate to conduct the action about
            that business. The cause having been commenced, and an action being appointed according
            to the formula, &ldquo;for injury and loss inflicted,&rdquo; you brought it to a
            conclusion with Flavius, without my knowledge. Was it for the half share, or for the
            entire partnership? I will speak plainly. Was it for myself, or for myself and for
            yourself? Was it for myself alone? I could do so according to the precedent set by many
            people; it is lawful to do so; many men have legally done so; I have done you no injury
            in that matter. Do you demand what is due to you? Exact it, and carry it off. Let every
            one have and follow up his portion of his right. &ldquo;But you managed your affair
            very well.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do you too manage yours well&rdquo; &ldquo;You
            get your half share valued at a high price.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do you too get yours
            valued at a high price.&rdquo; &ldquo;You get a hundred thousand <foreign
              lang="la">sesterces</foreign>,&rdquo;&mdash;if indeed that be true.
            &ldquo;Then do you also get a hundred thousand <foreign lang="la"
              >sesterces</foreign>.&rdquo; <milestone n="12" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="33"
              unit="section"/></p>
          <p>But you may easily, both in belief and in speaking of it, have exaggerated the terms on
            which Roscius concluded his business; in fact and reality you will find them moderate
            and unimportant. For he got a farm at a time when the prices of farms were very
            low,&mdash;a farm which had not a house on it, and was not well cultivated in any
            respect, which is worth much more now than it was. And no wonder, for at that time, on
            account of the calamities of the republic, every one's possessions were uncertain; now,
            by the kindness of the immortal gods, the fortunes of every one are well assured: then
            it was an uncultivated farm, without a house; now it is beautifully cultivated, with an
            excellent villa on it. <milestone n="34" unit="section"/> But since by nature you are so
            malevolent, I will never relieve you from that vexation and that anxiety. Roscius
            managed his business well; he got a most fertile farm. What is that to you? Do you
            settle your half of the matter anyhow you please. He then changes his plan of attack,
            and endeavours to invent a story which he cannot prove. &ldquo;You,&rdquo; says
            he, &ldquo;arranged the whole matter, and not your share of it only.&rdquo; The
            whole cause then is brought to this point,&mdash;whether Roscius came to a
            settlement with Flavius for his own share, or for the whole partnership. <milestone
              n="35" unit="section"/> For I confess that, if Roscius touched anything on their joint
            account, he ought to pay it to the partnership. Did he settle the quarrel of the
            partnership, and not merely his own, when he received this farm from Flavius? If so, why
            did he not give security to Flavius, that no one else should make any demand on him? He
            who settles his own demand only, leaves to the rest their right of action unimpaired; he
            who acts for his partners, gives security that none of them shall afterwards make any
            demand. Why did it not occur to Flavius to take this precaution for himself? Was he,
            forsooth, not aware that Panurgus belonged to a partnership. He knew that. Was he not
            aware that Fannius was Roscius' partner? Thoroughly; for he himself had a law-suit
            commenced with him. <milestone n="36" unit="section"/> Why then does he settle this
            action, and not exact an agreement that no one shall make any further demand on him? Why
            does he lose the farm, and yet get no release from this action? Why does he act in so
            inexperienced a manner, as neither to bind Roscius by any stipulation, nor on the other
            hand to get a release from Fannius' action? <milestone n="37" unit="section"/> This
            first argument, drawn both from the rules of civil rights, and from the customs
            prevailing with respect to such security, is a most important and powerful one, which I
            would press at greater length, if I had not other more undeniable and manifest proofs in
            the cause. <milestone n="13" unit="chapter"/></p>
          <p>And that you may not say I have promised this on insufficient grounds, I will call
            you&mdash;you, I say, Fannius&mdash;from your seat as a witness against
            yourself.&mdash;What is your charge? That Roscius settled with Flavius on behalf of
            the partnership.&mdash;When? Four years ago.&mdash;What is my defence? That
            Roscius settled with Flavius for his share in the property. You yourself, three years
            ago, made a new engagement with Roscius.&mdash;What? Recite that stipulation
            plainly.&mdash;Attend, I beg you, O <persName><surname>Piso</surname></persName>&mdash;I am compelling Fannius against his will, and though he is
            shuffling off in every direction, to give evidence against himself. For what are the
            words of this new agreement? &ldquo;Whatever I receive from Flavius, I undertake to
            pay one half of to Roscius.&rdquo; These are your words, O Fannius. <milestone
              n="38" unit="section"/> What can you get from Flavius, if Flavius owes you nothing?
            Moreover, why does he now enter into a mutual engagement about a sum which he has
            already exacted some time ago? But what can Flavius be going to give you, if he has
            already paid Roscius everything that he owed? Why is this new mutual arrangement
            interposed in so old an affair, in a matter so entirely settled, in a partnership which
            has been dissolved? Who is the drawer up of this agreement? who is the witness? who is
            the arbitrator? who? You, O <persName><surname>Piso</surname></persName>: for you
            begged Quintus Roscius to give Fannius fifteen thousand <foreign lang="la"
              >sesterces</foreign>, for his care, for his labour, for having been his agent, and for
            having given security, on this condition, that, if he get anything from Flavius, he
            should give half of that sum to Roscius. Does not that agreement seem to show you with
            sufficient clearness that Roscius settled the affair on his own behalf alone? <milestone
              n="39" unit="section"/> But perhaps this also may occur to you, that Fannius did in
            requital promise Roscius half of whatever he might get from Flavius, but that be got
            nothing at all. What has that to do with it? You ought to regard not the result of the
            demand, but the beginning of the mutual agreement. And it does not follow, if he did not
            choose to prosecute his demand, that he did not for all that, as far as it depended on
            him, show his opinion that Roscius had only settled his own claim, and not the claim of
            the partnership. What more? Suppose I make it evident, that after the whole settlement
            come to by Roscius, after this fresh mutual agreement entered into by Fannius, Fannius
            also recovered a hundred thousand <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign> from Flavius,
            for the loss of Panurgus? Will he after that still dare to sport with the character of
            that most excellent man, Quintus Roscius? <milestone n="14" unit="chapter"/><milestone
              n="40" unit="section"/></p>
          <p>I asked a little before&mdash;what was very material to the business, on what
            account Flavius, when (as they say) he was settling the whole claim, did neither take
            security from Roscius, nor obtain a release from all demands from Fannius? But now I ask
            how it was that, when he had settled the whole affair with Roscius, he paid also a
            hundred thousand <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign> to Fannius on his separate
            account? (a thing still more strange and incredible.) I should like to know, O Saturius,
            what answer are you preparing to give to this? Whether you are going to say that Fannius
            never got a hundred thousand <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign> from Flavius at all,
            or that he got them for some other claim, and on some other account? <milestone n="41"
              unit="section"/> If you say it was on some other account, what dealings had you ever
            had with him? None. Had you obtained any verdict against him? No. I am wasting time to
            no purpose. He never, he says, got a hundred thousand <foreign lang="la"
              >sesterces</foreign> from Flavius at all, neither on account of Panurgus, nor of any
            one else. If I prove that, after this recent agreement with Roscius, you did get a
            hundred thousand <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign> from Flavius, what have you to
            allege why you should not leave the court defeated with disgrace? By what witness then
            shall I make this plain? <milestone n="42" unit="section"/> This affair, as I imagine,
            came to trial. Certainly. Who was the plaintiff? Fannius. Who the defendant? Flavius.
            Who was the judge? Cluvius. Of all these men I must produce one as witness who can say
            that the money was paid. Who of these is the most authoritative witness? Beyond all
            controversy, he who was approved of as judge by the sentence of every one. Which of the
            three then will you look to me for as a witness? The plaintiff? That is Fannius; he will
            never give evidence against himself. The defendant? That is Flavius. He has been dead
            some time. The judge? That is Cluvius. What does he say? That Flavius did pay a hundred
            thousand <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign> to Fannius on account of Panurgus. And
            if you look at the rank of Cluvius, he is a Roman knight; if at his life, he is a most
            illustrious man; if at your own opinion of him, you chose him as judge; if to his truth,
            he has said what he both could know, and ought to know. <milestone n="43" unit="section"
            /> Deny now, deny, if you can, that credit ought to be given to a Roman knight, to an
            honest man, to your own judge. He looks round; he fumes; he denies that we are going to
            recite the testimony of Cluvius. We will recite it; you are mistaken, you are consoling
            yourself with a slight and empty hope. Recite the testimony of Titus Manilius and Caius
            Luscius Ocrea, two senators, most accomplished men, who heard it from Cluvius. </p>
          <p>(<emph>The secretary reads the evidence of Manilius and Luscius.</emph>) What do you
            say now&mdash;that we are not to believe Luscius and Manilius, or that we are not to
            believe Cluvius? I will speak more plainly and openly. <milestone n="15" unit="chapter"
            /></p>
          <p>Did Luscius and Manilius hear nothing from Cluvius about the hundred thousand <foreign
              lang="la">sesterces</foreign>? or did Cluvius say what was false to Luscius and
            Manilius? On this point I am of a calm and easy mind, and I am not particularly anxious
            as to which way you answer. For the cause of Roscius is fortified by the strongest and
            most solemn evidence of most excellent men. If you have taken time enough to consider to
            which you will refuse belief on their oath, answer me. <milestone n="44" unit="section"
            /> Do you say that one must not believe Manilius and Luscius? Say it. Dare to say it.
            Such a saying suits your obstinacy, your arrogance, your whole life. What! Are you
            waiting till I say presently of Luscius and Manilius that they are as to rank senators;
            as to age, old; as to their nature, pious and religious; as to their property, rich and
            wealthy I will not do so; I will not, on pretence of giving these men the credit due to
            a life passed with the greatest strictness, put myself in so bad a light as to venture
            to panegyrize men so much older and nobler than myself, whose characters stand in no
            need of my praise. My youth is in more need of their favourable opinion than their
            strict old age is of my commendation. But you, O Piso, must deliberate and consider for
            a long time whether you will rather believe Chaerea, though not on his oath, and in his
            own cause, or Manilius and Luscius on their oaths, in a cause in which they have no
            interest. <milestone n="45" unit="section"/> The remaining alternative is for him to
            contend that Cluvius told a falsehood to Luscius and Manilius. And, if he does that, how
            great is his impudence! Will he throw discredit on that man as a witness whom he
            approved of as a judge? Will he say that you ought not to trust that man whom he has
            trusted himself? Will he disparage the credit of that man as a witness to the judge,
            when on account of his opinion of his good faith and scrupulousness as a judge, he
            brought witnesses before him? When I produce that man as a witness, will he dare to find
            fault with him, when if I were to bring him as a judge even, he would be bound not to
            decline him? Oh, but says he, he was not on his oath when he said that to Luscius and
            Manilius. Would you believe him, if he said it on his oath? <milestone n="16"
              unit="chapter"/><milestone n="46" unit="section"/></p>
          <p>But what is the difference between a perjurer and a liar? He who is in the habit of
            lying, is in the habit of perjuring himself. The man whom I can induce to tell a lie, I
            shall easily be able to prevail on to take a false oath. For he who has once departed
            from truth, is easily led on, with no greater scruples to perjury than to a lie. For who
            is influenced by just a mention of the gods in the way of deprecating their anger, and
            not by the influence of conscience? Because the same punishment which is appointed by
            the immortal gods for a perjurer is appointed also for a liar. For the immortal gods are
            accustomed to be indignant and angry, not on account of the form of words in which an
            oath is contained, but on account of the treachery and malice by which a plot is laid to
            deceive any one. <milestone n="47" unit="section"/> But I, on the contrary, argue in
            this way. The authority of Cluvius would be less if be were speaking on his oath, than
            it is now when he is not speaking on his oath. For then, perhaps, he might seem to bad
            men over eager in being a witness in a cause in which he had been judge. But now he must
            appear to all his enemies most upright and most wise, inasmuch as he only tells his
            intimate friends what he knows. <milestone n="48" unit="section"/> Say now, if you can,
            if the business, if the cause permits you to, that Cluvius has spoken falsely. Has
            Cluvius spoken falsely? Truth itself lays its hand upon me, and compels me to stop, and
            dwell on this point for a short time. Whence was all this lie drawn, and where was it
            forged? Roscius, forsooth, is a deep and crafty man. He began to think of this from the
            first. Since, said he to himself, Fannius claims fifty thousand <foreign lang="la"
              >sesterces</foreign> from me, I will ask Caius Cluvius, a Roman knight, a most
            accomplished man, to tell a lie for my sake; to say that a settlement was made which was
            not made; that a hundred thousand <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign> were given by
            Flavius to Fannius, which were not given. This is the first idea of a wicked mind, of a
            miserable disposition, of a man of no sense. What came next? <milestone n="49"
              unit="section"/> After he had thoroughly made up his mind, he came to Cluvius. What
            sort of a man was he? an insignificant man? No, a most influential one. A fickle man? A
            most consistent one. An intimate friend of his? A perfect stranger. After he had saluted
            him, he began to ask him, in gentle and elegant language to be
            sure,&mdash;&ldquo;Tell a lie for my sake, tell some excellent men, your own
            intimate friends who are here with you, that Flavius settled with Fannius about
            Panurgus, though in truth he did not; tell them that he paid a hundred thousand <foreign
              lang="la">sesterces</foreign>, though in reality he did not pay a penny.&rdquo;
            What answer did he give? &ldquo;Oh, indeed, I will willingly and eagerly tell lies
            for your sake; and if at any time you wish me to perjure myself in order to make a
            little profit, know that I am quite ready; you need not have taken so much trouble as to
            come to me yourself; you could have arranged such a trifle as this by a
            messenger.&rdquo; <milestone n="17" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="50" unit="section"
            /></p>
          <p>Oh, the faith of gods and men! Would Roscius ever have asked this of Cluvius, even if
            he had had a hundred millions of <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign> at stake on the
            issue of the trial? Or would Cluvius have granted it to Roscius at his request, even if
            he had been to be a sharer in the whole booty? I scarcely, by the gods, think that you,
            O Fannius, would dare to make this request to Ballio, or to any one like him; and that
            you would be able to succeed in a matter not only false, but in its nature incredible.
            For I say nothing about Roscius and Cluvius being excellent men. I imagine them for this
            occasion to be worthless. <milestone n="51" unit="section"/> Roscius, then, suborned
            Cluvius as a false witness. Why did he do it so late? Why did he do so when the second
            payment was to be made, not when the first was? for already he had paid fifty thousand
            sesterce. Secondly; if Cluvius was, by this time, persuaded to tell lies, why did he say
            that a hundred thousand <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign> had been given to Fannius
            by Flavius, rather than three hundred thousand; when, according to the mutual agreement,
            a half-share of it belonged to Roscius. By this time you see, O Caius Piso, that Roscius
            had made his demand for himself alone, and had made no demand for the partnership. When
            Saturius perceives that this is proved, he does not dare to resist and struggle against
            the truth. He finds another subterfuge of dishonesty and treachery in the same track.
              <milestone n="52" unit="section"/> &ldquo;I admit,&rdquo; says he,
            &ldquo;that Roscius demanded his own share from Flavius; I admit that he left
            Fannius's right to make a similar demand entire and unimpaired; but I contend that what
            he got for himself became the common property of the partnership&rdquo; than which
            nothing more tricky or more scandalous can be said. For I ask whether Roscius had the
            power to demand his share from the partnership, or not? If he could not, how did he get
            it? If he could, how was it that he did not demand it for himself? For that which is
            demanded for one's self, is certainly not exacted for another. <milestone n="53"
              unit="section"/> Is it so? If he had made a demand of what belonged to the entire
            partnership, all would equally have shared what then came in. Now, when he demanded what
            was a part of his own share, did he not demand for himself alone what he got? <milestone
              n="18" unit="chapter"/></p>
          <p>What is the difference between him who goes to law for himself, and him who is assigned
            as agent for another? He who commences an action for himself, makes his demand for
            himself alone. No one can prefer a claim for another except him who is constituted his
            agent. Is it not so? If her had been your agent, you would get your own, because he had
            gained the action. But he preferred this claim in his own name; so what he got he got
            for himself, and not for you. <milestone n="54" unit="section"/> But if any one can make
            a claim on behalf of another, who is not appointed his agent, I ask why then, when
            Panurgus was slain, and an action was commenced against Fannius on the plea of injury
            sustained by the loss, you were made the agent of Roscius for that action? especially
            when, according to what you now say, whatever claim you made for yourself you made for
            him; whatever recompense you exacted for yourself, would belong to the partnership. But
            if nothing would have come to Roscius which you had got from Flavius, unless he had
            appointed you agent for his action, so nothing ought to come to you which Roscius has
            exacted for his share, since he was not appointed your agent. <milestone n="55"
              unit="section"/> For what answer can you make to this case, O Fannius? When Roscius
            settled with Flavius for his own share, did he leave you your right of action, or not?
            If he did not leave it you, how was it that you afterwards exacted a hundred thousand
              <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign> from him? If he did leave it, why do you claim
            from him what you ought to demand and follow up yourself? For partnership is very like
            inheritance, and, as it were, its twin sister. As a partner has a share in a
            partnership, so an heir has a share in an inheritance. As an heir prefers a claim for
            himself alone, and not for his co-heirs, so a partner prefers a claim for himself alone,
            and not for his partners. And as each prefers a claim for his own share, so he makes
            payments for his share alone; the heir, out of the share which he has received of the
            inheritance the partner, out of that property with which he entered into the
            partnership. <milestone n="56" unit="section"/> As Roscius could have executed a release
            to Flavius in his own name, so as to prevent you from preferring any claim; so, as he
            only exacted his own share, and left you your right to prefer a claim unimpaired, he
            ought not to share what he got with you&mdash;unless, indeed, you, by a perversion
            of all justice, are able to rob him of what is his, though you are not able to extort
            your own rights from another. Saturius persists in his opinion, that whatever a partner
            claims for himself becomes the property of the partnership. But if that be true, how
            great (plague take it!) was the folly of Roscius, who, by the advice and influence of
            lawyers, made a mutual agreement with Fannius, very carefully, that he should pay him
            half of whatever he got from Flavius; if indeed, without any security or mutual
            agreement, nevertheless, Fannius owed it to the partnership; that is to say, to Roscius

            <head>The Argument.</head>
            <p>The provinces of the quaestors being distributed to them by lot, the province of
                <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> fell to Cicero; Sextus Peducaeus
              being the praetor. In his discharge of the duties of his office he very much
              ingratiated himself with the Sicilians, and at his departure he assured them of his
              assistance in whatever business they might have at <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
                >Rome</placeName>. Three years after his return from <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                >Sicily</placeName> he was elected to the aedileship, being now in his
              thirty-seventh year the earliest age at which a man could be aedile. Before his
              entrance into this office he undertook the prosecution of Caius Verres, late praetor
              of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, who was accused of having treated
              the Sicilians with the greatest rapacity and tyranny. All the cities of Sicily
              concurred in this prosecution except <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse"
                >Syracuse</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7003897">Messana</placeName>, as
              Verres had kept on good terms with them through fear of their riches and influence.
              The other towns all by a joint petition to Cicero entreated him to take the management
              of the prosecution, and he consented; Verres was supported by the Scipios, by the
              Metelli, and Hortensius. As soon as Cicero had agreed to undertake the management of
              the business, Quintus Caecilius Niger came forth, a Sicilian by birth, who had been
              quaestor to Verres, and (being in reality the tool of Verres, and making this demand
              in order to stifle the prosecution) demanded that the management of it should be
              entrusted to him; partly on the ground that he was a Sicilian, partly because he was,
              as he stated, a personal enemy of Verres, also he alleged, that having been his
              quaestor in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, he knew better than
              Cicero could know the crimes which Verres really had committed. Cicero replies to this
              with many reasons why the conduct of the prosecution should be committed to him,
              especially because he did not volunteer to take it up, but is urged by a sense of
              duty, being begged to do so by all the Sicilians; and also because he is in ever,
              respect well able to conduct it, from his acquaintance with the count and with the
              Sicilians.</p>
            <p>There is some question why this speech is called <foreign lang="la"
                >Divinatio</foreign>, and different reasons have been alleged for it; some saying
              that it is because it refers to what is to be done, not to what has been done: others,
              that it is so called because no witnesses and no documents are produced, and the
              judges, having to decide on the arguments of the speakers alone, are forced to guess
              their way. Cicero carried his point, and the prosecution was entrusted to him. </p>

            protection lay in many of their ancient patrons, they thought there was also some
            support for their fortunes secured in me, who, being now plundered and harassed, have
            all frequently come to me by the public authority, entreating me to undertake the cause
            and the defence of all their fortunes. They say that I repeatedly promised and
            repeatedly assured them, that, if any time should arrive when they wanted anything of
            me, I would not be wanting to their service. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> They said
            that the time had come for me to defend not only the advantages they enjoyed, but even
            the life and safety of the whole province, that they had now not even any gods in their
            cities to whom they could flee, because Caius Verres had carried off their most sacred
            images from the very holiest temples. That whatever luxury could accomplish in the way
            of vice, cruelty in the way of punishment, avarice in the way of plunder, or arrogance
            in the way of insult, had all been borne by them for the last three years, while this
            one man was praetor. That they begged and entreated that I would not reject them as
            suppliants, who, while I was in safety, ought to be suppliants to no one. <milestone
              n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
          <p>I was vexed and distressed, O judges, at being brought into such a strait, as to be
            forced either to let those men's hopes deceive them who had entreated succour and
            assistance of me, or else, when I had from my very earliest youth devoted myself
            entirely to defending men, to be now, under the compulsion of the occasion and of my
            duty, transferred to the part of an accuser. I told them that they had an advocate in
            Quintus Caecilius, who had been quaestor in the same province after I was quaestor
            there. But the very thing which I thought would have been an assistance to me in getting
            rid of this difficulty, was above all things a hindrance to me; for they would have much
            more easily excused me if they had not known him, or if he had never been among them as
            quaestor. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> I was induced, O judges, by the
            considerations of duty, good faith, and pity; by the example of many good men; by the
            ancient customs and habits of our ancestors, to think that I ought to take upon myself
            this burden of labour and duty, not for any purpose of my own, but in the time of need
            to my friends. In which business, however, this fact consoles me, O judges, that this
            pleading of mine which seems to be an accusation is not to be considered an accusation,
            but rather a defence. For I am defending many men, many cities, the whole province of
              <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>. So that, if one person is to be
            accused by me, I still almost appear to remain firm in my original purpose, and not
            entirely to have given up defending and assisting men. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
            But if I had this cause so deserving, so illustrious, and so important; if either the
            Sicilians had not demanded this of me, or I had not had such an intimate connection with
            the Sicilians; and if I were to profess that what I am doing I am doing for the sake of
            the republic, in order that a man endowed with unprecedented covetousness, audacity, and
            wickedness,&mdash;whose thefts and crimes we have known to be most enormous and most
            infamous, not in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> alone, but in

            my instrumentality, still, who would there be who could find fault with my act or my
            intention? <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
          <p>What is there, in the name of gods and men! by which I can at the present moment confer
            a greater benefit on the republic? What is there which either ought to be more pleasing
            to the Roman people, or which can be more desirable in the eves of the allies and of
            foreign nations, or more adapted to secure the safety and fortunes of all men? The
            provinces depopulated, harassed, and utterly overturned; the allies and tributaries of
            the Roman people afflicted and miserable, are seeking now not for any hope of safety,
            but for comfort in their destruction. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> They who wish
            the administration of justice still to remain in the hands of the senatorial body,
            complain that they cannot procure proper accusers; those who are able to act as
            accusers, complain of the want of impartiality in the decisions. In the meantime the
            Roman people, although it suffers under many disadvantages and difficulties, yet desires
            nothing in the republic so much as the restoration of the ancient authority and
            importance to the courts of law. It is from a regret at the state of our courts of law
            that the restoration of the power of the tribunes <note anchored="yes">Sulla in his
              reform of the constitution on the early aristocratic principles, left to the tribunes
              only the <foreign lang="la">jus auxiliandi</foreign>, but deprived them of the right
              of making legislative or other proposals either to the senate or to the comitia
              without having previously obtained the sanction of the Senate. But this arrangement
              did not last, for Pompeius restored them to their former rights. Smith, Dict. Ant. p.
              990, v. <foreign lang="la">Tribunis</foreign>.</note> is so eagerly demanded again. It
            is in consequence of the uncertainty of the courts of law, that another class <note
              anchored="yes">Caius Gracchus had procured a law to be passed, that the Roman knights
              should be the judges; and they acted as such for forty years. After his victory over
              Marius, Sulla made a law that the judges should be selected from the senate. This
              arrangement had lasted ten years with the effect mentioned here by Cicero; and
              Aurelius Cotta was at this time proposing a law that the judges should be taken from
              the senators, knights, and <foreign lang="la">tribuni aerarii</foreign>,

            the judges, even the office of censor, which formerly was used to be accounted too
            severe by the people, is now again demanded, and has become popular and praiseworthy.
              <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> In a time of such licentiousness on the part of the
            wicked, of daily complaint on the part of the Roman people, of dishonour in the courts
            of law, of unpopularity of the whole senate, as I thought that this was the only remedy
            for these numerous evils, for men who were both capable and upright to undertake the
            cause of the republic and the laws, I confess that I, for the sake of promoting the
            universal safety, devoted myself to upholding that part of the republic which was in the
            greatest danger.<milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Now that I have shown the motives by
            which I was influenced to undertake the cause, I must necessarily speak of our
            contention, that, in appointing an accuser, you may have some certain line of conduct to
            follow. I understand the matter thus, O judges:&mdash;when any man is accused of
            extortion, if there be a contest between any parties as to who may best be entrusted
            with the prosecution, these two points ought to be regarded most especially; first, whom
            they, to whom the injury is said to have been done, wish most to be their counsel; and
            secondly, whom he, who is accused of having done those injuries, would least wish to be
            so. <milestone n="4" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="11" unit="section"/></p>
          <p>In this cause, O judges, although I think both these points plain, yet I will dilate
            upon each, and first on that which ought to have the greatest influence with you, that
            is to say, on the inclination of those to whom the injuries have been done; of those for
            whose sake this trial for extortion has been instituted. Caius Verres is said for three
            years to have depopulated the province of <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
              >Sicily</placeName>, to have desolated the cities of the Sicilians, to have made the
            houses empty, to have plundered the temples. The whole nation of the Sicilians is
            present, and complains of this. They fly for protection to my good faith, which they
            have proved and long known; they entreat assistance for themselves from you and from the
            laws of the Roman people through my instrumentality; they desire me to be their defender
            in these their calamities; they desire me to be the avenger of their injuries, the
            advocate of their rights, and the pleader of their whole cause. <milestone n="12"
              unit="section"/> Will you, O Quintus Caecilius, say this, that I have not approached
            the cause at the request of the Sicilians? or that the desire of those most excellent
            and most faithful allies ought not to be of great influence with these judges? If you
            dare to say that which Caius Verres, whose enemy you are pretending to be, wishes
            especially to be believed,&mdash;that the Sicilians did not make this request to
            me,&mdash;you will in the first place be supporting the cause of your enemy, against
            whom it is considered that no vague presumption, but that an actual decision has been
            come to, in the fact that has become notorious, that all the Sicilians have begged for
            me as their advocate against his injuries. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> If you,
            his enemy, deny that this is the case, which he himself to whom the fact is most
            injurious does not dare to deny, take care lest you seem to carry on your enmity in too
            friendly a manner. In the second place, there are witnesses, the most illustrious men of
            our state, all of whom it is not necessary that I should name, those who are present I
            will appeal to; while, if I were speaking falsely, they are the men whom I should least
            wish to be witnesses of my impudence. He, who is one of the assessors on this bid, Caius
            Marcellus, knows it; he, whom I see here present, Cnaeus Lentulus Marcellinus, knows it;
            on whose good faith and protection the Sicilians principally depend, because the whole
            of that province is inalienably connected with the name of the Marcelli. <milestone
              n="14" unit="section"/> These men know that this request was not only made to me, but
            that it was made so frequently and with such earnestness, that I had no alternative
            except either to undertake the cause, or to repudiate the duty of friendship. But why do
            I cite these men as witnesses, as if the matter were doubtful or unknown? Most noble men
            are present here from the whole province, who being present, beg and entreat you, O
            judges, not to let your judgment differ from their judgment in selecting an advocate for
            their cause. Deputations from every city in the whole of <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
              >Sicily</placeName>, except two, <note anchored="yes">Cicero means <placeName
                key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7003897"
                >Messana</placeName>, which did not join in the outcry against Verres, because
              Verres had resided at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, and had
              enriched that city with some of the plunder which he had taken from other cities; and
              he had treated <placeName key="tgn,7003897">Messana</placeName> in the same way, which
              place he had made the repository of his plunder till he could export it to <placeName
                key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>.</note> are present; and if deputations from
            those two were present also, two of the very most serious of the crimes would be
            lessened in which these cities are implicated with Caius Verres. <milestone n="15"
              unit="section"/> But why have they entreated this protection from me above all men? If
            it were doubtful whether they had entreated it from me or not, I could tell why they had
            entreated it; but now, when it is so evident that you can see it with your eyes, I know
            not why it should be any injury to me to have it imputed to me that I was selected above
            all men. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> But I do not arrogate any such thing to
            myself, and I not only do not say it, but I do not wish even to leave any one to believe
            that I have been preferred to every possible advocate. That is not the fact but a
            consideration of the opportunities of each individual and of his health, and of his
            aptitude for conducting this cause, has been taken into account. My desire and
            sentiments on this matter have always been these, that I would rather that any one of
            those who are fit for it should undertake it than I; but I had rather that I should
            undertake it myself than that no one should. <milestone n="5" unit="chapter"/><milestone
              n="17" unit="section"/></p>
          <p>The next thing is, since it is evident that the Sicilians have demanded this of me, for
            us to inquire whether it is right that this fact should have any influence on you and on
            your judgments; whether the allies of the Roman people, your suppliants, ought to have
            any weight with you in a matter of extortion committed on themselves. And why need I say
            much on such a point as this? as if there were any doubt that the whole law about
            extortion was established for the sake of the allies. <milestone n="18" unit="section"/>
            For when citizens have been robbed of their money, it is usually sought to be recovered
            by civil action and by a private suit. This is a law affecting the
            allies,&mdash;this is a right of foreign nations. They have this fortress somewhat
            less strongly fortified now than it was formerly, but still if there be any hope left
            which can console the minds of the allies, it is all placed in this law. And strict
            guardians of this law have long since been required, not only by the Roman people, but
            by the most distant nations. <milestone n="19" unit="section"/> Who then is there who
            can deny that it is right that the trial should be conducted according to the wish of
            those men for whose sake the law has been established? All <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
              >Sicily</placeName>, if it could speak with one voice, would say
            this:&mdash;&ldquo;All the gold, all the silver, all the ornaments which were in
            my cities, in my private houses, or in my temples,&mdash;all the rights which I had
            in any single thing by the kindness of the senate and Roman people,&mdash;all that
            you, O Caius Verres, have taken away and robbed me of, on which account I demand of you
            a hundred million of <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign> according to the
            law.&rdquo; If the whole province, as I have said, could speak, it would say this,
            and as it could not speak, it has of its own accord chosen an advocate to urge these
            points, whom it has thought suitable. <milestone n="20" unit="section"/> In a matter of
            this sort, will any one be found so impudent as to dare to approach or to aspire to the
            conduct of the cause of others against the will of those very people whose affairs are
            involved in it? <milestone n="6" unit="chapter"/></p>
          <p>If, O Quintus Caecilius, the Sicilians were to say this to you,&mdash;we do not
            know you&mdash;we know not who you are, we never saw you before; allow us to defend
            our fortunes through the instrumentality of that man whose good faith is known to us;
            would they not be saying what would appear reasonable to every one? But now they say
            this&mdash;that they know both the men, that they wish one of them to be the
            defender of their cause, that they are wholly unwilling that the other should be.
              <milestone n="21" unit="section"/> Even if they were silent they would say plainly
            enough why they are unwilling. But they are not silent; and yet will you offer yourself,
            when they are most unwilling to accept you! Will you still persist in speaking in the
            cause of others? Will you still defend those men who would rather be deserted by every
            one than defended by you? Will you still promise your assistance to those men who do
            neither believe that you wish to give it for their sake, nor that, if you did wish it,
            you could do it? Why do you endeavour to take away from them by force the little hope
            for the remainder of their fortunes which they still retain, built upon the impartiality
            of the law and of this tribunal? Why do you interpose yourself expressly against the
            will of those whom the law directs to be especially consulted? Why do you now openly
            attempt to ruin the whole fortunes of those of whom you did not deserve very well when
            in the province? Why do you take away from them, not only the power of prosecuting their
            rights, but even of bewailing their calamities? <milestone n="22" unit="section"/> If
            you are their counsel, whom do you expect to come forward of those men who are now
            striving, not to punish some one else by your means, but to avenge themselves on you
            yourself, through the instrumentality of some one or other? <milestone n="7"
              unit="chapter"/></p>
          <p>But this is a well established fact, that the Sicilians especially desire to have me
            for their counsel; the other point, no doubt, is less clear,&mdash;namely, by whom
            Verres would least like to be prosecuted! Did any one ever strive so openly for any
            honour, or so earnestly for his own safety, as that man and his friends have striven to
            prevent this prosecution from being entrusted to me? There are many qualities which
            Verres believes to be in me, and which he knows, O Quintus Caecilius, do not exist in
            you: and what qualities each of us have I will mention presently; <milestone n="23"
              unit="section"/> at this moment I will only say this, which you must silently agree
            to, that there is no quality in me which he can despise, and none in you which he can
            fear. Therefore, that great defender <note anchored="yes">Cicero alludes to Hortensius,
              indeed, the name of Hortensius appears in the text in some editions.</note> and friend
            of his votes for you and opposes me; he openly solicits the judges to have you preferred
            to me; and he says that he does this honestly, without any envy of me, and without any
            dislike to me. &ldquo;For,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I am now asking for that
            which I usually obtain when I strive for it earnestly. I am not asking to have the
            defendant acquitted; but I am asking this, that he may be accused by the one man rather
            than by the other. Grant me this; grant that which is easy to grant, and honourable, and
            by no means invidious; and when you have granted that, you will, without any risk to
            yourself, and without any discredit, have granted that he shall be acquitted in whose
            cause I am labouring.&rdquo; <milestone n="24" unit="section"/> He says also, in
            order that some alarm may be mingled with the exertion of his influence, that there are
            certain men on the bench to whom he wishes their tablets to be shown, and that that is
            very easy, for that they do not give their votes separately, but that all vote together;
            and that a tablet, <note anchored="yes">&ldquo;The judges were provided with three
                <foreign lang="la">tabellae</foreign>, one of which was marked with A, i.e. <foreign
                lang="la">absolvo</foreign>, I acquit; the second with C, i.e. <foreign lang="la"
                >condemno</foreign>, condemn; and the third with N L, i.e. <foreign lang="la">non
                liquet</foreign>. It is not clear to me, why Cicero (<bibl n="Cic. Mil. 6">pro Mil.
                6</bibl>) calls the first <foreign lang="la">litera salutaris</foreign>, and the
              second <foreign lang="la">litera tristis</foreign>. It would seem that in some trials
              the tabellae were marked with the lettera L, <foreign lang="la">libero</foreign>, and
              D, <foreign lang="la">damno</foreign>, respectively.&rdquo; Smith's Dict. Ant. v.
                <foreign lang="la">Tabella</foreign>. In trials like this between Cicero and
              Caecilius it is probable that the two tabellae had the names of the different
              candidates inscribed on them. The circumstance alluded to in the text was that a short
              time before this Terentius Varro had been accused of extortion and defended by
              Hortensius, who bribed the judges, and then in order to be sure that they voted as
              they had promised, caused tablets to be given to them smeared with coloured wax, so
              that he could easily recognize their votes in the balloting urn.</note> covered with
            the proper wax, and not with that illegal wax which has given so much scandal, is given
            to every one. And he does not give himself all this trouble so much for the sake of
            Verres, as because he disapproves of the whole affair. For he sees that, if the power of
            prosecuting is taken away from the high-born boys whom he has hitherto played with, and
            from the public informers, whom he has always despised and thought insignificant (not
            without good reason), and to be transferred to fearless men of well-proved constancy, he
            will no longer be able to domineer over the courts of law as he pleases. <milestone

          <p>I now beforehand give this man notice, that if you determine that this cause shall be
            conducted by me, his whole plan of defence must be altered, and must be altered in such
            a manner as to be carried on in a more honest and honourable way than he likes; that he
            must imitate those most illustrious men whom he himself has seen, Lucius Crassus and
            Marcus Antonius; who thought that they had no right to bring anything to the trials and
            causes in which their friends were concerned, except good faith and ability. He shall
            have no room for thinking, if I conduct the case, that the tribunal can be corrupted
            without great danger to many. <milestone n="26" unit="section"/> In this trial I think
            that the cause of the Sicilian nation,&mdash;that the cause of the whole Roman
            people, is undertaken by me; so that I have not to crush one worthless man alone, which
            is what the Sicilians have requested, but to extinguish and extirpate every sort of
            iniquity, which is what the Roman people has been long demanding. And how far I labour
            in this cause, or what I may be able to effect, I would rather leave to the expectations
            of others, than set forth in my own oration. <milestone n="27" unit="section"/> But as
            for you, O Caecilius, what can you do? On what occasion, or in what affair, have you, I
            will not say given proof to others of your powers! but even made trial of yourself to
            yourself? Has it never occurred to you how important a business it is to uphold a public
            cause? to lay bare the whole life of another? and to bring it palpably before, not only
            the minds of the judges, but before the very eyes and sight of all men; to defend the
            safety of the allies, the interests of the provinces, the authority of the laws, and the
            dignity of the judgment-seat? <milestone n="9" unit="chapter"/></p>
          <p>Judge by me, since this is the first opportunity of learning it that you have ever had,
            how many qualities must meet in that man who is the accuser of another: and if you
            recognise any one of these in yourself, I will, of my own accord, yield up to you that
            which you are desirous of. First of all, he must have a singular integrity and
            innocence. For there is nothing which is less tolerable than for him to demand an
            account of his life from another who cannot give an account of his own. Here I will not
            say any more of yourself. <milestone n="28" unit="section"/> This one thing, I think,
            all may observe, that up to this time you had no opportunity of becoming known to any
            people except to the Sicilians; and that the Sicilians say this, that even though they
            are exasperated against the same man, whose enemy you say that you are, still, if you
            are the advocate, they will not appear on the trial. Why they refuse to, you will not
            hear from me. Allow these judges to suspect what it is inevitable that they must. The
            Sicilians, indeed, being a race of men over-acute, and too much inclined to
            suspiciousness, suspect that you do not wish to bring documents from <placeName
              key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> against Verres; but, as both his praetorship and
            your quaestorship are recorded in the same documents, they suspect that you wish to
            remove <note anchored="yes">The Latin is <foreign lang="la">deportare</foreign> and
                <foreign lang="la">asportare</foreign>, the former meaning to remove from one place
              to another, the latter to carry away; &ldquo;but it seems by implication here, to
              carry them away with the intention of suppressing
              them.&rdquo;&mdash;Long.</note> them out of <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
              >Sicily</placeName>. <milestone n="29" unit="section"/> In the second place, an
            accuser must be trustworthy and veracious. Even if I were to think that you were
            desirous of being so, I easily see that you are not able to be so. Nor do I speak of
            these things, which, if I were to mention, you would not be able to invalidate, namely
            that you, before you departed from <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, had
            become reconciled to Verres; that Potamo, your secretary and intimate friend, was
            retained by Verres in the province when you left it; that Marcus Caecilius, your
            brother, a most exemplary and accomplished young man, is not only not present here and
            does not stand by you while prosecuting your alleged injuries, but that he is with
            Verres, and is living on terms of the closest friendship and intimacy with him. These,
            and other things belonging to you, are many signs of a false accuser; but these I do not
            now avail myself of. I say this, that you, if you were to wish it ever so much, still
            cannot be a faithful accuser. <milestone n="30" unit="section"/> For I see that there
            are many charges in which you are so implicated with Verres, that in accusing him, you
            would not dare to touch upon them. <milestone n="10" unit="chapter"/></p>
          <p>All Sicily complains that Caius Verres, when he had ordered corn to be brought into his
            granary for him, and when a bushel of wheat was two <foreign lang="la"
              >sesterces</foreign>, demanded of the farmers twelve <foreign lang="la"
              >sesterces</foreign> a bushel for wheat. <note anchored="yes">The praetor had the
              power to make an annual demand on the farmers for corn for be state, and the quaestor
              was to pay a fair market price for it; but in some cases the praetor allowed or
              compelled the farmer to pay a composition in money, instead of delivering corn, and
              Verres when the market price of wheat was only two <foreign lang="la"
                >sesterces</foreign> a bushel compelled the farmers to pay twelve <foreign lang="la"
                >sesterces</foreign> a bushel by way of composition</note> It was a great crime, an
            immense sum, an impudent theft, an intolerable injustice. I must inevitably convict him
            of this charge; what will you do, O Caecilius? <milestone n="31" unit="section"/> Will
            you pass over this serious accusation, or will you bring it forward? If you bring it
            forward, will you charge that as a crime against another, which you did yourself at the
            same time in the same province? Will you dare so to accuse another, that you cannot
            avoid at the same time condemning yourself? If you omit the charge, what sort of a
            prosecution will yours be, which from fear of danger to yourself, is afraid not only to
            create a suspicion of a most certain and enormous crime, but even to make the least
            mention of it? Corn was bought, on the authority of a decree of the senate, of the
            Sicilians while Verres was praetor; <milestone n="32" unit="section"/> for which corn
            all the money was not paid. This is a grave charge against Verres; a grave one if I
            plead the cause, but, if you are the prosecutor, no charge at all. For you were the
            quaestor, you had the handling of the public money; and, even if the praetor desired it
            ever so much, yet it was to a great extent in your power to prevent anything being taken
            from it. Of this crime, therefore, if you are the prosecutor, no mention will be made.
            And so during the whole trial nothing will be said of his most enormous and most
            notorious thefts and injuries. Believe me, O Caecilius, he who is connected with the
            criminal in a partnership of iniquity, cannot really defend his associates while
            accusing him. <milestone n="33" unit="section"/> The contractors exacted money from the
            cities instead of corn. Well! was this never done except in the praetorship of Verres? I
            do not say that, but it was done while Caecilius was quaestor. What then will you do?
            Will you urge against this man as a charge, what you both could and ought to have
            prevented from being done? or will you leave out the whole of it? Verres, then, at his
            trial will absolutely never hear at all of those things, which, when he was doing them,
            he did not know how he should be able to defend. <milestone n="11" unit="chapter"/></p>
          <p>And I am mentioning those matters which lie on the surface. There are other acts of
            plunder more secret, which he, in order, I suppose, to check the courage and delay the
            attack of Caecilius, has very kindly participated in with his quaestor. <milestone
              n="34" unit="section"/> You know that information of these matters has been given to
            me; and if I were to choose to mention them, all men would easily perceive that there
            was not only a perfect harmony of will subsisting between you both, but that you did not
            pursue even your plunder separately. So that if you demand to be allowed to give
            information of the crimes which Verres has committed in conjunction with you, I have no
            objection, if it is allowed by the law. But if we are speaking of conducting the
            prosecution, that you must yield ta those who are hindered by no crimes of their own
            from being able to prove the offences of another. <milestone n="35" unit="section"/> And
            see how much difference there will be between my accusation and yours. I intend to
            charge Verres with all the crimes that you committed, though he had no share in them,
            because he did not prevent you from committing them, though he had the supreme power;
            you, on the other hand, will not allege against him even the crimes which he committed
            himself, lest you should be found to be in any particular connected with him. What shall
            I say of these other points, O Caecilius? Do these things appear contemptible to you,
            without which no cause, especially no cause of such importance, can by any means be
            supported? Have you any talent for pleading? any practice in speaking? Have you paid any
            attention or acquired any acquaintance with the forum, the courts, and the laws?
              <milestone n="36" unit="section"/> I know in what a rocky and difficult path I am now
            treading; for as all arrogance is odious, so a conceit of one's abilities and eloquence
            is by far the most disagreeable of all. On which account I say nothing of my own
            abilities; for I have none worth speaking of, and if I had I would not speak of them.
            For either the opinion formed of me is quite sufficient for me, such as it is; or if it
            be too low an opinion to please me, still I cannot make it higher by talking about them.
              <milestone n="12" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="37" unit="section"/></p>
          <p>I will just, O Caecilius, say this much familiarly to you about yourself, forgetting
            for a moment this rivalry and contest of ours. Consider again and again what your own
            sentiments are, and recollect yourself; and consider who you are, and what you are able
            to effect. Do you think that, when you have taken upon yourself the cause of the allies,
            and the fortunes of the province, and the rights of the Roman people, and the dignity of
            the judgment-seat and of the law, in a discussion of the most important and serious
            matters, you are able to support so many affairs and those so weighty and so various
            with your voice, your memory, your counsel, and your ability? <milestone n="38"
              unit="section"/> Do you think that you are able to distinguish in separate charges,
            and in a well-arranged speech, all that Caius Verres has done in his quaestorship, and
            in his lieutenancy, and in his praetorship, at <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
              >Rome</placeName>, or in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, or in
              <placeName key="tgn,7002733">Achaia</placeName>, or in <placeName key="tgn,7002294"
              >Asia Minor</placeName>, or in <placeName key="tgn,7002611">Pamphylia</placeName>, as
            the actions themselves are divided by place and time? Do you think that you are able
            (and this is especially necessary against a defendant of this sort) to cause the things
            which he has done licentiously, or wickedly, or tyrannically, to appear just as bitter
            and scandalous to those who hear of them, as they did appear to those who felt them?
              <milestone n="39" unit="section"/> Those things which I am speaking of are very
            important, believe me. Do not you despise this either; everything must be related, and
            demonstrated, and explained; the cause must be not merely stated, but it must also be
            gravely and copiously dilated on. You must cause, if you wish really to do and to effect
            anything, men not only to hear you, but also to hear you willingly and eagerly. And if
            nature kind been bountiful to you in such qualities, and if from your childhood you had
            studied the best arts and systems, and worked hard at them;&mdash;if you had learnt
            Greek literature at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, not at
              <placeName key="tgn,7003850">Lilybaeum</placeName>, and Latin literature at <placeName
              key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and not in <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
              >Sicily</placeName>; still it would be a great undertaking to approach so important a
            cause, and one about which there is such great expectation, and having approached it, to
            follow it up with the requisite diligence; to have all the particulars always fresh in
            your memory; to discuss it properly in your speech, and to support it adequately with
            your voice and your faculties. <milestone n="40" unit="section"/> Perhaps you may say,
            What then? Are you then endowed with all these qualifications?&mdash;I wish indeed
            that I were; but at all events I have laboured with great industry from my very
            childhood to attain them. And if I, on account of the importance and difficulty of such
            a study have not been able to attain them, who have done nothing else all my life, how
            far do you think that you must be distant from these qualities, which you have not only
            never thought of before, but which even now, when you are entering on a stage that
            requires them all, you can form no proper idea of, either as for their nature or as to
            their importance? <milestone n="13" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="41" unit="section"
            /></p>
          <p>I, who as all men know, am so much concerned in the forum and the courts of justice,
            that there is no one of the same age, or very few, who have defended more causes, and
            who spend all my time which can be spared from the business of my friends in these
            studies and labours, in order that I may be more prepared for forensic practice and more
            ready at it, yet, (may the gods be favourable to me as I am saying what is true!)
            whenever the thought occurs to me of the day when the defendant having been summoned, I
            have to speak, I am not only agitated in my mind, but a shudder runs over my whole body.
              <milestone n="42" unit="section"/> Even now I am surveying in my mind and thoughts
            what party spirit will be shown by men; what throngs of men will meet; how great an
            expectation the importance of the trial will excite; how greet a multitude of hearers
            the infamy of Caius Verres will collect; how great an audience for my speech his
            wickedness will draw together And when I think of these things, even now I am afraid as
            to what I shall be able to say suitable to the hatred men bear him who are inimical and
            hostile to him, and worthy of the expectation which all men will form, and of the
            importance of the case. <milestone n="43" unit="section"/> Do you fear nothing, do you
            think of nothing are you anxious about nothing of all this? Or if from some old speech
            you have been able to learn, &ldquo;I entreat the mighty and beneficent <persName><surname>Jupiter</surname></persName>,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;I wish it were
            possible, O judges,&rdquo; or something of the sort, do you think that you shall
            come before the court in an admirable state of preparation? <milestone n="44"
              unit="section"/> And, even if no one were to answer you, yet you would not, as I
            think, be able to state and prove even the cause itself. Do you now never give it a
            thought, that you will have a contest with a most eloquent man, and one in a perfect
            state of preparation for speaking, with whom you will at one time have to argue, and at
            another time to strive and contend against him with all your might? Whose abilities
            indeed I praise greatly, but not so as to be afraid of them, and think highly of,
            thinking however at the same time that I am more easily to be pleased by them than
            cajoled by them. <milestone n="14" unit="chapter"/></p>
          <p>He will never put me down by his acuteness; he will never put me out of countenance by
            any artifice; he will never attempt to upset and dispirit me by displays of his genius.
            I know all the modes of attack and every system of speaking the man has. We have often
            been employed on the same, often on opposite sides. Ingenious as he is, he will plead
            against me as if he were aware that his own ability is to same extent put on its trial.
              <milestone n="45" unit="section"/> But as for you, O Caecilius, I think that I see
            already how he will play with you, how he will bandy you about; how often he will give
            you power and option of choosing which alternative you please,&mdash;whether a thing
            were done or not, whether a thing be true or false; and whichever side you take will be
            contrary to your interest. What a heat you will be in, what bewilderment! what darkness,
            O ye immortal gods! will overwhelm the man, free from malice as he is. What will you do
            when he begins to divide the different counts of your accusation, and to arrange on his
            fingers each separate division of the cause? What will you do when he begins to deal
            with each argument, to disentangle it, to get rid of it? You yourself in truth will
            begin to be afraid lest you have brought an innocent man into danger. <milestone n="46"
              unit="section"/> What will you do when he begins to pity his client, to complain, and
            to take off some of his unpopularity from him and transfer it to you? to speak of the
            close connection necessarily subsisting between the quaestor and the praetor? of the
            custom of the ancients? of the holy nature of the connection between those to whom the
            same province was by lot appointed? Will you be able to encounter the odium such a
            speech will excite against you? Think a moment; consider again and again. For there
            seems to me to be danger of his overwhelming you not with words only, but of his
            blunting the edge of your genius by the mere gestures and motions of his body, and so
            distracting you and leading you away from every previous thought and purpose. <milestone
              n="47" unit="section"/> And I see that the trial of this will be immediate; for if you
            are able today to answer me and these things which I am saying; if you even depart one
            word from that book which some elocution-master or other has given you, made up of other
            men's speeches; I shall think that you are able to speak, and that you are not unequal
            to that trial also, and that you will be able to do justice to the cause and to the duty
            you undertake. But if in this preliminary skirmish with me you turn out nothing, what
            can we suppose you will be in the contest itself against a most active adversary?
              <milestone n="15" unit="chapter"/></p>
          <p>Be it so; he is nothing himself, he has no ability; but he comes prepared with
            well-trained and eloquent supporters. And this too is something, though it is not
            enough; for in all things he who is the chief person to act, ought to be the most
            accomplished and the best prepared. But I see that Lucius Appuleius is the next counsel
            on the list, a mere beginner, not as to his age indeed, but as to his practice and
            training in forensic contests. <milestone n="48" unit="section"/> Next to him he has, as
            I think, Allienus; he indeed does belong to the bar, but however, I never took any
            particular notice of what he could do in speaking; in raising an outcry, indeed, I see
            that he is very vigorous and practiced. In this man all your hopes are placed; he, if
            you are appointed prosecutor, will sustain the whole trial. But even he will not put
            forth his whole strength in speaking, but will consult your credit and reputation; and
            will abstain from putting forth the whole power of eloquence which he himself possesses,
            in order that you may still appear of some importance As we see is done by the Greek
            pleaders; that he to whom the second or third part belongs, though he may be able to
            speak somewhat better than his leader, often restrains himself a good deal, in order
            that the chief may appear to the greatest possible advantage, so will Allienus act; he
            will be subservient to you, he will pander to your interest, he will put forth somewhat
            less strength than he might. <milestone n="49" unit="section"/> Now consider this, O
            judges, what sort of accusers we shall have in this most important trial; when Allienus
            himself will somewhat abstain from displaying all his abilities, if he has any, and
            Caecilius will only be able to think himself of any use, because Allienus is not so
            vigorous as he might be, and voluntarily allows him the chief share in the display. What
            fourth counsel he is to have with him I do not know, unless it be one of that crowd of
            losers of time who have entreated to be allowed an inferior part in this prosecution,
            whoever he might be to whom you gave the lead. <milestone n="50" unit="section"/> And
            you are to appear in just this state of preparation, that you have to make friends of
            those men who are utter strangers to you, for the purpose of obtaining their assistance.
            But I will not do these men so much honour as to answer what they have said in any
            regular order, or to give a separate answer to each; but since I have come to mention
            them not intentionally, but by chance, I will briefly, as I pass, satisfy them all in a
            few words. <milestone n="16" unit="chapter"/></p>
          <p>Do I seem to you to be in such exceeding want of friends that I must have an assistant
            given me, chosen not out of the men whom I have brought down to court with me, but out
            of the people at large? And are you suffering under such a dearth of defendants, that
            you endeavour to filch this cause from me rather than look for some defendants of your
            own class at the pillar of Maenius? <note anchored="yes">Maenius had sold his house to
              Cato and Valerius Flaccus when they were censors, and they had built the Porcian
              Piazza on the spot, but he had reserved for himself one pillar for him and his heirs
              to have a view of the gladiatorial contests from it; and near this column the <foreign
                lang="la">triumviricapitates</foreign> held their court, before whose tribunal it
              was chiefly the lower sort of criminals who were brought, and as a general rule the
              advocates who practised in these courts were of a lower class than those who confined
              themselves to more respectable clients, and to civil actions.</note>
            <milestone n="51" unit="section"/>Appoint me, says he, to watch Tullius. What? How many
            watchers shall I have need of, if I once allow you to meddle with my bag? as you will
            have to be watched not only to prevent your betraying anything, but to prevent your
            removing anything. But for the whole matter of that watchman I will answer you thus in
            the briefest manner possible; that these honest judges will never permit any assistant
            to force himself against my consent into so important a cause, when it has been
            undertaken by me, and is entrusted to me. <milestone n="52" unit="section"/> In truth,
            my integrity rejects an overlooker; my diligence is afraid of a spy. But to return to
            you, O Caecilius, you see how many qualities are wanting to you; how many belong to you
            which a guilty defendant would wish to belong to his prosecutor, you are well aware.
            What can be said to this? For I do not ask what you will say yourself, I see that it is
            not you who will answer me, but this book which your prompter has in his hand; who, if
            he be inclined to prompt you rightly, will advise you to depart from this place and not
            to answer me one word. For what can you say? That which you are constantly repeating,
            that Verres has done you an injury? I have no doubt he has, for it would not be
            probable, when he was doing injuries to all the Sicilians, that you alone should be so
            important in his eyes that he should take care of your interests. <milestone n="53"
              unit="section"/> But the rest of the Sicilians have found an avenger of their
            injuries; you, while you are endeavouring to exact vengeance for your injuries by your
            own means, (which you will not be able to effect,) are acting in a way to leave the
            injuries of all the rest unpunished and unavenged. And you do not see that it ought not
            alone to be considered who is a proper person to exact vengeance, but also who is a
            person capable of doing so,&mdash;that if there be a man in whom both these
            qualifications exist, he is the best man. <milestone n="54" unit="section"/> But if a
            man has only one of them, then the question usually asked is, not what he is inclined to
            do, but what he is able to do. And if you think that the office of prosecutor ought to
            be entrusted to him above all other men, to whom Caius Verres has done the greatest
            injury, which do you think the judges ought to be most indignant at,&mdash;at your
            having been injured by him, or at the whole province of <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
              >Sicily</placeName> having been harassed and ruined by him? I think you must grant
            that this both is the worst thing of the two, and that it ought to be considered the
            worst by every one. A flow, therefore, that the province ought to be preferred to you as
            the prosecutor. For the province is prosecuting when he is pleading the cause whom the
            province has adopted as the defender of her rights, the avenger of her injuries, and the
            pleader of the whole cause. <milestone n="17" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="55"
              unit="section"/></p>
          <p>Oh, but Caius Verres has done you such an injury as might afflict the minds of all the
            rest of the Sicilians also, though the grievance was felt only by another. Nothing of
            the sort. For I think it is material also to this argument to consider what sort of
            injury is alleged and brought forward as the cause of your enmity. Allow me to relate
            it. For he indeed, unless he is wholly destitute of sense, will never say what it is.
            There is a woman of the name of Agonis, a Lilybaean, a freedwoman of Venus Erycina; a
            woman who before this man was quaestor was notoriously well off and rich. From her some
            prefect of Antonius's <note anchored="yes">Antonius had been appointed as naval
              commander-in-chief along the whole coast; in which capacity it was that he made his
              unauthorized attack on <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>, which gave rise
              to the war in which the island was reduced by Metellus Creticus.</note> carried off
            some musical slaves whom he said he wished to use in his fleet. Then she, as is the
            custom in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> for all the slaves of
            <persName><surname>Venus</surname></persName>, and all those who have procured their
            emancipation from her, in order to hinder the designs of the prefect, by the scruples
            which the name of <persName><surname>Venus</surname></persName> would raise, said that
            she and all her property belonged to Venus. <milestone n="56" unit="section"/> When this
            was reported to Caecilius, that most excellent and upright man, he ordered Agonis to be
            summoned before him; he immediately orders a trial to ascertain &ldquo;if it
            appeared that she had said that she and all her property belonged to Venus.&rdquo;
            The recuperators <note anchored="yes">&ldquo;In many cases a single judex was
              appointed, in others several were appointed, and they seem sometimes to have been
              called <foreign lang="la">recuperatores</foreign>, as opposed to the single
              judex.&rdquo;&mdash;Smith, Dict. Ant. p. 529, v. <foreign lang="la"
                >Judex</foreign>.</note> decide all that was necessary, and indeed there was no
            doubt at all that she had said so. He sends men to take possession of the woman's
            property. He adjudges her herself to be again a slave of Venus; then he sells her
            property and confiscates the money. So while Agonis wishes to keep a few slaves under
            the name and religious protection of Venus, she loses all her fortunes and her own
            liberty by the wrong doing of that man. After that, Verres comes to <placeName
              key="tgn,7003850">Lilybaeum</placeName>; he takes cognisance of the affair; he
            disapproves of the act; he compels his quaestor to pay back and restore to its owner all
            the money which he had confiscated, having been received for the property of Agonis.
              <milestone n="57" unit="section"/> He is here, and you may well admire it, no longer
            Verres, but Quintus Mucius. <note anchored="yes">&ldquo;Quintus Mucius Scaevola is
              spoken of here, who in be year A.U.C. 660 was sent as proconsul to <placeName
                key="tgn,2097781">Asia</placeName>, where he governed with such justice and
              strictness that the senate afterwards by formal decree reminded magistrates about to
              depart for that province of his example.&rdquo;&mdash;Hottoman.</note> For
            what could he do more delicate to obtain a high character among men? what more just to
            relieve the distress of the women? what more severe to repress the licentiousness of his
            quaestor? All this appears to me most exceedingly praiseworthy. But at the very next
            step, in a moment, as if he had drank of some Circaean cup, having been a man, he
            becomes Verres again; he returns to himself and to his old habits. For of that money he
            appropriated a great share to himself, and restored to the woman only as much as he
            chose. <milestone n="18" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="58" unit="section"/></p>
          <p>Here now if you say that you were offended with Verres, I will grant you that and allow
            it; if you complain that he did you any injury, I will defend him and deny it. Secondly,
            I say that of the injury which was done to you no one of us ought to be a more severe
            avenger than you yourself, to whom it is said to have been done. If you afterwards
            became reconciled to him, if you were often at his house, if he after that supped with
            you, do you prefer to be considered as acting with treachery or by collusion with him? I
            see that one of these alternatives is inevitable, but in this matter I will have no
            contention with you to prevent your adopting which you please. <milestone n="59"
              unit="section"/> What shall I say if even the pretext of that injury which was done to
            you by him no longer remains? What have you then to say why you should be preferred, I
            will not say to me, but to any one? except that which I hear you intend to say, that you
            were his quaestor: which indeed would be an important allegation if you were contending
            with me as to which of us ought to be the most friendly to him; but in a contention as
            to which is to take up a quarrel against him, it is ridiculous to suppose that an
            intimate connection with him can be a just reason for bringing him into danger.
              <milestone n="60" unit="section"/> In truth, if you had received ever so many injuries
            from your praetor, still you would deserve greater credit by bearing them than by
            revenging them; but when nothing in his life was ever done more rightly than that which
            you call an injury, shall these judges determine that this cause, which they would not
            even tolerate in any one else, shall appear in your case to be a reasonable one to
            justify the violation of your ancient connection? When even if you had received the
            greatest injury from him, still, since you have been his quaestor, you cannot accuse him
            and remain blameless yourself. But if no injury has been done you at all, you cannot
            accuse him without wickedness; and as it is very uncertain whether any injury has been
            done you, do you think that there is any one of these men who would not prefer that you
            should depart without incurring blame rather than after having committed wickedness?
              <milestone n="19" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="61" unit="section"/></p>
          <p>And just think how great is the difference between my opinion and yours. You, though
            you are in every respect inferior to me, still think that you ought to be preferred to
            me for this one reason, because you were his quaestor. I think, that if you were my
            superior in every other qualification, still that for this one cause alone you ought to
            be rejected as the prosecutor. For this is the principle which has been handed down to
            us from our ancestors, that a praetor ought to be in the place of a parent to his
            quaestor; that no more reasonable nor more important cause of intimate friendship can be
            imagined than a connection arising from drawing the same lot, having the same province,
            and being associated in the discharge of the same public duty and office. <milestone
              n="62" unit="section"/> Wherefore, even if you could accuse him without violating
            strict right, still, as he had been in the place of a parent to you, you could not do so
            without violating every principle of piety. But as you have not received any injury, and
            would yet be creating danger for your praetor, you must admit that you are endeavouring
            to wage an unjust and impious war against him. In truth, your quaestorship is an
            argument of so strong a nature, that you would have to take a great deal of pains to
            find an excuse for accusing him to whom you had acted as quaestor, and can never be a
            reason why you should claim on that account to have the office of prosecuting him
            entrusted to you above all men. Nor indeed, did any one who had acted as quaestor to
            another, ever contest the point of being allowed to accuse him without being rejected.
              <milestone n="63" unit="section"/> And therefore, neither was permission given to
            Lucius Philo to bring forward an accusation against Caius Servilius, nor to Marcus
            Aurelius Scaurus to prosecute Lucius Flaccus, nor to Cnaeus Pompeius to accuse Titus
            Albucius; not one of whom was refused this, permission because of any personal
            unworthiness, but in order that the desire to violate such an intimate connection might
            not be sanctioned by the authority of the judges. And that great man Cnaeus Pompeius
            contended about that matter with Caius <persName><surname>Julius</surname></persName>,
            just as you are contending with me. For he had been the quaestor of Albucius, just as
            you were of Verres: Julius had on his side this reason for conducting the prosecution,
            that, just as we have now been entreated by the Sicilians, so he had then been entreated
            by the Sardinians, to espouse their cause. And this argument has always had the greatest
            influence; this has always been the most honourable cause for acting as accuser, that by
            so doing one is bringing enmity on oneself in behalf of allies, for the sake of the
            safety of a province, for the advantage of foreign nations&mdash;that one is for
            their sakes incurring danger, and spending much care and anxiety and labour. <milestone
              n="20" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="64" unit="section"/></p>
          <p>Even if the cause of those men who wish to revenge their own injuries be ever so
            strong, in which matter they are only obeying their own feelings of indignation, not
            consulting the advantage of the republic: how much more honourable is that cause, which
            is not only reasonable, but which ought to be acceptable to all,&mdash;that a man,
            without having received any private injury to himself, should be influenced by the
            sufferings and injuries of the allies and friends of the Roman people! When lately that
            most brave and upright man Lucius <persName><surname>Piso</surname></persName> demanded
            to be allowed to prefer an accusation against Publius Gabinius, and when Quintus
            Caecilius claimed the same permission in opposition to <persName><surname>Piso</surname></persName>, and said that in so doing he was following up an old quarrel which
            he had long had with Gabinius; it was not only the authority and dignity of Piso which
            had great weight, but also the superior justice of his cause, because the Achaeans had
            adopted him as their patron. <milestone n="65" unit="section"/> In truth, when the very
            law itself about extortion is the protectress of the allies and friends of the Roman
            people, it is an iniquitous thing that he should not, above all others, he thought the
            fittest advocate of the law and conductor of the trial, whom the allies wish, above all
            men, to be the pleader of their cause, and the defender of their fortunes. Or ought not
            that which is the more honourable to mention, to appear also far the most reasonable to
            approve of? Which then is the more splendid, which is the more honourable
            allegation&mdash;&ldquo;I have prosecuted this man to whom I had acted as
            quaestor, with whom the lot cast for the provinces, and the custom of our ancestors, and
            the judgment of gods and men had connected me,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;I have
            prosecuted this man at the request of the allies and friends of the Roman people, I have
            been selected by the whole province to defend its rights and fortunes?&rdquo; Can
            any one doubt that it is more honourable to act as prosecutor in behalf of those men
            among whom you have been quaestor, than as prosecutor of him whose quaestor you have
            been? <milestone n="66" unit="section"/> The most illustrious men of our state, in the
            best of times, used to think this most honourable and glorious for them to ward off
            injuries from their hereditary friends, and from their clients, and from foreign nations
            which were either friends or subjects of the Roman people, and to defend their fortunes.
            We learn from tradition that Marcus Cato, that wise man, that most illustrious and most
            prudent man, brought upon himself great enmity from many men, on account of the injuries
            of the Spaniards among whom he had been when consul. We know that lately Cnaeus Domitius
            prosecuted Marcus Silanus on account of the injuries of one man, Egritomarus, his
            father's friend and comrade. <milestone n="21" unit="chapter"/></p>
          <p>Nor indeed has anything ever had more influence over the minds of guilty men than this
            principle of our ancestors, now re-adopted and brought back among us after a long
            interval, namely, that the complaints of the allies should be brought to a man who is
            not very inactive, and their advocacy undertaken by him who appeared able to defend
            their fortunes with integrity and diligence. <milestone n="68" unit="section"/> Men are
            afraid of this; they endeavour to prevent this; they are disquieted at such a principle
            having ever been adopted, and after it has been adopted at its now being resuscitated
            and brought into play again. They think that, if this custom begins gradually to creep
            on and advance, the laws will be put in execution, and actions will be conducted by
            honourable and fearless men, and not by unskillful youths, or informers of this sort.
              <milestone n="69" unit="section"/> Of which custom and principle our fathers and
            ancestors did not repent when Publius Lentulus, he who was chief of the Senate,
            prosecuted Marcus Aquillius, having Caius Rutilius Rufus backing the accusation; or when
            Publius Africanus, a man most eminent for valour, for good fortune, for renown, and for
            exploits, after he had been twice consul and had been censor brought Lucius Cotta to
            trial Then the name of the Roman people was rightly held in high honour; rightly was the
            authority of this empire and the majesty of the state considered illustrious. Nobody
            marveled in the case of that great man Africanus, as they now pretend to marvel with
            respect to me, a man endowed with but moderate influence and moderate talents, just
            because they are annoyed at me; <milestone n="70" unit="section"/> &ldquo;What can
            he be meaning? does he want to be considered a prosecutor who hitherto has been
            accustomed to defend people? and especially now at the age when he is seeking the
            aedileship?&rdquo; But I think it becomes not my age only, but even a much greater
            age, and I think it an action consistent with the highest dignity to accuse the wicked,
            and to defend the miserable and distressed. And in truth, either this is a remedy for a
            republic diseased and in an almost desperate condition, and for tribunals corrupted and
            contaminated by the vices and baseness of a few, for men of the greatest possible honour
            and uprightness and modesty to undertake to uphold the stability of the laws, and the
            authority of the courts of justice; or else, if this is of no advantage, no medicine
            whatever will ever be found for such terrible and numerous evils as these. <milestone
              n="71" unit="section"/> There is no greater safety for a republic, than for those who
            accuse another to be no less alarmed for their own credit, and honour, and reputation,
            than they who are accused are for their lives and fortunes. And therefore, those men
            have always conducted prosecutions with the greatest care and with the greatest pains,
            who have considered that they themselves had their reputations at stake. <milestone
              n="22" unit="chapter"/></p>
          <p>You, therefore, O judges ought to come to this decision, that Quintus Caecilius of whom
            no one has ever had any opinion, and from whom even in this very trial nothing could be
            expected&mdash;who takes no trouble either to preserve a reputation previously
            acquired, or to give grounds for hope of himself in future times&mdash;will not be
            likely to conduct this cause with too much severity, with too much accuracy, or with too
            much diligence. For he has nothing which he can lose by disappointing public
            expectation; even if he were to come off ever so shamefully, or ever so infamously, he
            will lose no credit which he at present enjoys. <milestone n="72" unit="section"/> From
            us the Roman people has many hostages which we must labour with all our might and by
            every possible means to preserve uninjured, to defend, to keep in safety, and to redeem;
            it has honour which we are desirous of; it has hope, which we constantly keep before our
            eyes; it has reputation, acquired with much sweat and labour day and night; so that if
            we prove our duty and industry in this cause, we may be able to preserve all those
            things which I have mentioned safe and unimpaired by the favour of the Roman people; but
            if we trip and stumble ever so little, we may at one moment lose the whole of those
            things which have been collected one by one and by slow degrees. <milestone n="73"
              unit="section"/> On which account it is your business, O judges, to select him who you

            with wisdom, and with authority. If you prefer Quintus Caecilius to me, I shall not
            think that I am surpassed in dignity; but take you care that the Roman people do not
            think that a prosecution as honest, as severe, as diligent as this would have been in my

                <head>The Argument</head>
                <p>After the last oration it was decided that Cicero was to conduct the prosecution
                  against Verres; accordingly, a hundred and ten days were allowed to him to prepare
                  the evidence, with which object he went himself to <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                    >Sicily</placeName> to examine witnesses, and to collect facts in support of his
                  charges, taking with him his cousin Lucius Cicero as an assistant, and in this
                  journey, contrary to all precedent, he bore his own expenses, resolving to put the
                  island to no charge on his account. At <placeName key="tgn,7014561"
                    >Syracuse</placeName> the praetor, Metellus, endeavoured to obstruct him in his
                  inquiries, but the magistrates received him with great respect, and, declaring to
                  him that all that they had previously done in favour of Verres (for they had
                  erected a gilt statue of him, and had sent a testimonial of his good conduct and
                  kind government of them to <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>) had been
                  extorted from them by intrigue and terror, they delivered into his hands authentic
                  accounts of many injuries their city had received from Verres, and they revoked by
                  a formal decree the public praises which they had given him. <placeName
                    key="tgn,7003897">Messana</placeName>, however, continued firm in its
                  engagements to Verres, and denied Cicero all the honours to which he was entitled.
                  When he finished his investigations, apprehending that he might be waylaid by the
                  contrivance of Verres, he returned by sea to <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
                    >Rome</placeName>, where he found intrigues carrying on to protract the affair
                  as much as possible, in order to delay the decision of it till the year following,
                  when Hortensius and Metellus were to be the consuls, and the brother of Metellus
                  was to be praetor, by whose united authority the prosecution might be stifled: and
                  it was now so late in the year that there was not time to bring the trial to an
                  end, if the ordinary couse of proceeding was to be adhered to. But Cicero,
                  determined to bring on the decision while Glabrio continued to be praetor,
                  abandoned his idea of making a long speech, and of taking up time in dilating on
                  and enforcing the different counts of the indictment, and resolved to do nothing
                  more than produce his witnesses, and offer them to examination; and this novel
                  method of conducting the case, together with the powerful evidence produced, which
                  he could not invalidate, so confounded Hortensius, that he could find nothing to
                  say in his client's defence, who in despair went of his own accord into
                  banishment.</p>
                <p>The object of Cicero in this oration is to show that it is out of sheer necessity
                  that he does this, and that he is driven to such a proceeding by the intrigues of
                  the opposite party. He therefore exhorts the judges not to be intimidated or
                  cajoled into a dishonest decision, and threatens the opposite party with punishmet
                  for endeavouring to corrupt the judges.</p>

              <p>That which was above all things to be desired, O judges, and which above all things
                was calculated to have the greatest influence towards allaying the unpopularity of
                your order, and putting an end to the discredit into which your judicial decisions
                have fallen, appears to have been thrown in your way, and given to you not by any
                human contrivance, but almost by the interposition of the gods, at a most important
                crisis of the republic. For an opinion has now become established, pernicious to us,
                and pernicious to the republic, which has been the common talk of every one, not
                only at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, but among foreign nations
                also,&mdash;that in the courts of law as they exist at present, no wealthy man,
                however guilty he may be, can possibly be convicted. <milestone n="2" unit="section"
                /> Now at this time of peril to your order and to your tribunals, when men are ready
                to attempt by harangues, and by the proposal of new laws, to increase the existing
                unpopularity of the senate, Caius Verres is brought to trial as a criminal, a man
                condemned in the opinion of every one by his life and actions, but acquitted by the
                enormousness of his wealth according to his own hope and boast. I, O judges, have
                undertaken this cause as prosecutor with the greatest good wishes and expectation on
                the part of the Roman people, not in order to increase the unpopularity of the
                senate, but to relieve it from the discredit which I share with it. For I have
                brought before you a man, by acting justly in whose case you have an opportunity of
                retrieving the lost credit of your judicial proceedings, of regaining your credit
                with the Roman people, and of giving satisfaction to foreign nations; a man, the
                embezzler of the public funds, the petty tyrant of <placeName key="tgn,1000004"
                  >Asia</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7002611">Pamphylia</placeName>, the
                robber who deprived the city of its rights, the disgrace and ruin of the province of
                  <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                And if you come to a decision about this man with severity and a due regard to your
                oaths, that authority which ought to remain in you will cling to you still; but if
                that man's vast riches shall break down the sanctity and honesty of the courts of
                justice, at least I shall achieve this, that it shall be plain that it was rather
                honest judgment that was wanting to the republic, than a criminal to the judges, or
                an accuser to the criminal. <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>I, indeed, that I may confess to you the truth about myself, O judges, though many
                snares were laid for me by Caius Verres, both by land and sea, which I partly
                avoided by my own vigilance, and partly warded off by the zeal and kindness of my
                friends, yet I never seemed to be incurring so much danger, and I never was in such
                a state of great apprehension, as I am now in this very court of law.<milestone
                  n="4" unit="section"/> Nor does the expectation which people have formed of my
                conduct of this prosecution, nor this concourse of so vast a multitude as is here
                assembled, influence me (though indeed I am greatly agitated by these circumstances)
                so much as his nefarious plots which he is endeavouring to lay at one and the same
                time against me, against you, against Marcus Gabrio the praetor, and against the
                allies, against foreign nations, against the senate, and even against the very name
                of senator; whose favourite saying it is that they have got to fear who have stolen
                only as much as is enough for themselves, but that he has stolen so much that it may
                easily be plenty for many; that nothing is so holy that it cannot be corrupted, or
                so strongly fortified that it cannot be stormed by money. <milestone n="5"
                  unit="section"/> But if he were as secret in acting as he is audacious in
                attempting, perhaps in some particular he might some time or other have escaped our
                notice. But it happens very fortunately that to his incredible audacity there is
                joined a most unexampled folly. For as he was unconcealed in committing his
                robberies of money, so in his hope of corrupting the judges he has made his
                intentions and endeavours visible to every one. He says that once only in his life
                has he felt fear: at the time when he was first impeached as a criminal by me;
                because he was only lately arrived from his province, and was branded with
                unpopularity and infamy, not modern but ancient and of long standing; and, besides
                that, the time was unlucky, being very ill-suited for corrupting the judges.
                  <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Therefore, when I had demanded a very short time
                to prosecute my inquiries in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, he
                found a man to ask for two days less to make investigations in <placeName
                  key="tgn,7002733">Achaia</placeName>; <note anchored="yes">It is not certainly
                  known what Cicero refers to here.</note> not with any real intention of doing the
                same with his diligence and industry, that I have accomplished by my labour, and
                daily and nightly investigations. For the Achaean inquisitor never even arrived at
                  <placeName key="perseus,Brundusium">Brundusium</placeName>. I in fifty days so
                traveled over the whole of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> that I
                examined into the records and injuries of all the tribes and of all private
                individuals, so that it was easily visible to every one, that he had been seeking
                out a man not really for the purpose of bringing the defendant whom he accused to
                trial, but merely to occupy the time which ought to belong to me. <milestone n="3"
                  unit="chapter"/><milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>Now that most audacious and most senseless man thinks this. He is aware that I am
                come into court so thoroughly prepared and armed, that I shall fix all his thefts
                and crimes not only in your ears, but in the very eyes of all men. He sees that many
                senators are witnesses of his audacity, he sees that many Roman knights are so too,
                and many citizens, and many of the allies besides to whom he has done unmistakable
                injuries. He sees also that very numerous and very important deputations have come
                here at the same time from most friendly cities, armed with the public authority and
                evidence collected by their states. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> And though
                this is the case, still he thinks so ill of all virtuous men, to such an extent does
                he believe the decisions of the senators to be corrupt and profligate, that he makes
                a custom of openly boasting that it was not without reason that he was greedy of
                money, since he now finds that there is such protection in money, and that he has
                bought (what was the hardest thing of all) the very time of his trial, in order to
                be able to buy everything else more easily; so that, as he could not by any
                possibility shirk the force of the accusations altogether, he might avoid the most
                violent gusts of the storm. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> But if he had placed
                any hope at all, not only in his cause, but in any honourable defence, or in the
                eloquence or in the influence of any one, he would not be so eager in collecting and
                catching at all these things; he would not scorn and despise the senatorial body to
                such a degree, as to procure a man to be selected out of the senate at his will to
                be made a criminal of, who should plead his cause <note anchored="yes">This refers
                  to the same subject as the previous note.</note> before him, while he in the
                meantime was preparing whatever he had need of. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                And what the circumstances are on which he founds his hopes, and what hopes he
                builds on them, and what he is fixing his mind on. I see clearly. But how he can
                have the confidence to think that he can effect anything with the present praetor,
                and the present bench of Judges, I cannot conceive. This one thing I know, which the

                  <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>. And he did this not only in the
                case of public statues and ornaments, but he also plundered all the temples
                consecrated in the deepest religious feelings of the people. He did not leave, in
                short, one god to the Sicilians which appeared to him to be made in a tolerably
                workmanlike manner, and with any of the skill of the ancients. I am prevented by
                actual shame from speaking of his nefarious licentiousness as shown in rapes and
                other such enormities; and I am unwilling also to increase the distress of those men
                who have been unable to preserve their children and their wives unpolluted by his
                wanton lust. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> But, you will say, these things were
                done by him in such a manner as not to be notorious to all men. I think there is no
                man who has heard his name who cannot also relate wicked actions of his; so that I
                ought rather to be afraid of being thought to omit many of his crimes, than to
                invent any charges against him. And indeed I do not think that this multitude which
                has collected to listen to me wishes so much to learn of me what the facts of the
                case are, as to go over it with me, refreshing its recollection of what it knows
                already. <milestone n="6" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>And as this is the case, that senseless and profligate man attempts to combat me in
                another manner. He does not seek to oppose the eloquence of any one also to me, he
                does not rely on the popularity, or influence, or authority of any one. He pretends
                that he trusts to these things; but I see what he is really aiming at; (and indeed
                he is not acting with any concealment.) He sets before me empty titles of nobility,
                that is to say the names of arrogant men, who do not hinder me so much by being
                noble, as assist me by being notorious,&mdash;he pretends to rely on their
                protection; when he has in reality been contriving something else this long time.
                  <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> What hope he now has, and what he is
                endeavouring to do, I will now briefly explain to you, O judges. But first of all,
                remark, I beg you, how the matter has been arranged by him from the beginning. When
                he first returned from the province, he endeavoured to get rid of this prosecution
                by corrupting the judges at a great expense; and this object he continued to keep in
                view till the conclusion of the appointment of the judges. After the judges were
                appointed&mdash;because in drawing lots for them the fortune of the Roman people
                had defeated his hopes, and because in rejecting some, my diligence had defeated his
                impudence&mdash;the whole attempt at bribery was abandoned. <milestone n="17"
                  unit="section"/> The affair was going on admirably; lists of your names and of the
                whole tribunal were in every one's hands. It did not seem possible to mark the votes
                  <note anchored="yes">This refers to the way in which Hortensius had once marked

                sudden so downcast and humbled, that he seemed to be condemned not only by the Roman
                people but even by himself. But lo! all of a sudden, within these few days, since
                the consular comitia <note anchored="yes">The <foreign lang="la">comitia

                original plan with more money, and the same plots are now laid against your
                reputation and against the fortunes of every one, by the instrumentality of the same
                people; which fact at first, O judges, was pointed out to me by a very slight hint
                and indication; but afterwards, when my suspicions were once aroused, I arrived at
                the knowledge of all the most secret counsels of that party without any mistake.
                  <milestone n="7" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="18" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>For as Hortensius the consul elect was being attended home again from the Campus by
                a great concourse and multitude of people, Caius Curio fell in with that multitude
                by chance,&mdash;a man whom I wish to name by way of honour rather than of
                disparagement. I will tell you what, if he had been unwilling to have it mentioned,
                he would not have spoken of in so large an assembly so openly and undisguisedly;
                which, however, shall be mentioned by me deliberately and cautiously, that it may be
                seen that I pay due regard to our friendship and to his dignity. <milestone n="19"

                voice congratulates him on his victory. He does not say a word to Hortensius
                himself, who had been made consul, or to his friends and relations who were present
                attending on him; but he stops to speak to this man, embraces him, and bids him cast
                off all anxiety. &ldquo;I give you notice,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that
                you have been acquitted by this day's comitia.&rdquo; And as many most
                honourable men heard this, it is immediately reported to me; indeed, every one who
                saw me mentioned it to me the first thing. To some it appeared scandalous, to others
                ridiculous; ridiculous to those who thought that this cause depended on the
                credibility of the witnesses, on the importance of the charges, and on the power of
                the judges, and not on the consular comitia; scandalous to those who looked deeper,
                and who thought that this congratulation had reference to the corruption of the
                judge. <milestone n="20" unit="section"/> In truth, they argued in this
                manner&mdash;the most honourable men spoke to one another and to me in this
                manner&mdash;that there were now manifestly and undeniably no courts of justice
                at all. The very criminal who the day before thought that he was already condemned,
                is acquitted now that his defender has been made consul. What are we to think then?
                Will it avail nothing that all <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, all
                the Sicilians, that all the merchants who have business in that country, that all

                  >Rome</placeName>? Nothing, if the consul elect wills it otherwise. What! will not
                the judges be influenced by the accusation, by the evidence, by the universal
                opinion of the Roman people? No. Everything will be governed by the power and
                authority of one man. <milestone n="8" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>I will speak the truth, O judges. This thing agitated me greatly; for every good
                man was speaking in this way&mdash;&ldquo;That fellow will be taken out of
                your hands; but we shall not preserve our judicial authority much longer; for who,
                when Verres is acquitted, will be able to make any objection to transferring it from
                us?&rdquo; <milestone n="21" unit="section"/> It was a grievous thing to every
                one, and the sudden elation of that profligate man did not weigh with them as much
                as that fresh congratulation of a very honourable one. I wished to dissemble my own
                vexation at it; I wished to conceal my own grief of mind under a cheerful
                countenance, and to bury it in silence. But lo! on the very days when the praetors
                elected were dividing their duties by lot, and when it fell to the share of Marcus
                Metellus to hold trials concerning extortion, information is given me that that
                fellow was receiving such congratulations, that he also sent men home to announce it
                to his wife. <milestone n="22" unit="section"/> And this too in truth displeased me;
                and yet I was not quite aware what I had so much to fear from this allotment of the
                praetor's duties. But I ascertained this one thing from trustworthy men from whom I
                received all my intelligence; that many chests full of Sicilian money had been sent
                by some senator to a Roman knight, and that of these about ten chests had been left
                at that senator's house, with the statement that they were left to be used in the
                comitia when I expected to be elected aedile, and that men to distribute this money
                among all the tribes had been summoned to attend him by night. <milestone n="23"
                  unit="section"/> Of whom one, who thought himself under the greatest obligations
                to me, came to me that same night; reports to me the speech which that fellow had
                addressed to them; that he had reminded them how liberally he had treated them
                formerly when he was candidate for the praetorship, and at the last consular and
                praetorian comitia; and in the second place that he had promised them immediately
                whatever money they required, if they could procure my rejection from the
                aedileship. That on this some of them said that they did not dare attempt it; that
                others answered that they did not think it could be managed; but that one bold
                friend was found, a man of the same family as himself, Quintus Verres, of the
                Romilian tribe, of the most perfect school of bribers, the pupil and friend of
                Verres' father, who promised that, if five hundred thousand <foreign lang="la"
                  >sesterces</foreign> were provided, he would manage it; and that there were some
                others who said that they would cooperate with him. And as this was the case, he
                warned me beforehand with a friendly disposition, to take great care. <milestone
                  n="9" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="24" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>I was disquieted about many most important matters at one and the same moment, and
                with very little time to deliberate. The comitia were at hand; and at them I was to
                be opposed at immense expenditure of money. This trial was at hand; the Sicilian
                treasurers menaced that matter also. I was afraid, from apprehension about the
                comitia, to conduct the matters relating to the trial with freedom; and because of
                the trial, I was unable to attend with all my heart to my canvass. Threatening the
                agents of bribery was out of the question, because I saw that they were aware that I
                was hampered and fettered by this trial. <milestone n="25" unit="section"/> And at
                this same moment I hear that notice has been given to the Sicilians by Hortensius to
                come to speak to him at his house; that the Sicilians behaved in that matter with a
                proper sense of their own liberty, and, when they understood on what account they
                were sent for, they would not go. In the meantime my comitia began to be held; of
                which that fellow thought himself the master, as he had been of all the other
                comitia this year. He began to run about, that influential man, with his son, a
                youth of engaging and popular manners, among the tribes. The son began to address
                and to call on all the friends of his father, that is to say, all his agents for
                bribery; and when this was noticed and perceived, the Roman people took care with
                the most earnest goodwill that I should not be deprived of my honour through the
                money of that man, whose riches had not been able to make me violate my good faith.
                  <milestone n="26" unit="section"/> After that I was released from that great
                anxiety about my canvass, I began, with a mind much more unoccupied and much more at
                ease, to think of nothing and to do nothing except what related to this trial. I
                find, O judges, these plans formed and begun to be put in execution by them, to
                protract the matter, whatever steps it might be necessary to take in order to do so,
                so that the cause might be pleaded before Marcus Metellus as praetor. That by doing
                so they would have these advantages; firstly, that Marcus Metellus was most friendly
                to them; secondly, that not only would Hortensius be consul, but Quintus Metellus
                also: and listen while I show you how great a friend he is to them. For he gave him
                a token of his goodwill of such a sort, that he seemed to be giving it as a return
                for the suffrages <note anchored="yes">&ldquo;The order in which the centuries
                  voted was decided by lot, and that which gave its vote first was called <foreign

                  Ant. p. 274, v. <foreign lang="la">Comitia</foreign>. &ldquo;We also find the

                serious matters as these? and that, at a crisis of such danger to the republic and
                my own character, I would consult anything rather than my duty and my dignity? The
                other consul elect sent for the Sicilians; some came, because Lucius Metellus was
                praetor in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>. To them he speaks in
                this manner: that he is the consul; that one of his brothers has <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> for his province; that the other is to be
                judge in all prosecutions for extortion; and that care had been taken in many ways
                that there should be no possibility of Verres being injured. <milestone n="10"

              <p>I ask you, Metellus, what is corrupting the course of justice, if this is
                not,&mdash;to seek to frighten witnesses, and especially Sicilians, timid and
                oppressed men, not only by your own private influence, but by their fear of the
                consul, and by the power of two praetors? What would you do for an innocent man or
                for a relation, when for the sake of a most guilty man, entirely unconnected with
                you, you depart from your duty and your dignity, and allow what he is constantly
                saying to appear true to any one who is not acquainted with you? <milestone n="29"

                by destiny, as the rest of your family had been, but by his assistance. Two consuls,
                therefore, and the judge are to be such because of his will. We shall not only, says
                he, avoid having a man too scrupulous in investigating, too subservient to the
                opinion of the people, Marcus Glabrio, but we shall have this advantage
                also:&mdash;Marcus Caesonius is the judge, the colleague of our accuser a man of
                tried and proved experience in the decision of actions. It will never do for us to

                we shall not have Quintus Manlius and Quintus Cornificius, two most severe and
                upright judges, for judges, because they will then be tribunes of the people.
                Publius Sulpicius, a solemn and upright judge, must enter on his magistracy on the
                fifth of November. Marcus Crepereius, of that renowned equestrian family and of that
                incorruptible character; Lucius Cassius, of a family renowned for its severity in
                all things, and especially as judges; Cnaeus Tremellius, a man of the greatest
                scrupulousness and diligence;&mdash;these three men of ancient strictness of
                principle are all military tribunes elect. After the first of January they will not
                be able to act as judges. And besides this, we elect by lot a successor in the room
                of Marcus Metellus, since he is to preside over this very trial. And so after the
                first of January, the praetor, and almost the whole bench of judges being changed,
                we shall elude the terrible threats of the prosecutor, and the great expectations
                entertained of this trial, and manage it according to our own will and pleasure.
                  <milestone n="31" unit="section"/> Today is the fifth of August. You began to
                assemble at the ninth hour. This day they do not even count. There are ten days
                between this and the votive games which Cnaeus Pompeius is going to celebrate. These
                games will take up fifteen days; then immediately the Roman games will follow. And
                so, when nearly forty days have intervened, then at length they think they shall
                have to answer what has been said by us; and they think that, what with speeches,
                and what with excuses, they will easily be able to protract the cause till the
                period of the games of Victory. With these the plebeian games are connected, after
                which there will be either no day at all, or very few for pleading in. And so, when
                the accusation has got stale and cold, the matter will come all fresh before Marcus
                Metellus as praetor. And if I had distrusted his good faith, I should not have
                retained him as a judge. <milestone n="32" unit="section"/> But now I have such an
                opinion of him, that I would rather this matter was brought to a close while he is
                judge than while he is praetor; and I would rather entrust to him his own tablet
                while he is on his oath, than the tablets of others when he is restrained by no such
                obligation. <milestone n="11" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>Now, O judges, I consult you as to what you think I ought to do. For you will, in
                truth, without speaking, give me that advice which I understand that I must
                inevitably adopt. If I occupy the time which I legitimately might in speaking, I
                shall reap the fruit of my labour, industry, and diligence; and by this prosecution
                I shall make it manifest that no one in the memory of man appears ever to have come
                before a court of justice better prepared, more vigilant, or with his cause better
                got up. But while I am getting this credit for my industry, there is great danger
                lest the criminal may escape. What, then, is there which can be done? I think it is
                neither obscure nor hidden. <milestone n="33" unit="section"/> I will reserve for
                another time that fruit of praise which may be derived from a long uninterrupted
                speech. At present I must support this accusation by documentary evidence, by
                witnesses, by letters of private individuals and of public bodies, and by various
                other kinds of proof. The whole of this contest is between you and me, O Hortensius.
                I will speak openly. If I thought that you were contending with me in the matter of
                speaking, and of getting rid of the charges I bring against your client in this
                cause, I, too, would devote much pains to mounting an elaborate accusation, and to
                dilating on my charges. Now, since you have determined to contend against me with
                artifice, not so much in obedience to the promptings of your own nature, as from
                consulting his occasions and his cause, it is necessary for me to oppose conduct of
                that sort with prudence. <milestone n="34" unit="section"/> Your plan is, to begin
                to answer me after two sets of games have been celebrated; mine is to have the
                adjournment <note anchored="yes">The Latin is, <foreign lang="la">ut

                  is, when the cause has been pleaded on each side, to order that on the third day
                  both the defendant and the prosecutor appear to speak a second
                  time.&rdquo;&mdash;Hottoman. &ldquo;The parties appeared before the
                  judex on the third day (<foreign lang="la">comperendinatio</foreign>), unless the
                  praetor had deferred the <foreign lang="la">judicium</foreign> for some sufficient

                    >Judex</foreign>.</note> over before the first series. And the result will be,
                that that plan of yours will be thought crafty, but this determination of mine
                necessary. <milestone n="12" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>But as for what I had begun to say,&mdash;namely, that the contest is between
                you and me, this is it,&mdash;I, when I had undertaken this cause at the request
                of the Sicilians, and had thought it a very honourable and glorious thing for me
                that they were willing to make experiment of my integrity and diligence, who already
                knew by experience my innocence and temperance: then, when I had undertaken this
                business, I proposed to myself some greater action also by which the Roman people
                should be able to see my goodwill towards the republic. <milestone n="35"
                  unit="section"/> For that seemed to me to be by no means worthy of my industry and
                efforts, for that man to be brought to trial by me who had been already condemned by
                the judgment of all men, unless that intolerable influence of yours, and that
                grasping nature which you have displayed for some years in many trials, was
                interposed also in the case of that desperate man. But no, since all this dominion
                and sovereignty of yours over the courts of justice delights you so much, and since
                there are some men who are neither ashamed of their licentiousness and their infamy,
                nor weary of it, and who, as if on purpose, seem to wish to encounter hatred and
                unpopularity from the Roman people, I profess that I have undertaken
                this,&mdash;a great burden perhaps, and one dangerous to myself, but still
                worthy of my applying myself to it with all the vigour of my age, and all diligence.
                  <milestone n="36" unit="section"/> And since the whole order of the senate is
                weighed down by the discredit brought on it by the wickedness and audacity of a few,
                and is overwhelmed by the infamy of the tribunals, I profess myself an enemy to this
                race of men, an accuser worthy of their hatred, a persevering, a bitter adversary. I
                arrogate this to myself, I claim this for myself, and I will carry out this enmity
                in my magistracy, and from that post in which the Roman people has willed that from
                the next first of January I shall act in concert with it in matters concerning the
                republic, and concerning wicked men. I promise the Roman people that this shall be
                the most honourable and the fairest employment of my aedileship. I warn, I forewarn,
                I give notice beforehand to those men who are wont either to put money down, to
                undertake for others, to receive money, or to promise money, or to act as agents in
                bribery, or as go-betweens in corrupting the seat of judgment, and who have promised
                their influence or their impudence in aid of such a business, in this trial to keep
                their hands and inclinations from this nefarious wickedness. <milestone n="13"

              <p>Hortensius will then be consul with the chief command and authority, but I shall be
                aedile&mdash;that is, I shall be a little more than a private individual; and
                yet this business, which I promise that I am going to advocate, is of such a nature,
                so pleasing and agreeable to the Roman people, that the consul himself will appear
                in this cause, if that be possible, even less than a private individual in
                comparison of me. All those things shall not only be mentioned, but even, where
                certain matters have been explained, shall be fully discussed, which for the last
                ten years, ever since the office of the judge has been transferred to the senate,
                has been nefariously and wickedly done in the decision of judicial matters.
                  <milestone n="38" unit="section"/> The Roman people shall know from me why it is
                that when the equestrian body supplied the judges for nearly fifty years together,
                not even the slightest suspicion ever arose of bribes having been accepted for the
                purpose of influencing a decision; why it is, I say, when the judicial authority was
                transferred to the senatorial body, and the power <note anchored="yes">That is to

                Calidius, when he was condemned, said that a man of praetorian rank could not
                honestly be condemned at a less price than three hundred thousand <foreign lang="la"
                  >sesterces</foreign>; why it is that when Publius Septimius, a senator, was
                condemned for extortion, when Quintus Hortensius was praetor, damages were assessed
                against him, including money which he had received as judge to decide causes which
                came before him; <milestone n="39" unit="section"/> why it is, that in the case of
                Caius Herennius, and in that of Caius Popillius, senators, both of whom were
                convicted of peculation&mdash;why it is, that in the case of Marcus Atilius, who
                was convicted of treason&mdash;this was made plain,&mdash;that they had all
                received money for the purpose of influencing their judicial decisions; why it is,
                that senators have been found who, when Caius Verres, as praetor of the city, gave
                out the lots, voted against the criminal whom they were condemning without having
                inquired into his case; why it is, that a senator was found who, when he was judge,
                took money in one and the same trial both from the defendant to distribute among the
                judges, and from the accuser to condemn the defendant. <milestone n="40"
                  unit="section"/> But how shall I adequately complain of that stain, that disgrace,
                that calamity of the whole senatorial order,&mdash;that this thing actually
                happened in the city while the senatorial order furnished the judges, that the votes
                of men on their oaths were marked by coloured tablets? I pledge myself that I will
                urge all these things with diligence and with strictness. <milestone n="14"

              <p>And what do you suppose will be my thoughts, if I find in this very trial any
                violation of the laws committed in any similar manner? especially when I can prove
                by many witnesses that Caius Verres often said in <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName>, in the hearing of many persons, &ldquo;that he had a
                powerful friend, in confidence in whom he was plundering the province; and that he
                was not seeking money for himself alone, but that he had so distributed the three
                years of his Sicilian praetorship, that he should say he did exceedingly well, if he
                appropriated the gains of one year to the augmentation of his own property, those of
                the second year to his patrons and defenders, and reserved the whole of the third
                year, the most productive and gainful of all, for the judges.&rdquo; <milestone
                  n="41" unit="section"/> From which it came into my mind to say that which, when I
                had said lately before Marcus Glabrio at the time of striking the list of judges, I
                perceived the Roman people greatly moved by; that I thought that foreign nations
                would send ambassadors to the Roman people to procure the abrogation of the law, and
                of all trials, about extortion; for if there were no trials, they think that each
                man would only plunder them of as much as he would think sufficient for himself and
                his children; but now, because there are trials of that sort, every one carries off
                as much as it will take to satisfy himself, his patrons, his advocates, the praetor,
                and the judges; and that this is an enormous sum; that they may be able to satisfy
                the cupidity of one most avaricious man, but are quite unable to incur the expense
                of his most guilty victory over the laws. <milestone n="42" unit="section"/> O
                trials worthy of being recorded! O splendid reputation of our order! when the allies
                of the Roman people are unwilling that trials for extortion should take place, which
                were instituted by our ancestors for the sake of the allies. Would that man ever
                have had a favourable hope of his own safety, if he had not conceived in his mind a
                bad opinion of you? on which account, he ought, if possible, to be still more hated
                by you than he is by the Roman people, because he considers you like himself in
                avarice and wickedness and perjury. <milestone n="15" unit="chapter"/><milestone
                  n="43" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>And I beg you, in the name of the immortal gods, O judges, think of and guard
                against this; I warn you, I give notice to you, of what I am well assured, that this
                most seasonable opportunity has been given to you by the favour of the gods, for the
                purpose of delivering your whole order from hatred, from unpopularity, from infamy,
                and from disgrace. There is no severity believed to exist ill the tribunals, nor any
                scruples with regard to religion; in short, there are not believed to be any
                tribunals at all. Therefore we are despised and scorned by the Roman people; we are
                branded with a heavy and now a long standing infamy. <milestone n="44"
                  unit="section"/> Nor, in fact, is there any other reason for which the Roman
                people has with so much earnestness sought the restoration of the tribunician power:
                but when it was demanding that in words, it seemed to be asking for that, but in
                reality it was asking for tribunes which it could trust. And this did not escape the
                notice of Quintus Catulus, a most sagacious and honourable man, who, when Cnaeus
                Pompeius, a most gallant and illustrious man, made a motion about the tribunitian
                power, and when he was asked his opinion, begin his speech in this manner, speaking
                with the greatest authority, &ldquo;that the conscript fathers presided over the
                courts of justice badly and wickedly; but if in deciding judicial trials they had
                been willing to satisfy the expectations of the Roman people, men would not so
                greatly regret the tribunitian power?&rdquo; <milestone n="45" unit="section"/>
                Lastly, when Cnaeus Pompeius himself, when first he delivered an address to the
                people as consul elect, mentioned (what seemed above all things to be watched for)
                that he would restore the power of the tribunes, a great shout was raised at his
                words, and a grateful murmur pervaded the assembly. And when he had said also in the
                same assembly &ldquo;that the provinces were depopulated and tyrannised over,
                that the courts of justice were become base and wicked, and that he desired to
                provide for and to remedy that evil,&rdquo; the Roman people then signified
                their good will, not with a shout, but with a universal uproar. <milestone n="16"
                  unit="chapter"/><milestone n="46" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>But now men are on the watch towers; they observe how every one of you behaves
                himself in respecting religion and in preserving the laws. They see that, ever since
                the passing of the law for restoring the power of the tribunes, only one senator,
                and he too a very insignificant one, <note anchored="yes">The senator was
                  Dolabella</note> has been condemned. And though they do nor blame this, yet they
                have nothing which they can very much commend. For there is no credit in being
                upright in a case where there is no one who is either able or who endeavours to
                corrupt one. <milestone n="47" unit="section"/> This is a trial in which you will be
                deciding about the defendant, the Roman people about you;&mdash;by the example
                of what happens to this man it will be determined whether, when senators are the
                judges, a very guilty and a very rich man can be condemned. Moreover, he is a
                criminal of such a sort, that there is absolutely nothing whatever in him except the
                greatest crimes, and excessive riches; so that if he be acquitted, no other opinion
                can be formed of the matter except that which is the most discreditable possible.
                Such numerous and enormous vices as his will not be considered to have been canceled
                by influence, by family connection, by some things which may have been done well, or
                even by the minor vices of flattery and subservience. <milestone n="48"
                  unit="section"/> In short, I will conduct the cause in this manner; I will bring
                forward things of such a sort, so well known, so proved by evidence, so important,
                and so undeniable, that no one shall venture to use his influence to obtain from you
                the acquittal of that man; for I have a sure path and method by which I can
                investigate and become acquainted with all their endeavours. The matter will be so
                managed by me that not only the ears but even the eyes of the Roman people shall
                seem to be present at all their counsels. <milestone n="49" unit="section"/> You
                have in your power to remove and to eradicate the disgrace and infamy which has now
                for many years attached to your order. It is evident to all men, that since these
                tribunals have been established which we now have, there has never been a bench of
                judges of the same splendour and dignity as this. <note anchored="yes">Cicero
                  several times in these orations takes credit to himself for his industry and

                  were to try this case.</note> If anything is done wrongly in this case, all men
                will think not that other more capable judges should be appointed of the same order
                of men, which is not possible; but that another order must be sought for, from which

              <p>On which account, in the first place, I beg this of the immortal gods, which I seem
                to myself to have hopes of too, that in this trial no one may be found to be wicked
                except him who has long since been found to be such; secondly, if there are many
                wicked men, I promise this to you, O judges, I promise this to the Roman people,
                that my life shall fail rather than my vigour and perseverance in prosecuting their
                iniquity. <milestone n="51" unit="section"/> But that iniquity, which, if it should
                be committed, I promise to prosecute severely, with however much trouble and danger
                to myself, and whatever enmities I may bring on myself by so doing, you, O Marcus
                Glabrio, can guard against ever taking place by your wisdom, and authority, and
                diligence. Do you undertake the cause of the tribunals. Do you undertake the cause
                of impartiality, of integrity, of good faith and of religion. Do you undertake the
                cause of the senate; that, being proved worthy by its conduct in this trial, it may
                come into favour and popularity with the Roman people. Think who you are, and in
                what a situation you are placed; what you ought to give to the Roman people, what
                you ought to repay to your ancestors. Let the recollection of the Acilian <note

                law passed by your father occur to your mind, owing to which law the Roman people
                has had this advantage of most admirable decisions and very strict judges in cases
                of extortion. <milestone n="52" unit="section"/> High authorities surround you which
                will not suffer you to forget your family credit; which will remind you day and
                night that your father was a most brave man, your grandfather a most wise one, and
                your father-in-law a most worthy man. Wherefore, if you have inherited the vigour
                and energy of your father Glabrio in resisting audacious men; if you have inherited
                the prudence of your grandfather Scaevola in foreseeing intrigues which are prepared
                against your fame and that of your fellow-judges; if you have any share of the
                constancy of your father-in-law Scaurus, so that no one can move you from your
                genuine and deliberate opinion, the Roman people will understand that with an
                upright and honourable praetor, and a carefully selected bench of judges, abundance
                of wealth has more influence in bringing a criminal into suspicion, than in

              <p>I am resolved not to permit the praetor or the judges to be hanged in this cause. I

                from all <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> has departed from <placeName
                  key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, which has assembled from all quarters at the
                same time on account of the comitia, of the games, and of the census. The reward of
                the credit gained by your decision, or the danger arising from the unpopularity
                which will accrue to you if you decide unjustly, I think ought to belong to you; the
                labour and anxiety to me; the knowledge of what is done and the recollection of what
                has been said by every one, to all. <milestone n="55" unit="section"/> I will adopt
                this course, not an unprecedented one, but one that has been adopted before, by
                those who are now the chief men of our state,&mdash;the course, I mean, of at
                once producing the witnesses. What you will find novel, O judges, is this, that I
                will so marshal my witnesses as to unfold the whole of my accusation; that when I
                have established it by examining my witnesses, by arguments, and by my speech, then
                I shall show the agreement of the evidence with my accusation: so that there shall
                be no difference between the established mode of prosecuting, and this new one,
                except that, according to the established mode, when everything has been said which
                is to be said, then the witnesses are produced; here they shall be produced as each
                count is brought forward; so that the other side shall have the same opportunity of
                examining them, of arguing and making speeches or their evidence. If there be any
                one who prefers an uninterrupted speech and the old mode of conducting a prosecution
                without any break, he shall have it in some other trial. But for this time let him
                understand that what we do is done by us on compulsion, (for we only do it with the
                design of opposing the artifice of the opposite party by our prudence.) <milestone
                  n="56" unit="section"/> This will be the first part of the prosecution. We say
                that Caius Verres has not only done many licentious acts, many cruel ones, towards
                Roman citizens, and towards some of the allies, many wicked acts against both gods
                and men; but especially that he has taken away four hundred thousand <foreign

                  >Sicily</placeName> contrary to the laws. We will make this so plain to you by
                witnesses, by private documents, and by public records that you shall decide that,
                even if we had abundant space and leisure days for making a long speech without any
                inconvenience, still there was no need at all of a long speech in this matter.</p>

                <p>The following five orations were never spoken: they were published afterwards as
                  they had been prepared and intended to be spoken if Verres had made a regular
                  defence; for as this was the only cause in which Cicero had been engaged as
                  accuser, he was willing to leave these orations as a specimen of his abilities
                  that way, and as a pattern of a just and diligent impeachment of a corrupt
                  magistrate. But Hortensius had been so confounded by the novelty of Cicero's mode
                  of conducting the prosecution, and by the strength of the case brought against his
                  client, that he was quite unable to make any defence, and Verres went into
                  voluntary exile. </p>
                <p>In the beginning of this oration Cicero imagines Verres to be present, and to be
                  prepared to make his defence, but before he proceeds to the main subjects of the
                  prosecution, which occupy the last four orations he devotes this one to an
                  examination of his previous character and conduct as a public man, as quaestor, as
                  legatus, as praetor urbanus, and as praetor in <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                    >Sicily</placeName>; in order to show that his previous conduct had been such as
                  to warrant any one in believing the charges he was now bringing against him. </p>

              <p>I think that no one of you, O judges, is ignorant that for these many days the
                discourse of the populace, and the opinion of the Roman people, has been that Caius
                Verres would not appear a second time before the bench to reply to my charges, and
                would not again present himself in court; And this idea had not got about merely
                because he had deliberately determined and resolved not to appear, but because no
                one believed that any one would be so audacious, so frantic, and so impudent, as,
                after having been convicted of such nefarious crimes, and by so many witnesses, to
                venture to present himself to the eyes of the judges, or to show his face to the
                Roman people. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> But he is the same Verres that he
                always was; as he was abandoned enough to dare, so he is hardened enough to listen
                to anything. He is present; he replies to us; he makes his defence. He does not even
                leave himself this much of character, to be supposed, by being silent and keeping
                out of the way when he is so visibly convicted of the most infamous conduct, to have
                sought for a modest escape for his impudence. I can endure this, O judges, and I am
                not vexed that I am to receive the reward of my labours, and you the reward of your
                virtue. For if he had done what he at first determined to, that is, had not
                appeared, it would have been somewhat less known than is desirable for me what pains
                I had taken in preparing and arranging this prosecution: and your praise, O judges,
                would have been exceedingly slight and little heard of. <milestone n="3"
                  unit="section"/> For this is not what the Roman people is expecting from you, nor
                what it can be contented with,&mdash;namely, for a man to be condemned who
                refuses to appear, and for you to act with resolution in the case of a man whom
                nobody has dared to defend. Aye, let him appear, let him reply; let him be defended
                with the utmost influence and the utmost zeal of the most powerful men, let my
                diligence have to contend with the covetousness of all of them, your integrity with
                his riches, the consistency of the witnesses with the threats and power of his
                patrons. Then indeed those things will be seen to be overcome when they have come to
                the contest and to the struggle. But if he had been condemned in his absence, he
                would have appeared not so much to have consulted his own advantage as to have
                grudged you your credit. <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="4"
                  unit="section"/></p>
              <p>For neither can there be any greater safety for the republic imagined at this time,
                than for the Roman people to understand that, if all unworthy judges are carefully
                rejected by the accusers, the allies, the laws, and the republic can be thoroughly
                defended by a bench of judges chosen from the senators; nor can any such injury to
                the fortunes of all happen, as for all regard for truth, for integrity, for good
                faith, and for religion to be, in the opinion of the Roman people, cast aside by the
                senatorial body. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> And therefore, I seem to myself,
                O judges, to have undertaken to uphold an important, and very failing, and almost
                neglected part of the republic, and by so doing to be acting not more for the
                benefit of my own reputation than of yours. For I have come forward to diminish the
                unpopularity of the courts of justice, and to remove the reproaches which are
                levelled at them; in order that, when this cause has been decided according to the
                wish of the Roman people, the authority of the courts of justice may appear to have
                been re-established in some degree by my diligence; and in order that this matter
                may be so decided that an end may be put at length to the controversy about the
                tribunals; <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> and, indeed, beyond all question, O
                judges, that matter depends on your decision in this cause. For the criminal is most
                guilty. And if he be condemned, men will cease to say that money is all powerful
                with the present tribunal; but if he be acquitted we shall cease to be able to make
                any objection to transferring the tribunal to another body. Although that fellow has
                not in reality any hope, nor the Roman people any fear of his acquittal, there are
                some men who do marvel at his singular impudence in being present, in replying to
                the accusations brought against him; but to me even this does not appear marvellous
                in comparison with his other actions of audacity and madness. For he has done many
                impious and nefarious actions both against gods and men; by the punishment for which
                crimes he is now disquieted and driven out of his mind and out of his senses.
                  <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>The punishments of Roman citizens are driving him mad, some of whom he has
                delivered to the executioner, others he has put to death in prison, others he has
                crucified while demanding their rights as freemen and as Roman citizens. The gods of
                his fathers are hurrying him away to punishment, because he alone has been found to
                lead to execution sons torn from the embraces of their fathers, and to demand of
                parents payment for leave to bury their sons. The reverence due to, and the holy
                ceremonies practiced in, every shrine and every temple&mdash;but all violated by
                him; and the images of the gods, which have not only been taken away from their
                temples, but which are even lying in darkness, having been cast aside and thrown
                away by him&mdash;do not allow his mind to rest free from frenzy and madness.
                  <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Nor does he appear to me merely to offer himself
                to condemnation, nor to be content with the common punishment of avarice, when he
                has involved himself in so many atrocities; his savage and monstrous nature wishes
                for some extraordinary punishment. It is not alone demanded that, by his
                condemnation, their property may be restored to those from whom it has been taken
                away; but the insults offered to the religion of the immortal gods must be expiated,
                and the tortures of Roman citizens, and the blood of many innocent men, must be
                atoned for by that man's punishment. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> For we have
                brought before your tribunal not only a thief, but a wholesale robber; not only an
                adulterer, but a ravisher of chastity; not only a sacrilegious man, but an open
                enemy to all sacred things and all religion; not only an assassin, but a most
                barbarous murderer of both citizens and allies; so that I think him the only
                criminal in the memory of man so atrocious, that it is even for his own good to be
                condemned. <milestone n="4" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>For who is there who does not see this, that though he be acquitted, against the
                will of gods and men, yet that he cannot possibly be taken out of the hands of the
                Roman people? Who does not see that it would be an excellent thing for us in that
                case, if the Roman people were content with the punishment of that one criminal
                alone, and did not decide that he had not committed any greater wickedness against
                them when he plundered temples, when he murdered so many innocent men, when he
                destroyed Roman citizens by execution, by torture, by the cross,&mdash;when he
                released leaders of banditti for bribes,&mdash;than they, who, when on their
                oaths, acquitted a man covered with so many, with such enormous, with such
                unspeakable wickednesses? <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> There is, there is, O
                judges, no room for any one to err in respect of this man. He is not such a
                criminal, this is not such a time, this is not such a tribunal, (I fear to seem to
                say anything too arrogant before such men,) even the advocate is not such a man,
                that a criminal so guilty, so abandoned, so plainly convicted, can be either
                stealthily or openly snatched out of his hands with impunity. When such men as these
                are judges, shall I not be able to prove that Caius Verres has taken bribes contrary
                to the laws? Will such men venture to assert that they have not believed so many
                senators, so many Roman knights, so many cities, so many men of the highest honour
                from so illustrious a province, so many letters of whole nations and of private
                individuals? that they have resisted so general a wish of the Roman people?
                  <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Let them venture. We will find, if we are able
                to bring that fellow alive before another tribunal, men to whom we can prove that he
                in his quaestorship embezzled the public money which was given to Cnaeus Carbo the
                consul; men whom we can persuade that he got money under false pretences from the
                quaestors of the city, as you have learnt in my former pleadings. There will be some
                men, too, who will blame his boldness in having released some of the contractors
                from supplying the corn due to the public, when they could make it for his own
                interest. There will even, perhaps, be some men who will think that robbery of his
                most especially to be punished, when he did not hesitate to carry off out of the
                most holy temples and out of the cities of our allies and friends, the monuments of
                Marcus Marcellus and of Publius Africanus, which in name indeed belonged to them,
                but in reality both belonged and were always considered to belong to the Roman
                people. <milestone n="5" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="12" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>Suppose he has escaped from the court about peculation. Let him think of the
                generals of the enemy, for whose release he has accepted bribes; let him consider
                what answer he can make about those men whom he has left in his own house to
                substitute in their places;<note anchored="yes">This refers to the following act of
                  Verres:&mdash;A single pirate ship had been taken by his lieutenant; the
                  captain bribed Verres to save his life, but the people were impatient for the
                  execution of him and his chief officers. Verres, who had in his dungeons many
                  Roman citizens who had offended him, muffled up their faces, so that they could
                  not speak and could not be recognised, and produced them on the scaffold, and put
                  them to death as the pirates for whose execution the people were
                  clamouring.</note> let him consider not only how he can get over our accusation,
                but also how he can remedy his own confession. Let him recollect that, in the former
                pleadings, being excited by the adverse and hostile shouts of the Roman people, he
                confessed that he had not caused the leaders of the pirates to be executed; and that
                he was afraid even then that it would be imputed to him that he had released them
                for money. Let him confess that, which cannot be denied, that he, as a private
                individual, kept the leaders of the pirates alive and unhurt in his own house, after
                he had returned to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, as long as he
                could do so for me. If in the case of such a prosecution for treason it was lawful
                for him to do so, I will admit that it was proper. Suppose he escapes from this
                accusation also; I will proceed to that point to which the Roman people has long
                been inviting me. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> For it thinks that the decision
                concerning the rights to freedom and to citizenship belong to itself; and it thinks
                rightly. Let that fellow, forsooth, break down with his evidence the intentions of
                the senators&mdash;let him force his way through the questions of all
                men&mdash;let him make his escape from your severity; believe me, he will be
                held by much tighter chains in the hands of the Roman people. The Roman people will
                give credit to those Roman knights who, when they were produced as witnesses before
                you originally, said that a Roman citizen, one who was offering honourable men as
                his bail, was crucified by him in their sight. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>
                The whole of the thirty-five tribes will believe a most honourable and accomplished
                man, Marcus Annius, who said, that when he was present, a Roman citizen perished by
                the hand of the executioner. That most admirable man Lucius Flavius, a Roman knight,
                will be listened to by the Roman people, who gave in evidence that his intimate
                friend Herennius, a merchant from <placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>,
                though more than a hundred Roman citizens at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse"
                  >Syracuse</placeName> knew him, and defended him in tears, was put to death by the
                executioner. Lucius Suetius, a man endowed with every accomplishment, speaks to them
                with an honesty and authority and conscientious veracity which they must trust; and
                he said on his oath before you that many Roman citizens had been most cruelly put to
                death, with every circumstance of violence, in his stone-quarries. When I am
                conducting this cause for the sake of the Roman people from this rostrum, I have no
                fear that either any violence can be able to save him from the votes of the Roman
                people, or that any labour undertaken by me in my aedileship can be considered more
                honourable or more acceptable by the Roman people. <milestone n="6" unit="chapter"

              <p>Let, therefore, every one at this trial attempt everything. There is no mistake now
                which any one can make in this cause, O judges, which will not be made at your risk.
                My own line of conduct, as it is already known to you in what is past, is also
                provided for, and resolved on, in what is to come. I displayed my zeal for the
                republic at that time, when, after a long interval, I reintroduced the old custom,
                and at the request of the allies and friends of the Roman people, who were, however,
                my own most intimate connections, prosecuted a most audacious man. And this action
                of mine most virtuous and accomplished men (in which number many of you were)
                approved of to such a degree, that they refused the man who had been his quaestor,
                and who, having been offended by him, wished to prosecute his own quarrel against
                him, leave not only to prosecute the man himself, but even back the accusation
                against him, when he himself begged to do so. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> I

                into the business, in which occupation the celerity of my return showed my industry;
                the multitude of documents and witnesses which I brought with me declared my
                diligence; and I further showed my moderation and scrupulousness, in that when I had
                arrived as a senator among the allies of the Roman people, having been quaestor in
                that province, I, though the defender of the common cause of them all, lodged rather
                with my own hereditary friends and connections, than those who had sought that
                assistance from me. My arrival was no trouble nor expense to any one, either
                publicly or privately. I used in the inquiry just as much power as the law gave me,
                not as much as I might have had through the zeal of those men whom that fellow had
                oppressed. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> When I returned to <placeName
                  key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> from <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName>, when he and his friends, luxurious and polite men, had
                disseminated reports of this sort, in order to blunt the inclinations of the
                witnesses,&mdash;such as that I had been seduced by a great bribe from
                proceeding with a genuine prosecution; although it did not seem probable to any one,
                because the witnesses from <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> were men
                who had known me as a quaestor in the province; and as the witnesses from <placeName
                  key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> were men of the highest character, who knew
                every one of us thoroughly, just as they themselves are known; still I had some
                apprehension lest any one should have a doubt of my good faith and integrity, till
                we came to striking out the objectionable judges. <milestone n="7" unit="chapter"
                /></p>
              <p>I knew that in selecting the judges, some men, even within my own recollection, had
                not avoided the suspicion of a good understanding with the opposite party, though
                their industry and diligence was being proved actually in the prosecution of them.
                  <milestone n="18" unit="section"/> I objected to objectionable judges in such a
                way that this is plain,&mdash;that since the republic has had that constitution
                which we now enjoy, no tribunal has ever existed of similar renown and dignity. And
                this credit that fellow says that he shares in common with me; since when he
                rejected Publius Galba as judge, he retained Marcus Lucretius; and when, upon this,
                his patron asked him why he had allowed his most intimate friends Sextus Paeduceus,
                Quintus Considius, and Quintus Junius, to be objected to, he answered, because he
                knew them to be too much attached to their own ideas and opinions in coming to a
                decision. <milestone n="19" unit="section"/> And so when the business of objecting
                to the judges was over, I hoped that you and I had now one common task before us. I
                thought that my good faith and diligence was approved of, not only by those to whom
                I was known, but even by strangers. And I was not mistaken: for in the comitia for
                my election, when that man was employing boundless bribery against me, the Roman
                people decided that his money, which had no influence with me when put in opposition
                to my own good faith, ought to have no influence with them to rob me of my honour.
                On the day when you first, O judges, were summoned to this place, and sat in
                judgment on this criminal, who was so hostile to your order, who was so desirous of
                a new constitution, of a new tribunal and new judges, as not to be moved at the
                sight of you and of your assembled body? <milestone n="20" unit="section"/> When on
                the trial your dignity procured me the fruit of my diligence, I gained thus
                much,&mdash;that in the same hour that I began to speak, I cut off from that
                audacious, wealthy, extravagant, and abandoned criminal, all hope of corrupting the
                judges; that on the very first day, when such a number of witnesses had been brought
                forward, the Roman people determined that If he were acquitted, the republic would
                no longer exist; that the second day took away from his friends, not only all hope
                of victory, but even all inclination to make any defence; that the third day
                prostrated the man so entirely, that, pretending to be sick, he took counsel, not
                what reply he could make, but how he could avoid making any; and after that, on the
                subsequent days, he was so oppressed and overwhelmed by these accusations, by these
                witnesses, both from the city and from the provinces, that when these days of the
                games intervened, no one thought that he had procured an adjournment, but they
                thought that he was condemned. <milestone n="8" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="21"
                  unit="section"/></p>
              <p>So that, as far as I am concerned, O judges, I gained the day; for I did not desire
                the spoils of Caius Verres, but the good opinion of the Roman people. It was my
                business to act as accuser only if I had a good cause. What cause was ever juster
                than the being appointed and selected by as illustrious a province as its defender?
                To consult the welfare of the republic;&mdash;what could be more honourable for
                the republic, than while the tribunals were in such general discredit, to bring
                before them a man by whose condemnation the whole order of the senate might be
                restored to credit and favour with the Roman people?&mdash;to prove and convince
                men that it was a guilty man who was brought to trial? Who is there of the Roman
                people who did not carry away this conviction from the previous pleading, that if
                all the wickednesses, thefts, and enormities of all who have ever been condemned
                before were brought together into one place, they could scarcely be likened or
                compared to but a small part of this man's crimes? <milestone n="22" unit="section"
                /> Judges, consider and deliberate what becomes your fame, your reputation, and the
                common safety? Your eminence prevents your being able to make any mistake without
                the greatest injury and danger to the republic. For the Roman people cannot hope
                that there are any other men in the senate who can judge uprightly, if you cannot.
                It is inevitable that, when it has learnt to despair of the whole order, it should
                look for another class of men and another system of judicial proceedings. If this
                seems to you at all a trifling matter, because you think the being judges a grave
                and inconvenient burden, you ought to be aware, in the first place, that it makes a
                difference whether you throw off that burden yourselves, of your own accord, or
                whether the power of sitting as judges is taken away from you because you have been
                unable to convince the Roman people of your good faith and scrupulous honesty. In
                the second place, consider this also, with what great danger we shall come before
                those judges whom the Roman people, by reason of its hatred to you, has willed shall
                judge concerning you. <milestone n="23" unit="section"/> But I will tell you, O
                judges, what I am sure of. Know, then, that there are some men who are possessed
                with such a hatred or your order, that they now make a practice of openly saying
                that they are willing for that man, whom they know to be a most infamous one, to be
                acquitted for this one reason,&mdash;that then the honour or the judgment-seat
                may be taken from the senate with ignominy and disgrace. It is not my fear for your
                good faith, O judges, which has urged me to lay these considerations before you at
                some length, but the new hopes which those men are entertaining; for when those
                hopes had brought Verres suddenly back from the gates of the city to this court,
                some men suspected that his intention had not been changed so suddenly without a
                cause. <milestone n="9" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="24" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>Now, in order that Hortensius may not be able to employ any new sort of complaint,
                and to say that a defendant is oppressed if the accuser says nothing about him; that
                nothing is so dangerous to the fortunes of an innocent man as for his adversaries to
                keep silence; and in order that he may not praise my abilities in a way which I do
                not like, when he says that, if I had said much, I should have relieved him against
                whom I was speaking, and that I have undone him because I said nothing,&mdash;I
                will comply with his wishes, I shall employ one long unbroken speech: not because it
                is necessary, but that I may try whether he will be most vexed at my having been
                silent then or at my speaking now. <milestone n="25" unit="section"/> Here you,
                perhaps, will take care that I do not remit one hour of the time allowed me by law.
                If I do not employ the whole time which is allowed me by law, you will complain; you
                will invoke the faith of gods and men, calling them to witness how Caius Verres is
                circumvented because the prosecutor will not speak as long as he is allowed to speak
                by the law. What the law gives me for my own sake, may I not be allowed to forbear
                using? For the time for stating the accusation is given me for my own sake, that I
                may be able to unfold my charges and the whole cause in my speech. If I do not use
                it all, I do you no injury, but I give up something of my own right and advantage.
                You injure me, says he, for the cause ought to be thoroughly investigated.
                Certainly, for otherwise a defendant cannot be condemned, however guilty he may be.
                Were you, then, indignant that anything should be done by me to make it less easy
                for him to be condemned? For if the cause be understood, many men may be acquitted;
                if it be not understood, no one can be condemned. <milestone n="26" unit="section"/>
                I injure him, it seems, for I take away the right of adjournment. The most vexatious
                thing that the law has in it, the allowing a cause to be twice pleaded, has either
                been instituted for my sake rather than for yours, or, at all events, not more for
                your sake than for mine. For if to speak twice be an advantage, certainly it is an
                advantage which is common to both If there is a necessity that he who has spoken
                last should be refuted, then it is for the sake of the prosecutor that the he has
                been established that there should be a second discussion. But, as I imagine,
                Glaucia first proposed the law that the defendant might have an adjournment; before
                that time the decision might either be given at once, or the judges might take time
                to consider. Which law, then, do you think the mildest? I think that ancient one, by
                which a man might either be acquitted quickly, or condemned after deliberation. I
                restore you that law of Acilius, according to which many men who have only been
                accused once, whose cause has only been pleaded once, in whose case witnesses have
                only been heard once, have been condemned on charges by no means so clearly proved,
                nor so flagitious as those on which you are convicted. Think that you are pleading
                your cause, not according to that severe law, but according to that most merciful
                one. I will accuse you; you shall reply. Having produced my witnesses, I will lay
                the whole matter before the bench in such a way, that even if the law gave them a
                power of adjournment, yet they shall think it discreditable to themselves not to
                decide at the first hearing. <milestone n="10" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="27"
                  unit="section"/></p>
              <p>But if it be necessary for the cause to be thoroughly investigated, has this one
                been investigated but superficially? Are we keeping back anything, O Hortensius, a
                trick which we have often seen practiced in pleading? Who ever attends much to the
                advocate in this sort of action, in which anything is said to have been carried off
                and stolen by any one? Is not all the expectation of the judges fixed on the
                documents or on the witnesses? I said in the first pleading that I would make it
                plain that Caius Verres had carried off four hundred thousand <foreign lang="la"
                  >sesterces</foreign> contrary to the law. What ought I to have said? Should I have
                pleaded more plainly if I had related the whole affair thus?&mdash;There was a
                certain man of Halesa, named Dio, who, when a great inheritance had come to his son
                from a relation while Sacerdos was praetor, had at the time no trouble nor dispute
                about it. Verres, as soon as he arrived in the province, immediately wrote letters
                from <placeName key="tgn,7003897">Messana</placeName>; he summoned Dio before him,
                he procured false witnesses from among his own friends to say that that inheritance
                had been forfeited to Venus Erycina. He announced that he himself would take
                cognisance of that matter. <milestone n="28" unit="section"/> I can detail to you
                the whole affair in regular order, and at last tell you what the result was, namely,
                that Dio paid a million of <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign>, in order to
                prevail in a cause of most undeniable justice, besides that Verres had his herds of
                mares driven away, and all his plate and embroidered vestments carried off. But
                neither while I was so relating these things, nor while you were denying them, would
                our speeches be of any great importance. At what time then would the judge prick up
                his ears and begin to strain his attention? When Dio himself came forward, and the
                others who had at that time been engaged in <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName> on Dio's business, when, at the very time when Dio was
                pleading his cause, he was proved to have borrowed money, to have galled in all that
                was owing to him, to have sold farms; when the accounts of respectable men were
                produced, when they who had supplied Dio with money said that they had heard at the
                time that the money was taken on purpose to be given to Verres; when the friends,
                and connections, and patrons of Dio, most honourable men, said that they had heard
                the same thing. <milestone n="29" unit="section"/> Then, when this was going on, you
                would, I suppose, attend as you did attend. Then the cause would seem to be going
                on. Everything was managed by me in the former pleading so that among all the
                charges there was not one in which any one of you desired an uninterrupted statement
                of the case. I deny that anything was said by the witnesses which was either obscure
                to any one of you, or which required the eloquence of any orator to set it off.
                  <milestone n="11" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>In truth, you must recollect that I conducted the case in this way; I set forth and
                detailed the whole charge at the time of the examination of witnesses, so that as
                soon as I had explained the whole affair, I then immediately examined the witnesses.
                And by that means, not only you, who have to judge, are in possession of our
                charges, but also the Roman people became acquainted with the whole accusation and
                the whole cause: although I am speaking of my own conduct as if I had done so of my
                own will rather than because I was induced to do so by any injustice of yours.
                  <milestone n="30" unit="section"/> But you interposed another accuser, who, when I
                had only demanded a hundred and ten days to prosecute my inquiries in <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, demanded a hundred and eight for himself to
                go for a similar purpose into <placeName key="tgn,7002733">Achaia</placeName>. When
                you had deprived me of the three months most suitable for conducting my cause, you
                thought that I would give you up the remainder of the year, so that, when he had
                employed the time allowed to me, you, O Hortensius, after the interruption of two
                festivals, might make your reply forty days afterwards; and then, that the time
                might be so spun out, that we might come from Marius Glabrio, the praetor, and from
                the greater part of these judges, to another praetor, and other judges. <milestone
                  n="31" unit="section"/> If I had not seen this&mdash;if every one, both
                acquaintances and strangers, had not warned me that the object which they were
                driving at, which they were contriving, for which they were striving, was to cause
                the matter to be delayed to that time&mdash;I suppose, if I had chosen to spend
                all the time allowed me in stating the accusation, I should be under apprehensions
                that I should not have charges enough to bring, that subjects for a speech would be
                wanting to me, that my voice and strength would fail me, that I should not be able
                to accuse twice a man whom no one had dared to defend at the first pleading of the
                cause. I made my conduct appear reasonable both to the judges and also to the Roman
                people. There is no one who thinks that their injustice and impudence could have
                been opposed by any other means. Indeed, how great would have been my folly, if,
                though I might have avoided it, I had allowed matters to come on on the day which
                they who had undertaken to deliver him from justice provided for in their
                undertaking, when they gave their undertaking to deliver him in these
                words&mdash;&ldquo;If the trial took place on or after the first of
                January?&rdquo; <milestone n="32" unit="section"/> Now I must provide for the
                careful management of the time which is allowed me for making a speech, since I am
                determined to state the whole case most fully. <milestone n="12" unit="chapter"

              <p>Therefore I will pass by that first act of his life, most infamous and most wicked
                as it was. He shall hear nothing from me of the vices and offences of his childhood,
                nothing about his most dissolute youth: how that youth was spent, you either
                remember, or else you can recognise it in the son whom he has brought up to be so
                like himself: I will pass over everything which appears shameful to be mentioned;
                and I will consider not only what that fellow ought to have said of himself, but
                also what it becomes me to say. Do you, I entreat you, permit this, and grant to my

                the licentious transactions which the estate of his father and his own age prompted
                him to shall be passed over in silence. He may have lived in all infamy at that time
                with impunity, as far as I am concerned; the rest of his life has been such that I

                /></p>
              <p>As quaestor you received our province by lot, according to the decree of the
                senate. A consular province fell to your lot, so that you were with Cnaeus Carbo,
                the consul, and had that province. There was at that time dissension among the
                citizens: and in that I am not going to say anything as to what part you ought to
                have taken. This only do I say, that at such a time as that you ought to have made
                up your mind which side you would take and which party you would espouse. Carbo was
                very indignant that there had fallen to his lot as his quaestor a man of such
                notorious luxury and indolence. But he loaded him with all sorts of kindnesses. Not
                to dwell too long on this; money was voted, was paid;<note anchored="yes">By vote or
                  the money was voted to the <foreign lang="la">tribuni aerarii</foreign>, and was
                  paid by them to the quaestor, to be paid by him to the army.</note> he went as
                quaestor to the province; he came into <placeName key="tgn,1000070"
                >Gaul</placeName>, where he had been for some time expected, to the army of the
                consul with the money. At the very first opportunity that offered, (take notice of
                the principle on which the man discharged the duties of his offices, and
                administered the affairs of the republic,) the quaestor, having embezzled the public
                money, deserted the consul, the army, and his allotted province. <milestone n="35"
                  unit="section"/> I see what I have done; he rouses himself up; he hopes that, in
                the instance of this charge, some breeze may be wafted this way of good will and
                approbation for those men to him the name of Cnaeus Carbo, though dead, is
                unwelcome, and to whom he hopes that that desertion and betrayal of his consul will
                prove acceptable. As if he had done it from any desire to take the part of the
                nobility, or from any party zeal, and had not rather openly pillaged the consul, the
                army and the province, and then, because of this most impudent theft, had run away.
                For such an action as that is obscure, and such that one may suspect that Caius
                Verres, because he could not bear new men, passed over to the nobility, that is, to
                his own party, and that he did nothing from consideration of money. <milestone

                in such a manner as this, he became one of Sulla's party in an instant, and not for
                the sake of contributing to the restoration of honour and dignity to the nobility.
                Even if you had deserted empty-handed, still your desertion would be decided to be
                wicked, your betrayal of your consul, infamous. Oh, Cnaeus Carbo was a bad citizen,
                a scandalous consul, a seditious man. He may have been so to others: when did he
                begin to be so to you? After he entrusted to you the money, the supplying of corn,
                all his accounts, and his army; for if he had displeased you before that, you would
                have done the same as Marcus Piso did the year after. When he had fallen by lot to
                Lucius Scipio, as consul, he never touched the money, he never joined the army at
                all. The opinions he embraced concerning the republic he embraced so as to do no
                violence to his own good faith, to the customs of our ancestors, nor to the
                obligations imposed on him by the lot which he had drawn. <milestone n="15"
                  unit="chapter"/><milestone n="38" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>In truth, if we wish to disturb all these things, and to throw them into confusion,
                we shall render life full of danger, intrigue, and enmity; if such allurements are
                to have no scruples to protect them; if the connection between men in prosperous and
                doubtful fortunes is to cause no friendship; if the customs and principles of our
                ancestors are to have no authority. He is the common enemy of all men who has once
                been the enemy of his own connections. No wise man ever thought that a traitor was
                to be trusted; Sulla himself, to whom the arrival of the fellow ought to have been
                most acceptable, removed him from himself and from his army: he ordered him to
                remain at <placeName key="perseus,Beneventum">Beneventum</placeName>, among those
                men whom he believed to be exceedingly friendly to his party, where he could do no
                harm to his cause and could have no influence on the termination of the war.
                Afterwards, indeed, he rewarded him liberally; he allowed him to seize some estates
                of men who had been proscribed lying in the territory of <placeName
                  key="perseus,Beneventum">Beneventum</placeName>; he loaded him with honour as a
                traitor; he put no confidence in him as a friend. <milestone n="39" unit="section"/>
                Now, although there are men who hate Cnaeus Carbo, though dead, yet they ought to
                think, not what they were glad to have happen, but what they themselves would have
                to fear in a similar case. This is a misfortune common to many a cause for alarm,
                and a danger common to many. There are no intrigues more difficult to guard against
                than those which are concealed under a pretence of duty, or under the name of some
                intimate connection. For you can easily avoid one who is openly an adversary, by
                guarding against him; but this secret, internal, and domestic evil not only exists,
                but even overwhelms you before you can foresee it or examine into it. Is it not so?
                  <milestone n="40" unit="section"/> When you were sent as quaestor to the army, not
                only as guardian of the money, but also of the consul; when you were the sharer in
                all his business and of all his counsels, when you were considered by him as one of
                his own children, according to the tenor of the principles of our ancestors; could
                you on a sudden leave him? desert him? pass over to the enemy? O wickedness! O
                monster to be banished to the very end of the world! For that nature which has
                committed such an atrocity as this cannot be contented with this one crime alone. It
                must be always contriving something of this sort; it must be occupied in similar
                audacity and perfidy. <milestone n="41" unit="section"/> Therefore, that same fellow
                whom Cnaeus Dolabella afterwards, when Caius Malleolus had been slain, had for his
                quaestor, (I know not whether this connection was not even a closer one than the
                connection with Carbo, and whether the consideration of his having been voluntarily
                chosen is not stronger than that of his having been chosen by lot,) behaved to
                Cnaeus Dolabella in the same manner as he had behaved in to Cnaeus Carbo. For, the
                charges which properly touched himself, he transferred to his shoulders; and gave
                information of everything connected with his cause to his enemies and accusers. He
                himself gave most hostile and most infamous evidence against the man to whom he had
                been lieutenant and pro-quaestor. Dolabella, unfortunate as he was, through his
                abominable betrayal, through his infamous and false testimony, was injured far more
                than by either, by the odium created by that fellow's own thefts and atrocities
                  <milestone n="16" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="42" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>What can you do with such a man? or what hope can you allow so perfidious, so
                ill-omened an animal to entertain? One who despised and trampled on the lot which
                bound him to Cnaeus Carbo, the choice which connected him with Cnaeus Dolabella, and
                not only deserted them both, but also betrayed and attacked them. Do not, I beg of
                you, O judges, judge of his crimes by the brevity of my speech rather than by the
                magnitude of the actions themselves. For I am forced to make haste in order to have
                time to set before you all the things which I have resolved to relate to you.
                Wherefore, now that his quaestorship has been put before you, saw that the
                dishonesty and wickedness of his first conduct in his first office has been
                thoroughly seen, listen, I pray you, to the remainder.<milestone n="43"
                  unit="section"/> And in this I will pass over that period of proscription and
                rapine which took place under Sulla; nor will I allow him to derive any argument for
                his own defence from that time of common calamity to all men. I will accuse him of
                nothing but his own peculiar and well-proved crimes. Therefore, omitting all mention
                of the time of Sulla from the accusation, consider that splendid lieutenancy of his.
                After <placeName key="tgn,7002470">Cilicia</placeName> was appointed to Cnaeus
                Dolabella as his province, O ye immortal gods! with what covetousness, with what
                incessant applications, did he force from him that lieutenancy for himself, which
                was indeed the beginning of the greatest calamity to Dolabella. For as he proceeded
                on his journey to the province, wherever he went his conduct was such, that it was
                not some lieutenant of the Roman people, but rather some calamity that seemed to be
                going through the country. <milestone n="17" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="44"

              <p>In <placeName key="tgn,7002733">Achaia</placeName>, (I will omit all minor things,
                to some of which perhaps some one else may some time or other have done something
                like; I will mention nothing except what is unprecedented, nothing except what would
                appear incredible, if it were alleged against any other criminal,) he demanded money
                from a Sicyonian magistrate. Do not let this be considered a crime in Verres; others
                have done the tame. When he could not give it, he punished him; a scandalous, but
                still not an unheard-of act. Listen to the sort of punishment; you will ask, of what
                race of men you are to think him a specimen. He ordered a fire to be made of green
                and damp wood in a narrow place. There he left a free man, a noble in his own
                country, an ally and friend of the Roman people, tortured with smoke, half dead.
                  <milestone n="45" unit="section"/> After that, what statues, what paintings he
                carried off from <placeName key="tgn,7002733">Achaia</placeName>, I will not mention
                at present. There is another part of my speech which I have reserved for speaking of
                this covetousness of the man. You have heard that at <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                  >Athens</placeName> a great sum of money was taken out of the temple of Minerva.
                This was mentioned in the trial of Cnaeus Dolabella. Mentioned? the amount too was
                stated. Of this design you will find that Caius Verres was not only a partaker, but
                was even the chief instigator. <milestone n="46" unit="section"/> He came to
                  <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName>. There from that most holy temple
                of Apollo he privately took away by night the most beautiful and ancient statues,
                and took care that they were all placed on board his own transport. The next day,
                when the inhabitants of <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName> saw their
                temple plundered, they were very indignant. For the holiness and antiquity of that
                temple is so great in their eyes, that they believe that Apollo himself was born in
                that place. However, they did not dare to say one word about it, lest haply
                Dolabella himself might be concerned in the business. <milestone n="18"
                  unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>Then on a sudden a very great tempest arose, O judges; so that Dolabella could not
                only not depart, when he wished, but could scarcely stand in the city, such vast
                waves were dashed on shore. Here that ship of that pirate loaded with the
                consecrated statues, being cast up and driven ashore by the waves, is broken to
                pieces. Those statues of Apollo were found on the shore; by command of Dolabella
                they are restored; the tempest is lulled; Dolabella departs from <placeName

                doubt, though there was no feeling of humanity ever in you, no regard for holiness,
                still that now in your fear and danger thoughts of your wicked actions occurred to
                you. Can there be any comfortable hope of safety cherished by you, when you
                recollect how impious, how wicked, how blasphemous has been your conduct towards the

                impious and sacrilegious hands on that temple, so ancient, so venerated, so holy? If
                you were not in your childhood taught and framed to learn and know what has been
                committed to writing, still would you not afterwards, when you came into the very

                temple? Was any covetousness of such power as to extinguish such solemn religious
                belief? And if you did not think of this at that time, do you not recollect even now

                too ancient, and long ago obsolete. For at that time all men were so uniformly
                disposed in the same manner, that this credit of eminent virtue and incorruptibility
                appears to belong, not only to those men, but also to those times. Publius
                Servilius, a most illustrious man, who has performed the noblest exploits, is
                present. He will deliver his opinion on your conduct. He, by his power, had forces;
                his wisdom and his valour took <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName>, an
                ancient city, and one strengthened and embellished in every possible manner. I am
                bringing forward recent example of a most distinguished man. For Servilius, as a
                general of the Roman people, took <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName>
                after you, as lieutenant of the quaestor in the same district, had taken care to
                harass and plunder all the cities of our friends and allies even when they were at
                peace. <milestone n="57" unit="section"/> The things which you carried off from the
                holiest temples with wickedness, and like a robber, we cannot see, except in your
                own houses, or in those of your friends. The statues and decorations which Publius
                Servilius brought away from the cities of our enemies, taken by his courage and
                valour, according to the laws of war and his own rights as commander-in-chief, he
                brought home for the Roman people; he carried them in his triumph, and took care
                that a description of them should be engraved on public tablets and hid up in the
                treasury. You may learn from public documents the industry of that most honourable
                man. Read&mdash;&ldquo;The accounts delivered by Publius
                Servilius.&rdquo; You see not only the number of the statues, but the size, the
                figure, and the condition of each one among them accurately described in writing.
                Certainly, the delight arising from virtue and from victory is much greater than
                that pleasure which is derived from licentiousness and covetousness. I say that
                Servilius took much more care to have the booty of the Roman people noted and
                described, than you took to have your plunder catalogued. <milestone n="22"
                  unit="chapter"/><milestone n="58" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>You will say that your statues and paintings were also an ornament to the city and
                forum of the Roman people. I recollect: I, together with the Roman people, saw the
                forum and place for holding the assemblies adorned with embellishments, in
                appearance indeed magnificent, but to one's senses and thoughts bitter and
                melancholy. I saw everything glittering with your thefts, with the plunder of the
                provinces, with the spoils of our allies and friends. At which time, O judges, that
                fellow conceived the hope of committing his other crimes. For he saw that these men,
                who wished to be called the masters of the courts of law, were slaves to these
                desires. <milestone n="59" unit="section"/> But the allies and foreign nations then
                first abandoned the hope of saving any of their property and fortunes, because, as
                it happened, there were at that time very many ambassadors from <placeName
                  key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7002733"
                  >Achaia</placeName> at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, who
                worshipped in the forum the images of the gods which had been taken from their
                temples. And so also, when they recognised the other statues and ornaments, they
                wept, as they beheld the different pieces of their property in different place. And
                from all those men we then used to hear discourses of this
                sort:&mdash;&ldquo;That it was impossible for any one to doubt of the ruin
                of our allies and friends, when men saw in the forum of the Roman people, in which
                formerly those men used to be accused and condemned who had done any injury to the
                allies, those things now openly placed which had been wickedly seized and taken away
                from the allies.&rdquo; <milestone n="60" unit="section"/> Here I do not expect
                that he will deny that he has many statues, and countless paintings. But, as I
                fancy, he is accustomed at times to say that he purchased these things which he
                seized and stole; since indeed he was sent at the public expense, and with the title
                of ambassador, into <placeName key="tgn,7002733">Achaia</placeName>, <placeName
                  key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, and <placeName key="tgn,7002611"

              <p>I have all the accounts both of that fellow and of his father, of money received,
                which I have most carefully read and arranged; those of your father, as long as he
                lived, you own, as far as you say that you have made them up. For in that man, O
                judges, you will find this new thing. We hear that some men have never kept
                accounts; which is a mistaken opinion of men with respect to Antonius; for he kept
                them most carefully. But there may be men of that sort, but they are by no means to
                be approved of. We hear that some men have not kept them from the beginning, but
                after some time have made them up; there is a way of accounting for this too. But
                this is unprecedented and absurd which this man gave us for an answer, when we
                demanded his account of him: &ldquo;That he kept them up to the consulship of
                Marcus Terentius and Caius Cassius; but that, after that, he gave up keeping
                them.&rdquo; <milestone n="61" unit="section"/> In another place we will
                consider what sort of a reply this is; at present I am not concerned with it; for of
                the times about which I am at present occupied I have the accounts, both yours and
                those of your father. You cannot deny that you carried off very many most beautiful
                statues, very many admirable paintings. I wish you would deny it. Show in your
                accounts or in those of your father that any one of them was purchased, and you have
                gained your cause. There is not even any possibility of your having bought those two
                most beautiful statues which are now standing in your court, and which stood for
                many years by the folding doors of the Samian Juno; these two, I say, which are now
                the only statues left in your house, which are waiting for the broker, left alone
                and deserted by the other statues. <milestone n="24" unit="chapter"/><milestone

              <p>But, I suppose in these matters alone had he this irrepressible and unbridled
                covetousness; his other desires were restrained by some reason and moderation. To
                how many noble virgins, to how many matrons do you think he offered violence in that
                foul and obscene lieutenancy? In what town did he set his foot that he did not leave
                more traces of his rapes and atrocities than he did of his arrival? But I will pass
                over everything which can be denied; even those things which are most certain and
                most evident I will omit; I will select one of his abominable deeds, in order that I
                may the more easily at last arrive at <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName>, which has imposed the burden of this business on me.

                  <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> for renown and for nobleness. And
                the citizens themselves of <placeName key="tgn,7002579">Lampsacus</placeName> are
                most especially kind to all Roman citizens, and also are an especially quiet and
                orderly race; almost beyond all the rest of the Greeks inclined to the most perfect
                ease, rather than to any disorder or tumult. It happened, when he had prevailed on
                Cnaeus Dolabella to send him to king Nicomedes and to king Sadala, and when he had
                begged this expedition, more with a view to his own gain than to any advantage for
                the republic, that in that journey he came to <placeName key="tgn,7002579"
                  >Lampsacus</placeName>, to the great misfortune and almost ruin of the city. He is
                conducted to the house of a man named Janitor as his host; and his companions also,
                are billeted on other entertainers. As was the fellow's custom, and as his lusts
                always instigating him to commit some wickedness prompted him, he immediately gives
                a commission to his companions, the most worthless and infamous of men, to inquire
                and find out whether there is any virgin woman worthy of his staying longer at

              <p>He had a companion of the name of Rubrius, a man made for such vices as his, who
                used to find out all these things for him wherever he went, with wonderful address.
                He brings him the following news,&mdash;that there was a man of the name of
                Philodamus, in birth, in rank, in wealth, and in reputation by far the first man
                among the citizens of <placeName key="tgn,7002579">Lampsacus</placeName>; that his
                daughter, who was living with her father because she had not yet got a husband, was
                a woman of extraordinary beauty, but was also considered exceedingly modest and
                virtuous. The fellow, when he heard this, was so inflamed with desire for that which
                he had not only not seen himself, but which even he from whom he heard of it had not
                seen himself, that he said he should like to go to Philodamus immediately. Janitor,
                his host, who suspected nothing, being afraid that he must have given him some
                offence himself, endeavoured with all his might to detain him. Verres, as he could
                not find any pretext for leaving his host's house began to pave his way for his
                meditated violence by other steps. He says that Rubrius, his most loved friend, his
                assistant in all such matters, and the partner of his counsels, is lodged with but
                little comfort. He orders him to be conducted to the house of Philodamus. <milestone
                  n="65" unit="section"/> But when this is reported to Philodamus, although he was
                ignorant what great misfortune was at that moment being contrived for him and for
                his children, still he comes to him,&mdash;represents to him that that is not
                his office,&mdash;that when it was his turn to receive guests, he was accustomed
                to receive the praetors and consuls themselves, and not the attendants of
                lieutenants. Verres, as he was hurried on by that one desire alone, disregarded all
                his demands and allegations, and ordered Rubrius to be introduced by force into the
                house of a man who had a right to refuse him admittance. <milestone n="26"
                  unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>On this, Philodamus, when he could not preserve his rights, studied at least to
                preserve his courtesy and affability. He who had always been considered most
                hospitable and most friendly towards our people, did not like to appear to have
                received even this fellow Rubrius into his house unwillingly; he prepares a banquet
                magnificently and luxuriously, being, as he was, among the richest of all his fellow
                citizens; he begs Rubrius to invite whoever were agreeable to himself; to leave, if
                he pleased, just room for himself alone. He even sends his own son, a most excellent
                youth, out to one of his relations to supper. <milestone n="66" unit="section"/>
                Rubrius invites Verres's companions; Verres informs them all what there was to be
                done. They come early. They sit down to supper. Conversation takes place among them,
                and an invitation is given to drink in the Greek fashion. The host encourages them;
                they demand wine in larger goblets; the banquet proceeds with the conversation and
                joy of every one. When the business appeared to Rubrius to have got warm enough,
                &ldquo;I would know of you, O Philodamus,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;why you
                do not bid your daughter to be invited in hither to us?&rdquo; The man, who was
                both a most dignified man, and of mature age, and a parent, was amazed at the speech
                of the rascal. Rubrius began to urge it. Then he, in order to give some answer, said
                that it was not the custom of the Greeks for women to sit down at the banquets of
                men. On this some one else from some other part of the room cried out,
                &ldquo;But this is not to be borne; let the women be summoned.&rdquo; And
                immediately Rubrius orders his slaves to shut the door, and to stand at the doors
                themselves. <milestone n="67" unit="section"/> But when Philodamus perceived that
                what was intended and being prepared was, that violence should be offered to his
                daughter, he calls his servants to him, he bids them disregard him and defend his
                daughter, and orders some one to run out and bear the news to his son of this
                overpowering domestic misfortune. Meantime an uproar arises throughout the whole
                house; a fight takes place between the slaves of Rubrius and his host. That noble
                and most honourable man is buffeted about in his own house; every one fights for his
                own safety. At last Philodamus has a quantity of boiling water thrown over him by
                Rubrius himself. When the news of this is brought to the son, half dead with alarm
                he instantly hastens home to bring aid to save the life of his father and the
                modesty of his sister. All the citizens of <placeName key="tgn,7002579"
                  >Lampsacus</placeName>, with the same spirit, the moment they heard of it, because
                both the worth of Philodamus and the enormity of the injury excited them, assembled
                by night at his house. At this time Cornelius, the lictor of Verres, who had been
                placed with his slaves by Rubrius, as if on guard, for the purpose of carrying off
                the woman, is slain; some of the slaves are wounded; Rubrius himself is wounded in
                the crowd. Verres, when he saw such an uproar excited by his own cupidity, began to
                wish to escape some way or other if he could. <milestone n="27" unit="chapter"

              <p>The next morning men come early to the public assembly; they ask what is best to be
                done; every one delivered his own opinions to the people according as each
                individual had the most weight. No one was found whose opinion and speech was not to
                this purpose:&mdash;&ldquo;That it need not be feared, if the Lampsacenes
                had avenged that man's atrocious wickedness by force and by the sword, that the
                senate and Roman people would have thought they ought to chastise their city. And if
                the lieutenants of the Roman people were to establish this law with respect to the
                allies, and to foreign nations,&mdash;that they were not to be allowed to
                preserve the chastity of their children unpolluted by their lusts, it was better to
                endure anything rather than to live in a state of such violence and
                bitterness.&rdquo; <milestone n="69" unit="section"/> As all were of this
                opinion, and as every one spoke in this tenor, as his own feelings and indignation
                prompted each individual, all immediately proceeded towards the house where Verres
                was staying. They began to beat the door with stones, to attack it with weapons, to
                surround it with wood and faggots, and to apply fire to it. Then the Roman citizens
                who were dwelling as traders at <placeName key="tgn,7002579">Lampsacus</placeName>
                run together to the spot; they entreat the citizens of <placeName key="tgn,7002579"
                  >Lampsacus</placeName> to allow the name of the lieutenancy to have more weight
                with them than the insult of the lieutenant; they say that they were well aware that
                he was an infamous and wicked man, but as he had not accomplished what he had
                attempted, and as he was not going to be at <placeName key="tgn,7002579"
                  >Lampsacus</placeName> any longer, their error in sparing a wicked man would be
                less than that of not sparing a lieutenant. <milestone n="70" unit="section"/> And
                so that fellow, far more wicked and infamous than even the notorious Hadrian, <note

                  the younger Marius and Carbo, A.U.C. 672.</note> was a good deal more fortunate.
                He, because Roman citizens could not tolerate his avarice, was burnt alive at
                  <placeName key="tgn,7018163">Utica</placeName> in his own house; and that was
                thought to have happened to him so deservedly, that all men rejoiced, and no
                punishment was inflicted for the deed. This man, scorched indeed though he was by
                the fire made by our allies, yet escaped from those flames and that danger; and has
                not even yet been able to imagine what he had done, or what had happened to bring
                him into such great danger. For he cannot say:&mdash;&ldquo;When I was
                trying to put down a sedition, when I was ordering corn, when I was collecting money
                for the soldiers, when in short I was doing something or other for the sake of the
                republic, because I gave some strict order, because I punished some one, because I
                threatened some one, all this happened.&rdquo; Even if he were to say so, still
                he ought not to be pardoned, if he seemed to have been brought into such great
                danger through issuing too savage commands to our allies. <milestone n="28"

              <p>Now when he neither dares himself to allege any such cause for the tumult as being
                true, nor even to invent such a falsehood, but when a most temperate man of his own
                order, who at that time was in attendance on Caius Nero, Publius Tettius, says that
                he too heard this same account at <placeName key="tgn,7002579"
                >Lampsacus</placeName>, (a man most accomplished in everything, Caius Varro, who was

                says that be heard this very same story from Philodamus,) can you doubt that fortune
                was willing, not so much to save him from that danger, as to reserve him for your
                judgment! Unless, indeed, he will say, as indeed Hortensius did say, interrupting
                Tettius while he was giving his evidence in the former pleading (at which time
                indeed he gave plenty of proof that, if there were anything which he could say, he
                could not keep silence; so that we may all feel sure that, while he was silent in
                the other matters that were alleged, he was so because he had nothing to say); he at
                that time said this, that Philodamus and his son had been condemned by Caius Nero.
                  <milestone n="72" unit="section"/> About which, not to make a long speech, I will
                merely say that Nero and his bench of judges came to that decision on the ground
                that it was plain that Cornelius, his lictor, had been slain, and that they thought
                it was not right that any one, even while avenging his own injuries, should have the
                power to kill a man. And as to this I see that you were not by Nero's sentence
                acquitted of atrocity, but that they were convicted of murder. And yet what sort of
                a conviction was that? Listen, I entreat you, O judges, and do sometimes pity our
                allies, and show that they ought to have, and that they have, some protection in
                your integrity. <milestone n="29" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>Because the man appeared to all <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> to
                have been lawfully slain, being in name indeed his lictor, but in reality the
                minister of his most profligate desires, Verres feared that Philodamus would be
                acquitted by the sentence of Nero. He begs and entreats Dolabella to leave his own
                province, to go to Nero; he shows that he himself cannot be safe if Philodamus be
                allowed to live and at any time to come to <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
                  >Rome</placeName>. <milestone n="73" unit="section"/> Dolabella was moved; he did
                what many blamed, in leaving his army, his province, and the war, and in going into
                  <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, into the province of another
                magistrate, for the sake of a most worthless man. After he came to Nero, he urged
                him to take cognisance of the cause of Philodamus. He came himself to sit on the
                bench, and to be the first to deliver his opinion. He had brought with him also his
                prefects, and his military tribunes, all of whom Nero invited to take their places
                on the bench On that bench also was that most just judge Verres himself. There were
                some Romans also, creditors of some of the Greeks, to whom the favour of any
                lieutenant, be he ever so infamous, is of the greatest influence in enabling them to
                get in their money.<milestone n="74" unit="section"/> The unhappy prisoner could
                find no one to defend him; for what citizen was there who was not under the
                influence of Dolabella? what Greek who was not afraid of his power and authority?
                And then is assigned as the accuser a Roman citizen, one of the creditors of the
                Lampsacenes; and if he would only say what that fellow ordered him to say, he was to
                be enabled to compel payment of his money from the people, by the aid of that same
                Verres's lictors. When all these thing; were conducted with such zeal, and with such
                resources; when many were accusing that unhappy man, and no one was defending him;
                and when Dolabella, with his prefects, was taking an eager part on the bench; when
                Verres kept saying that his fortunes were at stake&mdash;when he also gave his
                evidence&mdash;when he also was sitting on the bench&mdash;when he also had
                provided the accuser; when all this was done, and when it was clear that the man had
                been slain, still, so great was the weight which the consideration of bat fellow's
                injury had, so great was his iniquity thought, that the case of Philodamus was
                adjourned for further inquiry. <milestone n="30" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="75"

              <p>Why need I now speak of the energy of Cnaeus Dolabella at the second hearing of the
                cause,&mdash;of his tears of his agitation of body and minds? Why need I
                describe the mind of Caius Nero,&mdash;a most virtuous and innocent man, but
                still on some occasions too timid and low spirited?&mdash;who in that emergency
                had no idea what to do, unless, perchance (as every one wished him to do), to settle
                the matter without the intervention of Verres and Dolabella. Whatever had been done
                without their intervention all men would approve; but, as it was, the sentence which
                was given was thought not to have been pronounced judicially by Nero, but to have
                been extorted by Dolabella. For Philodamus and his son are convicted by a few votes:
                Dolabella is present; urges and presses Nero to have them executed as speedily as
                possible, in order that as few as may be may bear of that man's nefarious
                wickedness. <milestone n="76" unit="section"/> There is exhibited in the
                market-place of <placeName key="tgn,7002280">Laodicea</placeName> a spectacle
                bitter, and miserable, and grievous to the whole province of <placeName
                  key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>&mdash;an aged parent led forth to
                punishment, and on the other side a son; the one because he had defended the
                chastity of his children, the other because he had defended the life of his father
                and the fair fame of his sister. Each was weeping,&mdash;the father, not for his
                own execution, but for that of his son; the son for that of his father. How many
                tears do you think that Nero himself sheds? How great do you think was the weeping
                of all Asia? How great the groans and lamentations of the citizens of <placeName
                  key="tgn,7002579">Lampsacus</placeName>, that innocent men, nobles, allies and
                friends of the Roman people, should be put to death by public execution, on account
                of the unprecedented wickedness and impious desires of one most profligate man?
                  <milestone n="77" unit="section"/> After this, O Dolabella, no one can pity either
                you or your children, whom you have left miserable, in beggary and solitude. Was
                Verres so dear to you, that you should wish the disappointment of his lust to be
                expiated by the blood of innocent men? Did you leave your army and the enemy, in
                order by your own power and cruelty to diminish the dangers of that most wicked man?
                For, had you expected him to be an everlasting friend to you, because you had
                appointed him to act as your quaestor? Did you not know, that Cnaeus Carbo, the
                consul whose real quaestor he had been, had not only been deserted by him, but had
                also been deprived of his resources and his money, and nefariously attacked and
                betrayed by him? Therefore, you too experienced his perfidy when he joined your
                enemies,&mdash;when he, himself a most guilty man, gave most damaging evidence
                against you&mdash;when he refused to give in his accounts to the treasury unless

                you see, whatever you hear, whatever you desire, whatever you think of, is in a

                are the cities of our allies and friends to be forced to have recourse to violence
                and to arms, in order to be able to repel from themselves and from their children
                the wickedness and lust of a lieutenant of the Roman people? For I ask of you, were
                you besieged at <placeName key="tgn,7002579">Lampsacus</placeName>? Did that
                multitude begin to burn the house in which you were staying? Did the citizens of

                the Roman people alive? You cannot deny it; for I have your own evidence which you
                gave before Nero,&mdash;I have the letters which you sent to him. Recite the
                passage from his evidence. <milestone n="79" unit="section"/> [The evidence of Caius
                Verres against Artemidorus is read.] Recite the passages out of Verres's letters to

                allies of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>? For I see, and, from those
                things which I have read and heard, I am sure, that, if in any city a lieutenant of
                the Roman people has been, not only besieged, not only attacked with fire and sword,
                by violence, and by armed forces, but even to some extent actually injured, unless
                satisfaction be publicly made for the insult, war is invariably declared and waged
                against that city. <milestone n="80" unit="section"/> What, then, was the cause why
                the whole city of the Lampsacenes ran, as you write yourself, from the assembly to
                your house? For neither in the letters which you sent to Nero, nor in your evidence,
                do you mention any reason for so important a disturbance. You say that you were
                besieged, that fire was applied to your house, that faggots were put round it; you
                say that your lictor was slain; you say that you did not dare appear in the public
                streets; but the cause of all this alarm you conceal. For if Rubrius had done any
                injury to any one on his own account, and not at your instigation and for the
                gratification of your desires, they would rather have come to you to complain of the
                injury done by your companion, than have come to besiege you. As, therefore, he
                himself has concealed what the cause of that disturbance was, and as the witnesses
                produced by us have related it, do not both their evidence and his own continued
                silence prove the reason to be that which we have alleged? <milestone n="32"

                fortune our subjects, by inclination our suppliants&mdash;so that it is evident
                to all men, that unless the bitterness of the injury and the enormity of the
                wickedness had been such that the Lampsacenes thought it better to die than to
                endure it, they never would have advanced to such a pitch as to be more influenced

                to such a refuge as that; and they must of necessity have recourse to it, unless you

                Philodamus and his son were condemned. What if I show, if I make it evident, by the

                matter,&mdash;by the evidence of you yourself,&mdash;that you yourself
                transferred the reason of this siege laid to you, and the blame of it, to others?
                and that those whom you had accused were not punished? Then the decision of Nero
                will do you but little good. Recite the letters which he sent to Nero. [The letter

                you?&mdash;how does the conviction of Philodamus? Though you, a lieutenant, had
                been besieged, and when, as you yourself write to Nero, a notorious injury had been
                done to the Roman people, and to the common cause of all lieutenants, you did not
                prosecute. You said that you intended to prosecute at some other time When was that
                time? When have you prosecuted? Why have you taken so much from the rights of a
                lieutenant's rank? Why have you abandoned and betrayed the cause of the Roman
                people? Why have you passed over your own injuries, involved as they were in the
                public injury? Ought you not to have brought the cause before the senate? to have

                and with indignation, still I shall pass them all over, and reserve them for another
                time to be proved by evidence. At present listen to this which cannot possibly be

                this city. The citizens are, indeed, obedient to the command, as long as they are
                present who give the command. As soon as they are gone, they not only set down that

                  >Asia</placeName> had done, each in proportion to its amount of taxation Wherefore
                they entered on their public records, that one of the ten had been lost, not by the

              <p>When Caius Malleolus, the quaestor of Dolabella, had been slain, he thought that
                two inheritances had come to him; one, that of his quaestorian office, for he was
                immediately desired by Dolabella to be his proquaestor; the other, of a
                guardianship, for as he was appointed guardian of the young Malleolus, he
                immediately invaded his property. <milestone n="91" unit="section"/> For Malleolus
                had started for his province so splendidly equipped that he left actually nothing
                behind him at home. Besides, he had put out a great deal of money among the
                provincials, and had taken bills from them. He had taken with him a great quantity
                of admirably embossed silver plate. For he, too, was a companion of that fellow
                Verres in that disease and in that covetousness; and so he left behind him at his
                death a great quantity of silver plate, a great household of slaves, many workmen,
                many beautiful youths. That fellow seized all the plate that took his fancy; carried
                off all the slaves he chose; carried off the wines and all the other things which
                are procured most easily in <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, which he
                had left behind: the rest he sold, and took the money himself. <milestone n="92"
                  unit="section"/> Though it was plain that he had received two million, five
                hundred thousand <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign>, when he returned to
                  <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, he rendered no account to his
                ward, none to his ward's mother, none to his fellow-guardians; though he had the
                servants of his ward, who were workmen, at home, and beautiful and accomplished
                slaves about him, he said that they were his own,&mdash;that he had bought them.
                When the mother and grandmother of the boy repeatedly asked him if he would neither
                restore the mosey nor render an account, at least to say how much money of
                Malleolus's he had received, being wearied with their importunities, at last he
                said, a million of <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign>. Then on the last line of
                his accounts, he put in a name at the bottom by a most shameless erasure; he put
                down that he had paid to Chrysogonus, a slave, six hundred thousand <foreign
                  lang="la">sesterces</foreign> which he had received for his ward Malleolus. How
                out of a million they became six hundred thousand; how the six hundred thousand
                tallied so exactly with other accounts,&mdash;that of the money belonging to
                Cnaeus Carbo there was also a remainder of six hundred thousand <foreign lang="la"
                  >sesterces</foreign>; and how it was that they were put down as paid to
                Chrysogonus; why that name occurred on the bottom line of the page, and after an
                erasure, you will judge. <milestone n="93" unit="section"/> Yet, though he had
                entered in his accounts six hundred thousand <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign>
                as having been received, he has never paid over fifty thousand. Of the slaves, since
                he has been prosecuted in this manner, some have been restored, some are detained
                even now. All the gains which they had made, and all their substitutes <note
                  anchored="yes">&ldquo;As slaves often acted as factors or agents for their
                  masters in matters of business, and, as such, were often entrusted with property
                  to a large amount, there arose a practice of allowing the slave to consider part
                  of the gains as his own; this was his <foreign lang="la">peculium</foreign> ....
                  According to strict law the <foreign lang="la">peculium</foreign> was the property

                under his power and in subjection. Being a young man, when in prosecuting his
                inquiries he ascertained the numerous robberies and iniquities of that man, he acted
                skillfully and warily. He showed him a huge volume full of his exploits; he got from
                the fellow all he wanted against Dolabella. He brought him forward as a witness; the

                themselves from the danger of actions, and from a connection with his crimes. I
                rejected the voluntary offers of all of them. There was not only no room for a
                traitor, there was none even for a deserter in my camp. Perhaps they are to be
                considered better accusers than I, who do all these things; but I wish the defender
                of others to be praised in my person, not the accuser. He does not dare bring in his
                accounts to the treasury before Dolabella is condemned. He prevails on the senate to
                grant him an adjournment; because he said that his account-books had been sealed up
                by the accusers of Dolabella; just as if he had not the power of copying them. This
                man is the only man who never renders accounts to the treasury. <milestone n="39"

              <p>You have heard the accounts of his quaestorship rendered in three lines; but no
                accounts of his lieutenancy, till he was condemned and banished who alone could
                detect any error in them. The accounts of his praetorship, which, according to the
                decree of the senate, he ought to have rendered immediately on leaving office, he
                has not rendered to this very day. <milestone n="99" unit="section"/> He said that
                he was waiting for the quaestors to appear in the senate; just as if a praetor could
                not give in his accounts without the quaestor, in the same way as the quaestor does
                without the praetor, (as you did, Hortensius, and as all have done.) He said that
                Dolabella obtained the same permission. The omen pleased the conscript fathers
                rather than the excuse; they admitted it. But now the quaestors have arrived some
                time. Why have you not rendered them now? Among the accounts of that infamous
                lieutenancy and pro-quaestorship of yours, those items occur which are necessarily
                set down also in the accounts of Dolabella. (An extract is read of the account of
                the damages assessed against Dolabella, praetor of the Roman people, for money
                received.) <note anchored="yes">Hottomann makes sure that there is some corruption
                  of the MS. here, and Graevius agrees with him. &ldquo;The whole passage is
                  very obscure and the more difficult because we are not acquainted with the forms
                  of proceeding which were followed against magistrates convicted of extortion. It
                  is not clear, as far as appears from Cicero's speech, that, though there was a
                  discrepancy between the accounts of Verres and that of Dolabella, the fault was
                  necessarily in the accounts of Verres; especially as Dolabella had been justly
                  convicted of extortion and malversation already. Undoubtedly Cicero produced
                  witnesses who assisted to put the case in the point of view in which he wished it
                  to be looked at.&rdquo;&mdash;Desmenorius.</note>
                <milestone n="100" unit="section"/> The sum which Dolabella entered to Verres as
                having been received from him, is less than the sum which Verres has entered as

                  >sesterces</foreign>. The sum which Dolabella made out that Verres received less
                than he has put down in his account-books, is two hundred and thirty-two thousand
                  <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign>. Dolabella also made out that on account of
                corn he had received one million and eight hundred thousand <foreign lang="la"
                  >sesterces</foreign>; as to which you, O most incorruptible man, had quite a
                different entry in your account-books. Hence it is that those extraordinary gains of
                yours have accumulated, which we are examining into without any guide, article by

                speak after long consideration. In dealing with which, I do not doubt that I may not
                be able to avoid and escape from some blame on the ground of negligence. For many
                will say, &ldquo;He said nothing of the transaction at which I was present; he
                never touched upon that injury which was done to me, or to my friend, transactions

                over many things, but because I wish to reserve some points till I produce the
                witnesses, and because I think it necessary to omit some altogether with a view to
                brevity, and to the time my speech must take. I will confess too, though against my
                will, that, as he never allowed any moment of time to pass free from crime, I have
                not been able to ascertain fully every iniquity which has been committed by him.
                Therefore I beg you to listen to me with respect to the crimes of his praetorship,
                expecting only to hear those mentioned, both in the matters of deciding law-suits
                and of insisting on the repair of public buildings, which are thoroughly worthy of a
                criminal whom it is not worth while to accuse of any small or ordinary offences.

              <p>Publius Annius Asellus died while Caius Sacerdos was praetor. As he had an only
                daughter, and as he was not included in the census, <note anchored="yes"
                  >&ldquo;By the <foreign lang="la">lex Voconia</foreign> it was enacted, that
                  no person who should be included in the census, after the census of that year, BC
                    <date value="-169">169</date>, should make any female his heir. Cicero does not
                  state that the <foreign lang="la">Lex</foreign> fixed the census at any sum; but
                  it appears from other writers that a woman could not be made <foreign lang="la"
                    >haeres</foreign> by any person who was rated in the census at a hundred
                  thousand <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign>. The Lex only applied to girls,
                  and therefore a daughter or other female could inherit <foreign lang="la">ab
                    intestato</foreign> to any amount. The Vestal virgins could make women their
                    <foreign lang="la">haeredes</foreign> in all cases, which was the only exception
                  to the provisions of the law. If the terms of the law are correctly reported by
                  Cicero, a person who was not <foreign lang="la">census</foreign> might make a
                  woman his <foreign lang="la">haeres</foreign> whatever was the amount of his
                  property. Still there is a difficulty about the meaning of <foreign lang="la"
                    >census</foreign>. If it is taken to mean that a person whose property was above
                  a hundred thousand <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign>, and who was not
                  included in the census, could dispose of his property as he pleased by will, the
                  purpose of the law would be frustrated and further, the &ldquo;not being
                  included in the census&rdquo; (<foreign lang="la">neque census
                  esset</foreign>) seems rather vague. Another provision of the law, mentioned by
                  Cicero, forbade a person who was <foreign lang="la">census</foreign> to give more
                  in amount in the form of a legacy or a <foreign lang="la">donatio mortis
                    causu</foreign> to any person than the <foreign lang="la">haeres</foreign> or
                    <foreign lang="la">haeredes</foreign> should take.&rdquo;&mdash;Smith,

                  reference to this passage.</note> he did what nature prompted, and what no law
                forbade,&mdash;he appointed his daughter heiress of all his property. His
                daughter was his heiress. Everything made for the orphan; the equity of the law, the
                wish of the father, the edicts of the praetors, the usage of the law which existed
                at the time that Asellus died. <milestone n="105" unit="section"/> That fellow,
                being praetor elect, (whether being instigated by others, or being tempted by
                circumstances, or whether, from the instinctive sagacity which he has in such
                matters, he came of his own accord to this rascality, without any prompter, without
                any informer, I know not; you only know the audacity and insanity of the man,)
                appeals to Lucius Annius as the heir, (who indeed was appointed heir after the
                daughter,) for I cannot be persuaded that Verres was appealed to by him; he says
                that he can give him the inheritance by an edict; he instructs the man in what can
                be done. To the one the property appeared desirable, the other thought that he could
                sell it. Verres, although he is of singular audacity, still sent privately to the
                young girl's mother; he preferred taking money for not issuing any new edict, to
                interposing so shameful and inhuman a decree. <milestone n="106" unit="section"/>
                Her guardians, if they gave money to the praetor in the name of their ward,
                especially if it were a huge sum, did not see how they could enter it in their
                accounts; did not see how they could give it except at their own risk; and at the
                same time they did not believe that he would be so wicked. Being often applied to,
                they refused. I pray you, take notice, how equitable a decree he issued at the will
                of the man to whom he was giving the inheritance of which the children were robbed.
                &ldquo;As I understand that the <foreign lang="la">Lex Voconia</foreign> ...
                &rdquo; Who would ever believe that Verres would be an adversary of women? or
                did he do something contrary to the interests of women, in order that the whole
                edict might not appear to have been drawn up at the will of Chelidon. He wishes, he
                says, to oppose the covetousness of men. Oh, certainly. Who, not only in the present
                age, but even in the times of our ancestors, was ever so far removed from
                covetousness? Recite what comes next, I beg; for the gravity of the man, his
                knowledge of the law, and his authority delight me. &ldquo;Who, since the
                censorship of Aulus Postumius and Quintus Fulvius, has made, or shall have
                made....&rdquo; Has made, or shall have made! who ever issued an edict in such a
                manner? <milestone n="107" unit="section"/> Who ever proposed by an edict any
                penalty or danger for an act which could not be provided for otherwise either before
                the edict or after the edict? <milestone n="42" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>Publius Annius had made his will in accordance with law, with the statutes, with
                the authority of all who were consulted; a will neither improper, nor made in
                disregard of any duty, nor contrary to human nature. But even if he had made such a
                will as that, still, after his death no new law ought to have been enacted which
                should have any effect on his will. I suppose the Voconian law pleased you greatly?
                You should have imitated Quintus Voconius himself, who did not by his law take away
                her inheritance from any female whether virgin or matron, but established a law for
                the future, that no one who after the year of the existing censors should be
                enrolled in the census, should make either virgin or matron his heir. <milestone
                  n="108" unit="section"/> In the Voconian law, there is no &ldquo;has made or
                shall have made.&rdquo; Nor in any law is time past ever implicated in blame,
                except in cases which are of their own nature wicked and nefarious, so that, even if
                there were no law, they would be strenuously to be avoided. And in these cases we
                see that many things are established by law in such a way that things done
                previously cannot be called in question&mdash;the Cornelian law the law about
                testaments, the law about money, and many others, in which no new law is established
                in the nation, but it is established that what has always been an evil action shall
                be liable to public prosecution up to a certain time. <milestone n="109"
                  unit="section"/> But if any one establishes any new regulation on any points of
                civil law, does he allow everything which has been previously done to remain
                unaltered? Look at the Atinian law, at the Furian law, at the Voconian law itself,
                as I said before; in short, at every law on the subject of civil rights; you will
                find in all of them that regulations are established which are only to come into
                operation after the passing of the law. Those who attribute the greatest importance
                to the edict, say that the edict of the praetor is an annual law. You embrace more
                in an edict than you can in a law. If the first of January puts an end to the edict
                of the praetor, why does not the edict have its birth also on the first of January?
                Or, is it the case that no one can advance forward by his edict into the year when
                another man is to be praetor, but that he may retire back into the year when another
                man has been praetor? And if you had published this edict for the sake of right, and
                not for the sake of one man, you would have composed it more carefully. <milestone
                  n="43" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="110" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>You write, &ldquo;If any one has made, or shall have made his
                heir......&rdquo; What are we to think? Suppose a man has bequeathed in legacies
                more than comes to his heir or heirs, as by the Voconian law a man may do who is not
                included in the census? Why do you not guard against this, as it comes under the
                same class? Because in your expressions you are not thinking of the interests of a
                class, but of an individual; so that it is perfectly evident that you were
                influenced by a desire for money. And if you had issued this edict with only a
                prospective operation, it would have been less iniquitous; still it would have been
                scandalous: but in that case, though it might have been blamed, it could not have
                been doubted about, for no one would have broken it. Now it is an edict of such a
                sort, that any one can see that it was written, not for the people, but for the
                second heir of Publius Annius. <milestone n="111" unit="section"/> Therefore, though
                that heading had been embellished by you with so many words, and with that mercenary
                preamble, was any praetor found afterwards to draw up an edict in similar style? Not
                only no one ever did publish such an edict, but no one was ever apprehensive even of
                any one publishing such an edict. For after your praetorship many people made wills
                in the same manner, and among them Annia did so lately. She, by the advice of many
                of her relations, being a wealthy woman, because she was not included in the census,
                by her will made her daughter her heiress. This, now, is great proof of men's
                opinion of the singular wickedness of that fellow, that, though Verres had
                established this of his own accord, yet no one was apprehensive that any one could
                be found to adopt the rule which he had laid down. For you alone were found to be a
                man who could not be satisfied with correcting the wills of the living, unless you
                also rescinded those of the dead. <milestone n="112" unit="section"/> You yourself
                removed this clause from your Sicilian edict. You wished, if any matters arose
                unexpectedly, to decide them according to your edict as praetor of the city. The
                defence which you left yourself afterwards you yourself greatly injured, when you
                yourself, in your provincial edict, repudiated your own authority. <milestone n="44"

              <p>And I do not doubt that as this action appears bitter and unworthy to me, to whom
                my daughter is very dear, it appears so also to each one of you who is influenced by
                a similar feeling and love for his daughters. For what has nature ordained to be
                more agreeable and more dear to us? What is more worthy to have all our affections
                and all our indulgence expended upon it? <milestone n="113" unit="section"/> O most
                infamous of men, why did you do so great an injury to Publius Annius after death?
                Why did you cause such indelible grief to his ashes and bones, as to take from his
                children the property of their father given to then? by the will of their father in
                accordance with the law and with the statutes, and to give them to whomsoever you
                pleased? Shall the praetor be able, when we are dead, to take away our property and
                our fortunes from those to whom we give them while alive? He says, &ldquo;I will
                neither give any right of petition, nor possession.&rdquo; Will you, then, take
                away from a young girl her purple-bordered robe? Will you take away, not only the
                ornaments of her fortune, but those also denoting her noble birth? Do we marvel that
                the citizens of <placeName key="tgn,7002579">Lampsacus</placeName> flew to arms
                against that man? Do we marvel that when he was leaving his province, he fled
                secretly from <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> as if we were
                as indignant at what happens to others as at our own injury there would not be a
                relic of that man left to appear in the forum. <milestone n="114" unit="section"/>
                The father gives to his daughter: you forbid it. The laws allow it: yet you
                interpose your authority. He gives to her of his own property in such a manner as
                not to infringe any law. What do you find to blame in that? Nothing, I think. But I
                allow you to do so. Forbid it if you can; if you can find any one to listen to you;
                if any one can possibly obey your order. Will you take away their will from the
                dead,&mdash;their property from the living,&mdash;their rights from all men?
                Would not the Roman people have avenged itself by force if it had not reserved you
                for this occasion and for this trial? Since the establishment of the praetorian
                power, we have always adopted this principle,&mdash;that if no will was
                produced, then possession was given to that person who would have had the best right
                to be the heir, if the deceased had died intestate. Why this is the most righteous
                principle it is easy to show; but in a matter so established by precedent it is
                sufficient to point out that all men had previously laid down the law in this way,
                and that this was the ancient and customary edict. <milestone n="45" unit="chapter"
                  /><milestone n="115" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>Listen to another new edict of the fellow in a case of frequent occurrence; and
                then, while there is any place where civil law can be learnt, pray send all the
                youths of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> to his lectures. The genius
                of the man is marvellous; his prudence is marvellous. A man of the name of Minucius
                died while he was praetor. He left no will. By law his inheritance passed to the
                Minucian family. If Verres had issued the edict which all praetors both before and
                after him did issue, possession would have been given to the Minucian family. If any
                thought himself heir by will, though no will was known, he might proceed by law to
                put forward his claim to the inheritance; or if he had taken security for the claim,
                and given security, he then proceeded to try an action for his inheritance. This is
                the law which, as I imagine, both our ancestors and we ourselves have always been
                accustomed to. See, now, how that fellow amended it. <milestone n="116"
                  unit="section"/> He composes an edict;&mdash;such language that any one can
                perceive that it was written for the sake of one individual. He all but names the
                man; he details his whole cause; he disregards right, custom, equity, the edicts of
                all his predecessors. &ldquo;According to the edict of the city
                praetor,&mdash;if any doubt arises about an inheritance, if the possessor does
                not give security....&rdquo; What is it to the praetor which is the possessor?
                Is not this the point which ought to be inquired into, who ought to be the
                possessor? Therefore, because he is in possession, you do not remove him from the
                possession. If he were not in possession, you would not give him possession. For you
                nowhere say so; nor do you embrace anything else in your edict except that cause for
                which you had received money. What follows is ridiculous. <milestone n="117"
                  unit="section"/> &ldquo;If any doubt arises about an inheritance, and if
                testamentary papers are produced before me, sealed with not fewer seals than are
                required by law, I shall adjudge the inheritance as far as possible according to the
                testamentary papers.&rdquo; So far is usual. This ought to follow next:
                &ldquo;If testamentary papers are not produced....&rdquo; What says he? That
                he will adjudge it to him who says he is the heir. What, then, is the difference
                whether testamentary papers are produced or not? If he produces them, though they
                may have only one seal less than is required by law, you will not give him
                possession; but if he produces no such papers at all, you will. What shall I say
                now? That no one else ever issued a similar edict afterwards? A very marvellous
                thing, truly, that there should have been no one who chose to be considered like
                that fellow! He himself, in his Sicilian edict, has not this passage. No; for he had
                received his payment for it. And so in the edict which I have mentioned before,
                which he issued in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, about giving
                possession of inheritances, he laid down the same rules which all the praetors at
                  <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> had laid down besides himself. From
                the Sicilian edict,&mdash;&ldquo;If any doubt arise about an

                  unit="section"/></p>
              <p>But, in the name of the immortal gods, what can possibly be said of this business?
                For I ask of you now a second time, as I did just now, with reference to the affair
                of Annia, about the inheritance of females,&mdash;I ask you now, I say, about
                the possession of inheritances,&mdash;why you were unwilling to transfer those
                paragraphs into your provincial edict? Did you think those men who were living in
                the province more worthy to enjoy just laws than we were? Or is one thing just in
                  <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> and another in <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>? For you cannot say in this place that there
                are many things in the province which require to be regulated differently from what
                they would if they existed at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>; at all
                events not in the case of taking possession of inheritances, or of the inheritances
                of women. For in both these cases I see that nor only all other magistrates, but
                that you yourself, have issued edicts word for word the same as those which are
                accustomed to be issued at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. The
                clauses which, with great disgrace and for a great bribe, you had inserted in your
                edict at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, those alone, I see, you
                omitted in your Sicilian edict, in order not to incur odium in the province for
                nothing. <milestone n="119" unit="section"/> And as, while he was praetor elect, he
                composed his whole edict at the pleasure of those who bought law of him to secure
                their own advantage; so also, when he had entered on his office, he used to make
                decrees contrary to his edict without the slightest scruple. Therefore, Lucius Piso
                filled many books with the affairs in which he had interposed his authority, because
                Verres had decreed in a manner contrary to his edict. And I think that you have not
                forgotten what a multitude and what respectable citizens used to assemble before
                Piso's seat while that man was praetor, and unless he had had him for a colleague,
                he would have been stoned in the very forum. But his injuries at that time appeared
                of less importance, because there was a refuge always ready in the justice and
                prudence of Piso, whom men could apply to without any labour, or any trouble, or any
                expense, and even without a patron to recommend them. <milestone n="120"
                  unit="section"/> For, I entreat you, recall to your recollection, O judges, what
                licence that fellow took in determining the law; how great a variation there was in
                his decrees, what open buying and selling of justice; how empty the houses of all
                those men who were accustomed to be consulted on points of civil law, how full and
                crammed was the house of Chelidon. And when men had come from that woman to him, and
                had whispered in his ear, at one time he would recall those between whom he had just
                decided, and alter his decree; at another time he, without the least scruple, gave a
                decision between other parties quite contrary to the last decision which he had
                given only a little while before. <milestone n="121" unit="section"/> Hence it was
                that men were found who were even ridiculous in their indignation; some of whom, as
                you have heard, said that it was not strange that such piggish <note anchored="yes"
                  >There is a pun here on the name of Verres, which means a pig, boar: and on the
                  name of Sacerdos, which means also a sacrificing priest.</note> justice should be
                worthless. Others were colder; but still, because they were angry they seemed
                ridiculous, while they execrated Sacerdos who had spared so worthless a boar. And I
                should hardly mention these things, for they were not extraordinarily witty, nor are
                they worthy of the gravity of the present subject, if I did not wish you to
                recollect that his worthlessness and iniquity were constantly in the mouths of the
                populace, and had become a common proverb. <milestone n="47" unit="chapter"
                  /><milestone n="122" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>But shall I first speak of his arrogance towards the Roman people, or his cruelty?
                Beyond all question, cruelty is the graver and more atrocious crime. Do you think
                then that these men have forgotten how that fellow was accustomed to beat the common
                people of <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> with rods? And indeed a
                tribune of the people touched on that matter in the public assembly, when he
                produced in the sight of the Roman people the man whom he had beaten with rods. And
                I will give you the opportunity of taking cognisance of that business at its proper
                time. <milestone n="123" unit="section"/> But who is ignorant with what arrogance he
                behaved? how he disregarded every one of a low condition, how he despised them, how
                he did not account the poor to be free men at all? Publius Trebonius made many
                virtuous and honourable men his heirs; and among them his own freedman. He had had a
                brother, Aulus Trebonius, a proscribed man. As he wished to make provision for him,
                he put down in his will, that his heirs should take an oath to manage that not less
                than half of each man's share should come to Aulus Trebonius, that proscribed
                brother of his. The freedman takes the oath; the other heirs go to Verres, and point
                out to him that they ought not to take such an oath; that they should be doing what
                was contrary to the <placeName key="tgn,2257061">Cornelian</placeName> law, which
                forbids a proscribed man to be assisted. They obtain from him authority to refuse
                the oath. He gives them possession; that I do not find fault with. Certainly it was
                a scandalous thing for any part of his brother's property to be given to a man who
                was proscribed and in want. But that freedman thought that he should be committing a
                wickedness if he did not take the oath in obedience to the will of his patron.
                  <milestone n="124" unit="section"/> Therefore Verres declares that he will not
                give him possession of his inheritance, in order that he may not be able to assist
                his proscribed patron; and also in order that that might serve as a punishment for
                having obeyed the will of his other patron. You give possession to him who did not
                take the oath. I admit your right to do so; it is a privilege of the praetor. You
                take it from him who has taken the oath. According to what precedent? He is aiding a
                proscribed man. There is a law; there is a punishment established in such a case.
                What is that to him who is determining the law? Do you blame him because he assisted
                his patron, who was in distress at the time, or because he attended to the wishes of
                his other patron, who was dead, from whom he had received the greatest of all
                benefits? Which of these actions are you blaming? And then that most admirable man,
                sitting on his curule chair, said this: &ldquo;Can a freedman be heir to a Roman
                knight of such great wealth?&rdquo; O how modest must the class of freedmen be,
                since he departed from that place alive! <milestone n="125" unit="section"/> I can
                produce six hundred decrees in which, even if I were not to allege that money had
                interrupted justice, still the unprecedented and iniquitous nature of the decrees
                themselves would prove it. But that by one example you may be able to form your
                conjectures as to the rest, listen to what you have already heard in the previous
                pleading. <milestone n="48" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>There was a man called Caius Sulpicius Olympus. He died while Caius Sacerdos was
                praetor. I don't know whether it was not before Verres had begun to announce himself
                as a candidate for the praetorship. He made Marcus Octavius Ligur his heir. Ligur
                thus entered upon his inheritance; he took possession while Sacerdos was praetor,
                without any dispute. After Verres entered on his office, in accordance with his
                edict, an edict such as Sacerdos had not issued, the daughter of the patron of
                Sulpicius began to claim from Ligur a sixth part of the inheritance. Ligur was
                absent. His brother <placeName key="tgn,2023439">Lucius</placeName> conducted his
                cause; his friends and relations were present. That fellow Verres said that, unless
                the business was settled with the woman, he should order her to take possession.
                Lucius Gellius defended the cause of Ligur. He showed that his edict ought not to
                prevail with respect to those inheritances which had accrued to the heirs before his
                praetorship; that, if this edict had existed at that time, perhaps Ligur would not
                have entered upon the inheritance at all. This just demand, and the highest
                authority of influential men, was beaten down by money. <milestone n="126"
                  unit="section"/> Ligur came to <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>; he
                did not doubt that, if he himself had seen Verres, he should have been able to move
                the man by the justice of his cause and by his own influence. He went to him to his
                house; he explains the whole business; he points out to him how long ago it was that
                the inheritance had come to him and, as it was easy for an able man to do in a most
                just cause, he said many things which might have influenced any one. At last he
                began to entreat him not to despise his influence and scorn his authority to such an
                extent as to inflict such an injury upon him. The fellow began to accuse Ligur of
                being so assiduous and so attentive in a business which was adventitious, and only
                belonging to him by way of inheritance. He said that he ought to have a regard for
                him also; that he required a great deal himself; that the dogs whom he kept about
                him required a great deal. I cannot recount those things to you more plainly than
                you have heard Ligur himself relate them in his evidence. <milestone n="127"
                  unit="section"/> What are we to say, then, O Verres? Are we not to give credence
                to even these men as witnesses? Are these things not material to the question before
                us? Are we not to believe Marcus Octavius? Are we not to believe Lucius Ligur? Who
                will believe us? Who shall we believe? What is there, O Verres which can ever be
                made plain by witnesses, if this is not made so? Or is that which they relate a
                small thing? It is nothing less than the praetor of the city establishing this law
                as long as he remains in office,&mdash;that the praetor ought to be co-heir with
                all those to whom an inheritance comes. And can we doubt with what language that
                fellow was accustomed to address the rest of the citizens of an inferior rank, of
                inferior authority, and of inferior fortune; with what language he was accustomed to
                address country people from the municipal towns; with what language he was
                accustomed to address those whom he never thought free men,&mdash;I mean, the
                freedmen; when he did not hesitate to ask Marcus Octavius Ligur, a man of the
                highest consideration as to position, rank, name, virtue, ability, and influence,
                for money for deciding in favour of his undoubted lights? <milestone n="49"

              <p>And as to how he behaved in the matter of putting the public buildings in proper
                repair, what shall I say? They have said, who felt it. There are others, too, who
                are speaking of this. <milestone n="128" unit="section"/> Notorious and manifest
                facts have been brought forward, and shall be brought forward again. Caius Fannius,
                a Roman knight, the brother of Quintus Titinius, one of your judges, has said that
                he gave you money. Recite the evidence of Caius Fannius. [Read.] Pray do not believe
                Caius Fannius when he says this; do not believe&mdash;you I mean, O Quintus
                Titinius&mdash;do not believe Caius Fannius, your own brother. For he is saying
                what is incredible. He is accusing Caius Verres of avarice and audacity; vices which
                appear to meet in any one else rather than in him. Quintus Tadius has said something
                of the same sort, a most intimate friend of the father of Verres, and not
                unconnected with his mother, either in family or in name. He has produced his
                account-books, by which he proves that he had given him money. Recite the

                Tadius, or his evidence? What then shall we follow in coming to our decision? What
                else is giving all men free licence for every possible sin and crime, if it is not
                the disbelieving the evidence of the most honourable men, and the account books of

                temple which is placed before the eyes and in the daily view of the Roman people, to
                which the senate is often summoned, where crowded deliberations on the most
                momentous affairs take place every day, why should I mention his having dared to
                leave in that place, in contempt of anything any one can say, an eternal monument of
                his audacity? <milestone n="50" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="130" unit="section"
                /></p>
              <p>Publius <persName><surname>Junius</surname></persName>, O judges, had the
                guardianship, of the temple of Castor. He died in the consulship of Lucius Sulla and
                Quintus Metellus. He left behind him a young son under age. When Lucius Octavius and
                Caius Aurelius the consuls had let out contracts for the holy temple, and were not
                able to examine all the public buildings to see in what repair they were; nor could
                the praetors to whom that business had been assigned, namely, Caius Sacerdos and
                Marcus Caesius; a decree of the senate was passed that Caius Verres and Publius
                Caelius, the praetors should examine into and decide about those public buildings as
                to which no examination or decision had yet taken place. And after this power was
                conferred on him, that man, as you have learnt from Caius Fannius and from Quintus
                Tadius, as he had committed his robberies in every sort of affair without the least
                disguise and with the greatest effrontery, wished to leave this as a most visible
                record of his robberies, which we might, not occasionally hear of, but see every day
                of our lives. <milestone n="131" unit="section"/> He inquired who was bound to
                deliver up the temple of Castor in good repair. He knew that <persName><surname>Junius</surname></persName> himself was dead; he desired to know to whom
                his property belonged. He hears that his son is under age. The fellow, who had been
                in the habit of saying openly that boys and girls who were minors were the surest
                prey for the praetors, said that the thing he had so long wished for had been
                brought into his bosom. He thought that, in the care of a monument of such vast
                size, of such laborious finish, however sound and in however thorough a state of
                repair it might be, he should certainly find something to do, and some excuse for
                plunder. <milestone n="132" unit="section"/> The temple of Castor ought to have been
                entrusted to Lucius Rabonius. He by chance was the guardian of the young <persName><surname>Junius</surname></persName> by his father's will. An agreement had been
                made between him and his ward, without any injury to either, in what state it should
                be given up to him. Verres summons Rabonius to appear before him he asks him whether
                there is anything which has not been handed over to him by his ward, which might be
                exacted from him. When he said, as was the case, that the delivery of the temple had
                been very easy for his ward; that all the statues and presents were in their places,
                that the temple itself was sound in every part; that fellow began to think it a
                shameful thing if he was to give up so large a temple and so extensive a work
                without enriching himself by booty, and especially by booty to be got from a minor.
                  <milestone n="51" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="133" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>He comes himself into the temple of Castor; he looks all over the temple; he sees
                the roof adorned all over with a most splendid ceiling, and all the rest of the
                building as good as new and quite sound. He ponders; he considers what he can do.
                Some one of those dogs, of whom he himself had said to Ligur that there were a great
                number about him, said to him&mdash;&ldquo;You, O Verres, have nothing which
                you can do here, unless you like to try the pillars by a plumb-line.&rdquo; The
                man, utterly ignorant of everything, asks what is the meaning of the expression,
                &ldquo;by a plumb-line.&rdquo; They tell him that there is hardly any pillar
                which is exactly perpendicular when tried by a plumb-line. &ldquo;By my
                truth,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;that is what we must do; let the pillars be
                tested by a plumb-line.&rdquo; <milestone n="134" unit="section"/> Rabonius,
                like a man who knew the law, in which law the number of the pillars only is set
                down, but no mention made of a plumb-line, and who did not think it desirable for
                himself to receive the temple on such terms, lest he should be hereafter expected to
                hand it over under similar conditions, says that he is not to be treated in that
                way, and that such an examination has no right to be made. Verres orders Rabonius to
                be quiet, and at the same time holds out to him some hopes of a partnership with
                himself in the business. He easily overpowers him, a moderate man, and not at all
                obstinate in his opinions; and so he adheres to his determination of having the
                pillars examined. <milestone n="135" unit="section"/> This unprecedented resolve,
                and the unexpected calamity of the minor, is immediately reported to Caius Mustius,
                the step-father of the youth, who is lately dead; to Marcus <persName><surname>John Adams</surname></persName>, his uncle, and to Publius Potitius, his
                guardian, a most frugal man. They report the business to a man of the greatest
                consideration, of the greatest benevolence and virtue, Marcus Marcellus, who was
                also a guardian of the minor. Marcus Marcellus comes to Verres; he begs of him with
                many arguments, in the name of his own good faith and diligence in his office, not
                to endeavour to deprive <persName><surname>Junius</surname></persName> his ward of
                his father's fortune by the greatest injustice. Verres, who had already in hope and
                belief devoured that booty, was neither influenced by the justice of Marcus
                Marcellus's argument, nor by his authority. And therefore he answered that he should
                proceed with the examination, according to the orders which he had given. <milestone
                  n="136" unit="section"/> As they found that or all applications to this man were
                ineffectual, all access to him difficult, and almost impossible, being, as he was, a
                man with whom neither right, nor equity, nor mercy, nor the arguments of a relation,
                nor the wishes of a friend, nor the influence of any one had any weight, they
                resolve that the best thing which they could do, as indeed might have occurred to
                any one, was to beg Chelidon for her aid, who, while Verres was praetor, was not
                only the real judge in all civil law, and in the disputes of all private
                individuals, but who was supreme also in this affair of the repairs of the public
                buildings. <milestone n="52" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="137" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>Caius Mustius, a Roman knight, a farmer of the revenues, a man of the very highest
                honour, came to Chelidon. Marcus <persName><surname>Junius</surname></persName>,
                the uncle of the youth, a most frugal and temperate man, came to her; a man who
                shows his regard for his high rank by the greatest honour, and modesty, and
                attention to his duties. Publius Potitius, his guardian, came to her. Oh that
                praetorship of yours, bitter to many, miserable, scandalous? To say nothing of other
                points, with what shame, with what indignation, do you think that such men as these
                went to the house of a prostitute? men who would have encountered such disgrace on
                no account, unless the urgency of their duty and of their relationship to the
                injured youth had compelled them to do so. They came, as I say, to Chelidon. The
                house was full; new laws, new decrees, new decisions were being solicited:
                &ldquo;Let him give me possession.&rdquo; ... &ldquo;Do not let him take
                away from me.&rdquo;... &ldquo;Do not let him give sentence against
                me.&rdquo;.... &ldquo;Let him adjudge the property to me.&rdquo; Some
                were paying money, some were signing documents. The house was full, not with a
                prostitute's train, but rather with a crowd seeking audience of the praetor.
                  <milestone n="138" unit="section"/> As soon as they can get access to her, the men
                whom I have mentioned go to her. Mustius speaks, he explains the whole affair, he
                begs for her assistance, he promises money. She answers, considering she was a
                prostitute, not unreasonably: she says that she will gladly do what they wish, and
                that she will talk the matter over with Verres carefully; and desires Mustius to
                come again. Then they depart. The next day they go again. She says that the man
                cannot be prevailed on, that he says that a vast sum can be made of the business.
                  <milestone n="53" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>I am afraid that perhaps some of the people, who were not present at the former
                pleading, (because these things seem incredible on account of their consummate
                baseness,) may think that they are invented by me. You, O judges, have known them
                before. <milestone n="139" unit="section"/> Publius Potitius, the guardian of the
                minor <persName><surname>Junius</surname></persName>, stated them on his oath. So
                did Marcus Junius, his uncle and guardian. So would Mustius have stated them if he
                had been alive; but as Mustius cannot, Lucius Domitius stated that while the affair
                was recent, he heard these things stated by Mustius; and though he knew that I had
                had the account from Mustius while he was alive, for I was very intimate with him;
                (and indeed I defended Caius Mustius when he gained that trial which he had about
                almost the whole of his property ;) though, I say, Lucius Domitius knew that I was
                aware that Mustius was accustomed to tell him all his affairs, yet he said nothing
                about Chelidon as long as he could help it; he directed his replies to other points.
                So great was the modesty of that most eminent young man, of that pattern for the
                youth of the city, that for some time, though he was pressed by me on that point, he
                would rather give any answer than mention the name of Chelidon. At first, he said
                that the friends of Verres had been deputed to mention the subject to him; at last,
                after a time, being absolutely compelled to do so, he named Chelidon. <milestone
                  n="140" unit="section"/> Are you not ashamed, O Verres, to have carried on your
                praetorship according to the will of that woman, whom Lucius Domitius scarcely
                thought it creditable to him even to mention the name of? <milestone n="54"
                  unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>Being rejected by Chelidon, they adopt the necessary resolution of undertaking the
                business themselves. They settle the business, which ought to have come to scarcely
                forty thousand <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign>, with Rabonius the other
                guardian, for two hundred thousand. Rabonius reports the fact to Verres; as it seems
                to him the exaction has been sufficiently enormous and sufficiently shameless. He,
                who had expected a good deal more, receives Rabonius with harsh language, and says
                that he cannot satisfy him with such a settlement as that. To cut the matter short,
                he says that he shall issue contracts for the job. <milestone n="141" unit="section"
                /> The guardians are ignorant of this; they think that what has been settled with
                Rabonius is definitely arranged&mdash;they fear no further misfortune for their
                ward. But Verres does not procrastinate; he begins to let out his contracts,
                (without issuing any advertisement or notice of the day,) at a most unfavourable
                time&mdash;at the very time of the Roman games, and while the forum is decorated
                for them. Therefore Rabonius gives notice to the guardians that he renounces the
                settlement to which he had come. However, the guardians come at the appointed time;
                Junius, the uncle of the youth, bids. Verres began to change colour: his
                countenance, his speech, his resolution failed him. He begins to consider what he
                was to do. If the contract was taken by the minor, if the affair slipped through the
                fingers of the purchaser whom he himself had provided, he would get no plunder.
                Therefore He contrives&mdash;what? Nothing very cleverly, nothing of which any
                one could say, &ldquo;it was a rascally trick, but still a deep one.&rdquo;
                Do not expect any disguised roguery from him, any underhand trick; you will find
                everything open, undisguised, shameless, senseless, audacious. <milestone n="142"
                  unit="section"/> &ldquo;If the contract be taken by the minor, all the plunder
                is snatched out of my hands; what then is the remedy? What? The minor must not be
                allowed to have the contract.&rdquo; Where is the usage in the case of selling
                property, securities, or lands adopted by every consul, and censor, and praetor, and
                quaestor, that that bidder shall have the preference to whom the property belongs,
                and at whose risk the property is sold? He excludes that bidder alone to whom alone,
                I was nearly saying, the power of taking the contract ought to have been offered.
                &ldquo;For why,&rdquo;&mdash;so the youth might
                say&mdash;&ldquo;should any one aspire to my money against my will! What
                does he come forward for? The contract is let out for a work which is to be done and
                paid for out of my money. I say that it is I who am going to put the place in
                repair, the inspection of it afterwards will belong to you who let out the contract.
                You have taken sufficient security for the interests of the people with bonds and
                sureties; and if you do not think sufficient security has been taken, will you as
                praetor send whomsoever you please to take possession of my property, and not permit
                me to come forward in defence of my own fortune?&rdquo; <milestone n="55"
                  unit="chapter"/><milestone n="143" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>It is worth while to consider the words of the contract itself. You will say that
                the same man drew it up who drew up that edict about inheritance. &ldquo;The
                contract for work to be done, which the minor Junius's....&rdquo; Speak, I pray
                you, a little more plainly. &ldquo;Caius Verres, the praetor of the city, has
                added....&rdquo; The contracts of the censors are being amended. For what do
                they say? I see in many old documents, &ldquo;Cnaeus Domitius, Lucius Metellus,
                Lucius Cassius, Cnaeus Servilius have added....&rdquo; Caius Verres wants
                something of the same sort. Read. What has he added? &ldquo;Admit not as a
                partner in this work any one who has taken a contract from Lucius Marcius and Marcus
                Perperna the censors; give him no snare in it; and let him not contract for
                it.&rdquo; Why so? Is it that the work may not be faulty? But the inspection
                afterwards belonged to you. Lest he should not have capital enough? But sufficient
                security had been taken for the people's interest in bonds and sureties, and more
                security still might have been had. <milestone n="144" unit="section"/> If in this
                case the business itself, if the scandalous nature of your injustice had no weight
                with you;&mdash;if the misfortune of this minor, the tears of his relations, the
                peril of Decimus Brutus, whose lands were pledged as security for him, and the
                authority of Marcus Marcellus his guardian had no influence with you, did you not
                even consider this, that your crime would be such that you would neither be able to
                deny it, (for you had entered it in your account-books,) nor, if you confessed it,
                to make any excuse for it? The contract is knocked down at five hundred and fifty
                thousand <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign>, while the guardians kept crying out
                that they could do it even to the satisfaction of the most unjust of men, for eighty
                thousand. In truth, what was the job? <milestone n="145" unit="section"/> That which
                you saw. All those pillars which you see whitewashed, had a crane put against them,
                were taken down at a very little expense, and put up again of the same stone as
                before. And you let this work out for five hundred and sixty thousand <foreign
                  lang="la">sesterces</foreign>. And among those pillars I say that there are some
                which have never been moved at all by your contractor. I say that there are some
                which only had the outer coat scraped off, and a fresh coat put on. But, if I had
                thought that it cost so much to whitewash pillars, I should certainly never have
                stood for the aedileship. Still, in order that something might appear to be really
                being done, and that it might not seem to be a mere robbery of a
                minor&mdash;&ldquo;If in the course of the work you injure anything, you
                must repair it.&rdquo; <milestone n="56" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="146"
                  unit="section"/></p>
              <p>What was there that he could injure, when he was only putting back every stone in
                its place? &ldquo;He who takes the contract must give security to bear the man
                harmless who has taken the work from the former contractor.&rdquo; He is joking
                when he orders Rabonius to give himself security. &ldquo;Ready money is to be
                paid.&rdquo; Out of what funds? From his funds who cried out that he would do
                for eighty thousand <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign> what you let out at five
                hundred and sixty thousand. Out of what funds? out of the funds of a minor, whose
                tender age and desolate condition, even if he had no guardians, the praetor himself
                ought to protect. But as his guardians did protect him, you took away not only his
                paternal fortune, but the property of the guardians also. <milestone n="147"
                  unit="section"/> &ldquo;Execute the work in the best materials of every
                sort.&rdquo; Was any stone to be cut and brought to the place? Nothing was to be
                brought but the crane. For no stone, no materials at all were brought; there was
                just as much to be done in that contract as took a little labour of artisans at low
                wages, and there was the hire of the crane. Do you think it was less work to make
                one entirely new pillar without any old stone, which could be worked up again, or to
                put back those four in their places? No one doubts that it is a much a better job to
                make one new one. I will prove that in private houses, where there has been a great
                deal of expensive carriage, pillars no smaller than these are contracted for to be
                placed in an open court for forty thousand <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign>
                apiece. <milestone n="148" unit="section"/> But it is folly to argue about such
                manifest shamelessness of that man at any greater length, especially when in the
                whole contract he has openly disregarded the language and opinion of every one,
                inasmuch as he has added at the bottom of it, &ldquo;Let him have the old
                materials for himself.&rdquo; As if any old materials were taken from that work,
                and as if the whole work were not done with old materials. But still, if the minor
                was not allowed to take the contract, it was not necessary for it to come to Verres
                himself: some other of the citizens might have undertaken the work. Every one else
                was excluded no less openly than the minor. He appointed a day by which the work
                must be completed&mdash;the first of December. He gives out the contract about
                the thirteenth of September: every one is excluded by the shortness of the time.
                What happens then? How does Rabonius contrive to have his work done by that day?

              <p>No one troubles Rabonius, neither on the first of December, nor on the fifth, nor
                on the thirteenth. At last Verres himself goes away to his province some time before
                the work is completed. After he was prosecuted, at first he said that he could not
                enter the work in his accounts; when Rabonius pressed it, he attributed the cause of
                it to me, because I had sealed up his books. Rabonius applies to me, and sends his
                friends to apply to me; he easily gets what he wishes for; Verres did not know what
                he was to do. By not having entered it in his accounts, he thought he should be able
                to make some defence; but he felt sure that Rabonius would reveal the whole of the
                transaction. Although, what could be more plain than it now is, even without the
                evidence of any witness whatever. At last he enters the work in Rabonius's name as
                undertaken by him, four years after the day which he had fixed for its completion.
                  <milestone n="150" unit="section"/> He would never have allowed such terms as
                those if any other citizen had been the contractor; when he had shut out all the
                other contractors by the early day which he had fixed, and also because men did not
                choose to put themselves in the power of a man who, if they took the contract,
                thought that his plunder was torn from his hands. For why need we discuss the point
                where the money went to? He himself has showed us. First of all, when Decimus Brutus
                contended eagerly against him, who paid five hundred and sixty thousand <foreign
                  lang="la">sesterces</foreign> of his own money; and as he could not resist him,
                though he had given out the job, and taken securities for its execution, he returned
                him a hundred and ten thousand. Now if this had been another man's money, he clearly
                could not have done so. In the second place, the money was paid to Cornificius, whom
                he cannot deny to have been his secretary. Lastly, the accounts of Rabonius himself
                cry out loudly that the plunder was Verres's own. Read &ldquo;The items of the

              <p>Even in this place in the former pleadings Quintus Hortensius complained that the

                    >praetexta</foreign> was a token of the tender age of the youth, as it was only

                was there, O Hortensius, to rouse the popular feeling? what was there to excite
                odium in that boy, I suppose, forsooth, I had brought forward the son of Gracchus,
                or of Saturninus, or of some man of that sort, to excite the feelings of an ignorant

                whom his dying father thought he ought to recommend to the protection of guardians

                not his age but his cause, not his dress but his fortune, that seemed to you
                calculated to rouse the popular feeling. Nor did it move you so much that he had

                the people than by us, and by yourself, O Hortensius, and by those who are to
                pronounce sentence in this cause. For because it is the common cause of all men, the
                common danger of all men, such wickedness like a conflagration must be put out by
                the common endeavours of all men. For we have little children; it is uncertain how

                the mother of Annia, though a most noble woman, was a great protection to her when
                she was left a minor. No doubt she, by imploring the aid of gods and men, prevented
                him from robbing her infant ward of her father's fortunes. Can their guardians
                defend them? Very easily, no doubt, with a praetor of that sort by whom both the

                herself to the friendship and alliance of the Roman people. She was the first to be

                first who taught our ancestors how glorious a thing it was to rule over foreign
                nations. She alone has displayed such good faith and such good will towards the
                Roman people, that the states of that island which have once come into our alliance

                  key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>, adorned the cities of the Sicilians
                with most beautiful statues and monuments, in order to place the greatest number of
                monuments of his victory among those whom he thought were especially delighted at
                the victory of the Roman people. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Afterwards that
                illustrious man, Marcus Marcellus himself, whose valour in <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> was felt by his enemies, his mercy by the
                conquered, and his good faith by all the Sicilians, not only provided in that war
                for the advantage of his allies, but spared even his conquered enemies. When by
                valour and skill he had taken <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse"
                >Syracuse</placeName>, that most beautiful city, which was not only strongly
                fortified by art, but was protected also by its natural advantages&mdash;by the
                character of the ground about it, and by the sea&mdash;he not only allowed it to
                remain without any diminution of its strength, but he left it so highly adorned, as
                to be at the same time a monument of his victory, of his clemency, and of his
                moderation; when men saw both what he had subdued, and whom he had spared, and what
                he had left behind him. He thought that <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName> was entitled to have so much honour paid to her, that he did
                not think that he ought to destroy even an enemy's city in an island of such allies.
                  <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> And therefore we have always so esteemed the
                island of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> for every purpose, as to
                think that whatever she could produce was not so much raised among the Sicilians as
                stored up in our own homes. When did she not deliver the corn which she was bound to
                deliver, by the proper day? When did she fail to promise us, of her own accord,
                whatever she thought we stood in need of? When did she ever refuse anything which
                was exacted of her? Therefore that illustrious Marcus Cato the wise called
                  <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> a storehouse of provisions for our
                republic&mdash;the nurse of the Roman people. But we experienced, in that long
                and difficult Italian war which we encountered, that <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName> was not only a storehouse of provisions to us, but was also an
                old and well-filled treasury left us by our ancestors; for, supplying us with hides,
                with tunics, and with corn, it clothed, armed, and fed our most numerous armies,
                without any expense at all to us. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="6"
                  unit="section"/></p>
              <p>What more need I say? How great are these services, O judges, which perhaps we are
                hardly aware we are receiving,&mdash;that we have many wealthy citizens, that
                they have a province with which they are connected, faithful and productive to which
                they may easily make excursions, where they may be welcome to engage in traffic;
                citizens, some of whom she dismisses with gain and profit by supplying them with
                merchandise, some she retains, as they take a fancy to turn farmers, or graziers, or
                traders in her land, or even to pitch in it their habitations and their homes. And
                this is no trifling advantage to the Roman people, that so vast a number of Roman
                citizens should be detained so near home by such a respectable and profitable
                business. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> And since our tributary nations and our
                provinces are, as it were, farms belonging to the Roman people; just as one is most
                pleased with those farms which are nearest to one, so too the suburban character of
                this province is very acceptable to the Roman people. And as to the inhabitants
                themselves, O judges, such is their patience their virtue, and their frugality, that
                they appear to come very nearly up to the old-fashioned manners of our country, and
                not to those which now prevail. There is nothing then like the rest of the Greeks;
                no sloth, no luxury; on the contrary there is the greatest diligence in all public
                and private affairs, the greatest economy, and the greatest vigilance. Moreover,
                they are so fond of our nation that they are the only people where neither a
                publican nor a money-changer is unpopular. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> And
                they have born the injuries of many of our magistrates with such a disposition, that
                they have never till this time fled by any public resolution to the altar of our
                laws and to your protection; although they endured the misery of that year which so
                prostrated them that they could not have been preserved through it, if Caius
                Marcellus had not come among them, by some special providence, as it were, in order
                that the safety of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> might be twice
                secured by the same family. Afterwards, too, they experienced that terrible
                government of Marcus Antonius. For they had had these principles handed down to them
                from their ancestors, that the kindnesses of the Roman people to the Sicilians had
                been so great, that they ought to think even the injustice of some of our men
                endurable. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The states have never before this man's
                time given any public evidence against any one. And they would have borne even this
                man himself, if he had sinned against them like a man, in any ordinary manner; or in
                short, in any one single kind of tyranny. But as they were unable to endure luxury,
                cruelty, avarice, and pride, when they had lost by the wickedness and lust of one
                man all their own advantages, all their own rights, and all fruits of the kindness
                of the senate and the Roman people, they determined either to avenge themselves for
                the injuries they had suffered from that man by your instrumentality or if they
                seemed to you unworthy of receiving aid and assistance at your hands, then to leave
                their cities and their homes, since they had already left their fields, having been
                driven out of them by his injuries. <milestone n="4" unit="chapter"/><milestone
                  n="10" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>With this design all the deputations begged of Lucius Metellus that he would come
                as his successor as early as possible; with these feelings, they so often bewailed
                their miseries to their patrons; agitated by this indignation, they addressed the
                consuls with demands, which seemed to be not demands, but charges against that
                tyrant. They contrived also, by their indignation and their tears, to draw me, whose
                good faith and moderation they had experienced, almost from the employment of my
                life, in order to become his accuser; an action with which both the settled plan of
                my life and my inclination are utterly inconsistent (although in this business I
                appear to have undertaken a cause which has more parts of defence than of accusation
                in it). <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Lastly, the most noble men and the chief
                men of the whole province have come forward both publicly and privately; every city
                of the greatest authority&mdash;every city of the highest
                reputation&mdash;have come forward with the greatest earnestness to prosecute
                its oppressor for its injuries. </p>
              <p>But how, O judges, have they come? It seems to me that I ought to speak before you
                now on behalf of the Sicilians with more freedom than perhaps they themselves wish.
                For I shall consult their safety rather than their inclination. Do you think that
                there was ever any criminal in any province defended in his absence against the
                inquiry into his conduct urged by his accuser, with such influence, and with such
                zeal? The quaestors of both provinces, <note anchored="yes"><placeName
                    key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> had two quaestors, one for the western or
                  Lilybaean district, one for the Syracusan. </note> who were so while he was
                praetor, stood close to me with their forces. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>
                Those also who succeeded them, very zealous for his interests, liberally fed from
                his stores, were no less vehement against me. See how great was his influence who
                had four quaestors in one province, most zealous defenders and bulwarks of his
                cause; and the praetor and all his train so zealous in his interest, that it was
                quite plain, that it was not <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, which
                they had come upon when stripped bare, so much as Verres himself, who had left it
                loaded, which they looked upon as their province. They began to threaten the
                Sicilians, if they decreed any deputations to make statements against him; to
                threaten any one who had gone on any such deputation, to make most liberal promises
                to others, if they spoke well of him; to detain by force and under guard the most
                damaging witnesses of his private transactions, whom we had summoned by word of
                mouth to give evidence. <milestone n="5" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="13"
                  unit="section"/></p>
              <p>And though all this was done, yet know ye, that there was but one single city,
                that, namely, of the Mamertines, which by public resolution sent ambassadors to
                speak in his favour. But you heard the chief man of that embassy, the most noble man
                of that state, Caius Eleius, speak on his oath, and say, that Verres had had a
                transport of the largest size built at <placeName key="tgn,7003897"
                  >Messana</placeName>, the work being contracted for at the expense of the city.
                And that same ambassador of the Mamertines, his panegyrist, said that he had not
                only robbed him of his private property, but had also carried away his sacred
                vessels, and the images of the Di Penates, which he had received from his ancestors,
                out of his house. A noble panegyric; when the one business of the ambassadors is
                discharged by two operations, praising the man and demanding back what has been
                stolen by him. And on what account that very city is friendly to him, shall be told
                in its proper place. For you will find that those very things which are the causes
                of the Mamertines bearing him good-will, are themselves sufficiently just causes for
                his condemnation. No other city, O judges, praises him by public resolution.
                  <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> The power of supreme authority has had so much
                influence with a very few men, not in the cities, that either some most
                insignificant people of the most miserable and deserted towns were found who would
                go to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> without the command of their
                people or their senate, or on the other hand, those who had been voted as
                ambassadors against him, and who had received the public evidence to deliver, and
                the public commission, were detained by force or by fear. And I am not vexed at this
                having happened in a few instances, in order that the rest of the cities, so
                numerous, so powerful, and so wise,&mdash;that all <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName>, in short, should have all the more influence with you when
                you see that they could be restrained by no force, could be hindered by no danger,
                from making experiment whether the complaints of your oldest and most faithful
                allies had any weight with you. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> For as to what
                some of you may, perhaps, have heard, that he had a public encomium passed upon him
                by the Syracusans, although in the former pleading you learnt from the evidence of
                Heraclius the Syracusan what sort of encomium it was, still it shall be proved to
                you in another place how the whole matter really stands as far as that city is
                concerned For you shall see clearly that no man has ever been so hated by any people
                as that man both is and has been by the Syracusans. <milestone n="6" unit="chapter"
                /></p>
              <p>But perhaps it is only the native Sicilians who are persecuting him: the Roman
                citizens who are trading in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> defend
                him, love him, desire his safety. First of all, if that were the case, still in this
                trial for extortion, which has been established for the sake of the allies,
                according to that law and forms of proceeding which the allies are entitled to, you
                ought to listen to the complaints of the allies. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/>
                But you were able to see clearly in the former pleading, that many Roman citizens
                from <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, most honourable men, gave
                evidence about most important transactions, both as to injuries which they had
                received themselves, and injuries which they knew had been inflicted on others. I, O
                judges, affirm in this way what I know. I seem to myself to have done an action
                acceptable to the Sicilians in seeking to avenge their injuries with my own labour,
                at my own peril, and at the risk of incurring enmity in some quarters; and I am sure
                that this which I am doing is not less acceptable to our own citizens, who think
                that the safety of their rights, of their liberty, of their properties and fortunes,
                consists in tho condemnation of that man. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> On
                which account, while speaking of his Sicilian praetorship, I will not object to your
                listening to me on this condition, that if he has been approved of by any
                description of men whatever; whether of Sicilians or of our own citizens; if he has
                been approved of by any class of men, whether agriculturists, or graziers, or
                merchants; if he has not been the common enemy and plunderer of all these
                men,&mdash;if, in short, he has ever spared any man in any thing, then you, too,
                shall spare him. </p>
              <p>Now, as soon as <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> fell to him by lot
                as his province, immediately at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>,
                while he was yet in the city, before he departed, he began to consider within
                himself and to deliberate with his friends, by what means he might make the greatest
                sum of money in that province in one year. He did not like to learn while he was
                acting, (though he was not entirely ignorant and inexperienced in the oppression of
                a province,) but he wished to arrive in <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName> with all his plans for plunder carefully thought of and
                prepared. <milestone n="18" unit="section"/> Oh how correct was the augury diffused
                by common report and common conversation among the people in that province! when
                from his very name men augured in a jesting way what he would do in the province.
                Indeed, who could doubt, when they recollected his flight and robbery in his
                quaestorship&mdash;when they considered his spoliation of temples and shrines in
                his lieutenancy&mdash;when they saw in the forum the plunder of his
                praetorship&mdash;what sort of man he was likely to prove in the fourth act of
                his villainy? <milestone n="7" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>And that you may be aware that he inquired at <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
                  >Rome</placeName> not only into the different kinds of robbery which he might be
                able to execute, but into the very names of his victims, listen to this most certain
                proof, by which you will be able more easily to form an opinion of his unexampled
                impudence. <milestone n="19" unit="section"/> The very day on which he reached
                  <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, (see now whether he was not come,
                according to that omen bruited about the city,) prepared to sweep <note
                  anchored="yes">This is another pun on the name of Verres, from its similarity in
                  sound to the word <foreign lang="la">verro</foreign>, I sweep.</note> the province
                pretty clean, he immediately sends letters from <placeName key="tgn,7003897"
                  >Messana</placeName> to Halesa, which I suppose he had written in <placeName
                  key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>. For, as soon as he disembarked from the ship,
                he gave orders that Dio of Halesa should come to him instantly; saying that he
                wished to make inquiry about an inheritance which had come to his son from a
                relation, Apollodorus Laphiro. <milestone n="20" unit="section"/> It was, O judges,
                a very large sum of money. This Dio, O judges, is now, by the kindness of Quintus
                Metellus, become a Roman citizen; and in his case it was proved to your satisfaction
                at the former pleading, by the evidence of many men of the highest consideration,
                and by the account-books of many men, that a million of <foreign lang="la"
                  >sesterces</foreign> had been paid in order that, after Verres had inquired into
                the cause, in which there could no possible doubt exist, he might have a decision in
                his favour;&mdash;that, besides that all herds of the highest-bred mares were
                driven away, that all the plate and embroidered robes which he had in his home were
                carried off; so that Quintus Dio lost eleven hundred thousand <foreign lang="la"
                  >sesterces</foreign> because an inheritance had come to him, and for no other
                reason. <milestone n="21" unit="section"/> What are we to say? Who was praetor when
                this inheritance came to the son of Dio? The same man who was so when hers came to
                Annia the daughter of Publius Annius the senator,&mdash;the same who was so when
                his was left to Marcus Ligur the senator, namely Caius Sacerdos. What are we to say?
                Had no one been troublesome to Dio on the subject at the time?, No more than they
                had to Ligur, while Sacerdos was praetor. What then? :Did any one make any complaint
                to Verres? Nobody, unless perhaps you suppose that the informers were ready for him
                at the strait. <milestone n="8" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>When he was still at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, he heard that
                a very great inheritance had come to a certain Sicilian named Dio; that the heir had
                been enjoined by the terms of the will to erect statues in the forum; that, unless
                he erected them, he was to be liable to forfeiture to Venus Erycina. Although they
                had been erected in compliance with the will, still he; Verres, thought, since the
                name of Venus was mentioned, that he could find some pretext for making money of it.
                  <milestone n="22" unit="section"/> Therefore he sets up a man to claim that
                inheritance for Venus Erycina. For it was not (as would have been usual) the
                quaestor in whose province Mount Eryx was, who made the demand. A fellow of the name
                of Naevius Turpo is the claimant, a spy and emissary of Verres, the most infamous of
                all that band of informers of his, who had been condemned in the praetorship of
                Caius Sacerdos for many wickednesses. For the cause was such that the very praetor
                himself when he was seeking for an accuser, could not find one a little more
                respectable than this fellow. Verres acquits his man of any forfeiture to Venus, but
                condemns him to pay forfeit to himself. He preferred, forsooth, to have men do wrong
                rather than gods;&mdash;he preferred himself to extort from Dio what was
                contrary to law, rather than to let Venus take anything that was not due to her.

                evidence of Sextus Pompeius Chlorus, who pleaded Dio's cause? who was concerned in
                the whole business? A most honourable man, and, although he has long ago been made a
                Roman citizen in reward for his virtues, still the very chief man and the most noble
                of all the Sicilians. Why need I recite the evidence of Quintus Caecilius Dio
                himself, a most admirable and moderate man? Why need I recite that of Lucius

                whom this case about Dio's money was fully established. Marcus Lucullus said the

              <p>Does not this Venereal man, who went forth from the bosom of Chelidon to his
                province, appear to you to have got a sufficiently large sum by means of the name of
                Verres? <milestone n="25" unit="section"/> Listen now to a no less shamelessly false
                accusation in a case where a smaller sum was involved. Sosippus and Epicrates were
                brothers of the town of <placeName key="tgn,1043116">Agyrium</placeName>; their
                father died twenty-two years ago, by whose will, if anything were done wrongly in
                any point, there was to be a forfeiture of his property to Venus. In the twentieth
                year after his death, though there had been in the interim so many praetors, so many
                quaestors, and so many false accusers in the province, the inheritance was claimed
                from the brothers in the name of Venus. Verres takes cognisance of the cause; by the
                agency of Volcatius he receives money from the two brothers, about four hundred
                thousand <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign>. You have heard the evidence of many
                people already; the brothers of <placeName key="tgn,1043116">Agyrium</placeName>
                gained their cause, but on such terms that they left the court stripped and
                beggared. <milestone n="10" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="26" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>Oh, but that money never came to Verres. What does that defence mean? is that
                asserted in this case, or only put out as a feeler? For to me it is quite a new
                light. Verres set up the accusers; Verres summoned the brother to appear before him;
                Verres heard the cause; Verres gave sentence. A vast sum was paid; they who paid it
                gained the cause; and you argue in defence &ldquo;that money was not paid to
                Verres.&rdquo; I can help you; my witnesses too say the same thing; they say
                they paid it to Volcatius. How did Volcatius acquire so much power as to get four
                hundred thousand <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign> from two men? Would any one
                have given Volcatius, if he had come on his own account, one half-farthing? Let him
                come now, let him try; no one will receive him in his house. But I say more; I
                accuse you of having received forty millions of <foreign lang="la"
                  >sesterces</foreign> contrary to law; and I deny that you have ever accounted for
                one farthing of that money; but when money was paid for your decrees, for your
                orders, for your decisions, the point to be inquired into was not into whose hand it
                was paid, but by whose oppression it was extorted. <milestone n="27" unit="section"
                /> Those chosen companions of yours were your hands; the prefects, the secretaries,
                the surgeons, the attendants the soothsayers, the criers, were your hands. The more
                each individual was connected with you by any relationship, or affinity, or
                intimacy, the more he was considered one of your bands. The whole of that retinue of
                yours, which caused more evil to <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>
                than a hundred troops of fugitive slaves would have caused, was beyond all question
                your hand. Whatever was taken by any one of these men, that must be considered not
                only as having been given to you, but as having been paid into your own hand. For if
                you, O judges, admit this defence, &ldquo;He did not receive it
                himself,&rdquo; you will put an end to all judicial proceedings for extortion.
                For no criminal will be brought before you so guilty as not to be able to avail
                himself of that plea? Indeed, since Verres uses it, what criminal will ever
                henceforward be found so abandoned as not to be thought equal to Quintus Lucius in
                innocence by comparison with that man? And even now those who say this do not appear
                to me to be defending Verres so much as trying, in the instance of Verres, what
                license of defence will be admitted in other cases. <milestone n="28" unit="section"
                /> And with reference to this matter, you, O judges, ought to take great care what
                you do. It concerns the chief interests of the republic, and the reputation of our
                order, and the safety of the allies. For if we wish to be thought innocent, we must
                not only show that we ourselves are moderate, but that our companions are so too.

              <p>First of all, we must take care to take those men with us who with regard our

                us through friendship for the persons, we must take care to punish them, to dismiss
                them. We must always live as if we expected to have to give an account of what we
                have been doing. This is what was said by Africanus, a most kind-hearted man, (but
                that kind-heartedness alone is really admirable which is exercised without any risk
                to a man's reputation, as it was by him,) <milestone n="29" unit="section"/> when an
                old follower of his, who reckoned himself one of his friends, could not prevail on

                prefect, and was much annoyed at it. &ldquo;Do not marvel,&rdquo; said he,
                &ldquo;that you do not obtain this from me, for I have been a long time begging
                a man to whom I believe my reputation to be dear, to go with me as my prefect, and
                as yet I cannot prevail upon him.&rdquo; And in truth there is much more reason
                to beg men to go with us as our officers into a province, if we wish to preserve our
                safety and our honour, than to give men office as a favour to them; but as for you,
                when you were inviting your friends into the province, as to a place for plunder,
                and were robbing in company with them, and by means of them, and were presenting
                them in the public assembly with golden rings, did it never occur to you that you

                none of us can retain possession of his house, of his farm, or of his paternal
                property, if, when these are claimed by any one of you, a rascally praetor, whose
                judgments no one has the power of arresting, can assign any judge whom he chooses,
                and if the worthless and corrupt judge gives any sentence which the praetor bids him
                give. <milestone n="31" unit="section"/> But if this also be added, that the praetor
                assigns the trial to take place according to such a formula, that even Lucius
                Octavius Balbus, if he were judge, (a man of the greatest experience in all that
                belongs to the law and to the duties of a judge,) could not decide otherwise:
                suppose it ran in this way:&mdash;&ldquo;Let Lucius Octavius be the judge;
                if it appears that the farm at <placeName key="perseus,Capena">Capena</placeName>,
                which is in dispute, belongs, according to the law of the Roman people, to Publius
                Servilius, that farm must be restored to Quintus Catulus,&rdquo; will not Lucius
                Octavius be bound, as judge, to compel Publius Servilius to restore the farm to
                Quintus Catulus, or to condemn him whom he ought not to condemn? The whole
                praetorian law was like that; the whole course of judicial proceedings in <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> was like that for three years, while Verres
                was praetor. His decrees were like this:&mdash;&ldquo;If he does not accept
                what you say that you owe, accuse him; if he claims anything, take him to
                prison.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>He ordered Caius Fuficius, who claimed something, to be taken to prison; so he did
                Lucius Suetius and Lucius Rucilius. His tribunals he formed in this
                way:&mdash;those who were Roman citizens were to be judges, when Sicilians ought
                to have been, according to their laws, those who were Sicilians were to be judges,

                  unit="section"/> But that you may understand his whole system of judicial
                proceedings, listen first to the laws of the Sicilians in such uses, and then to the
                practices this man established. <milestone n="13" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>The Sicilians have this law,&mdash;that if a citizen of any town has a dispute
                with a fellow-citizen, he is to decide it in his own town, according to the laws
                there existing; if a Sicilian has a dispute with a Sicilian of a different city, in
                that case the praetor is to assign judges of that dispute, according to the law of
                Publius Rupilius, which be enacted by the advice of ten commissioners appointed to
                consider the subject, and which the Sicilians call the Rupilian law. If an
                individual makes a claim in a community, or a community on an individual, the senate
                of some third city is assigned to furnish the judges, as the citizens of the cities
                interested in the litigation are rejected as judges in such a case. If a Roman
                citizen makes a claim on a Sicilian, a Sicilian judge is assigned; if a Sicilian
                makes a claim on a Roman citizen, a Roman citizen is assigned as judge: in all other
                matters judges are appointed selected from the body of Roman citizens dwelling in
                the place. In law-suits between the farmers and the tax collectors, trials are
                regulated by the law about corn, which they call <foreign lang="la">Lex
                  Hieronica</foreign>. <milestone n="33" unit="section"/> All these rights were not
                only thrown into disorder while that man was praetor, but indeed were openly taken
                away from both the Sicilians and from the Roman citizens. First of all, their own
                laws with reference to one another were disregarded. If a citizen had a dispute with
                another citizen, he either assigned any one as judge whom it was convenient to
                himself to assign, crier, soothsayer, or his own physician; or if a tribunal was
                established by the laws, and the parties had come before one of their
                fellow-citizens as the judge, that citizen was not allowed to decide without
                control. For, listen to the edict issued by this man, by which edict he brought
                every tribunal under his own authority: &ldquo;If any one had given a wrong
                decision, he would examine into the matter himself; when he had examined, he would
                punish.&rdquo; And when he did that, no one doubted that when the judge thought
                that some one else was doing to sit in judgment on his decision, and that he should
                be at the risk of his life in the matter, he would consider the inclination of the
                man who he expected would presently be judging in a matter affecting his down
                existence as a citizen. <milestone n="34" unit="section"/> Judges selected from the
                Roman settlers there were none; none even of the traders in the cities were proposed
                as judges. The crowd of judges which I am speaking of was the retinue, not of
                Quintus Scaevola, (who, however, did not make practice of appointing judges from
                among his own followers,) but of Caius Verres. And what sort of a retinue do you
                suppose it was when such a man as he was its chief? You see announced in the edict,
                &ldquo;If the senate gives an erroneous decision....&rdquo; I will prove
                that, if at any time a bench of judges was taken from the senate, that also gave its
                decisions, through compulsion, on his part, contrary to their own opinions. There
                never was any selection of the judges by lot, according to the Rupilian law, except
                when he had no interest whatever in the case. The tribunals established in the case
                of many disputes by the <foreign lang="la">Lex Hieronica</foreign> were all
                abolished by a single edict; no judges were appointed selected from the settlers or
                from the traders. What great power he had you see; now learn how he exercised it.

              <p>Heraclius is the son of Hiero, a Syracusan; a man among the very first for nobility

                Syracusans; now a very poor man, owing to no other calamity but the avarice and
                injustice of that man. An inheritance of at least three millions of <foreign

                the house was full of silver plate exquisitely carved, of abundance of embroidered
                robes, and of most valuable slaves; things in which who is ignorant of the insane
                cupidity of that man? The fact was a subject of common conversation, that a great
                fortune had come to Heraclius that Heraclius would not only be rich, but that he
                would be amply supplied with furniture, plate, robes and slaves. <milestone n="36"
                  unit="section"/> Verres, too, hears this; and at first he tries by the tricks and
                maneuvers which he is so fond of, to get him to lend things to him to look at, which
                he means never to return. Afterwards he takes counsel from some Syracusans; and they
                were relations of his, whose wives too were not believed to be entirely strangers to
                him, by name Cleomenes and Aeschrio. What influence they had with him, and on what
                disgraceful reasons it was founded, you may understand from the rest of the
                accusation. These men, as I say, give Verres advice. They tell him that the property
                is a fine one, which in every sort of wealth; and that Heraclius himself is a man
                advancing in years, and not very active; and that he has no patron on whom he has
                any claim, or to whom he has any access except the Marcelli; that a condition was
                contained in the will in which he was mentioned as heir, that he was to erect some
                statues in the palaestra. We will contrive to produce people from the palaestra to
                assert that they have not been erected according to the terms of the will, and to
                claim the inheritance, because they say that it is forfeited to the palaestra. The
                idea pleased Verres. <milestone n="37" unit="section"/> For he foresaw that, when
                such an inheritance became disputed, and was claimed by process of law, it was quite
                impossible for him not to get some plunder out of it before it was done with. He
                approves of the plan; he advises them to begin to act as speedily as possible, and
                to attack a man of that age, and disinclined to law-suits, with as much bluster as
                possible. <milestone n="15" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>An action is brought in due form against Heraclius. At first all marvel at the
                roguery of the accusation. After a little, of those who knew Verres, some suspected,
                and some clearly saw that he had cast his eyes on the inheritance. In the mean time
                the day had arrived, on which he had announced in his edict that, according to
                established usage, and to the Rupilian law, he would assign judges at <placeName

                in this cause. Then Heraclius points out to him that he cannot assign judges in his
                cause that day, because the Rupilian law said that they were not to be assigned till
                thirty days after the action was commenced. The thirty days had not yet elapsed;
                Heraclius hoped that, if he could avoid having them appointed that day, Quintus
                Arrius, whom the province was eagerly expecting, would arrive as successor to Verres
                before another appointment could take place. <milestone n="38" unit="section"/> He
                postponed appointing judges in all suits, and fixed the first day for appointing
                them that he legally could after the thirty days claimed by Heraclius in his action
                had elapsed. When the day arrived, he began to pretend that he was desirous to
                appoint the judges. Heraclius comes with his advocates, and claims to be allowed to
                have the cause between him and the men of the palaestra, that is to say, with the
                Syracusan people, tried by strict law. His adversaries demand that judges be
                appointed to decide on that matter of those cities which were in the habit of
                frequenting the Syracusan courts. Judges were appointed, whomsoever Verres chose.
                Heraclius demanded, on the other hand, that judges should be appointed according to
                the provisions of the Rupilian law; and that no departure should be made from the
                established usage of their ancestors, from the authority of the senate, and from the
                rights of all the Sicilians. <milestone n="16" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="39"

              <p>Why need I demonstrate the licentious wickedness of that Verres, in the
                administration of justice? Who of you is not aware of it, from his administration in
                this city? Who ever, while he was praetor, could obtain anything by law against the
                will of Chelidon? The province did not corrupt that man, as it has corrupted some;
                he was the same man that he had been at <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
                  >Rome</placeName>. When Heraclius said, what all men well knew, that there was an
                established form of law among the Sicilians by which causes between them were to be
                tried; that there was the Rupilian law, which Publius Rupilius, the consul, had
                enacted, with the advice of ten chosen commissioners; that every praetor and consul
                in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> had always observed this law. He
                said that he should not appoint judges according to the provisions of the Rupilian
                law. He appointed five judges who were most agreeable to himself. <milestone n="40"
                  unit="section"/> What can you do with such a man as this? What punishment can you
                find worthy of such licentiousness? Then it was prescribed to you by law, O most
                wicked and most shameless man, in what way you were to appoint judges among the
                Sicilians; when the authority of a general of the Roman people, when the dignity of
                ten commissioners, men of the highest rank, when a positive resolution of the senate
                was against you, in obedience to which resolution Publius Rupilius had established
                laws in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> by the advice of ten
                commissioners; when, before you came as praetor every one had most strictly observed
                the Rupilian laws in all points, and especially in judicial matters; did you dare to
                consider so many solemn circumstances as nothing in comparison with your own
                plunder? Did you acknowledge no law? Had you no scruple? no regard for your
                reputation? no fear of any judgment yourself? Has the authority of no one of any
                weight with you? Was there no example which you chose to follow? <milestone n="41"
                  unit="section"/> But, I was going to say, when these five judges had been
                appointed, by no law, according to no use, with none of the proper ceremonies, with
                no drawing of lots, according to his mere will, not to examine into the cause, but
                to give whatever decision they were commanded, on that day nothing more was done;
                the parties are ordered to appear on the day following. <milestone n="17"
                  unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>In the meantime Heraclius, as he sees that it is all a plot laid by the praetor
                against his fortune, resolves, by the advice of his friends and relations, not to
                appear before the court. Accordingly he flies from <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse"
                  >Syracuse</placeName> that night. Verres the next day, early in the
                morning,&mdash;for he had got up much earlier than he ever did
                before,&mdash;orders the judges to be summoned. When he finds that Heraclius
                does not appear, he begins to insist on their condemning Heraclius in his absence.
                They expostulate with him, and beg him, if he pleases, to adhere to the rule he had
                himself laid down, and not to compel them to decide against the absent party in
                favour of the party who was present, before the tenth hour. He agrees. <milestone
                  n="42" unit="section"/> In the meantime both Verres himself began to be uneasy,
                and his friends and counselors began also to be a good deal vexed at Heraclius'
                having fled. They thought that the condemnation of an absent man, especially in a
                matter involving so large a sum of money, would be a far more odious measure than if
                he had appeared in court, and had there been condemned. To this consideration was
                added the fact, that because the judges had not been appointed in accordance with
                the provisions of the Rupilian law, they saw that the affair would appear much more
                base and more iniquitous. And so, while he endeavours to correct this error, his
                covetousness and dishonesty are made more evident. For he declares that he will not
                use those five judges; he orders (as ought to have been done at first, according to
                the Rupilian law) Heraclius to be summoned, and those who had brought the action
                against him; he says that he is going to appoint the judges by lot, according to the
                Rupilian law. That which Heraclius the day before could not obtain from him, though
                he begged and entreated it of him with many tears, occurred to him the next day of
                his own accord, and he recollected that he ought to appoint judges according to the
                Rupilian law. He draws the names of three out of the urn: he commands them to
                condemn Heraclius in his absence. So they condemn him. <milestone n="43"
                  unit="section"/> What was the meaning of that madness? Did you think that you
                would never have to give an account of your actions? Did you think that such men as
                these would never hear of these transactions? Is such an inheritance to be claimed
                without the slightest grounds for such a claim, in order to become the plunder of
                the praetor? is the name of the city to be introduced? is the base character of a
                false accuser to be fixed upon an honourable state? And not this only, but is the
                whole business to be conducted in such a matter that there is to be not even the
                least appearance of justice kept up? For, in the name of the immortal gods, what
                difference does it make whether the praetor commands and by force compels any one to
                abandon all his property, or passed a sentence by which, without any trial, he must
                lose all his fortune? <milestone n="18" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="44"
                  unit="section"/></p>
              <p>In truth you cannot deny that you ought to have appointed judges according to the
                provisions of the Rupilian law, especially when Heraclius demanded it. If you say
                that you departed from the law with the consent of Heraclius, you will entangle
                yourself, you will be hampered by the statement you make in your own defence. For if
                that was the case, why, in the first place, did he refuse to appear, when he might
                have had the judges chosen from the proper body which he demanded? Secondly, why,
                after his flight, did you appoint other judges by drawing lots, if you had appointed
                those who had been before appointed, with the consent of each party? Thirdly, Marcus
                Postumius, the quaestor, appointed as the other judges in the market-place; you
                appointed the judges in this case alone. <milestone n="45" unit="section"/> However,
                by these means, some one will say, he gave that inheritance to the Syracusan people.
                In the first place, even if I were disposed to grant that, still you must condemn
                him; for it is not permitted to us with impunity to rob one man for the purpose of
                giving to another. But you will find that he despoiled that inheritance himself
                without making much secret of his proceedings; that the Syracusan people, indeed,
                had a great deal of the odium, a great deal of the infamy, but that another had the
                profit; that a few Syracusans, those who now say that they have come in obedience to
                the public command of their city, to bear testimony in his favour, were then sharers
                in the plunder, and are come hither now, not for the purpose of speaking in his
                favour, but to assist in the valuation of the damages which they claim from him.
                After he was condemned in his absence, possession is given to the palaestra of the
                Syracusans,&mdash;that is, to the Syracusan people,&mdash;not only of that
                inheritance which was in question, and which was of the value of three millions of
                  <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign>, but also of all Heraclius's own paternal
                property, which was of equal amount. <milestone n="46" unit="section"/> What sort of
                a partnership in that of yours? You take away a man's inheritance, which had come to
                him from a relation, had come by will, had come in accordance with the laws; all
                which property, he, who made the will, had made over to this Heraclius to have and
                to use as he would, some time before he died,&mdash;of which inheritance, as he
                had died some time before you became praetor, there had been no dispute, nor had any
                one made any mention of it. <milestone n="19" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>However, be it so; take away inheritances from relations, give them to people at
                the palaestra; plunder other people's property in the name of the state; overturn
                laws, wills, the wishes of the dead, the rights of the living: had you any right to
                deprive Heraclius of his paternal property also? And yet as soon as he fled, how
                shamelessly, how undisguisedly, how cruelly, O ye immortal gods, was his property
                seized! How disastrous did that business seem to Heraclius, how profitable to
                Verres, how disgraceful to the Syracusans, how miserable to everybody! For the first
                measures which are taken are to carry whatever chased plate there was among that
                property to Verres: as for all Corinthian vessels, all embroidered robes, no one
                doubted that they would be taken and seized, and carried inevitably to his house,
                not only out of that house, but out of every house in the whole province. He took
                away whatever slaves he pleased, others he distributed to his friends: an auction
                was held, in which his invincible train was supreme everywhere. <milestone n="47"
                  unit="section"/> But this is remarkable. The Syracusans who presided over what was
                called the collection of this property of Heraclius, but what was in reality the
                division of it, gave in to the senate their accounts of the whole business; they
                said that many pairs of goblets many silver water-ewers, much valuable embroidered
                cloth, and many valuable slaves, had been presented to Verres; they stated how much
                money had been given to each person by his order. The Syracusans groaned, but still
                they bore it. Suddenly this item is read,&mdash;that two hundred and fifty
                thousand <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign> were given to one person by command
                of the praetor. A great outcry arises from every one, not only from every virtuous
                man, nor from those to whom it had always seemed scandalous that the goods of a
                private individual should be taken from him, by the greatest injustice, under the
                name of being claimed by the people, but even the very chief instigators of the
                wrong; and in some degree the partner in the rapine and plunder, began to cry out
                that the man ought to have his inheritance for himself. So great an uproar arise in
                the senate-house, that the people ran to see what had happened. <milestone n="20"
                  unit="chapter"/><milestone n="48" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>The matter being known to the whole assembly, is soon reported at Verres's house.
                The man was in a rage with those who had read out the accounts,&mdash;an enemy
                to all who had raised the outcry; he was in fury with rage and passion. But he was
                at that moment unlike himself. You know the appearance of the man, you know his
                audacity; yet at that moment he was much disquieted by the reports circulated among
                the people, by their outcry, and by the impossibility of concealing the robbery of
                so large a sum of money. When he came to himself, he summoned the Syracusans to him,
                because he could not deny that money had been given him by them; he did not go to a
                distance to look for some one, (in which case he would not have been able to prove
                it,) but he took one of his nearest relations, a sort of second son, <note
                  anchored="yes">He was in fact his son-in-law elect.</note> and accused him of
                having stolen the money. He declared that he would make him refund it; and he, after
                he heard that, had a proper regard for his dignity, for his age, and for his noble
                birth. He addressed the senate on the subject; he declared to them that he had
                nothing to do with the business Of Verres he said what all saw to be true, and he
                said it plainly enough. Therefore, the Syracusans afterwards erected him a statue;
                and he himself, as soon as he could, left Verres, and departed from the province.
                  <milestone n="49" unit="section"/> And yet they say that this man complains
                sometimes of his misery in being weighed down, not by his own offences and crimes,
                but by those of his friends. You had the province for three years; your son-in-law
                elect, a young man, was with you one year. Your companions, gallant men, who were
                your lieutenants, left you the first year. One lieutenant, Publius Tadius, who
                remained, was not much with you; but if he had been always with you, he would with
                the greatest care have spared your reputation, and still more would he have spared
                his own. What presence have you for accusing others? What reason have you for
                thinking that you can, I will not say, shift the blame of your actions on another,
                but that you can divide it with another? <milestone n="50" unit="section"/> That two
                hundred and fifty thousand <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign> are refunded to
                the Syracusans, and how they afterwards returned to him by the backdoor, I will make

                  >Syracuse</placeName>, are those crimes which were committed by the

                which matter I have arranged to speak in another part of my accusation, so that, by
                the assistance of those men whom I have named, he carried off all the statues, all
                the works in ivory out of the sacred temples, all the paintings from every place,
                and even whatever images of the gods he fancied; secondly, that in the senate-house
                of the Syracusans, which they call <foreign lang="greek">bouleuth/rion</foreign>, a
                most honourable place, and of the highest reputation in the eyes of the citizens,
                where there is a brazen statue of Marcus Marcellus himself, (who preserved and
                restored that place to the Syracusans, though by the laws of war and victory he
                might have taken it away,) those men erected a gilt statue to him and another to his
                son; in order that, as long as the recollection of that man remained, the Syracusan
                senate might never be in the senate-house without lamentation and groaning.

                indeed, not far from <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>. By far
                the first man of that city is a man of the name of Epicrates. An inheritance of five
                hundred thousand <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign> had come to him from some
                woman who was a relation of his, and so near a relation, that even if she had died
                intestate, Epicrates must have been her heir according to the laws of Bidis. The
                transaction at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> which I have
                just mentioned was fresh in men's memories,&mdash;the affair I mean of Heraclius
                the Syracusan, who would not have lost his property if an inheritance had not come
                to him. To this Epicrates too an inheritance had come, as I have said. <milestone
                  n="54" unit="section"/> His enemies began to consider that he too might be easily
                turned out of his property by the same praetor as Heraclius had been stripped of his
                by; they plan the affair secretly; they suggest it to Verres by his emissaries. The
                cause is arranged, so that the people belonging to the palaestra at Bidis are to
                claim his inheritance from Epicrates, just as the men of the Syracusan palaestra had
                claimed his from Heraclius. You never saw a praetor so devoted to the interests of
                the palaestra. But he defended the men of the palaestra in such a way that he
                himself came off with his wheels all the better greased. In this instance Verres, as
                soon as he foresaw what would happen, ordered eighty thousand <foreign lang="la"
                  >sesterces</foreign> to be paid to one of his friends. <milestone n="55"
                  unit="section"/> The matter could not be kept entirely secret. Epicrates is
                informed of it by one of those who were concerned in it. At first he began to
                disregard and despise it, because the claim made against him had actually nothing in
                it about which a doubt could be raised. Afterwards when he thought of Heraclius, and
                recollected the licentiousness of Verres, he thought it better to depart secretly
                from the province. He did so; he went to <placeName key="tgn,7004296"
                  >Rhegium</placeName>. <milestone n="23" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>And when this was known, they began to fret who had paid the money. They thought
                that nothing could be done in the absence of Epicrates. For Heraclius indeed had
                been present when the judges were appointed; but in the case of this man, who had
                departed before any steps had been taken in the action, before indeed there had been
                any open mention made of the dispute, they thought that nothing could be done. The
                men go to <placeName key="tgn,7004296">Rhegium</placeName>; they go to Epicrates;
                they point out to him, what indeed he knew, that they had paid eighty thousand
                  <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign>; they beg him to make up to them the money
                they themselves were out of pocket; they tell him he may take any security from them
                that he likes, that none of them will go to law with Epicrates about that
                inheritance. <milestone n="56" unit="section"/> Epicrates reproaches the men at
                great length and with great severity, and dismisses them. They return from
                  <placeName key="tgn,7004296">Rhegium</placeName> to <placeName
                  key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>; they complain to many people, as men
                in such a case are apt to do, that they have paid eighty thousand <foreign lang="la"
                  >sesterces</foreign> for nothing. The affair got abroad; it began to be the topic
                of every one's conversation. Verres repeats his old Syracusan trick. He says he
                wants to examine into that affair of the eighty thousand <foreign lang="la"
                  >sesterces</foreign>. He summons many people before him. The men of Bidis say that
                they gave it to Volcatius; they do not add that they had done so by his command. He
                summons Volcatius; he orders the money to be refunded. Volcatius with great
                equanimity brings the money, like a man who was sure to lose nothing by it; he
                returns it to them in the sight of many people; the men of Bidis carry the money
                away. <milestone n="57" unit="section"/> Some one will say, &ldquo;What fault
                then do you find with Verres in this, who not only is not a thief himself, but who
                did not even allow any one else to be one?&rdquo; Listen a moment. Now you shall
                see that this money which was just now seen to leave his house by the main road
                returned back again by a by-path. What came next? Ought not the praetor, having
                inquired into the case with the bench of judges, when he had found out that a
                companion of his own, with the object of corruptly swaying the law, the sentence,
                and the bench, (a matter in which the reputation of the praetor and even his
                condition as a free citizen were at stake,) had received money, and that the men of
                Bidis had given it, doing injury to the fair fame and fortune of the
                praetor,&mdash;ought he not, I say, to have punished both him who had taken the
                money, and those who had given it? You who had determined to punish those who had
                given an erroneous decision, which is often done out of ignorance, do you permit men
                to escape with impunity who thought that money might be received or be paid for the
                purpose of influencing your decree, your judicial decision? And yet that same
                Volcatius remained with you, although he was a Roman knight, after he had such
                disgrace put upon him. <milestone n="24" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="58"
                  unit="section"/></p>
              <p>For what is more disgraceful for a well-born man&mdash;what more unworthy of a
                free man, than to be compelled by the magistrate before a numerous assembly to
                restore what has been stolen; and if he had been of the disposition of which not
                only a Roman knight, but every free man ought to be, he would not have been able
                after that to look you in the face. He would have been a foe, an enemy, after he had
                been subjected to such an insult; unless, indeed, it had been done through collusion
                with you, and he had been serving your reputation rather than his own. And how great
                a friend he not only was to you then as long as he was with you in the province, but
                how great a friend he is even now, when you have long since been deserted by all the
                rest, you know yourself, and we can conceive. But is this the only argument that
                nothing was done without his knowledge, that Volcatius was not offended with him?
                that he punished neither Volcatius nor the men of Bidis? <milestone n="59"
                  unit="section"/> It is a great proof, but this is the greatest proof of all, that
                to those very men of Bidis, with whom he ought to have been angry, as being the men
                by whom he found out that his decree had been attempted to be influenced by bribes,
                because they could do nothing against Epicrates according to law, even if he were
                present,&mdash;to these very men, I say, he not only gave that inheritance which
                had come to Epicrates, but, as in the case of Heraclius of <placeName
                  key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, so too in this case, (which was even
                rather more atrocious than the other, because Epicrates had actually never had any
                action brought against him at all,) he gave them all his paternal property and
                fortune. For he showed that if any one made a demand of any thing from an absent
                person, he would hear the cause, though without any precedent for so doing. The men
                of Bidis appear&mdash;they claim the inheritance. The agents of Epicrates demand
                that he would either refer them to their own laws, or else appoint judges, in
                accordance with the provisions of the Rupilian law. The adversaries did not dare to
                say anything against this; no escape from it could be devised. They accuse the man
                of having fled for the purpose of cheating them. They demand to be allowed to take
                possession of his property. <milestone n="60" unit="section"/> Epicrates did not owe
                a farthing to any one. His friends said that, if any one claimed anything from him,
                they would stand the trial themselves, and that they would give security to satisfy
                the judgment. <milestone n="25" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>When the whole business was getting cool, by Verres's instigation they began to
                accuse Epicrates of having tampered with the public documents; a suspicion from
                which he was far removed. They demand a trial on that charge. His friends began to
                object that no new proceeding, that no trial affecting his rank and reputation,
                ought to be instituted while he was absent; and at the same time they did not cease
                to reiterate their demands that Verres should refer them to their own laws.
                  <milestone n="61" unit="section"/> He, having now got ample room for false
                accusation, when he sees that there is any point on which his friends refused to
                appear for Epicrates in his absence, declares that he will appoint a trial on that
                charge before any other. When all saw plainly that not only that money which had (to
                make a presence) been sent from his house, had returned back to it, but that he had
                afterwards received much more money, the friends of Epicrates ceased to argue in his
                defence. Verres ordered the men of Bidis to take possession of all his property, and
                to keep it for themselves. Besides the five hundred thousand <foreign lang="la"
                  >sesterces</foreign> which the inheritance amounted to, his own previous fortune
                amounted to fifteen hundred thousand. Was the affair planned out in this way from
                the beginning? Was it completed in this way? Is it a very trifling sum of money? Is
                Verres such a man as to be likely to have done all this which I have related for
                nothing? <milestone n="62" unit="section"/> Now, O judges, hear a little about the
                misery of the Sicilians. Both Heraclius the Syracusan, and Epicrates of Bidis, being
                stripped of all their property, came to <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
                  >Rome</placeName>. They lived at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>
                nearly two years in mourning attire, with unshaven beard and hair. When Lucius
                Metellus went to the province, then they also go back with Metellus, bearing with
                them letters of high recommendation. As soon as Metellus came to <placeName
                  key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> he rescinded both the
                sentences&mdash;the sentence in the case of Epicrates, and that against
                Heraclius. In the property of both of them there was nothing which could be
                restored, except what was not able to be moved from its place. <milestone n="26"
                  unit="chapter"/><milestone n="63" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>Metellus had acted admirably on his first arrival, in rescinding and making of no
                effect all the unjust acts of that man which he could rescind. He had ordered
                Heraclius to be restored to his property; he was not restored. Every Syracusan
                senator who was accused by Heraclius he ordered to be imprisoned. And on this ground
                many were imprisoned. Epicrates was restored at once. Other sentences which had been
                pronounced at <placeName key="tgn,7003850">Lilybaeum</placeName>, at <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003808">Agrigentum</placeName>, and at <placeName key="perseus,Panormus"
                  >Panormus</placeName>, were reviewed and reformed. Metellus showed that he did not
                mean to attend to the returns which had been made while Verres was praetor. The
                tithes which he had sold in a manner contrary to the Lex Hieronica, he said that he
                would sell according to that law. All the actions of Metellus went to the same
                point, so that he seemed to be remodeling the whole of Verres's praetorship. As soon
                as I arrived in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, he changed his
                conduct. <milestone n="64" unit="section"/> A man of the name of Letilius had come
                to him two days before, a man not unversed in literature, so he constantly used him
                as his secretary. He had brought him many letters, and, among them, one from home
                which had changed the whole man. On a sudden he began to say that he wished to do
                everything to please Verres; that he was connected with him by the ties of both
                friendship and relationship. All men wondered that this should now at last have
                occurred to him, after he had injured him by so many actions and so many decisions.
                Some thought that Letilius had come as an ambassador from Verres, to put him in mind
                of their mutual interests, their friendship, and their relationship. From that time
                he began to solicit the cities for testimony in favour of Verres, and not only to
                try to deter the witnesses against him by threats, but even to detain them by force.
                And if I had not by my arrival checked his endeavours in some degree, and striven
                among the Sicilians, by the help of Glabrio's letters and of the law, I should not
                have been able to bring so many witnesses into this court. <milestone n="27"
                  unit="chapter"/><milestone n="65" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>But, as I began to say, remark the miseries of the Sicilians. Heraclius, whom I
                have mentioned, and Epicrates came forward a great distance to meet me, with all
                their friends. When I came to <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse"
                >Syracuse</placeName>, they thanked me with tears; they wished to leave <placeName
                  key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, and go to <placeName
                  key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> in my company: because I had many other towns
                left which I wanted to go to, I arranged with the men on what day they were to meet
                me at <placeName key="tgn,7003897">Messana</placeName>. They sent a messenger to me
                there, that they were detained by the praetor. And though I summoned them formally
                to attend and give evidence,&mdash;though I gave in their names to
                Metellus,&mdash;though they were very eager to come, having been treated with
                the most enormous injustice, they have not arrived yet. These are the rights which
                the allies enjoy now, not to be allowed even to complain of their distresses. </p>
              <p><milestone n="66" unit="section"/> You have already heard the evidence of Heraclius
                of Centuripa, a most virtuous and noble young man, from whom a hundred thousand
                  <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign> were claimed by a fraudulent and false
                accusation. Verres, by means of penalties and securities <note anchored="yes">The

                  a security for their obeying the decision of the judge, &ldquo;though the same
                  term was also employed to express the engagement by which parties agreed to settle
                  their differences by arbitration, without the intervention of the

                and the sentence which had been given in favour of Heraclius, in the affairs about
                which security had been given) he set aside, because a citizen of Centuripa had
                acted as judge between two of his fellow-citizens, and he said that he had given a
                false decision; he forbade him to appear in the senate, and deprived him by an
                interdict of all the privileges of citizens and of access to all public places. If
                any one struck him, he announced that he would take no cognisance of the injury;
                that if any claim were made on him, he would appoint a judge from his own retinue,
                but that he would not allow him an action on any ground whatever. <milestone n="67"
                  unit="section"/> And his authority in the province had just this weight, that no
                one did strike him, though the praetor in his province gave every one leave by word,
                and in reality incited them to do so; nor did any one claim anything of him, though
                he had given licence to false accusation by his authority; yet that heavy mark of
                ignominy was attached to the man as long as Verres remained in the province. After
                this fear had been impressed on the judges, in a manner unexampled and wholly
                without precedent, do you suppose that any matter was decided in <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> except according to his will and pleasure?
                Does this appear to have been the only effect of it, (which effect, however, it
                had,) to take his money from Heraclius? or was not this also the object, as the
                means by which the greatest plunder was to be got,&mdash;to bring, under
                presence of judicial decision, the property and fortune of every one into the power
                of that one man? <milestone n="28" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="68" unit="section"
                /></p>
              <p>But why should I seek out every separate transaction and cause in the trials which
                took place on capital charges? Out of many, which are all nearly alike, I will
                select those which seem to go beyond all the others in rascality. There was a man of
                Halicya, named Sopater, among the first men of his state for riches and high
                character. He, having been accused by his enemies before Caius Sacerdos the praetor,
                on a capital charge, was easily acquitted. The same enemies again accused this same
                Sopater on the same charge before Caius Verres when he had come as successor to
                Sacerdos. The matter appeared trifling to Sopater, both because he was innocent, and
                because he thought that Verres would never dare to overturn the decision of
                Sacerdos. The defendant is cited to appear. The cause is heard at <placeName
                  key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>. Those changes are brought forward by
                the accusers which had been already previously extinguished, not only by the
                defence, but also by the decision. <milestone n="69" unit="section"/> Quintus
                Minucius, a Roman knight, among the first for a high and honourable reputation, and
                not unknown to you, O judges, defended the cause of Sopater. There was nothing in
                the cause which seemed possible to be feared, or even to be doubted about at all. In
                the meantime that same Timarchides, that fellow's attendant and freedman, who is, as
                you have learnt by many witnesses at the former hearing, his agent and manager in
                all affairs of this sort, comes to Sopater, and advised him not to trust too much to
                the decision of Sacerdos and the justice of his cause; he tells him that his
                accusers and enemies have thoughts of giving money to the praetor, but that the
                praetor would rather take it to acquit; and at the same time, that he had rather, if
                it were possible, not rescind a decision of his predecessor. Sopater, as this
                happened to him quite suddenly and unexpectedly, was greatly perplexed, and had no
                answer ready to make to Timarchides, except that he would consider what he had best
                do in such a case; and at the same time he told him that he was in great
                difficulties respecting money matters. Afterwards he consulted with his friends; and
                as they advised him to purchase an acquittal, he came to Timarchides. Having
                explained his difficulties to him, he brings the man down to eighty thousand
                  <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign>, and pays him that money. <milestone n="29"
                  unit="chapter"/><milestone n="70" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>When the cause came to be heard, all who were defending Sopater were without any
                fear or any anxiety. No crime had been committed; the matter had been decided;
                Verres had received the money. Who could doubt how it would turn out? The matter is
                not summed up that day; the court breaks up; Timarchides comes a second time to
                Sopater. He says that his accusers were promising a much larger sum to the praetor
                than what he had given, and that if he were wise he would consider what he had best
                do. The man, though he was a Sicilian, and a defendant&mdash;that is to say,
                though he had little chance of obtaining justice&mdash;and was in an unfortunate
                position, still would not bear with or listen to Timarchides any longer. Do, said
                he, whatever you please; I will not give any more And this, too, was the advice of
                his friends and defenders; and so much the more, because Verres, however he might
                conduct himself on the trial, still had with him on the bench some honourable men of
                the Syracusan community, who had also been on the bench with Sacerdos when this same
                Sopater had been acquitted. They considered that it was absolutely impossible for
                the same men, who had formerly acquitted Sopater, to condemn him now on the same
                charge, supported by the same witnesses. And so with this one hope they came before
                the court. <milestone n="71" unit="section"/> And when they came thither, when the
                same men came in numbers on the bench who were used to sit there, and when the whole
                defence of Sopater rested on this hope, namely, on the number and dignity of the
                bench of judges, and on the fact of their being, as I have said before, the same men
                who had before acquitted Sopater of the same charge, mark the open rascality and
                audacity of the man, not attempted to be disguised, I will not say under any reason,
                but with even the least dissimulation. He orders Marcus Petilius, a Roman knight,
                whom he had with him on the bench, to attend to a private cause in which he was
                judge. Petilius refused, because Verres himself was detaining his friends whom he
                had wished to have with him on the bench. He, liberal man, said that he did not wish
                to detain any of the men who preferred being with Petilius. And so they all go; for
                the rest also prevail upon him not to detain them, saying that they wished to appear
                in favour of one or other of the parties who were concerned in that trial. And so he
                is left alone with his most worthless retinue. <milestone n="72" unit="section"/>
                Minucius, who was defending Sopater, did not doubt that Verres, since he had
                dismissed the whole bench, would not proceed with the investigation of his cause
                that day; when all of a sudden he is ordered to state his case. He answers,
                &ldquo;To whom?&rdquo; &ldquo;To me,&rdquo; says Verres,
                &ldquo;if I appear to you of sufficient dignity to try the cause of a Sicilian,
                a Greek.&rdquo; &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;you are of
                sufficient dignity, but I wish for the presence of those men who were present
                before, and were acquainted with the case.&rdquo; &ldquo;State your
                case,&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;they cannot be present.&rdquo;
                &ldquo;For in truth,&rdquo; says Quintus Minucius, &ldquo;Petilius
                begged me also to be with him on the bench;&rdquo; and at the same time he began
                to leave his seat as counsel. <milestone n="73" unit="section"/> Verres, in a rage,
                attacks him with pretty violent language, and even began to threaten him severely,
                for bringing such a charge, and trying to excite such odium against him. <milestone
                  n="30" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>Minucius, who lived as a merchant at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse"
                  >Syracuse</placeName>, in such a way as always to bear in mind his rights and his
                dignity and who knew that it became him not to increase his property in the province
                at the expense of any portion of his liberty, gave the man such answer as seemed
                good to him, and as the occasion and the cause required. He said that he would not
                speak in defence of his client when the bench of judges was sent away and dismissed.
                And so he left the bar. And all the other friends and advocates of Sopater, except
                the Sicilians, did the same. <milestone n="74" unit="section"/> Verres, though he is
                a man of incredible effrontery and audacity, yet when he was thus suddenly left
                alone got frightened and agitated. He did not know what to do, or which way to turn.
                If he adjourned the investigation at that time, he knew that when those men were
                present, whom he had got rid of for the time, Sopater would be acquitted; but if he
                condemned an unfortunate and innocent man, (while he himself, the praetor, was
                without any colleagues, and the defendant without any counsel or patron,) and
                rescinded the decision of Caius Sacerdos, he thought that he should not be able to
                withstand the unpopularity of such an act. So he was quite in a fever with
                perplexity. He turned himself every way, not only as to his mind, but also as to his
                body; so that all who were present could plainly see that fear and covetousness were
                contending together in his heart. There was a great crowd of people present, there
                was profound silence, and eager expectation which way his covetousness was going to
                find vent. His attendant Timarchides was constantly stooping down to his ear.
                  <milestone n="75" unit="section"/> Then at last he said, &ldquo;Come, state
                your case.&rdquo; Sopater began to implore him by the good faith of gods and
                man, to hear the cause in company with the rest of the bench. He orders the
                witnesses to be summoned instantly. One or two of them give their evidence briefly.
                No questions are asked. The crier proclaims that the case is closed. Verres, as if
                he were afraid that Petilius, having either finished or adjourned the private cause
                on which he was engaged, might return to the bench with the rest, jumps down in
                haste from his seat; he condemned an innocent man, one who had been acquitted by
                Caius Sacerdos, without hearing him in his defence, by the joint sentence of a
                secretary, a physician, and a soothsayer. <milestone n="31" unit="chapter"

                you may have a man to assist you in judging causes; to declare his opinion in the
                senate on questions of war and peace, without any covetous desires. Although,
                indeed, we and the Roman people have less cause to be anxious as to what his opinion
                in the senate is likely to be: for what will be his authority? When will he have
                either the daring or the power to deliver his opinion? When will a man of such

              <p>In truth, if that is a wicked action, (which appears to me to be of all actions the
                most base, and the most wicked,) to take money to influence a decision in a court of
                law, to put up one's good faith and religion to auction; how much love wicked,
                flagitious, and scandalous is it, to condemn a man from whom you have taken money to
                acquit him?&mdash;so that the praetor does not even act up to the customs of
                robbers, for there is honour among thieves. It is a sin to take money from a
                defendant; how much more to take it from an accuser! how much more wicked still to
                take it from both parties! When you had put up your good faith to auction in the
                province, he had the most weight with you who gave you the most
                money.&mdash;That was natural: perhaps some time or other some one else may have
                done something of the same sort. But when you had already disposed of your good
                faith and of your scruples to the one party, and had received the money, and had
                afterwards sold the very same articles to his adversary for a still higher price,
                are you going to cheat both, and to decide as you please? and not even to give back

              <p>For what of all these things does he deny having done? That, perhaps, which he must
                deny or else be silent,&mdash;the having taken the money? Why should he not deny
                it? But the Roman knight who defended Sopater, who was present at all his
                deliberations and at every transaction, Quintus Minucius, says on his oath that the
                money was paid; he says on his oath that Timarchides said that a greater sum was
                being offered by the accusers. All the Sicilians will say the same; all the citizens
                of Halicya will say the same; even the young son of Sopater will say the same, who
                by that most cruel man has been deprived of his innocent father and of his father's
                property. <milestone n="81" unit="section"/> But if I cannot make the case plain, as
                far as the money is concerned, by evidence, can you deny this, or will you now deny,
                that after you had dismissed the rest of the judges, after those excellent men who

                these things which were done openly, to ask what you did secretly; or to doubt
                whether he had better believe my witnesses or your defenders. <milestone n="82"

              <p>Listen now to another remarkable exploit of his, one that has already been
                mentioned in many places, and one of such a sort that every possible crime seems to
                be comprehended in that one. Listen carefully, for you will find that this deed had
                its origin in covetousness, its growth in lust, its consummation and completeness in
                cruelty. <milestone n="83" unit="section"/> Sthenius, the man who is sitting by us,
                is a citizen of Thermae, long since known to many by his eminent virtue and his
                illustrious birth, and now known to all men by his own misfortune and the unexampled
                injuries he has received from that man. Verres having often enjoyed his hospitality,
                and having not only stayed often with him at Thermae, but having almost dwelt with
                him there, took away from him out of his house everything which could in any
                uncommon degree delight the mind or eyes of any one. In truth, Sthenius from his
                youth had collected such things as these with more than ordinary diligence; elegant
                furniture of brass, made at <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName> and at
                  <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>, paintings, and even a good
                deal of elegantly wrought silver, as far as the wealth of a citizen of Thermae could
                afford. And these things, when he was in <placeName key="tgn,1000004"
                  >Asia</placeName> as a young man, he had collected diligently, as I said, not so
                much for any pleasure to himself, as for ornaments against the visits of Roman
                citizens, his own friends and connections, whenever he invited them. <milestone
                  n="84" unit="section"/> But after Verres got them all, some by begging for then,
                some by demanding them, and some by boldly taking them, Sthenius bore it as well as
                he could, but he was affected with unavoidable indignation in his mind, at that
                fellow having rendered his house, which had been so beautifully furnished and
                decorated, naked and empty; still he told his indignation to no one. He thought he
                must bear the injuries of the praetor in silence&mdash;those of his guest with
                calmness. <milestone n="85" unit="section"/> Meantime that man, with that
                covetousness of his which was now notorious and the common talk of every one, as he
                took a violent fancy to some exceedingly beautiful and very ancient statues at
                Thermae placed in the public place, began to beg of Sthenius to promise him his
                countenance and to aid him in taking them away. But Sthenius not only refused, but
                declared to him that it was utterly impossible that most ancient statues, memorials
                of Publius Africanus, should ever be taken away out of the town of the Thermitani,
                as long as that city and the empire of the Roman people remained uninjured.
                  <milestone n="35" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="86" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>Indeed, (that you may learn at the same time both the humanity and the justice of
                Publius Africanus,) the Carthaginians had formerly taken the town of Himera, one of
                the first towns in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> for renown and
                for beauty. Scipio as he thought it a thing worthy of the Roman people, that, after
                the war was over, our allies should recover their property in consequence of our
                victory, took care, after <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> had
                been taken, that everything which he could manage should be restored to all the
                Sicilians. As Himera had been destroyed, those citizens whom the disasters of the
                war had spared had settled at Thermae, on the border of the same district, and not
                far from their ancient town. They thought that they were recovering the fortune and
                dignity of their fathers, when those ornaments of their ancestors were being placed
                in the town of Thermae. <milestone n="87" unit="section"/> There were many statues
                of brass; among them a statue of Himera herself, of marvellous beauty, made in the
                shape and dress of a woman, after the name of the town and of the river. There was
                also a statue of the poet Stesichorus, aged, stooping,&mdash;made, as men think,
                with the most exceeding skill,&mdash;who was, indeed, a citizen of Himera, but
                who both was and is in the highest renown and estimation over all <placeName
                  key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> for his genius. These things he coveted to a
                degree of madness. There is also, which I had almost passed over, a certain she-goat
                made, as even we who are skilled in these matters can judge, with wonderful skill
                and beauty. These, and other works of art, Scipio had not thrown away like a fool,
                in order that an intelligent man like Verres might have an opportunity of carrying
                them away, but he had restored them to the people of Thermae; not that he himself
                had not gardens, or a suburban villa, or some place or other where he could put
                them; but, if he had taken them home, they would not long have been called Scipio's,

              <p>When that fellow claimed those things, and the subject was mooted in the senate,
                Sthenius resisted his claim most earnestly, and urged many arguments, for he is
                among the first men in all <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> for
                fluency of speech. He said that it was more honourable for the men of Thermae to
                abandon their city than to allow the memorials of their ancestors, the spoils of
                their enemies, the gifts of a most illustrious man, the proofs of the alliance and
                friendship with the Roman people, to be taken away out of their city. The minds of
                all were moved. No one was found who did not agree that it was better to die. And so
                Verres found this town almost the only one in the whole world from which he could
                not carry off anything of that sort belonging to the community, either by violence,
                or by stealth, or by his own absolute power, or by his interest, or by bribery. But,
                however, all this covetousness of his I will expose another time; at present I must
                return to Sthenius. <milestone n="89" unit="section"/> Verres being furiously
                enraged against Sthenius, renounces the connection of hospitality with him, leaves
                his house, and departs; <note anchored="yes">The Latin is, &ldquo;<foreign

                    >migrasse</foreign> when he plundered Sthenius of all his furniture and plate,
                  and removed it to his own house.&rdquo;&mdash;Garaton.</note> for, indeed,
                he had moved his quarters before. The greatest enemies of Sthenius immediately
                invite him to their houses, in order to inflame his mind against Sthenius by
                inventing lies and accusing him. And these enemies were, Agathinus, a man of noble
                birth, and Dorotheus, who had married Callidama, the daughter of that same
                Agathinus, of whom Verres had heard. So he preferred migrating to the son-in-law of
                Agathinus. Only one night elapsed before he became so intimate with Dorotheus, that,
                as one might say, they had everything in common. He paid as great attention to
                Agathinus as if he had been some connection or relation of his own. He appeared even
                to despise that statue of Himera, because the figure and features of his hostess
                delighted him much more. <milestone n="37" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="90"
                  unit="section"/></p>
              <p>Therefore he began to instigate the men to create some danger for Sthenius, and to
                invent some accusation against him. They said they had nothing to allege against
                him. On this he openly declared to them, and promised to them that they might prove
                whatever they pleased against Sthenius if they only laid the information before him.
                So they do not delay. They immediately bring Sthenius before him; they say that the
                public documents have been tampered with by him. Sthenius demands, that as his own
                fellow-citizens are prosecuting him on a charge of tampering with the public
                documents, and as there is a right of action on such a charge according to the laws
                of the Thermitani since the senate and people of <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
                  >Rome</placeName> had restored to the Thermitani their city, and their territory
                and their laws, because they had always remained faithful and friendly; and since
                Publius Rupilius had afterwards, in obedience to a degree of the senate, given laws
                to the Sicilinus, acting with the advice of ten commissioners, according to which
                the citizens were to use their own laws in their actions with one another; and singe
                Verres himself had the same regulation contained in his edict;&mdash;on all
                these accounts, I say, he claims of Verres to refer the matter to their own laws.
                  <milestone n="91" unit="section"/> That man, the justest of all men, and the most
                remote from covetousness, declares that he will investigate the affair himself, and
                bids him come prepared to plead his cause at the eighth hour. It was not difficult
                to see what that dishonest and wicked man was designing. And, indeed, he did not
                himself very much disguise it, and the woman could not hold her tongue. It was
                understood that his intention was, that, after he, without any pleading taking
                place, and without any witnesses being called, had condemned Sthenius, then,
                infamous that he was, he should cause the man, a man of noble birth, of mature age,
                and his own host, to be cruelly punished by scourging. And as this was notorious, by
                the advice of his friends and connections, Sthenius fled from there to <placeName
                  key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. He preferred trusting himself to the winter
                and to the waves, rather than not escape that common tempest and calamity of all the

              <p>That punctual and diligent man is ready at the eighth hour. He orders Sthenius to
                be summoned; and, when he sees that he does not appear, he begins to burn with
                indignation, and to go mad with rage; to despatch <note anchored="yes">The Latin
                  word is <foreign lang="la">Venereus</foreign>: the officers who attended on the

                kept waiting there till some certain news could be brought to him, he did not leave
                the court till the third hour of the night. The next day he came down again the
                first thing in the morning; he calls Agathinus, he bids him make his statement about
                the public documents against Sthenius in his absence. It was a cause of such a
                character, that, even though he had no adversary in court, and a judge unfriendly to
                the defendant, still he could not find anything to say. <milestone n="93"
                  unit="section"/> So that he confined himself to the mere statement that, when
                Sacerdos was praetor, Sthenius had tampered with the public documents. He had
                scarcely said this when Verres gives sentence &ldquo;that Sthenius seems to have
                tampered with the public documents,&rdquo; and, moreover, this man so devoted to
                Venus, added this besides, with no precedent for, no example of, such an addition,
                &ldquo;For that action he should adjudge five hundred thousand <foreign
                  lang="la">sesterces</foreign> to Venus Erycina out of the property of
                Sthenius.&rdquo; And immediately he began to sell his property; and he would
                have sold it, if there had been ever so little delay in paying him the money.
                  <milestone n="94" unit="section"/> After it was paid, he was not content with this
                iniquity; he gave notice openly from the seat of justice, and from the tribunal,
                &ldquo;That if any one wished to accuse Sthenius in his absence of a capital
                charge, he was ready to take the charge.&rdquo; And immediately he began to
                instigate Agathinus, his new relation and host, to apply himself to such a cause,
                and to accuse him. But he said loudly, in the hearing of every one, that he would
                not do so, and that he was not so far an enemy to Sthenius as to say that he was
                implicated in any capital crime. Just at this moment a man of the name of Pacilius,
                a needy and worthless man, arrives on a sudden. He says, that he is willing to
                accuse the man in his absence if he may. And Verres tells him that he may, that it
                is a thing often done, and that he will receive the accusation. So the charge is
                made. Verres immediately issues an edict that Sthenius is to appear at <placeName
                  key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> on the first of December. <milestone
                  n="95" unit="section"/> He, when he had reached <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
                  >Rome</placeName>, and had a sufficiently prosperous voyage for so unfavourable a
                time of year, and had found everything more just and gentle than the disposition of
                the praetor, his own guest, related the whole matter to his friends, and it appeared
                to them all cruel and scandalous, as indeed it was. <milestone n="39" unit="chapter"
                /></p>
              <p>Therefore Cnaeus Lentulus and Lucius Gellius the consuls immediately propose in the
                senate that it be established as a law, if it so seem good to the conscript fathers,
                &ldquo;That men be not proceeded against on capital charges in the provinces
                while they are absent.&rdquo; They relate to the senate the whole case of
                Sthenius, and the cruelty and injustice of Verres. Verres, the father of the
                praetor, was present in the senate, and with tears begged all the senators to spare
                his son, but he had not much success. For the inclination of the senate for the
                proposal of the consuls was extreme. Therefore opinions were delivered to this
                effect; &ldquo;that as Sthenius had been proceeded against in his absence, it
                seemed good to the senate that no trial should take place in the case of an absent
                man; and if anything had been done, it seemed good that it should not be
                ratified.&rdquo; <milestone n="96" unit="section"/> On that day nothing could be
                done, because it was so late, and because his father had found men to waste the time
                in speaking. Afterwards the elder Verres goes to all the defenders and connections
                of Sthenius; he begs and entreats them not to attack his son, not to be anxious
                about Sthenius; he assures them that he will take care that he suffers no injury by
                means of his son; that with that object he will send trustworthy men into <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> both by sea and land. And it wanted now about
                thirty days of the first of December, on which day he had ordered Sthenius to appear
                at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>. <milestone n="97"
                  unit="section"/> The friends of Sthenius are moved; they hope that by the letters
                and messengers of the father the Bon may be called off from his insane attempt. The
                cause is not agitated any more in the senate. Family messengers come to Verres, and
                bring him letters from his father before the first of December, before any steps
                whatever had been taken by him in Sthenius's affair; and at the same time many
                letters about the same business are brought to him from many of his friends and
                intimates. <milestone n="40" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>On this he, who had never any regard either for his duty or his danger, or for
                affection, or for humanity, when put in competition with his covetousness, did not
                think, as far as he was advised, that the authority of his father, nor, as far as he
                was entreated, that his inclination was to be preferred to the gratification of his
                own evil passions. On the morning of the first of December, according to his edict,
                he orders Sthenius to be summoned. <milestone n="98" unit="section"/> If your
                father, at the request of any friend, whether influenced by kindness or wishing to
                curry favour with him, had made that petition to you, still the inclination of your
                father ought to have had the greatest weight with you; but when he begged it of you
                for the sake of your own safety from a capital charge, and when he had sent
                trustworthy men from home, and when they had come to you at a time when the whole
                affair was still intact, could not even then a regard, if not for affection, at
                least for your own safety, bring you back to duty and to common sense? He summons
                the defendant. He does not answer. He summons the accuser. (Mark, I pray you, O
                judges; see how greatly fortune herself opposed that man's insanity, and see at the
                same time what chance aided the cause of Sthenius;) the accuser, Marcus Pacilius,
                being summoned, (I know not how it came about,) did not answer, did not appear.
                  <milestone n="99" unit="section"/> If Sthenius had been accused while present, if
                he had been detected in a manifest crime, still, as his accuser did not appear,
                Sthenius ought not to have been condemned. In truth, if a defendant could be
                condemned though his accuser did not appear, I should not have come from Vibo to
                  <placeName key="perseus,Velia">Velia</placeName> in a little boat through the
                weapons of fugitive slaves, and pirates, and through yours, at a time when all that
                haste of mine at the peril of my life was to prevent your being taken out of the
                list of defendants if I did not appear on the appointed day. If then in this trial
                of yours that was the most desirable thing by you,&mdash;namely, for me not to
                appear when I was summoned, why did you not think that it ought also to serve
                Sthenius that his accuser had not appeared? He so managed the matter that the end
                entirely corresponded to the beginning; the same man against whom he had received an
                accusation while he was absent, he condemns now when the accuser is absent.

              <p>At the very outset news was brought to him that the matter had been agitated in the

                in the public assembly Marcus Palicanus, a tribune of the people, had made a
                complaint to their of the treatment of Sthenius; lastly, that I myself had pleaded
                the cause of Sthenius before this college of the tribunes of the people, as by their

                business as I have now done to you, and had proved that this had no right to be

                was brought to him, he for a while was alarmed and agitated; he turned the blunt end
                of his pen <note anchored="yes">To turn the pen was to erase what had been written

                tablets, and by so doing he overturned the whole of his cause. For he left himself
                nothing which could be defended by any means whatever. For if he were to urge in his
                defence, &ldquo;It is lawful to take a charge against an absent man, no law
                forbids this being done in a province,&rdquo; he would seem to be putting forth
                a faulty and worthless defence, but still it would be some sort of a defence.
                Lastly, he might employ that most desperate refuge, of saying, that he had acted
                ignorantly; that he had thought that it was lawful. And although this is the worst
                defence of all, still he would seem to have said something. He erases that from his
                tablets which he had put down, and enters &ldquo;that the charge was brought
                against Sthenius while he was present.&rdquo; <milestone n="42" unit="chapter"

              <p>Here consider in how many toils he involved himself; from which he could never
                disentangle himself. In the first place, he had often and openly declared himself in
                  <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> from his tribunal, and had
                asserted to many people in private conversation, that it was lawful to take a charge
                against an absent man; that he, for example, had done so himself&mdash;which he
                had. That he was in the habit of constantly saying this, was stated at the former
                pleading by Sextus Pompeius Chlorus, a man of whose virtue I have before spoken
                highly; and by Cnaeus Pompeius Theodorus, a man approved of by the judgment of that
                most illustrious man Cnaeus Pompeius in many most important affairs, and, by
                universal consent, a most accomplished person; and by Posides Matro of Solentum, a
                man of the highest rank, of the greatest reputation and virtue. And as many as you
                please will tell you the same thing at this present trial, both men who have heard
                it from his own mouth,&mdash;some of the leading men of our order,&mdash;and
                others too who were present when the accusation was taken against Sthenius in his

                Besides, all <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> gives evidence of the

                they were instructing him in their case, and pointing out to him what matters were
                to be urged in their behalf before the senate, complained much of this misfortune of
                Sthenius, and on account of this injustice which had been done to Sthenius, resolved
                to make this demand which I have mentioned. <milestone n="104" unit="section"/> And
                as this is the ease, were you endued with such insanity and audacity, as, in a
                matter so clear, so thoroughly proved,&mdash;made so notorious even by you
                yourself, to dare to corrupt the public records? But how did you corrupt them? Did
                you not do it in such a way that, even if we all kept silence, still your own
                handwriting would be sufficient to condemn you? Give me, it you please, the
                document. Take it round to the judges; show it to them. Do you not see that the
                whole of this entry, where he states that the charge was made against Sthenius in
                his presence, is a correction? What was written there before? What blunder did he
                correct when he made that erasure? Why, O judges, do you wait for proofs of this
                charge from us? We say nothing; the books are before you, which cry out themselves
                that they have been tampered with and amended. <milestone n="105" unit="section"/>
                Do you think you can possibly escape out of this business, when we are following you
                up, not by any uncertain opinion, but by your own traces, which you have left deeply
                printed and fresh in the public documents? Has he decided, (I should like to know,)
                without hearing the cause, that Sthenius has tampered with the public documents, who
                cannot possibly defend himself from the charge of having tampered with the public
                documents in the case of that very Sthenius? <milestone n="43" unit="chapter"
                  /><milestone n="106" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>See now another instance of madness; see how, in trying to acquit himself; he
                entangles himself still more. He assigns an advocate to Sthenius.&mdash;Whom?
                Any relation or intimate friend? No.&mdash;Any citizen, any honourable and noble
                man of <placeName key="tgn,7000457">Florence</placeName>? Not even
                that.&mdash;At least it was some Sicilian, in whom there was some credit and
                dignity? Far from it.&mdash;Whom then did he assign to him? A Roman citizen. Who
                can approve of this? When Sthenius was the man of the highest rank in his city, a
                man of most extensive connections, with numberless friends; when, besides, he was of
                the greatest influence all over <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, by
                his own personal character and popularity; could he find no Sicilian who was willing
                to be appointed his advocate? Will you approve of this? Did he himself prefer a
                Roman citizen? Tell me what Sicilian, when he was defendant in any action, ever had
                a Roman citizen assigned to him as his advocate? Produce the records of all the
                praetors who preceded Verres; open them. If you find one such instance, I will then
                admit to you that this was done as you have entered it in your public documents.
                  <milestone n="107" unit="section"/> Oh but, I suppose, Sthenius thought it
                honourable to himself for Verres to choose a man for his advocate out of the number
                of Roman citizens who were his own friends and connections! Whom did he choose?
                Whose name is written in the records? Caius Claudius, the son of Caius, of the
                  <placeName key="tgn,3000935">Palatine</placeName> tribe. I do not ask who this
                Claudius is; how illustrious, how honourable, how well suited to the business, and
                deserving that, because of his influence and dignity, Sthenius should abandon the
                custom of all the Sicilians, and have a Roman citizen for his advocate. I do not ask
                any of these questions;&mdash;for perhaps Sthenius was influenced not by the
                high position of the man, but by his intimacy with him.&mdash;What? What shall
                we say if there was in the whole world a greater enemy to Sthenius than this very
                Caius Claudius, both constantly in old times, and especially at this time and in
                this affair?&mdash;if he appeared against him on the charge of tampering with
                the public documents?&mdash;if he opposed him by every means in his power? Which
                shall we believe,&mdash;that an enemy of Sthenius was actually appointed his
                advocate, or that you, at a time of the greatest danger to Sthenius, made free with
                the name of his enemy, to ensure his ruin? <milestone n="44" unit="chapter"
                  /><milestone n="108" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>And that no one may have any doubt as to the real nature of the whole transaction,
                although I feel sure that by this time that man's rascality is pretty evident to you
                all, still listen yet a little longer. Do you see that man with curly hair, of a
                dark complexion, who is looking at us with such a countenance as shows that he seems
                to himself a very clever fellow? him, I mean, who has the papers in his
                hand&mdash;who is writing&mdash;who is prompting him&mdash;who is next
                to him. That is Caius Claudius, who in <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName> was considered Verres's agent and interpreter, the manager of
                all his dirty work, a sort of colleague to Timarchides. Now he is promoted so high
                that he scarcely seems to yield to Apronius in intimacy with him; indeed he called
                himself the colleague and ally not of Timarchides, but of Verres himself. <milestone
                  n="109" unit="section"/> Now doubt, if you can, that he chose that man of all the
                world to impose the worthless character of a false advocate on, whom he knew to be
                most hostile to Sthenius, and most friendly to himself. And will you hesitate in
                this case, O judges, to punish such enormous audacity and cruelty and injustice as
                that of this man? Will you hesitate to follow the example of those judges, who, when
                they had condemned Cnaeus Dolabella, rescinded the condemnation of Philodamus of
                Opus, because a charge had been received against him not in his absence, which is of
                all things the most unjust and the most intolerable, but after a commission had been
                given him by his fellow-citizens to proceed to <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
                  >Rome</placeName> as their ambassador? That precedent which the judges, in
                obedience to the principles of equity, established in a less important cause, will
                you hesitate to adopt in a cause of the greatest consequence, especially now that it
                has been established by the authority of others? <milestone n="45" unit="chapter"
                  /><milestone n="110" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>But who was it, O Verres, whom you treated with such great, with such unexampled
                injustice? Against whom did you receive a charge in his absence? Whom did you
                condemn in his absence; not only without any crime, and without any witness, but
                even without any accuser? Who was it? O ye immortal gods! I will not say your own
                friend,&mdash;that which is the dearest title among men. I will not say your
                host,&mdash;which is the most holy name. There is nothing in Sthenius's case
                which I speak of less willingly. The only thing which I find it possible to blame
                him in is,&mdash;that he, a most moderate and upright man, invited you, a man
                full of adultery, and crime, and wickedness, to his house; that he, who had been and
                was connected by ties of hospitality with Caius Marius, with Cnaeus Pompeius, with
                Caius Marcellus, with Lucius Sisenna, your defender, and with other excellent
                citizens, added your name also to that of those unimpeachable men. <milestone
                  n="111" unit="section"/> On which account I make no complaint of violated
                hospitality, and of your abominable wickedness in violating it; I say this not to
                those who know Sthenius,&mdash;that is to say, not to any one of those who have
                been in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>; (for no one who has is
                ignorant in how great authority he lived in his own city, in what great honour and
                consideration among all the Sicilians;) but I say it that those, too, who have not
                been in the province, may be able to understand who he was in whose case you
                established such a precedent, that both on account of the iniquity of the deed, as
                well as on account of the rank of the man, it appeared scandalous and intolerable to
                every one. <milestone n="46" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="112" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>Is not Sthenius the man, he who when he had very easily obtained all the honourable
                offices in his city, executed them with the greatest splendor, and
                magnificence?&mdash;who decorated a town, not itself of the first rank, with
                most spacious places of public resort, and most splendid monuments, at his own
                expense?&mdash;on account of whose good services towards the state of Thermae,
                and towards all the Sicilians, a brazen tablet was set up in the senate-house at
                Thermae; in which mention was made of his services, and engraved at the public
                expense?&mdash;which tablet was torn down under your government, and is now
                brought hither by me, that all may know the honour in which he was held among his
                countrymen, and his preeminent dignity. <milestone n="113" unit="section"/> Is this
                the man, who when he was accused before that most illustrious man, Cnaeus Pompeius,
                and when his enemies and accusers charged him, in terms calculated to excite odium
                against him, rather than true, of having been ill affected to the republic on
                account of his intimacy and his connections of hospitality with Caius Marius, was
                acquitted by Cnaeus Pompeius with such language as showed that, from what had come
                out at that very trial, Cnaeus Pompeius judged him most worthy of his own intimacy?
                and moreover was defended and extolled by all the Sicilians in such a manner, that
                Pompeius thought that by his acquittal he had earned, not only the gratitude of the
                man himself, but that of the whole province? Lastly, is not he the man who had such
                affection towards the republic, and also such great authority among his
                fellow-citizens, that he alone in all <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName>, while you were praetor, did what not only no other Sicilian,
                but what all <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> even could not
                do,&mdash;namely, prevented you from taking away any statue, any ornament, any
                sacred vessel, or any public property from Thermae; and that too when there were
                many remarkable beautiful things there, and though you coveted everything?

                you, in whose name days of festival are kept among the Sicilians, and those splendid

                evidence, by deputations went hither with that object. You, the patron of all the
                Sicilians, the solitary state of the Mamertini, the partner of your thefts and
                crimes, praises publicly; and yet in such a way that, by a new process, the deputies
                themselves injure your cause, though the deputation praises you. These other states
                all publicly accuse you, complain of you, impeach you by letters, by deputations, by
                evidence; and, if you are acquitted, think themselves utterly ruined. <milestone

              <p>It is in the case of this man and of his property that you have erected a monument
                of your crimes and cruelty even on Mount Eryx itself; on which is inscribed the name
                Sthenius of Thermae. I saw a Cupid made of silver, with a torch. What object had
                you,&mdash;what reason was there for employing the plunder of Sthenius on that
                subject rather than on any other? Did you wish it to be a token of your own
                cupidity, or a trophy of your friendship and connection of hospitality with him, or
                a proof of your love towards him? Men, who in their excelling wickedness are pleased
                not only with their lust and pleasure itself, but also with the fame of their
                wickedness, do wish to leave in many places the marks and traces of their crimes.
                  <milestone n="116" unit="section"/> He was burning with love of that hostess for
                whose sake he had violated the laws of hospitality. He wished that not only to be
                known, but also to be recorded for ever. And therefore, out of the proceeds of that
                very action which he had performed, Agathinus being the accuser, he thought that a
                reward was especially due to Venus, who had caused the prosecution and the whole
                proceeding. I should think you grateful to the Gods if you had given this gift to
                Venus, not out of the property of Sthenius, but out of your own, as you ought to
                have done, especially as an inheritance had come to you from Chelidon that very same

                injury done to the credit of our order and of the courts of justice, had not
                compelled me to do so; and if this had been my only reason, that you had so cruelly,

                Sthenius, to whom I had formed an extraordinary attachment in my quaestorship, of
                whom I had the highest possible opinion, whom while I was in the province I knew to
                be most zealous and earnest for my reputation,&mdash;I should still think I had
                plenty of reason to incur the enmity of a most worthless man, in order to defend the
                safety and fortunes of my friend. <milestone n="118" unit="section"/> Many men have
                done the same in the times of our ancestors. Lately, too, that most eminent man
                Cnaeus Domitius did so, who accused Marcus Silanus, a man of consular rank, on
                account of the injuries done by him to Egritomarus of the Transalpine country, his
                friend. I should think it became me to follow the example of their good feeling and
                regard for their duty; and I should hold out hope to my friends and connections to
                think that they would live a safer life owing to my protection. But when the cause
                of Sthenius draws along with it the common calamity of the whole province, and when
                many of my friends and connections are being defended by me at the same time, both
                in their public and private interests, I ought not in truth to fear that any one can
                suppose that I have done what I have in undertaking this cause under the pressure
                and compulsion of any motive except that of the strictest duty. <milestone n="48"

                of Quintus Varius was corroborated, and that this whole affair was proved by the
                testimony of Caius Sacerdos, a most excellent man. You know that Cnaeus Sertius and
                Marcus Modius, Roman knights, and that six hundred Roman citizens besides, and many

                why need I dilate upon this accusation when the whole matter is set plainly forth in
                the evidence? Why should I argue about what no one can doubt? Or will any man in the

                though he was unworthy, though he was of a class from which it was not lawful to
                take senators; still, if he paid money enough to appear in his eyes a fit man to
                gain his object, so it always was. Not only the laws of the Sicilians had no
                influence in this matter, but even those which had been given to them by the senate
                and people of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> had none either. For
                the laws which he makes who has the supreme command given to him by the Roman
                people, and authority to make laws conferred on him by the senate, ought to be
                considered the laws of the senate and people of <placeName key="perseus,Rome"

                were till lately in the enjoyment of their own laws, in return for the numerous and
                great services and good deeds done both by themselves and by their ancestors to our
                republic, lately in the consulship of Lucius Licinius and Quintus Mucius, requested
                laws from our senate, as they had disputes among themselves about the elections into
                their senate. The senate, by a very honourable decree, voted that Caius Claudius
                Pulcher, the son of Appius the praetor, should give them laws to regulate their
                elections into their senate. Caius Claudius, taking as his counselors all the
                Marcelli who were then alive, with their advice gave laws to the men of Halesa in
                which he laid down many rules about the age of the men who might be elected; that no
                one might be under thirty years of age; about trade,&mdash;that no one engaged
                in it might be elected; about their income, and about all other matters; all which
                regulations prevailed till that man became praetor by the authority of our
                magistrates, and with the cordial good-will of the men of Halesa. But from him even
                a crier who was desirous of it, bought that rank for a sum of money, and boys
                sixteen and seventeen years old purchased the title of senator; and that which the
                men of Halesa, our most ancient and faithful allies and friends, had petitioned, and
                that successfully, at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, to have put on
                such a footing that it might not be lawful for men to be elected even by vote, he

              <p>The people of <placeName key="tgn,7003808">Agrigentum</placeName> have old laws
                about appointing their senate, given them by Scipio, in which the same principles
                are laid down, and this one besides,&mdash;as there are two classes of
                Agrigentines, one of the old inhabitants, and the other of the
                new,&mdash;settlers whom Titus Manlius, when praetor, had led from other towns
                of the Sicilians to <placeName key="tgn,7003808">Agrigentum</placeName>, in
                obedience to a resolution of the senate;&mdash;it was provided in the laws of
                Scipio, that there should not be a greater number of members of the senate taken
                from the class of settlers than from the old inhabitants of <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003808">Agrigentum</placeName>. That man, who had levelled all laws by
                bribery, and who had taken away all distinction between things for money, not only
                disturbed all those regulations which related to age, rank, and traffic, but even
                with respect to these two classes of old and new inhabitants, he disturbed the
                proportion of their selection. <milestone n="124" unit="section"/> For when a
                senator died of the old inhabitants, and when the remaining number of each class was
                equal, it was necessary, according to the laws, that one of the original inhabitants
                should be elected in order that there might be the larger number. And though this
                was the case, still, not only some of the original inhabitants, but also some of the
                new settlers, came to him to purchase the rank of senator. The result is, that
                through bribery, one of the new men carries the day, and gets letters of appointment
                from the praetor. The Agrigentines send deputies to him to inform him of their laws,
                and to explain to him the invariable usage of past years, in order that he might be
                aware that he had sold that rank to one with whom he had no right even to treat on
                the subject. By whose speech, as he had already received the money, he was not in
                the least influenced. <milestone n="125" unit="section"/> He did the same thing at

                Rupilius led settlers and gave them similar laws about the appointment of the
                senate, and about the number of the old and new senators. There he did not only
                receive money, as he did in the other cities, but he even confused the class of the
                original inhabitants and of the new settlers. <milestone n="51" unit="chapter"/></p>

                everything,&mdash;that no one could be made a senator while he was praetor

                due to the immortal gods. There is at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse"
                  >Syracuse</placeName> a law respecting their religion, which enjoins a priest of

                and that priesthood is considered among the Syracusans as the most honourable.

                of the three classes of citizens, the matter is decided by lot. He by his absolute
                command had contrived to have his intimate friend Theomnastus returned among the
                three by vote. When it came to the decision by lot, which he could not command, men
                were waiting to see what he would do. The fellow at first forbade them to elect by
                lot, as that seemed the easiest way, and ordered Theomnastus to be appointed without
                casting lots. The Syracusans say that cannot possibly be done, according to the
                reverence due to their sacred laws; they say it would be impious. He orders the law
                to be read to him. It is read. In it was written, &ldquo;that as many lots were
                to be thrown into the urn as there were names returned; that he whose name was drawn
                was to have the priesthood.&rdquo; He then, ingenious and clever man! said,
                &ldquo;Capital! it is written, &lsquo;As many lots as there are names
                returned;&rsquo; how many names then were returned?&rdquo; It is answered,
                &ldquo;Three.&rdquo; &ldquo;Is there then anything necessary except that
                three lots should be put in, and one drawn out?&rdquo;
                &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; He orders three lots to be put in, on all of which
                was written the name of Theomnastus. A great outcry arises as it seemed to every one
                a scandalous and infamous proceeding. And so by these means that most honourable
                priesthood is given to Theomnastus. <milestone n="52" unit="chapter"/><milestone

              <p>At Cephalaedium there is a regular month, in which the pontifex is bound to be
                appointed. A man of the name of Artemo, surnamed Climachias, was desirous of that
                honour a man of sufficient riches to be sure, and of noble family; but he could not
                possibly have been appointed if a man of the name of Herodotus had been present. For
                that place and rank was thought to be so decidedly due to him for that year, that
                even Climachias could say nothing against him. The matter is referred to Verres, and
                is decided according to his usual fashion. Some beautiful and valuable specimens of
                carving are removed from Artemo's. Herodotus was at <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
                  >Rome</placeName>; he thought that he should arrive in time enough for the comitia
                if he came the day before. Verres, in order that the comitia might not be held in
                any other month than the regular one, and that the honour might not be refused to
                Herodotus when he was present, (a thing which he was not anxious for, and which
                Climachias was very eager to avoid,) contrives, (I have said before, there is no one
                cleverer, and never was, in his way,)&mdash;he contrives, I say, how the comitia
                may be held in the regular month for them, and yet Herodotus may not be able to be
                present. <milestone n="129" unit="section"/> It is a custom of the Sicilians, and of
                the rest of the Greeks, because they wish their days and months to agree with the
                calculations as to the sun and moon, if there be any difference sometimes to take
                out a day, or, at most, two days from a month, which they call <foreign lang="greek"
                  >e)caire/simoi</foreign>. And so also they sometimes make a month longer by a day
                or by two days. And when he heard of that, he, this new astronomer, who was thinking
                not so much of the heavens as of the heavy plate, <note anchored="yes">The original
                  puns on the resemblance between <foreign lang="la">caelum</foreign>,

                  &ldquo;carved&rdquo; or &ldquo;chased.&rdquo;</note> he orders
                (not a day to be taken out of the month, but) a month and a half to be taken out of
                the year; so that the day which, as one may say, ought to have been the thirteenth
                of January, became the first of March. And that is done in spite of the
                remonstrances and indignation of every one. That was the legitimate day for holding
                the comitia. On that day Climachias is declared to have been elected priest.

                thirty days before. Then the people of Cephalaedium voted an intercalary month of
                forty-five days, in order that the rest of the months might fall again into their
                proper season. If these things could be done at <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
                  >Rome</placeName>, no doubt he would somehow or other have contrived to have the

              <p>But now it is worth while to see how the censors were appointed in <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> while that man was praetor. For that is the
                magistracy among the Sicilians, the appointments to which are made by the people
                with the greatest care, because all the Sicilians pay a yearly tax in proportion to
                their incomes; and, in making the census, the power is entrusted to the censor of
                making every sort of valuation, and of determining the total amount of every man's
                contribution. Therefore the people choose with the greatest care the man in whom
                they can place the greatest confidence in a matter affecting their own property; and
                on account of the greatness of the power, this magistracy is an object of the
                greatest ambition. <milestone n="132" unit="section"/> In such a matter, Verres did
                not choose to do any thing obscurely, nor to play tricks in the drawing of lots, nor
                to take days out of the calendar. He did not choose to do anything in an underhand
                manner, or by means of artifice; but in order to take away the fondness and desire
                for honours and ambition out of every city, feelings which usually tend to the ruin
                of a state, he declared that he should appoint the censors in every city.<milestone
                  n="133" unit="section"/> When the praetor announced so vast a scene of bargaining
                and trafficking as that, people came to <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse"
                  >Syracuse</placeName> to see him, from all quarters. The whole of the praetor's
                house was on fire with the eagerness and cupidity of men; and no wonder, when all
                the comitia of so many cities were packed together into one house, and when all the
                ambition of an entire province was confined in one chamber. Bribes being openly
                asked for, and biddings being openly made, Timarchides appointed two censors for
                every city. He, by his own labour, and by his own visits to every one, by all the
                trouble which he took in this employment, achieved this, that all the money came to
                Verres without his having any anxiety on his part. How much money this Timarchides
                made, you cannot as yet know; for a certainty; but in what a variety of manners, and
                how shamefully, he plundered people, you heard at the former pleading, by the
                evidence of many witnesses. <milestone n="54" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="134"

              <p>But that you may not wonder how that freedman obtained so much influence with him,
                I will tell you briefly what the man is; so that you may both see the worthlessness
                of the man who kept such a fellow about him, especially in that employment and
                position, and that you may also see the misery of the province. In the seduction of
                women, and in all licentiousness and wickedness of that character, I found this
                Timarchides wonderfully fitted by nature to be subservient to his infamous lusts,
                and unexampled profligacy. In finding out who people were, in calling on them, in
                addressing them, in bribing them, in doing anything in matters of that sort, however
                cunningly, however audaciously, however shamelessly it might be necessary to go to
                work, I heard that this man could contrive admirable schemes for ensuring success.
                For, as for Verres himself, he was only a man of a covetousness ever open-mouthed,
                and ever threatening, but he had no ingenuity, no resources; so that, in whatever he
                did of his own accord, (just as you know was the case with him at <placeName
                  key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>,) he seemed to rob openly rather than to
                cheat. <milestone n="135" unit="section"/> But the other fellow's skill and artifice
                were marvellous, so that he could hunt out and scent out with the greatest
                acuteness, all over the province, whatever had happened to any one, whatever any one
                stood in need of. He was able to find out, to converse with, to tamper with every
                one's foes, and every one's enemies; to know the circumstances of every trial on
                both sides; to ascertain men's inclinations, and power, and resources; where it was
                necessary to strike terror; where it was desirable to hold out hope. Every accuser,
                every informer, he had in his power, if he wished to cause trouble to any one, he
                did it without any difficulty. All Verres's decrees, and commands, and letters, he
                sold in the most skillful and cunning manner. <milestone n="136" unit="section"/>
                And he was not only the minister of Verres's pleasures, he also took equally good
                care of himself. He not only picked up whatever money had slipped through his
                principal's fingers, by which he amassed great riches, but he also picked up the
                relics of his pleasures and of his profligacy. Therefore do not fancy that Athenio
                  <note anchored="yes">Athenio was a Cilician slave who had headed a revolt of

                matrons, the property, and all the fortunes of the most ancient and most devoted
                allies of the Roman people were all that time in the power of Timarchides. He
                therefore, as I say, he, Timarchides, sent censors into every city, having taken
                bribes for their appointment. Comitia for the election of censors, while Verres was
                praetor, were never held not even for the purpose of making a presence of legality.
                  <milestone n="55" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="137" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>This was the most shameless business of all. Three hundred denarii were openly
                exacted (for this, forsooth, was permitted by the laws) from each censor, to be paid
                down for the praetors statue. There were appointed a hundred and thirty censors.
                They gave one sum of money for the censorship contrary to the law; these thirty-nine
                thousand denarii they openly paid down for the statue, in compliance with the laws.
                First of all, what was all that money for? Secondly, why did the censors pay it to
                you for your statue? I suppose there is a regular order of censors, a college of
                them. They are a distinct class of men! Why, it is either cities in their capacity
                of communities, that confer these honours, or men according to their classes, as
                cultivators, as merchants, as shipowners. But why to censors rather than to aediles?
                Is it for any service that they have done? Therefore, will you confess that these
                things were begged of you,&mdash;for you will not dare to say they were
                purchased of you;&mdash;that you granted those magistracies to men out of
                favour, and not with a new to the interests of the republic? And when you confess
                this, will any one doubt that you incurred that unpopularity held hatred among the
                different tribes of that province, not out of ambition, nor for the sake of doing a
                kindness to any one, but with the object of procuring money? <milestone n="138"
                  unit="section"/> Therefore those censors did the same thing that those do in our
                republic, who have got offices by bribery; they took care to use their power so as
                to fill up again that gap in their property. The census was so taken, when you were
                praetor, that the affairs of no state whatever could be administered according to
                such a census. For they made a low return of the incomes of all the richest men, and
                exaggerated that of each poor man. And so in levying the taxes so heavy a burden was
                laid upon the common people, that even if the men themselves said nothing, the facts
                alone would discredit that census, as may easily be understood from the
                circumstances themselves. <milestone n="56" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>For Lucius Metellus who, after I came into <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName> for the sake of prosecuting my injuries, became on a sudden
                after the arrival of Letilius not only the friend of Verres, but even his relative;
                because he saw that that census could not possibly stand, ordered that former one to
                be attended to which had been when that most gallant and upright man, Sextus
                Peducaeus, was praetor. For at that time there were censors made according to the
                laws, elected by their cities, in whose case, if they did anything wrong,
                punishments were appointed by the law. <milestone n="139" unit="section"/> But when
                you were praetor, how could the censor either fear the law, by which he was not
                bound, since he had not been created by the law; or fear your reproof for having
                sold what he had bought of you? Let Metellus now detain my witnesses&mdash;let
                him compel others to praise him, as he has attempted in many instances; only let him
                do what he is doing. For whoever was treated by any one with such insult, with so
                much ignominy? Every fifth year a census is taken of all <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>. A census was taken when Peducaeus was
                praetor. When the five years had elapsed in your praetorship, a census was taken
                again. The next year Lucius Metellus forbids any mention to be made of your census;
                he says that censors must be created afresh; and in the meantime he orders the
                census of Peducaeus to be attended to. If an enemy of yours had done this to you,
                although the province would have borne it with great equanimity, still it would have
                seemed the severe decision of an enemy. A new friend, a voluntary relation did it.
                For he could not do otherwise, if he wished to retain the province in its
                allegiance, if he wished to live himself in safety in the province <milestone n="57"
                  unit="chapter"/><milestone n="140" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>Are you waiting to see what these men also will decide? If he had deprived you of
                your office, he would have treated you with less insult, than when he abrogated and
                annulled the things which you had done in your office. Nor did he behave in this way
                in that matter alone, but he had done the same in many other matters of the greatest
                importance, before I arrived in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>. For
                he ordered your friends, the palaestra people, to restore his property to Heraclius
                the Syracusan, and the people of Bidis to restore his property to Epicrates, and
                Appius Claudius his to his ward at <placeName key="tgn,7003849"
                >Drepanum</placeName>; and, if Letilius had not arrived in <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> with letters a little too soon, in less than
                thirty days Metellus would have annulled your whole three years' praetorship.
                  <milestone n="141" unit="section"/>
              </p>
              <p>And, since I have spoken of that money which the censors paid to you for your
                statue, it seems to me that I ought not to pass over that method of raising money,
                which you exacted from the cities on presence of erecting statues. For I see that
                the sum total of that money is very large, amounting to a hundred and twenty
                thousand <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign>. This much is proved by the evidence
                and letters of the cities. And he admits that, and indeed he cannot say otherwise.
                What sort of conduct then are we to think that which he denies, when these actions
                which he confesses are so infamous? For what do you wish to be believed? That all
                that money was spent in statues?&mdash;Suppose it was. Still this is by no means
                to be endured, that the allies should be robbed of so much money, in order that
                statues of a most infamous robber may be placed in every alley, where it appears
                scarcely possible to pass in safety. <milestone n="58" unit="chapter"/><milestone
                  n="142" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>But where in the world, or on what statues, was that enormous sum of money spent?
                It will be spent, you will say. Let us, forsooth, wait for the recurrence of that
                regular five years. If in this interval he has not spent it then at last we will
                impeach him for embezzlement in the article of statues. He is brought before the
                court as a criminal on many most important charges. We see that a hundred and twenty
                thousand <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign> have been taken on this one account.
                If you are condemned, you will not, I presume, trouble yourself about having that
                money spent on statues within five years. If you are acquitted, who will be so
                insane as to attack you in five years' time on the subject of the statues, after you
                have escaped from so many and such grave charges? If, therefore, this money has not
                been spent as yet, and if it is evident that it will not be spent, we may understand
                that a plan has been found out by which he may take and appropriate to himself a
                hundred and twenty thousand <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign> at one swoop, and
                by which others too, if this is sanctioned by you, may take as large sums as ever
                they please on similar grounds; so that we shall appear not to deter men from taking
                money, but, as we approve of some methods of taking money, we shall seem rather to
                be giving decent names to the basest actions. <milestone n="143" unit="section"/> In
                truth, suppose, for example, that Caius Verres had demanded a hundred and twenty
                thousand <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign> from the people of Centuripa, and
                had taken this money from them; there would have been no doubt, I conceive, that, if
                that were proved, he must have been condemned.&mdash;What then? Suppose he
                demanded three hundred thousand <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign> of the same
                people; and compelled them to give them, and carried them off? Shall he be acquitted
                because it was entered in the accounts that that money was given for statues? I
                think not; unless, indeed, our object is to create, not an unwillingness to take
                money on the part of our magistrates, but a cause for giving it on the part of our
                allies. But if statues are a great delight to any one, and if any one is greatly
                attracted by the honour and glory of having them raised to him, still he must lay
                down these rules; first of all, that he must not take to his own house the money
                given for those purposes; secondly, that there must be some limit to those statues;
                and lastly, that at all events they must not be exacted from unwilling people.
                  <milestone n="59" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="144" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>And concerning the embezzlement of the money, I ask of you whether the cities
                themselves were accustomed to let out contracts for erecting statues to the man who
                would take the contract on the best terms, or to appoint some surveyor to
                superintend the erection of the statues, or to pay the money to you, or to any one
                whom you appointed? For the statues were erected under the superintendence of those
                men by whom that honour was paid to you&mdash;I am glad to hear it; but, if that
                money was paid to Timarchides, cease I beg of you, to pretend that you were desirous
                of glory and of monuments when you are detected is so evident a robbery. What then?
                Is there to be no limit to statues? But there must be. Indeed, consider the matter
                in this way. <milestone n="145" unit="section"/> The city of <placeName
                  key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> (to speak of that city in preference
                to others) gave him a statue;&mdash;it is an honour: and gave his father
                one;&mdash;a pretty and profitable picture of affection: and gave his son
                one;&mdash;this may be endured, for they did not hate the boy: still how often,
                and for how many individuals will you take statues from the Syracusans? You accepted
                one to be placed in the forum. You compelled them to place one in the senate-house.
                You ordered them to contribute money for those statues which were to be erected at
                  <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. You ordered that the same men
                should also contribute as agriculturists, they did so. You ordered the same men also
                to pay their contribution to the common revenue of <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName>; even that they did also. When one city contributed money on
                so many different presences, and when the other cities did the same, does not the
                fact itself warn you to think that some bounds must be put to this covetousness? But
                if no city did this of its own accord; if all of them only paid you this money for
                statues because they were induced to do so by your command, by fear, by force, by
                injury; then, O ye immortal gods, can it be doubtful to any one, that, even if any
                one were to establish a law, that it was allowable to accept money for statues,
                still he would also establish one, that at all events it was not allowable to extort
                it? <milestone n="146" unit="section"/> First, therefore, I will cite the whole of
                  <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> as a witness on this point; and
                  <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> declares to me with one voice that
                an immense sum of money was extorted from her by force under the name of providing
                statues. For the deputations of all the cities, in their common
                petitions&mdash;nearly all of which have arisen from your
                injuries,&mdash;have inserted this demand also; &ldquo;that they might not
                for the future promise statues to any one till he had left the province.&rdquo;
                  <milestone n="60" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>There have been many praetors in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>.
                Often, in the times of our ancestors, the Sicilians have approached the senate;
                often in the memory of the present generation; but it is your praetorship that has
                introduced and originated a new kind of petition. <milestone n="147" unit="section"
                /> For what else is so strange, not only in the matter but in the very form of the
                petition? For other points which occur in the same petitions with reference to your
                injuries, are indeed novel, but still they are not urged in a novel manner. The
                Sicilians beg and entreat of the conscript fathers that our magistrates may
                henceforth sell the tenths according to the law of Hiero. You were the first who had
                sold them in a way contrary to that law.&mdash;That they may not put a money
                value on the corn which is ordered for the public granary. This, too, is now
                requested for the first time on account of your three denarii: <note anchored="yes"
                  >See the note on the next oration, &ldquo;<title>De Re
                  Frumentaria</title>,&rdquo; for an explanation of this; and on points
                  connected with the topic of corn, and the <foreign lang="la">societas</foreign> of
                  the <foreign lang="la">publicani</foreign>, see the Argument of the next
                  oration.</note> but that kind of petition is not unprecedented.&mdash;That a
                charge be not taken against any one in his absence. This has arisen from the
                misfortune of Sthenius, and your tyranny.&mdash;I will not enumerate the other
                points. All the demands of the Sicilians are of such a nature that they look like
                charges collected against you alone as a criminal. Still all these, though they
                refer to new injuries, preserve the ordinary form of requests. <milestone n="148"
                  unit="section"/> But this request about the statues must seem ridiculous to the
                man who is not acquainted with the facts and with the meaning of it; for they
                entreat that they may not be compelled to erect statues;&mdash;what then? That
                they may not be allowed to do so;&mdash;what does this mean? Do you request of
                me not to be allowed to do what it depends on yourself to do or not? Ask rather that
                no one may compel you to promise a statue, or to erect one against your will. I
                shall do no good, says he; for they will all deny that they compelled me to do so:
                if you wish for my preservation, put this violence on me,&mdash;that it may be
                utterly illegal for me to make such a promise. It is from your praetorship that such
                a request as this has taken its rise; and those who employ it, intimate and openly
                declare that they, entirely against their will, contributed money for your statues,
                being compelled by fear and violence. <milestone n="149" unit="section"/> Even
                suppose they did not say this, still, would it not be impossible for you to avoid
                confessing it? See and consider what defence you are going to adopt; for then you
                will understand that you must confess this about the statues. <milestone n="61"
                  unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>For I am informed that your cause is planned out in this way by your advocates, men
                of great ingenuity, and that you are instructed and trained by them in this way;
                that, as each influential and honourable man from the province of <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> gives an energetic testimony against you, as
                many of the lending Sicilians have already done to a great extent, you are
                immediately to say to your defenders, &ldquo;That man is an enemy of mine
                because he is an agriculturist. And so, I suppose, you have it in your mind to set
                aside the class of agriculturists, saving that they have come with a hostile and
                inimical disposition towards Verres because he was a little strict in collecting the
                tenths. The agriculturists, then, are all your enemies, all your adversaries. There
                is not one of them who does not wish you dead. Altogether you are admirably well
                off, when that order and class of men which is the most virtuous and honourable, by
                which both the republic in general, and most especially that province upheld, as
                fixedly hostile to you. <milestone n="150" unit="section"/> However, be it so;
                another time we will consider of the disposition of the agriculturists and of their
                injuries. For the present I assume, what you grant me, that they are most hostile to
                you. You say, forsooth, on account of the tenths. I grant that; I do not inquire
                whether they are enemies with or without reason. What then is the meaning of those
                gilt equestrian statues which greatly offend the feelings and eyes of the Roman
                people, near the temple of <persName><surname>Vulcan</surname></persName>? For I
                see an inscription on them stating that the agriculturists had presented one of
                them. If they gave this statue to do you honour, they are not your enemies. Let us
                believe the witnesses; for then they were consulting your honour, now they are
                regarding their own consciences. But if they presented the statues under the
                compulsion of fear, you must confess that you exacted money in the province on
                account of statues by violence and fear. Choose whichever alternative you like.
                  <milestone n="62" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="151" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>In truth I would willingly now abandon this charge about the statues, to have you
                admit to me, what would be most honourable to you, that the agriculturists
                contributed this money for a statue to do you honour, of their own free will. Grant
                me this. In a moment you cut from under your feet the principal part of your
                defence. For then you will not be able to say that the agriculturists were angry
                with and enemies to you. O singular cause; O miserable and ruinous defence; for the
                defendant, and he too a defendant who has been praetor in <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, to be unwilling to receive an admission from
                his accuser that the agriculturists erected him a statue of their own free will,
                that they have a good opinion of him, that they are his friends, that they desire
                his safety! He is afraid of your believing this, for he is overwhelmed with the
                evidence given against him by the agriculturists. <milestone n="152" unit="section"
                /> I will avail myself of what is granted to me; at all events you must judge that
                those men, who, as he himself wishes it to be believed, are most hostile to him, did
                not contribute money for his honour and for his monuments of their own free will.
                And that this may be most easily understood, ask any one you please of the witnesses
                whom I shall produce, who are witnesses from <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName>, whether a Roman citizen or a Sicilian, and one too who
                appears most hostile to you, who says that he has been plundered by you, whether he
                contributed anything in his own name to the statue? You will not find one man to
                deny it In truth they all contributed. <milestone n="153" unit="section"/> Do you
                think then that any one will doubt that he who ought to be most hostile to you, who
                has received the severest injuries from you, paid money on account of a statue to
                you because he was compelled by violence and authoritative command, not out of
                kindness and by his own free will? And I have neither counted up, nor been able to
                count, O judges, the amount of this money, which is very large, and which has been
                most shamelessly extorted from unwilling men, so as to estimate how much was
                extorted from agriculturists, how much from traders who trade at <placeName

              <p>I come now to the cities of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, in
                which case it is exceedingly easy to form an opinion of their inclination. Did the
                Sicilians also contribute against their will? It is not probable. In truth it is
                evident that Caius Verres so conducted himself during his praetorship in <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, that, as he could not satisfy both parties,
                both the Sicilians and the Romans, he considered rather his duty to our allies, than
                his ambition, which might have prompted him to gratify the citizens. And therefore I
                saw him called in an inscription at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse"
                  >Syracuse</placeName>, not only the patron of that island, but also the saviour of
                it. What a great expression is this! so great that it cannot be expressed by any
                single Latin word. He in truth is a saviour, who has given salvation. In his name
                days of festival are kept&mdash;that fine Verrean festival&mdash;not as if
                it was the festival of Marcellus, but instead of the Marcellean festival, which they
                abolished at his command. His triumphal arch is in the forum at <placeName
                  key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, on which his son stands, naked; and
                he himself from horseback looks down on the province which has been stripped bare by
                himself. His statues are in every place; which seem to show this, that he very
                nearly erected as many statues at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse"
                  >Syracuse</placeName> as he had taken away from it. And even at <placeName
                  key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> we see an inscription in his honour carved at
                the foot of the statues, in letters of the largest size, &ldquo;that that were
                given by the community of <placeName key="tgn,7003122"

                believe that such great honours were paid to him by people against their will?

              <p>Here, too, you must deliberate and consider even much more than you did in the case
                of the agriculturists, what you intend. It is an important matter. Do you wish the
                Sicilians, both in their public and private capacity, to be considered friends to
                you, or enemies? If enemies, what is to become of you? Whither will you free for
                refuge? On what will you depend? Just now you repudiated the greater part of the
                agriculturists, most honourable and wealthy men, both Sicilians and Roman citizens.
                Now, what will you do about the Sicilian cities? Will you say that the Sicilians are
                friendly to you? How can you say so? They who (though they have never done such a
                thing in the instance of any one else before, as to give public evidence against

                condemned, and only two, who have been prosecuted, have been
                acquitted)&mdash;they, I say, who now come with letters, with commissions, with
                public testimonies against you, while, if they were to utter a panegyric on you in
                behalf of their state, they would appear to do so according to their usual custom,
                rather than because of your deserts. When these men make a public complaint of your
                actions, do they not show this that your injuries have been so great that they
                preferred to depart from their ancient habit, rather than not speak of your habits?
                  <milestone n="156" unit="section"/> You must, therefore, inevitably confess that
                the Sicilians are hostile to you; since they have addressed to the consuls petitions
                of the gravest moment directed against you, and have entreated me to undertake this
                cause, and the advocacy of their safety; since, though they were forbidden to come
                by the praetor, and hindered by four quaestors, they still have thought every one's
                threats and every danger insignificant, in comparison with their safety; since at
                the former pleading they gave their evidence so earnestly and so bitterly, that
                Hortensius said that Artemo, the deputy of Centuripa, end the witness authorized by
                the public council there, was an accuser, not a witness. In truth he, together with
                Andron, a most honourable and trustworthy man, both on account of his virtue and
                integrity, and also on account of his eloquence, was appointed by his
                fellow-citizens as their deputy in order that he might be able to explain in the

                persuade us that these men contributed large sums of money to confer honour and
                dignity on you of their own free will? I suppose, forsooth, they who did not like
                you to remain in safety in your own city, wished to have memorials of your person
                and name in their own cities! The facts show that they wished it. For I have been
                for some time thinking that I was handling the argument about the inclination of the
                Sicilians towards you too tenderly, as to whether they were desirous to erect
                statues to you, or were compelled to do so. <milestone n="158" unit="section"/> What
                man ever lived of whom such a thing was heard as has happened to you, that his
                statues in his province, erected in the public places, and some of them even in the
                holy temples, were thrown down by force by the whole population? There have been
                many guilty magistrates in <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, many in

                a thing as this of any of them? It is an unexampled thing, O judges, a sort of
                prodigy amazing the Sicilians, and among all the Greeks. I would not have believed
                that story about the statues, if I had not seen them myself uprooted and lying on
                the ground; because it is a custom among all the Greeks to think that honours paid
                to men by monuments of that sort, are, to some extent, consecrated, and under the
                protection of the gods. <milestone n="159" unit="section"/> Therefore, when the
                Rhodians, almost single-handed, carried on the first war against Mithridates, and
                withstood all his power and his most vigorous attacks on their walls, and shores,
                and fleets,&mdash;when they, beyond all other nations, were enemies to the king;
                still, even then, at the time of imminent danger to their city, they did not touch
                his statue which was among them in the most frequented place in their city. Perhaps
                there might seem some inconsistency in preserving the effigy and image of the man,
                when they were striving to overthrow the man himself: but still I saw, when I was
                among them, that they had a religious feeling in those matters handed down to them
                from their ancestors, and that they argued in this way;&mdash;that as to the
                statue, they regarded the period when it had been erected; but as to the man, they
                regarded the fact of his waging war against them, and being an enemy. <milestone

              <p> You see, therefore, that the custom and religious feeling of the Greeks, which is
                accustomed to defend the monuments of enemies, even at a time of actual war, could
                not, even in a time of profound peace, protect the statues of a praetor of the Roman

                from the injuries of our magistrates, owing to the protection the treaty was to
                them; yet even they did not hesitate to overturn that man's statue. But when that
                was removed, they allowed the pedestal to remain in the forum, because they thought
                it would tell more strongly against him, if men knew that his statue had been thrown
                down by the Tauromenians, than if they thought that none had ever been erected. The
                men of Tyndarus threw down his statue in the forum; and for the same reason left the
                horse without a rider. At Leontini, even in that miserable and desolate city, his
                statue in the gymnasium was thrown down. For why should I speak of the Syracusans,
                when that act was not a private act of the Syracusans, but was done by them in
                common with all their neighbouring allies, and withal most the whole province? How
                great a multitude, how vast a concourse of men is said to have been present when his
                statues were pulled down and overturned! But where was this done? In the most
                frequented and sacred place of the whole city; before Serapis himself, in the very
                entrance and vestibule of the temple. And if Metellus had not acted with great
                vigour, and by his authority, and by a positive edict forbidden it, there would not
                have been a trace of a statue of that man left in all <placeName key="tgn,7003122"

              <p>The senate of Centuripa decreed, and the people ordered, that the quaestors should
                issue a contract for taking down whatever statues there were of Caius Verres
                himself, of his father, and of his son; and that while such demolition was being
                executed, there should be not less than thirty senators present. Remark the
                soberness and dignity of that city. They neither chose that those statues should
                remain in their city which they themselves had given against their will, under the
                pressure of authority and violence; nor the statues of that man, against whom they
                themselves (a thing which they never did before) had sent by a public vote
                commissions and deputies, with the most weighty testimony, to <placeName
                  key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. And they thought that it would be a more
                important thing if it seemed to have been done by public authority, than by the
                violence of the multitude. <milestone n="162" unit="section"/> When, in pursuance of
                this design, the people of Centuripa had publicly destroyed his statues, Metellus
                hears of it. He is very indignant; he summons before him the magistrates of
                Centuripa and the ten principal citizens. He threatens them with measures of great
                severity, if they do not replace the statues. They report the matter to the senate.
                The statues, which could do no good to his cause, are replaced; the decrees of the
                people of Centuripa, which had been passed concerning the statues, are not taken
                away. Here I can excuse some of the actors. I cannot at all excuse Metellus, a wise
                man, if he acts foolishly. What? did he think it would look like a crime in Verres,
                if his statues were thrown down, a thing which is often done by the wind, or by some
                accident? There could be in such a fact as that no charge against the man, no
                reproof of him Whence, then, does the charge and accusation arise? From the
                intention and will of the people by whom it was caused. <milestone n="68"

              <p>I, if Metellus had not compelled the men of Centuripa to replace the statues,
                should say, &ldquo;See, O judges, what exceeding and bitter indignation the
                injuries of that man have implanted in the minds of our allies and friends; when
                that most friendly and faithful city of Centuripa, which is, connected with the
                Roman people by so many reciprocal good offices, that it has not only always loved
                our republic, but has also shown its attachment to the very name of Roman in the
                person of every private individual, has decided by public resolution and by the
                public authority that the statues of Caius Verres ought not to exist in
                it.&rdquo; I should recite the decrees of the people of Centuripa; I should
                extol that city, as with the greatest truth I might; I should relate that ten
                thousand of those citizens, the bravest and most faithful of our
                allies,&mdash;that every one of the whole people resolved, that there ought to
                be no monument of that man in their city. I should say this if Metellus had not
                replaced the statues. <milestone n="164" unit="section"/> I should now wish to ask
                of Metellus himself, whether by his power and authority he has at all weakened my
                speech? I think the very same language is still appropriate. For, even if the
                statues were ever so much thrown down, I could not show them to you on the ground.
                This only statement could I use, that so wise a city had decided that the statues of
                Caius Verres ought to be demolished. And this argument Metellus has not taken from
                me. He has even given me this additional one; he has enabled me to complain, if I
                thought fit, that authority is exercised over our friends and allies with so much
                injustice, that, even in the services they do people, they are not allowed to use
                their own unbiased judgment; he has enabled me to entreat you to form your
                conjectures, how you suppose Lucius Metellus behaved to me in those matters in which
                he was able to injure me, when he behaved with such palpable partiality in this one
                in which he could be no hindrance to me. But I am not angry with Metellus, nor do I
                wish to rob him of his excuse which he puts forth to every one, that he did nothing
                spitefully nor with any especial design. <milestone n="69" unit="chapter"

              <p>Now, therefore, it is so evident that you cannot deny it, that no statue was given
                to you with the good will of any one; no money on account of statues, that was not
                squeezed out and extorted by force. And, in making that charge, I do not wish that

                my enemies, because I defended the interests and rights of the allies.&rdquo;
                But the allies complain that they were considered and treated by you as enemies.
                &ldquo;The agriculturists are hostile to me on account of the tenths.&rdquo;
                Well; they who cultivate land untaxed and free from this impost; why do they hate
                you? why do the men of Halesa, of Centuripa, of Segesta, of Halicya hate you? What
                race of men, what number of men, what rank of men can you name that does not hate
                you, whether they be Roman citizens or Sicilians? So that even if I could not give a
                reason for their hating you, still I should think that the fact ought to be
                mentioned and that you also O judges, ought to hate the man whom all men hate.

                Who will dare to touch this man? Can you then say that the evidence of
                agriculturists, of traders, and of all the Sicilians against you, ought to be no
                objection to you, when you hoped to be able to extinguish all your unpopularity and
                infamy by placing their names in an inscription on your statues? Or, if you
                attempted to add honour to your statues by their authority, shall I not be able to
                corroborate my argument by the dignity of those same men? <milestone n="169"
                  unit="section"/> Unless, perchance, in that matter, some little hope still
                consoles you, because you were popular among the farmers of the revenues: but I have
                taken care, through my diligence, that that popularity should not
                serve,&mdash;you have contrived, by your own wisdom, to show that it ought to
                be, an injury to you. Listen, O judges, to the whole affair in a few words.
                  <milestone n="70" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>In the collecting the tax on pasture lands in <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName> there is a sub-collector of the name of Lucius Carpinatius,
                who both for the sake of his own profit, and perhaps because he thought it for the
                interest of his partners, cultivated the favour of Verres to the neglect of
                everything else. He, while he was attending the praetor about all the markets, and
                never leaving him, had got into such familiarity with, and aptitude at the practice
                of selling Verres's decrees and decisions, and managing his other concerns, that he
                was considered almost a second Timarchides. <milestone n="170" unit="section"/> He
                was in one respect still more important; because he also lent money at usury to
                those who were purchasing anything of the praetor. And this usury, O judges, was
                such that even the profit from the other transactions was inferior to the gain
                obtained by it. For the money which he entered as paid to those with whom he was
                dealing, he entered also under the name of Verres's secretary, or of Timarchides, or
                even under Verres's own name, as received from them. And besides that, he lent other
                large sums belonging to Verres, of which he made no entry at all, in his own name.
                  <milestone n="171" unit="section"/> Originally this Carpinatius, before he had
                become so intimate with Verres, had often written letters to the shareholders about
                his unjust actions. But Canuleius, who had an agency at <placeName
                  key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, in the harbour, had also written
                accounts to his shareholders of many of Verres's robberies, giving instances,
                especially, concerning things which had been exported from <placeName
                  key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> without paying the harbour dues. But
                the same company was farming both the harbour dues and the taxes on pasture land.
                And thus it happened that there were many things which we could state and produce
                against Verres from the letters of that company. <milestone n="172" unit="section"/>
                But it happened that Carpinatius, who had by this time become connected with him by
                the greatest intimacy, and also by community of interests, afterwards sent frequent
                letters to his partners, speaking of his exceeding kindness, and of his services to
                their common property. And in truth, as he was used to do and to decree everything
                which Carpinatius requested him, Carpinatius also began to write still more flaming
                accounts to his shareholders, in order, if possible, utterly to efface the
                recollection of all that he had written before. But at last, when Verres was
                departing, he sent letters to them, to beg them to go out in crowds to meet him and
                to give him thanks; and to promise zealously that they would do whatever he desired
                them. And the shareholders did so, according to the old custom of farmers; not
                because they thought him deserving of any honour, but because they thought it was
                for their own interest to be thought to remember kindness, and to be grateful for
                it. They expressed their thanks to him, and said that Carpinatius had often sent
                letters to them mentioning his good offices. <milestone n="71" unit="chapter"
                  /><milestone n="173" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>When he had made answer that he had done those things gladly, and had greatly
                extolled the services of Carpinatius, he charges a friend of his, who at that time
                was the chief collector of that company, to take care diligently, and to make sure
                that there was nothing in any of the letters of any of the partners which could tell
                against his safety and reputation. Accordingly he, having got rid of the main body
                of the shareholders, summons the collectors of the tenths, and communicates the
                business to them. They resolve and determine that those letters in which any attack
                was made on the character of Caius Verres shall be removed, and that care he taken
                that that business shall not by any possibility be any injury to Caius Verres.
                  <milestone n="174" unit="section"/> If I prove that the collectors of the truths
                passed this resolution,&mdash;if I make it evident that, according to this
                decree, the letters were removed, what more would you wait for? Can I produce to you
                any affair more absolutely decided? Can I bring before your tribunal any criminal
                more fully condemned? But condemned by whose judgment? By that, forsooth, of those
                men whom they who wish for severe tribunals think ought to decide on
                causes,&mdash;by the judgment of the farmers, whom the people is now demanding
                to have for judges, and concerning whom, that we may have them for judges, we at
                this moment see a law proposed, not by a man of our body, not by a man born of the
                equestrian order, not by a man of the noblest birth: <milestone n="175"
                  unit="section"/> the collectors of the tenths, that is to say, the chiefs, and, as
                it were, the senators of the farmers, voted that these letters should be removed out
                of sight. I have men, who were present, whom I can produce, to whom I will entrust
                this proof, most honourable and wealthy men, the very chief of the equestrian order,
                on whose high credit the very speech and cause of the man who has proposed this law
                mainly relies. They shall come before you; they shall say what they deter mined.
                Indeed, if I know the men properly, they will not speak falsely For they were able,
                indeed, to put letters to their community out of sight; they have not been able to
                put out of sight their own good faith and conscientiousness. Therefore the Roman
                knights, who condemned you by their judgment, have not been willing to be condemned
                in the judgment of those judges. Do you now consider whether you prefer to follow
                their decision or their inclination. <milestone n="72" unit="chapter"/><milestone
                  n="176" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>But see now, how far the zeal of your friends, your own devices, and the
                inclination of those partners aid you. I will speak a little more openly; for I am
                not afraid of any one thinking that I am saying this in the spirit of an accuser
                rather than with proper freedom. If the collectors had not removed those letters
                according to the resolution of the farmers of the tenths, I could only say against
                you what I had found in those letters; but now that the resolution has been passed,
                and the letters have been removed, I may say whatever I can, and the judge may
                suspect whatever he chooses. I say that you exported from <placeName
                  key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> an immense weight of gold, of silver,
                of ivory, of purple; much cloth from <placeName key="tgn,7005730"
                >Melita</placeName>, much embroidered stuff, much furniture of <placeName
                  key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName>, many Corinthian vessels, a great quantity
                of corn, an immense load of honey; and that on account of these things, because no
                port dues were paid on them, Lucius Canuleius, who was the agent in the harbour,
                sent letters to his partners. </p>
              <p>Does this appear a sufficiently grave charge? <milestone n="177" unit="section"/>
                None, I think, can be graver. What will Hortensius say in defence? Will he demand
                that I produce the letters of Canuleius? Will he say that a charge of this sort is
                worthless unless it be supported by letters? I shall cry out that the letters have
                been put out of the way; that by a resolution of the shareholders the proofs and
                evidences of his thefts have been taken from me. He must either contend that this
                has not been done, or he must bear the brunt of all my weapons. Do you deny that
                this was done? I am glad to hear that defence. I descend into the arena; for equal
                terms and an equal contest are before us. I will produce witnesses, and I will
                produce many at the same time; since they were together when this took place, they
                shall be together now also. When they are examined, let them be bound not only by
                the obligation of their oath and regard for their character, but also by a common
                consciousness of the truth. <milestone n="178" unit="section"/> If it be proved that
                this did take place as I say it did, will you be able to say, O Hortensius, that
                there was nothing in those letters to hurt Verres? You not only will not say so, but
                you will not even be able to say this,&mdash;that there was not as much in them
                as I say there was. This then is what you have brought about by your wisdom and by
                your interest; that, as I said a little while ago, you have given me the greatest
                licence for accusing, and he judges the most ample liberty to believe anything.
                  <milestone n="73" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="179" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>But though this be the case, still I will invent nothing. I will recollect that I
                have not taken a criminal to accuse, but that I have received clients to defend; and
                that you ought to hear the cause not as it might be produced by me, but as it has
                been brought to me; that I shall satisfy the Sicilians, if I diligently set forth
                what I have known myself in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, and
                what I have heard from them; that I shall satisfy the Roman people, if I fear
                neither the violence nor the influence of any one; that I shall satisfy you, if by
                my good faith and diligence I give you an opportunity of deciding correctly and
                honestly; that I shall satisfy myself, if I do not depart a hair's breadth from that
                course of life which I have proposed to myself. <milestone n="180" unit="section"/>
                Wherefore, you have no ground to fear that I will invent anything against you. You
                have cause even to be glad; for I shall pass over many things which I know to have
                been done by you, because they are either too infamous, or scarcely credible. I will
                only discuss this whole affair of this society. That you may now hear the truth, I
                will ask, Was such a resolution passed? When I have ascertained that, I will ask,
                Have the letters been removed? When that too, is proved , you will understand the
                matter, even if I say nothing. If they who passed this resolution for his
                sake&mdash;namely, the Roman knights&mdash;were now also judges in his case,
                they would beyond all question condemn that man, concerning whom they knew that
                letters which laid bare his robberies had been sent to themselves, and had been
                removed by their own resolution. He, therefore, who must have been condemned by
                those Roman knights who desire everything to turn out for his interest, and who have
                been most kindly treated by him, can he, O judges, by any possible means or
                contrivance be acquitted by you? <milestone n="181" unit="section"/> And that you
                may not suppose that those things which have been removed out of the way, and taken
                from you, were all so carefully hidden, and kept so secretly, that with all the
                diligence which I am aware is universally expected of me nothing concerning them has
                been able to be arrived at or discovered, I must tell you that, whatever could by
                any means or contrivance be found out, has been found out, O judges. You shall see
                in a moment the man detected in the very act; for as I have spent a great part of my
                life in attending to the causes of farmers, and have paid great attention to that
                body, I think that I am sufficiently acquainted with their customs by experience and
                by intercourse with them. <milestone n="74" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="182"
                  unit="section"/></p>
              <p>Therefore, when I ascertained that the letters of the company were removed out of
                the way, I made a calculation of the years that that man had been in <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>; then I inquired (what was exceedingly easy
                to discover) who during those years had been the collectors of that
                company,&mdash;in whose care the records had been. For I was aware that it was
                the custom of the collectors who kept the records, when they gave them up to the new
                collector, to retain copies of the documents themselves. And therefore I went in the
                first place to Lucius Vibius, a Roman knight, a man of the highest consideration,
                who, I ascertained, had been collector that very year about which I particularly had
                to inquire. I came upon the man unexpectedly when he was thinking of other things. I
                investigated what I could, and inquired into everything. I found only two small
                books, which had been sent by Lucius Canuleius to the shareholders from the harbour
                at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>; in which there was
                entered an account of many months, and of things exported in Verres's name without
                having paid harbour dues. These I sealed up immediately. <milestone n="183"
                  unit="section"/> These were documents of that sort which of all the papers of the
                company I was most anxious to find; but still I only found enough, O judges, to
                produce to you as a sample, as it were. But still, whatever is in these books,
                however unimportant it may seem to be, will at all events be undeniable; and by this
                you will be able to form your conjectures as to the rest. Read for me, I beg, this
                first book, and then the other. [The books of Canuleius are read.] I do not ask now
                whence you got those four hundred jars of honey, or such quantities of Maltese
                cloth, or fifty cushions for sofas or so many candelabra;&mdash;I do not, I say,
                inquire at present where you got these things; but, how you could want such a
                quantity of them, that I do ask. I say nothing about the honey; but what could you
                want with so many Maltese garments? as if you were going to dress all your friends'
                wives;&mdash;or with so many sofa cushions? as if you were going to furnish all
                their villas. <milestone n="75" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="184" unit="section"
                /></p>
              <p>As in these little books there are only the accounts of a few months, conjecture in
                your minds what they must have been for the whole three years. This is what I
                contend for. From these small books found in the house of one collector of the
                company, you can form some conjecture how great a robber that man was in that
                province; what a number of desires, what different ones, what countless ones he
                indulged; what immense sums he made not only in money, but invested also in articles
                of this sort; which shall be detailed to you more fully another time. At present
                listen to this. <milestone n="185" unit="section"/> By these exportations, of which
                the list was read to you, he writes that the shareholders had lost sixty thousand
                  <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign> by the five per cent due on them as harbour
                dues at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>. In a few months,
                therefore, as these little insignificant books show, things were stolen by the
                praetor and exported from one single town of the value of twelve hundred thousand
                  <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign>. Think now, as the island is one which is
                accessible by sea on all sides, what you can suppose was exported from other places?
                from <placeName key="tgn,7003808">Agrigentum</placeName>, from <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003850">Lilybaeum</placeName>, from <placeName key="perseus,Panormus"
                  >Panormus</placeName>, from Thermae, from Halesa, from <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003947">Catina</placeName>, from the other towns? And what from
                  <placeName key="tgn,7003897">Messana</placeName>? the place which he thought safe
                for his purpose above all others,&mdash;where he was always easy and comfortable
                in his mind, because he had selected the Mamertines as men to whom he could send
                everything which was either to be preserved carefully, or exported secretly. After
                these books had been found, the rest were removed and concealed more carefully; but
                we, that all men may see that we are acting without any ulterior motive, are content
                with these books which we have produced. <milestone n="76" unit="chapter"
                  /><milestone n="186" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>Now we will return to the accounts of the society of money received and paid, which
                they could not possibly remove honestly, and to your friend Carpinatius. We
                inspected at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> accounts of the
                company made up by Carpinatius, which showed by many items that many of the men who
                had paid money to Verres, had borrowed it of Carpinatius. That will be clearer than
                daylight to you, O judges, when I produce the very men who paid the money; for you
                will see that the times at which, as they were in danger, they bought themselves
                off, agree with the records of the company not only as to the years, but even as to
                the months. </p>
              <p><milestone n="187" unit="section"/> While we were examining this matter thoroughly,
                and holding the documents actually in our hands, we see on a sudden erasures of such
                a sort as to appear to be fresh wounds inflicted on papers. Immediately, having a
                suspicion of something wrong, we bent our eyes and attention on the names
                themselves. Money was entered as having been received from Caius Verrutius the son
                of Caius, in such a way that the letters had been let stand down to the second R,
                all the rest was an erasure. A second, a third, a fourth&mdash;there were a
                great many names in the same state. As the matter was plain, so also was the
                abominable and scandalous worthlessness of the accounts. We began to inquire of
                Carpinatius who that Verrutius was, with whom he had such extensive pecuniary
                dealings. The man began to hesitate, to look away, to colour. Because there is a
                provision made by law with respect to the accounts of the farmers, forbidding their
                being taken to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>; in order that the
                matter might be as clear and as completely proved as possible, I summon Carpinatius
                before the tribunal of Metellus and produce the accounts of the company in the
                forum. There is a great rush of people to the place; and as the partnership existing
                between Carpinatius and that praetor, and his usury, were well known, all people
                were watching with the most eager expectation to see what was contained in the
                accounts <milestone n="77" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="188" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>I bring the matter before Metellus; I state to him that I have seen the accounts of
                the shareholders, that in these there is a long account of one Caius Verrutius made
                up of many items, and that I saw, by a computation of the years and months, that
                this Verrutius had had no account at all with Carpinatius, either before the arrival
                of Caius Verres, or after his departure. I demand that Carpinatius shall give me an
                answer who that Verrutius is; whether he is a merchant, or a broker, or an
                agriculturist, or a grazier; whether he is in <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName>, or whether he has now left it. All who were in the court
                cried out at once that there had never been any one in <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName> of the name of Verrutius. I began to press the man to answer
                me who he was, where he was, whence he came; why the servant of the company who made
                up the accounts always made a blunder in the name of Verrutius at the same place?
                  <milestone n="189" unit="section"/> And I made this demand, not because I thought
                it of any consequence that he should be compelled to answer me these things against
                his will, but that the robberies of one, the dishonesty of the other, and the
                audacity of both might be made evident to all the world. And so I leave him in the
                court, dumb from fear and the consciousness of his crimes, terrified out of his
                wits, and almost frightened to death; I take a copy of the accounts in the forum,
                with a great crowd of men standing round me; the most eminent men in the assembly
                are employed in making the copy; the letters and the erasures are faithfully copied
                and imitated, and transferred from the accounts into books. <milestone n="190"

              </p>
              <p>The copy was examined and compared with the original with the greatest care and
                diligence, and then sealed up by most honourable men. If Carpinatius would not
                answer me then, do you, O Verres, answer me now, who you imagine this Verrutius, who
                must almost be one of your own family, to be. It is quite impossible that you should
                not have known a man in your own province, who, I see, was in <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> while you were praetor, and who, I perceive
                from the accounts themselves, was a very wealthy man. And now, that this may not be

                able to see now, not the traces only of that man's avarice, but the very bed in
                which it lay. <milestone n="78" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="191" unit="section"

              <p>You see the word <foreign lang="la">Verrutius</foreign>?&mdash;You see the
                first letters untouched? you see the last part of the name, the tail of Verres,
                smothered in the erasure, as in the mud. The original accounts, O judges, are in
                exactly the same state as this copy.&mdash;What are you waiting for? What more
                do you want? You, Verres, why are you sitting there? Why do you delay? for either
                you must show us Verrutius, or confess that you yourself are Verrutius. The ancient
                orators are extolled, the Crassi and Antonii, because they had the skill to efface
                the impression made by an accusation with great clearness, and to defend the causes
                of accused persons with eloquence. It was not, forsooth, in ability only that they
                surpassed those who are now employed here as counsel, but also in good fortune. No
                one, in those times, committed such crimes as to leave no room for any defence; no
                one lived in such a manner that no part of his life was free from the most extreme
                infamy; no one was detected in such manifest guilt, that, shameless as he had been
                in the action, he seemed still more shameless if he denied it. <milestone n="192"
                  unit="section"/></p>
              <p>But now what can Hortensius do? Can he argue against the charges of avarice by
                panegyrics on his client's economy? He is defending a man thoroughly profligate,
                thoroughly licentious, thoroughly wicked. Can he lead your attention away from this
                infamy and profligacy of his, and turn them into some other direction by a mention
                of his bravery? But a man more inactive, more lazy, one who is more a man among
                women, a debauched woman among men, cannot be found.&mdash;But his manners are
                affable. Who is more obstinate more rude? more arrogant?&mdash;But still all
                this is without any injury to any one. Who has ever been more furious, more
                treacherous, and more cruel? With such a defendant and such a cause, what could all
                the Crassus's and Antonius's in the world do? This is all they would do, as I think,
                O Hortensius; they would have nothing to do with the cause at all, lest by contact
                with the impudence of another they might lose their own characters for virtue. For
                they come to plead causes free and unshackled, so as not, if they did not choose to
                act shamelessly in defending people, to be thought ungrateful for abandoning
                them.</p>

                <p>A great part of this speech is occupied with charges against Verres of extortion
                  committed with respect to the <foreign lang="la">decuriae</foreign> or tenths.
                  &ldquo;The <foreign lang="la">decuriae</foreign> formed a part of the <foreign
                    lang="la">vectigalia</foreign> of the Romans, and were paid by subjects whose
                  territory, either by conquest, or by <foreign lang="la">deditio</foreign>, had
                  become the property of the state. They consisted as the name denotes, of a tithe
                  or tenth of the produce of the soil levied upon the cultivators (<foreign
                    lang="la">aratores</foreign>) or occupiers (<foreign lang="la"
                    >possessores</foreign>) of the lands, which from being subject to this payment
                  were called <foreign lang="la">agri decumani </foreign> . . . It appears from
                  Cicero (<bibl n="Cic. Ver. 2.3.1">c. Verr. act. ii. lib. iii.</bibl>.) that
                  Romans, on reducing <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> to a province,
                  allowed to the old inhabitants a continuance of their ancient rights, and that,
                  with some few exceptions, the territory of all the states was subjected, as
                  formerly, to the payment of a tithe on corn, wine, oil, and the <foreign lang="la"

                      key="tgn,1033212">Fruges</placeName> minutae&rdquo; probably
                    pulse&mdash;Riddle's Lat. Dict. in v. <foreign lang="la"
                    >Minutus</foreign>.</note>It was further determined that place and time of
                  paying these tithes to the <foreign lang="la">decumani</foreign> should
                  &lsquo;be and continue&rsquo; as settled by the law of king Hiero
                    (<foreign lang="la">Lex Hieronica</foreign>), which enacted severe penalties
                  against any <foreign lang="la">arator</foreign> who did not pay his due, as well
                  as against the <foreign lang="la">decumani</foreign> who exacted more than their
                  tenth . . . The name of <foreign lang="la">decumani</foreign> was also applied to
                  the farmers of these tributes, who purchased them from the state, and then
                  collected them on their own account.&rdquo; In fact &ldquo;the revenues
                  which <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> derived from conquered
                  countries, consisting chiefly of tolls, tithes, harbour duties, &amp;c....
                  were chiefly let out, or, as the Romans expressed it, sold by the censors in
                    <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> itself to the highest bidders,
                    (<bibl n="Cic. Ver. 2.3.7">Cic. c. Verr. ii. iii. 7.</bibl>)... The tithes
                  raised in the province of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> alone,
                  with the exception of those of wine, oil, and garden produce, were not sold at
                    <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, but in the district of
                    <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> itself, according to a practice
                  established by Hiero (<bibl n="Cic. Ver. 2.3.64">Cic. c. Verr. ii. iii. 64</bibl>,
                    <bibl n="Cic. Ver. 2.3.33">33</bibl>). The persons who undertook the farming of
                  the public revenue, of course, belonged to the wealthiest Romans. and down to the
                  end of the republic, as well as during the earlier part of the empire, the farming
                  of the public revenues was almost exclusively in the hands of the <foreign
                    lang="la">equites</foreign>, whence the words <foreign lang="la"
                    >equites</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">publicani</foreign> are sometimes used
                  as synonymous, (<bibl n="Cic. Ver. 1.1.51">Cic. c. Verr. i. 51, 52</bibl>, 71.) .
                  . . The <foreign lang="la">publicani</foreign> had to give security to the state
                  for the sum at which they bought one or more branches of revenue in a province;
                  and as no one person was rich enough to give sufficient security, a number of
                    <foreign lang="la">equites</foreign> generally united together and formed a
                  company (<foreign lang="la">socii</foreign>, <foreign lang="la"
                  >societas</foreign>, or <foreign lang="la">corpus</foreign> ) which was recognised
                  by the state, and by which they were enabled to carry on their undertakings on a
                  large scale. The shares which each partner in such a company took in the business
                  were called <foreign lang="la">partes</foreign>, and if they were small <foreign
                    lang="la">particulae</foreign>. The responsible person in each company, and the
                  one who contracted with the state, was called <foreign lang="la"
                  >manceps</foreign>, but there was also a <foreign lang="la">magister</foreign> to
                  manage the business of each company, who resided at <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
                    >Rome</placeName>, and kept up an extensive correspondence with the agents in
                  the provinces, (<bibl n="Cic. Ver. 2.2.74">Cic. c. Verr. ii. 74</bibl>.) He seems
                  to have held his office only for one year; his representative in the province was
                  called <foreign lang="la">submagister</foreign>, who had to travel about and
                  superintend the actual business of collecting the revenues . . . Nobody but a
                  Roman citizen was allowed to become a member of a company of <foreign lang="la"
                    >publicani</foreign>; freedmen and slaves were excluded, (<bibl
                    n="Cic. Ver. 2.3.39">Cic. c. Verr. ii. iii. 39</bibl>) No Roman magistrate,
                  however, or governor of a province, was allowed to take any share whatever in a
                  company of <foreign lang="la">publicani</foreign>, (<bibl n="Cic. Ver. 2.3.57"
                    >Cic. c. Verr. ii. iii. 57</bibl>), a regulation which was chiefly intended as a
                  protection against the oppression of the provincials. . . The actual levying or
                  collecting of the taxes in the provinces was performed by an inferior class of
                  men, who were said <foreign lang="la">operas publicanis dare</foreign>, or
                    <foreign lang="la">esse in operis societatis</foreign>, (<bibl
                    n="Cic. Ver. 2.3.41">Cic. c. Verr. ii. iii. 41.</bibl>.) They were engaged by
                  the <foreign lang="la">publicani</foreign>, and consisted of freemen as well as
                  slaves, Romans as well as provincials.&rdquo; (<bibl n="Cic. Ver. 2.3.77">Cic.

                <p>Verres had broken the law which forbade a governor of a province to hold shares
                  in a company which farmed the revenue; and as he had therefore a personal interest
                  in increasing the taxes, he committed unexampled acts of extortion himself, and
                  protected those who committed similar act. And in many other respects he had
                  plundered the cultivators of the public domain, whom I have called in this
                  translation &ldquo;agriculturists,&rdquo; not using the word
                  &ldquo;farmers,&rdquo; by which word I have rendered
                  &ldquo;publicani.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>The <foreign lang="la">medimnus</foreign>, as we see, (<bibl n="Cic. Ver. 2.3.45"

              <p>Every man, O judges, who, without being prompted by any enmity, or stung by any
                private injury, or tempted by any reward, prosecutes another for the good of the
                republic, ought to consider, not only how great a burden he is liking upon himself
                at the time, but also how much trouble he is courting for the remainder of
                  <emph>his</emph> life. For he imposes on himself a law of innocence, of
                moderation, and of all virtues, who demands from another an account of his life; and
                he does so the more if, as I said before, he does this being urges by no other
                motive except a desire for the common good. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> For if
                any one assumes to himself to correct the manners of others, and to reprove their
                faults, who will pardon him, if he himself turn aside in any particular from the
                strict line of duty? Wherefore, a citizen of this sort is the more to he praised and
                beloved by all men for this reason also,&mdash;that he does not only remove a
                worthless citizen from the republic, but he also promises and binds himself to be
                such a man as to be compelled, not only by an ordinary inclination to virtue and
                duty, but by even some more unavoidable principle, to live virtuously and
                honourably. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> And, therefore, O judges, that most
                illustrious and most eloquent man, Lucius Crassus, was often heard to say that he
                did not repent of anything so much as having ever proceeded against Caius Carbo: for
                by so doing he had his inclination as to everything less uncontrolled, and he
                thought, too, that his way of life was remarked by more people than he liked. And
                he, fortified as he was by the protection of his own genius and fortune, was yet
                hampered by this anxiety which he had brought upon himself, before his judgment was
                fully formed, at his entrance into life; on which account virtue and integrity is
                less, looked for from those who undertake this business as young men, than from
                those who do so at a riper age; for they, for the sake of credit and ostentation,
                become accusers of others before they have had time to take notice how much more
                free the life of those who have accused no one is. We who have already shown both
                what we could do, and what judgment we had, unless we could easily restrain our
                desires, should never, of our own accord, deprive ourselves of all liberty and
                freedom in our way of life. <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="4"
                  unit="section"/></p>
              <p>And I have a greater burden on me than those who have accused other men, (if that
                deserve to be called a burden which you bear with pleasure and
                delight,)&mdash;but still I have in one respect undertaken a greater burden than
                others who have done the same thing, because all men are required to abstain most
                especially from those vices for which they have reproved another. Have you accused
                any thief or rapacious man? You must for ever avoid all suspicion of avarice. Have
                you prosecuted any spiteful or cruel man? You must for ever take care not to appear
                in any matter the least harsh or severe. A seducer? an adulterer? You must, take
                care most diligently that no trace of licentiousness be ever seen in your conduct.
                In short, everything which you have impeached in another must be earnestly avoided
                by you your self. In truth, not only no accuser, but no reprover even can be
                endured, who is himself detected in the vice which he reproves in another.
                  <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> I, in the case of one man, am finding fault with
                every vice which can exist in a wicked and abandoned man. I say that there is no
                indication of lust, of wickedness, of audacity, which you cannot see clearly in the
                life of that one man. In the case of this criminal, I, O judges, establish this law
                against myself; that I must so live as to appear to be, and always to have been,
                utterly unlike that man, not only in all my actions and words, but even in that
                arrogance and haughtiness of countenance and eyes which you see before you. I will
                bear without uneasiness, O judges, that that course of life which was previously
                agreeable to me of my own accord, shall now, by the law and conditions I hare laid
                down for myself, become necessary for me. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"

              <p>And in the case of this man you often, O Hortensius, are asking me, under the
                pressure of what enmity or what injury I have come forward to accuse him. I omit all
                mention of my duty, and of my connection with the Sicilians; I answer you as to the
                point of enmity. Do you think there is any greater enmity than that arising from the
                opposite opinions of men, and the contrariety of their wishes and inclinations? Can
                he who thinks good faith the holiest thing in life avoid being an enemy to that man
                who, as quaestor, dared to despoil, to desert, to betray, and to attack his consul,
                whose counsels he had shared, whose money he had received, with all whose business
                affairs he had been entrusted? Can he who reverences modesty and chastity behold
                with equanimity the daily adulteries, the dissolute manners of that man, the
                domestic pandering to his passions? Can he who wishes to pay due honours to the
                immortal gods, by any means avoid being an enemy to that man who has plundered all
                the temples, who has dared to commit his robberies even on the track of the wheels
                of the sacred car? <note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="la">Thensa</foreign> was the
                  chariot or car on which the images of the gods were carried in the <foreign
                    lang="la">Ludi Circenses</foreign>.</note> Must not he who thinks that all men
                ought to live under equal laws, be very hostile to you, when he considers the
                variety and caprice of your decrees? Must not he who grieves at the injuries of the
                allies and the distresses of the provinces be excited against you by the plundering
                of <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, the harassing of <placeName
                  key="tgn,7002611">Pamphylia</placeName>, the miserable state and the agony of
                  <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>? Ought not he who desires the
                rights and the liberty of the Roman citizens to be held sacred among all
                men,&mdash;to be even more than an enemy to you, when here collects your
                scourgings, your executions, your crosses erected for the punishment of Roman
                citizens? <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Or if he had in any particular made a
                decree contrary to my interest unjustly, would you then think that I was fairly an
                enemy to him; but now that he has acted contrary to the interests, and property, and
                advantage, and inclination, and welfare of all good men, do you ask why I am an
                enemy to a man towards whom the whole Roman people is hostile? I, who above all
                other men ought to undertake, to gratify the desires of the Roman people, even a
                greater burden and duty than my strength perhaps is equal to. <milestone n="4"

              <p>What? cannot even those matters, which seem more trifling, move any one's
                mind,&mdash;that the worthlessness and audacity of that man should have a more
                easy access to your own friendship, O Hortensius, and to that of other great and
                noble men, than the virtue and integrity of any one of us? You hate the industry of
                new men; you despise their economy; you scorn their modesty; you wish their talents
                and virtues to be depressed and extinguished. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> You
                are fond of Verres: I suppose so. If you are not gratified with his virtue, and his
                innocence, and his industry, and his modesty, and his chastity, at least you are
                transported at his conversation, his accomplishments, and his high breeding. He has
                no such gifts; but, on the contrary, all his qualities are stained with the most
                extreme disgrace and infamy, with most extraordinary stupidity and boorishness. If
                any man's house is open to this man, do you think it is open, or rather that it is
                yawning and begging something? He is a favourite of your factors, of your valets.
                Your freedmen, your slaves, your housemaids, are in love with him. He, when he
                calls, is introduced out of his turn; he alone is admitted, while others, often most
                virtuous men, are excluded. From which it is very easily understood that those
                people are the most dear to you who have lived in such a manner that without your
                protection they cannot be safe. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> What? do you think
                this can be endurable to any one,&mdash;that we should live on slender incomes
                in such a way as not even to wish to acquire anything more; that we should be
                content with maintaining our dignity, and the goodwill of the Roman people, not by
                wealth, but by virtue; but that that man having robbed every one on all sides, and
                having escaped with impunity, should live, in prosperity and abundance? that all
                your banquets should be decorated with his plate, your forum and hall of assembly
                with his statues and pictures? especially when, through your own valour, you are
                rich in all such trophies? That it should be Verres who adorns your villas with his
                spoils? That it should be Verres who is vying with Lucius Mummius: so that the one
                appears to have laid waste more cities of the allies, than the other overthrew
                belonging to the enemy? That the one, unassisted, seems to have adorned more villas
                with the decorations of temples, than the other decorated-temples with the spoils of
                the enemy? And shall he be dearer to you, in order that others may more willingly
                become subservient to your covetousness at their own risk? <milestone n="5"

              <p>But these topics shall be mentioned at another time, and they have already been
                mentioned elsewhere. Let us proceed to the other matters, after we have in a few
                words, O judges, begged your favourable construction. All through our former speech
                we had your attention very carefully given to us. It was very pleasing to us; but it
                will be far more pleasing, if you will be so kind as to attend to what follows;
                because in all the things which were said before, there was some pleasure arising
                from the very variety and novelty of the subjects and of the charges. Now we are
                going to discuss the affair of corn; which indeed in the greatness of the iniquity
                exceeds nearly all the other charges, but will have far less variety and
                agreeableness in the discussion. But it is quite worthy of your authority and
                wisdom, O judges, in the matter of careful hearing, to give no less weight to
                conscientiousness in the discharge of your duties, than to pleasure. <milestone
                  n="11" unit="section"/> I, inquiring into this charge respecting the corn, keep
                this in view, O judges, that you are going to inquire into the estates and fortunes
                of all the Sicilians&mdash;into the property of all the Roman citizens who
                cultivate land in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>&mdash;into the
                revenues handed down to you by your ancestors&mdash;into the life and sustenance
                of the Roman people. And if these matters appear to you important&mdash;yes, and
                most important,&mdash;do not be weary if they are pressed upon you from various
                points of view, and at some length. It cannot escape the notice of any one of you, O
                judges, that all the advantage and desirableness of <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName>, which is in any way connected with the convenience of the
                Roman people, consists mainly in its corn; for in other respects we are indeed
                assisted by that province, but as to this article, we are fed and supported by it.
                  <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> The case, O judges, will be divided under three
                heads in my accusation: for, first, I shall speak of the collectors of the tenths;
                secondly, of the corn which has been bought; thirdly, of that which has been valued.
                  <milestone n="6" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>There is, O judges, this difference between Sicily and other provinces, in the
                matter of tribute derived from the lands; that in the other provinces, either the
                tribute imposed is of a fixed amount, which is called <foreign lang="la"
                  >stipendiarium</foreign>, as in the case of the Spaniards and most of the
                Carthaginian provinces, being a sort of reward of victory, and penalty for war; or
                else a contract exists between the state and the farmers, settled by the censor, as
                is the case in <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, by the Sempronian law.
                But the cities in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> were received into
                our friendship and alliance, retaining the same laws which they had before, and that
                being subject to the Roman people on the same conditions as they had formerly been
                subject to their own princes. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> Very few cities of
                  <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> were subdued in war by our
                ancestors, and even in the case of those which were, though their land was made the
                public domain of the Roman people, still it was afterwards restored to them. That
                domain is regularly let out to farmers by the censors. There are two federate
                cities, whose tenths are not put up to auction; the city of the Mamertines and
                Taurominium. Besides these, there are five cities without any treaty, free and
                enfranchised; Centuripa, Halesa, Segesta, Halicya, and <placeName
                  key="perseus,Panormus">Panormus</placeName>. All the land of the other states of
                  <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> is subject to the payment of
                tenths; and was so, before the sovereignty of the Roman people, by the will and laws
                of the Sicilians themselves. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> See now the wisdom
                of our ancestors, who, when they had added <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName>, so valuable an assistant both in war and peace, to the
                republic, were so careful to defend the Sicilians and to retain them in their
                allegiance, that they not only imposed no new tax upon their lands, but did not even
                alter the law of putting up for sale the contracts of the farmers of the tenths, or
                the time or place of selling them; so that they were to put them up for sale at the
                regular time of year, at the same place, in <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName>,&mdash;in short, in every respect as the law of Hiero
                directed; they permitted them still to manage their own affairs, and were not
                willing that their minds should be disturbed even by a new name to a law, much less
                by an actual new law. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> And so that resolved that
                the farming of the tenth should always be put up to auction according to the law of
                Hiero, in order that the discharge of that office might be the more agreeable if,
                though the supreme power was changed, still, not only the laws of that king who was
                very dear to the Sicilians, but his name also remained in force among them. This law
                the Sicilians always used before Verres was praetor. He first dared to root up and
                alter the established usages of them all, their customs which had been handed down
                to them from their ancestors, the conditions of their friendship with us, and the
                rights secured to them by our alliance. <milestone n="7" unit="chapter"/><milestone
                  n="16" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>And in this, this is the first thing I object to and accuse you for, that in a
                custom of such long standing, and so thoroughly established, you made any innovation
                at all. Have you ever gained anything by this genius of yours? Were you superior in
                prudence and wisdom to so many wise and illustrious men who governed that province
                before you? That is your renown; this praise is due to your genius and diligence. I
                admit and grant this to you. I do know that, at <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
                  >Rome</placeName>, when you were praetor, you did transfer by your edict the
                possession of inheritance from the children to strangers, from the first heirs to
                the second, from the laws to your own licentious covetousness. I do know that you
                corrected the edicts of all your predecessors, and gave possession of inheritance
                not according to the evidence of those who produced the will, but according to
                theirs who said that a will had been made. And I do know too that those new
                practices, first brought forward and invented by you, were a very great profit to
                you. I recollect, moreover, that you also abrogated and altered the laws of the
                censors about the keeping the public buildings in repair; so that he might not take
                the contract to whom the care of the building belonged; so that his guardians and
                relations might not consult the advantage, of their ward so as to prevent his being
                stripped of all his property; that you appointed a very limited time for the work,
                in order to exclude others from the business; but that with respect to the
                contractor you favoured, you did not observe any fixed time at all. <milestone
                  n="17" unit="section"/> So that I do not marvel at your having established a new
                law in the matter of the tenths you, a man so wise, so thoroughly practiced in
                praetorian edicts and censorian laws. I do not wonder, I say, at your having
                invented something; but I do blame you, I do impeach you, for having of your own
                accord, without any command from the people, without the authority of the senate,
                changed the laws of the province of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>.
                  <milestone n="18" unit="section"/> The senate permitted Lucius Octavius and Caius
                Cotta, the consuls, to put up to auction at <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
                  >Rome</placeName> the tenths of wine, and oil, and of pulse, which before your
                time the quaestors had been in the habit of putting up in <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>; and to establish any law with respect to
                those articles which they might think fit. When the contract was offered for sale,
                the farmers begged them to add some clauses to the law, and yet not to depart from
                the other laws of the censors. A man opposed this, who by accident was at <placeName
                  key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> at that time; your host,&mdash;your host,
                and intimate friend, I say, O Verres,&mdash;Sthenius, of Thermae, who is here
                present The consuls examined into the matter. When they had summoned many of the
                principal and most honourable men of the state to form a council on the subject;
                according to the opinion of that council they gave notice that they should put the
                tenths up to auction according to the law of Hiero. <milestone n="8" unit="chapter"
                  /><milestone n="19" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>Was it not so? Men of the greatest wisdom, invested with the supreme authority, to
                whom the senate had given the whole power of making laws respecting the letting out
                the farming of the tributes, (and this power had been ratified by the people, while
                only one Sicilian objected to it,) would not alter the name of the law of Hiero,
                even when the measure would have been accompanied by an augmentation of the revenue;
                but you, a man of no wisdom, of no authority, without any order from people or
                senate, while all <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> objected,
                abrogated the whole law of Hiero, to the greatest injury and even destruction of the
                revenue. <milestone n="20" unit="section"/> But what law is this, O judges, which he
                amends, or rather totally abrogates? A law framed with the greatest acuteness and
                the greatest diligence, which gives up the cultivator of the land to the collector
                of the tenths, guarded by so many securities, that neither in the corn fields, nor
                on the threshing floors, nor in the barns, nor while removing his corn privately,
                nor while carrying it away openly, can the cultivator defraud the collector of one
                single grain without the severest punishment. The law has been framed with such
                care, that it is plain that a man framed it who had no other revenues; with such
                acuteness that it was plain that he was a Sicilian; with such severity, that he was
                evidently a tyrant: by this law, however, cultivating the land was an advantageous
                trade for the Sicilian; for the laws for the collectors of the tenths were also
                drawn up so carefully that it is not possible for more than the tenth to be extorted
                from the cultivator against his will. <milestone n="21" unit="section"/> And though
                all these things were settled in this way, after so many years and even ages, Verres
                was found not only to change, but entirely to overturn them, and to convert to
                purposes of his own most infamous profit those regulations which had long ago been
                instituted and established for the safety of the allies and the benefit of the
                republic. In the first instance he appointed certain men, collectors of the tenths
                in name, in reality the ministers and satellites of his desires; by whom I will show
                that the province was for three years so harassed and plundered, O judges, that it
                will take many years and a long series of wise and incorruptible governors to
                recover it. <milestone n="9" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="22" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>The chief of all those who were called collectors, was Quintus Apronius, that man
                whom you see in court, concerning whose extraordinary wickedness you have heard the
                complaints of most influential deputations. Look, O judges, at the face and
                countenance of the man; and from that obstinacy which he retains now in the most
                desperate circumstances, you may imagine and recollect what his arrogance must have
                been in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>. This Apronius is the man
                whom Verres (though he had collected together the most infamous men from all
                quarters, and though he had taken with him no small number of men like himself in
                worthlessness, licentiousness, and audacity,) still considered most like himself of
                any man in the whole province. And so in a very short time they became intimate, not
                because of interest, nor of reason, nor of any introduction from mutual friends, but

                /> You know the depraved and licentious habits of Verres. Imagine to yourselves, if
                you can, any one who can be in every respect equal to him in the wicked and
                dissolute commission of every crimes that man will be Apronius; who, as he shows not
                only by his life, but by his person and countenance, is a vast gulf and whirlpool of
                every sort of vice and infamy. Him did Verres employ as his chief agent in all his
                adulteries, in all his plundering of temples, in all his debauched banquets; and the
                similarity of their manners caused such a friendship and unanimity between them,
                that Apronius, whom every one else thought a boor and a barbarian, appeared to him
                alone an agreeable and an accomplished man; that, though every one else hated him,
                and could not bear the sight of him, Verres could not bear to be away from him;
                that, though others shunned even the banquets at which Apronius was to be presents
                Verres used the same cup with him; lastly, that, though the odour of Apronius's
                breath and person is such that even, as one may say, the beasts cannot endure him,
                he appeared to Verres alone sweet and pleasant. He sat next to him on the
                judgment-seat; he was alone with him in his chamber; he was at the head of his table
                at his banquets; and especially then, when he began to dance at the feast naked,
                while the young son of the praetor was sitting by. <milestone n="10" unit="chapter"

              <p>This man, as I began to say, Verres selected for his principal agent in distressing
                and plundering the fortunes of the cultivators of the land. To this man's audacity,
                and wickedness, and cruelty, our most faithful allies and most virtuous citizens
                were given up, O judges, by this praetor, and were placed at his mercy by new
                regulations and new edicts, the entire law of Hiero, as I said before, having been
                rejected and repudiated. </p>
              <p><milestone n="25" unit="section"/> First of all, listen, O judges, to his splendid
                edict. &ldquo;Whatever amount of tithe the collector declared that the
                cultivator ought to pay, that amount the cultivator should be compelled to pay to
                the collector.&rdquo;&mdash;How? Let him pay as much as Apronius demands?
                What is this? is the regulation of a praetor for allies, or the edict and command of
                an insane tyrant to conquered enemies? Am I to give as much as he demands? He will
                demand every grain that I can get out of my land. Am I to give all? Yes, and more
                too, if he chooses. What, then, am I to do? What do you think? You must either pay,
                or you will be convicted of having disobeyed the edict. O ye immortal gods, what a
                state of things is this For it is hardly credible. And indeed. <milestone n="26"
                  unit="section"/> I am persuaded, O judges, that, though you should think that all
                other vices are met in this man, still this must seem false to you. For I myself,
                though all <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> told me of it, still
                should not dare to affirm this to you, if I was not able to recite to you these
                edicts from his own documents in those very words&mdash;as I will do. Give this,
                I pray you, to the clerk; he shall read from the register. Read the edict about the
                returns of property. [The edict about the returns of property is read.] He says I am
                not reading the whole. For that is what he seems to intimate by shaking his head.
                What am I passing over? is it that part where you take care of the interests of the
                Sicilians, and show regard for the miserable cultivators? For you announce in your
                edict, that you will condemn the collector in eightfold damages, if he has taken
                more than was due to him. I do not wish anything to be passed over. Read this also
                which he requires; read every word. [The edict about the eightfold damages is read.]
                Does this mean that the cultivator is to prosecute the collector at law? It is a
                miserable and unjust thing for men to be brought from the country into the forum,
                from the plough to the courts of justice; from habits of rustic life to actions and
                trials to which they are wholly unaccustomed. <milestone n="11" unit="chapter"

                regulations respecting the most virtuous and honest and honourable class of
                men,&mdash;that is, respecting the cultivators of the soil,&mdash;which are
                contrary to all other laws. Which is the most just, for the collector to have to
                make his claim, or for the cultivator to have to recover what has been unlawfully
                seized? for them to go to trial when things are in their original state, or when one
                side is ruined? for him to be in possession of the property who has acquired it by
                hard labour, or him who has obtained it by bidding for it at an auction? What more?
                They who cultivate single acres, who never cease from personal labour, of which
                class there were a great number, and a vast multitude among the Sicilians before you
                came as praetor,&mdash;what are they to do? When they have given to Apronius all

                while you, forsooth, are praetor, to prosecute, by the equal law which they will
                find there, Apronius, the delight and joy of your life, in a suit for recovery of
                their property? <milestone n="28" unit="section"/> But so be it. Some fearless and
                experienced cultivator will be found, who, when he has paid the collector as much as
                he says is due, will seek to recover it by course of law, and will sue for the
                eightfold penalty. I look for the vigour of the edict, for the impartiality of the
                praetor; I espouse the cause of the cultivator; I wish to see Apronius condemned in
                the eightfold penalty. What now does the cultivator demand? Nothing but sentence for
                an eightfold penalty, according to the edict. What says Apronius? He is unable to
                object. What says the praetor? He bids him challenge the judges. Let us, says he,
                make out the decuries. What decuries? Those from my retinue; you will challenge the
                others. What? of what men is that retinue composed? Of Volusius the soothsayer, and

                  which often occurs in these orations; properly it means any assembly of men, but
                  when the Romans had reduced foreign countries into the form of provinces, it
                  assumed a nave definite meaning. Sometimes it was applied to the whole body of
                  Roman citizens who were either permanently or temporarily settled in a province.
                  Also in order to facilitate the administration of justice, a province was divided
                  into a number of districts, each of which was called <foreign lang="la"

                  the trial, and pronounced the sentence according to the views of the judges who

              <p>What a splendid and memorable court! what an impartial decision! what a safe
                resource for the cultivators of the soil! <milestone n="29" unit="section"/> And
                that you may understand what sort of decisions are obtained in actions for the
                eightfold penalty, and what sort of judges those selected from that man's retinue
                are considered to be, listen to this. Do you think that any collector, when this
                licence was allowed him of taking from the cultivator whatever he claimed, ever did
                demand more than was due? Consider yourselves in your own minds, whether you think
                any one ever did so, especially when it might have happened, not solely through
                covetousness, but even though ignorance. Many must have done so. But I say that all
                extorted more, and a great deal more, than the proper tenths. Tell me of one man, in
                the whole three years of your praetorship, who was condemned in the eightfold
                penalty. Condemned, indeed! Tell me of one man who was ever prosecuted according to
                your edict. There was not, in fact, one cultivator who was able to complain that
                injustice had been done to him; not one collector who claimed one grain more as due
                to him than really was due. Far from that. Apronius seized and carried off whatever
                he chose from every one. In every district the cultivators, harassed and plundered
                as they were, were complaining, and yet no instance of a trial can be found.
                  <milestone n="30" unit="section"/> Why is this? Why did so many bold, honourable,
                and highly esteemed men&mdash;so many Sicilians, so many Roman
                knights&mdash;when injured by one most worthless and infamous man, not seek to
                recover the eightfold penalty, which had most unquestionably been incurred? What is
                the cause, what is the reason? That reason alone, O judges, which you
                see,&mdash;because they knew they should come off at the trial defrauded and
                ridiculed. In truth, what sort of triad must that be, when three of the profligate
                and abandoned retinue of Verres sat on the tribunal under the name of
                judges?&mdash;slaves of Verres, not inherited by him from his father, but
                recommended to him by his mistress. <milestone n="31" unit="section"/> The
                cultivator, forsooth, might plead his cause; he might show that no corn was left him
                by Apronius,&mdash;that even his other property was seized; that he himself had
                been driven away with blows. Those admirable men would lay their heads together,
                they would chat to one another about revels and harlots, if they could catch any
                when leaving the praetor. The cause would seem to be properly heard: Apronius would
                have risen, full of his new dignity as a knight; not like a collector all over dirt
                and dust, but reeking with perfumes, languid with the lateness of the last night's
                drinking party, with his first motion, and with his breath he would have filled the
                whole place with the odour of wine, of perfume, and of his person. He would have
                said, what he repeatedly has said, that he had bought, not the tenths, but the
                property and fortunes of the cultivators; that he, Apronius, was not a collector,
                but a second Verres,&mdash;the absolute lord and master of those men. And when
                he had said this, those admirable men of Verres's train, the judges, would
                deliberate, not about acquitting Apronius, but they would inquire how they could
                condemn the cultivator himself to pay damages to Apronius. <milestone n="13"
                  unit="chapter"/><milestone n="32" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>When you had granted this licence for plundering the cultivators to the collectors
                of the tenths,&mdash;that is, to Apronius,&mdash;by allowing him to demand
                as much as he chose, and to carry off as much as he demanded, were you preparing
                this defence for your trial,&mdash;that you had promised by edict that you would
                assign judges in a trial for an eightfold penalty? Even if in truth you were to give
                power to the cultivator, not only to challenge his judges, but even to pick them out
                of the whole body of the Syracusan assembly, (a body of most eminent and honourable
                men,) still no one could bear this new sort of injustice,&mdash;that, when one
                has given up the whole of one's produce to the farmer, and had one's property taken
                out of one's hands, then one is to endeavour to recover one's property and to seek
                its restitution by legal proceedings. <milestone n="33" unit="section"/> But when
                what is granted by the edict is, in name indeed, a trial, but in reality a collusion
                of your attendants, most worthless men, with the collectors, who are your partners,
                and besides that, with the judges, do you still dare to mention that trial,
                especially when what you say is refuted, not merely by my speech, but by the facts
                themselves? when in all the distresses of the cultivators of the soil, and all the
                injustice of the collectors, not only has no trial ever taken place according to
                that splendid edict, but none has ever been so much as demanded? <milestone n="34"
                  unit="section"/> However, he will be more favourable to the cultivators than he
                appears; for the same man who has announced in his edict that he will allow a trial
                against the collectors, in which they shall be liable to an eightfold penalty, had
                it also set down in his edict, that he would grant a similar trial against the
                cultivators, in which they should be liable to a fourfold penalty. Who now dares to
                say that this man was unfavourably disposed or hostile to the cultivators? How much
                more lenient is he to them than to the collectors? He has ordered in his edict that
                the Sicilian magistrate should exact from the cultivator whatever the collector
                declared ought to be paid to him. What sentence has he left behind, which can be
                pronounced against a cultivator of the soil It is not a bad thing, says he, for that
                fear to exist; so that, when the money has been exacted from the cultivator, still
                there will be behind a fear of the court of justice, to prevent him from stirring
                himself. If you wish to exact money from me by process of law, remove the Sicilian
                magistrate. If you employ this violence, what need is there of a process of law?
                Moreover, who will there be who would not prefer paying to your collectors what they
                demand, to being condemned in four times the amount by your attendants. <milestone
                  n="14" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="35" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>But that is a splendid clause in the edict, that gives notice that in all disputes
                which arise between the cultivator and the collector, he will assign judges, if
                either party wishes it. In the first place, what dispute can there be when he who
                ought to make a claim, makes a seizure instead? and when he seizes, not as much as
                is due, but as much as he chooses? and when he, whose property is seized, cannot
                possibly recover his own by a suit at law? In the second place, this dirty fellow
                wants even in this to seem cunning and wily; for he frames his edict in these
                words&mdash;&ldquo;If either wishes it, I will assign judges.&rdquo; How
                neatly does he think he is robbing him! He gives each party the power of choice; but
                it makes no difference whether he wrote&mdash;&ldquo;If either wishes it,"
                or "If the collector wishes it.&rdquo; For the cultivator will never wish for
                those judges of yours. <milestone n="36" unit="section"/> What next? What sort of
                edicts are those which he issued to meet particular occasions, at the suggestion of
                Apronius? When Quintus Septitius, a most honourable man, and a Roman knight,
                resisted Apronius, and declared that he would not pay more than a tenth, a sudden
                special edict makes its appearance, that no one is to remove his corn from the
                threshing-floor before he has settled the demands of the collector. Septitius put up
                with this injustice also, and allowed his corn to be damaged by the rain, while
                remaining on the threshing-floor, when on a sudden that most fruitful and profitable
                edict comes out, that every one was to have his tenths delivered at the water-side
                before the first of August. <milestone n="37" unit="section"/> By this edict, it was
                not the Sicilians, (for he had already sufficiently crushed and ruined them by his
                previous edicts,) but all those Roman knights who had fancied that they could
                preserve their rights against Apronius, excellent men, and highly esteemed by other
                praetors, who were delivered bound hand and foot into the power of Apronius. For
                just listen and see what sort of edicts these are. &ldquo;A man,&rdquo; says
                he, &ldquo;is not to remove his corn from the threshing-floor, unless he has
                settled all demands.&rdquo; This is a sufficiently strong inducement to making
                unfair demands; for I had rather give too much, than not remove my corn from the
                threshing-floor at the proper time. But that violence does not affect Septitius, and
                some others like Septitius, who say, &ldquo;I will rather not remove my corn,
                than submit to an extortionate demand.&rdquo; To these then the second edict is
                opposed. &ldquo;You must have delivered it by the first of August.&rdquo; I
                will deliver it then.&mdash;&ldquo;Unless you have settled the demands, you
                shall not remove it.&rdquo; So the fixing of the day for delivering it at the
                waterside, compelled the man to remove his corn from the threshing floor. And the
                prohibition to remove, unless the demand were settled, made the settlement
                compulsory and not voluntary. <milestone n="15" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="38"

              <p>But what follows is not only contrary to the law of Hiero, not only contrary to the

                give security to appear in any courts of justice but their own. Verres made a
                regulation that the cultivator should appear to an action brought by a collector in
                any court which the collector might choose. So that in this way also gain might
                accrue to Apronius, when he dragged a defendant all the way from Leontini to
                  <placeName key="tgn,7003850">Lilybaeum</placeName> to appear before the court
                there, by making false accusations against the wretched cultivators. Although that
                device for false accusation was also contrived with singular cunning, when he
                ordered that the cultivators should make a return of their acres, as to what they
                were sown with. And this had not only great power in causing most iniquitous claims
                to be submitted to, as we shall show hereafter, and that too without any advantage
                to the republic, but at the same time it gave a great handle to false accusations,
                which all men were liable to if Apronius chose. <milestone n="39" unit="section"/>
                For, as any one said anything contrary to his inclination, immediately he was
                summoned before the court on some charge relative to the returns made of his lands.
                Through fear of which action a great quantity of corn was extorted from many, and
                vast sums were collected; not that it was really difficult to male a correct return
                of a man's acres, or even to make an extravagantly liberal one, (for what danger
                could there be in doing that?) but still it opened a pretext for demanding a trial
                because the cultivator had not made his return in the terms of the edict. And you
                must feel sure what sort of trial that would be while that man was praetor, if you
                recollect what sort of a train and retinue he had about him. What is it, then, which
                I wish you to understand, O judges, from the iniquity of these new edicts? That any
                injury has been done to our allies? That you see. That the authority of his
                predecessors has been overruled by him? He will not dare to deny it. <milestone

              <p>That Apronius had such great influence while he was praetor? That he must
                unavoidably confess. But perhaps you will inquire in this place, as the law reminds
                you to do, whether he himself has made any money by this conduct. I will show you
                that he has made vast sums, and I will prove that he established all those
                iniquitous rules which I have mentioned before, with no object but his own profit,
                when I have first removed out of his line of defence that rampart which he thinks he
                shall be able to employ against all my attacks. </p>
              <p>I sold, says he, the tenths at a high price. What are you saying? Did you, O most
                audacious and senseless of men, sell the tenths? Did you sell those portions which
                the senate and people of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> allowed you
                to sell, or the whole produce; and in that the whole property and fortunes of the
                cultivators? If the crier had openly given notice by your order, that there was
                being sold, not a tenth, but half the corn, and if purchasers had come with the idea
                of buying half the corn&mdash;if then you had sold the half for more than the
                other praetors had sold the tenth part of it, would that seem strange to any one?
                But what shall we say if the crier gave notice of a sale of the tenths, but if, in
                fact, by your regulation,&mdash;by your edict,&mdash;by the terms of the
                sale which you offered, more than a half portion Was sold? Will you still think that
                creditable to yourself, to have sold what you had no right to sell for more than
                others sold what they fairly could? <milestone n="41" unit="section"/> Oh, you sold
                the tenths for more than others had sold them. By what means did you manage that? by
                innocent means? Look at the temple of Castor, and then, if you dare, talk of your
                innocent means. By your diligence? Look at the erasures in your registers at the
                name of Sthenius of Thermae, and then have the face to call yourself diligent. By
                your ability? You who refused at the former pleadings to put questions to the
                witnesses, and preferred presenting yourself dumb before them, pray call yourself
                and your advocates able men as much as you please. By what means, then, did you
                manage what you say you did? For it is a great credit to you if you have surpassed
                your predecessors in ability, and left to your successors your example and your
                authority. Perhaps you had no one before you fit to imitate. But, no doubt, all men
                will imitate you, the investor and first parent of such excellent methods.
                  <milestone n="42" unit="section"/> What cultivator of the soil, when you were
                praetor, paid a tenth? Who paid two-tenths only? Who was there who did not think
                himself treated with the greatest lenity if he paid three tenths instead of one,
                except a few men, who, on account of a partnership with you in your robberies, paid
                nothing at all? See how great a difference there is between your harshness and the
                kindness of the senate. The senate, when owing to any necessity of the republic it
                is compelled to decree that a second tenth shall be exacted, decrees that for that
                second tenth money be paid to the cultivators, so that the quantity which is taken
                beyond what is strictly due may be considered to be purchased, not to be taken away.
                You, when you were exacting and seizing so many tenths, not by a decree of the
                senate, but by your own edicts and nefarious regulations, shall you think that you
                have done a great deed if you sell them for more than Lucius Hortensius, the father
                of this Quintus Hortensius, did,&mdash;than Cnaeus Pompeius or Caius Marcellus
                sold them for; men who did not violate justice, or law, or established rules?

                the corn interest, and the interests of the republic in future times, though you
                came to the administration of affairs when matters were so managed that sufficient
                corn was supplied to the Roman people from <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName>, and still it was a profitable thing for the cultivators to
                plough and till their land? What have you brought about? What have you gained? In
                order that, while you were praetor, some addition might be made to the revenue
                derived from the tenths, you have caused the allotments of land to be deserted and
                abandoned. Lucius Metellus succeeded you. Were you more innocent than Metellus? Were
                you more desirous of credit and honour? For you were seeking the consulship, but
                Metellus neglected the renown which he had inherited from his father and his
                grandfather. He sold the tenths for much less, not only than you had done, but even
                than those had who had sold them before you. <milestone n="17" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>I ask, if he himself could not contrive any means for selling them at the best
                possible price, could he not follow in the fresh steps of you the very last praetor,
                so as to use your admirable edicts and regulations, invented and devised by you
                their author? <milestone n="44" unit="section"/> But he thought that he should not
                at all be a Metellus if he imitated you in anything; he who when he thought that he
                was to go to that province sent letters to the cities of <placeName

                  >Rome</placeName>, a thing which no one in the memory of man ever did before, in
                which he exhorts and entreats the Sicilians to plough and sow their land for the
                service of the Roman people. He begs this some time before his arrival, and at the
                same time declares that he will sell the tenths according to the law of Hiero; that
                is to say, that in the whole business of the tenths he will do nothing like that
                man. And he writes this, not from being impelled by any covetousness to send letters
                into the province before his time, but out of prudence, lest, if the seed-time
                passed, we should have not a single grain of corn in the province of <placeName

              <p>It is these letters, O judges, of Lucius Metellus, which you have heard, that have
                raised all the corn that there in this year in <placeName key="tgn,7003122"

                if Metellus had not sent this letter. What? Did this idea occur to Metellus by
                inspiration, or had he his information from the Sicilians who had come to <placeName
                  key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> in great numbers, and from the traders of
                  <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>? And who is ignorant what great
                crowds of them assembled at the door of the Marcelli, the most ancient patrons of
                  <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>? what crowds of them thronged to
                Cnaeus Pompeius, the consul elect, and to the rest of the men connected with the
                province? And such a thing never yet took place in the instance of any one, as for a
                man to be openly accused by those people over whose property and families he had
                supreme dominion and power. So great was the effect of his injuries, that men
                preferred to suffer anything, rather than not to bewail themselves and complain of
                his wickedness and injuries. <milestone n="46" unit="section"/> And when Metellus
                had sent these letters couched in almost a supplicating tone to all the cities,
                still he was far from prevailing with them to sow the land as they formerly had. For
                many had fled, as I shall presently show, and had left not only their allotments of
                land, but even their paternal homes, being driven away by the injuries of that man.
                I will not indeed, O judges, say anything for the sake of unduly exaggerating my
                charges. But the sentiments which I have imbibed through my eyes and in my mind,
                those I will state to you truly, and, as far as I can, plainly. <milestone n="47"
                  unit="section"/> For when four years afterwards I came into <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, it appeared to me in such a condition as
                those countries are apt to be in, in which a bitter and long war has been carried
                on. Those plains and fields which I had formerly seen beautiful and verdant, I now
                saw so laid waste and desolate that the very land itself seemed to feel the want of
                its cultivators, and to be mourning for its master. The land of Herbita, of
                  <placeName key="tgn,7003916">Enna</placeName>, of Morgantia, of Assoria, of
                Imachara, and of <placeName key="tgn,1043116">Agyrium</placeName>, was so deserted
                as to its principal part, that we had to look not only for the allotments of land,
                but also for the body of owners. But the district of <placeName key="tgn,7003867"
                  >Aetna</placeName>, which used to be most highly cultivated, and that which was
                the very head of the corn country, the district of Leontini, the character of which
                was formerly such that when you had once seen that sown, you did not fear any
                dearness of provisions, was so rough and unsightly, that in the most fruitful part
                of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> we were asking where <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> could be gone? The previous year had, indeed,
                greatly shaken the cultivators, but the last one had utterly ruined them. <milestone

              <p>Will you dare also to make mention to me of the tenths? Do you, after such
                wickedness, after such cruelty, after such numerous and serious injuries done to
                people, when the whole province of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>
                entirely depends on its arable land, and on its rights connected with that land;
                after the cultivators have been entirely ruined, the fields deserted&mdash;after
                you have left no one in so wealthy and populous a province&mdash;not only no
                property, but no hope even remaining; do you, I say, think that you can acquire any
                popularity by saying that you have sold the tenths at a better price than the other
                praetors? As if the Roman people had formed this wish, or the senate had given you
                this commission, by seizing all the fortunes of the cultivators under the name of
                tenths, to deprive the Roman people for all future time of that revenue, and of
                their supply of corn; and, as if after that, by adding some part of your own plunder
                to the total amount got from the tenths, you could appear to have deserved well of
                the Roman people. And I say this, as if his injustice was to be reproved in this
                particular, that, out of a desire for credit to be got by surpassing others in the
                sum derived from tenths, he had put forth a law rather too severe, and edicts rather
                too stringent, and rejected the examples of all his predecessors. <milestone n="49"
                  unit="section"/> You sold the tenths at a high price. What will be said, if I

                What is there to obtain popularity for you in that plan of yours, when you took for
                yourself from a province of the Roman people a share equal to that which you sent to
                the Roman people? What will be said if I prove that you took twice as much corn
                yourself as you sent to the Roman people? Shall we still expect to see your advocate
                toss his head at this accusation, and throw himself on the people, and on the
                assembly here present? These things you have heard before, O judges; but perhaps you
                have heard it on no other authority than report, and the common conversation of men.
                Know now that an enormous sum was taken by him on pretences connected with corn; and
                consider at the same time the profligacy of that saying of his, when he said that by
                the profit made on the tenths alone, he could buy himself off from all his dangers.
                  <milestone n="20" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="50" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>We have heard this for a long time, O judges. I say that there is not one of you
                who has not often heard that the collectors of the tenths were that mans partners. I
                do not think that anything else has been said against him falsely by those who think
                ill of him but this. For they are to be considered partners of a man, with whom the
                gains of a business are shared. But I say that the whole of these gains, and the
                whole of the fortunes of the cultivators, went to Verres alone. I say that Apronius,
                and those slaves of Venus, who were quite a new class of farmers first heard of in
                his praetorship! and the other collectors, were only agents of that one man's gains,
                and ministers of his plunder. How do you prove that? <milestone n="51"
                  unit="section"/> How did I prove that he had committed robbery in the contract for
                those pillars? Chiefly, I think, by this fact, that he had put forth an unjust and
                unprecedented law. For who ever attempted to change all the rights of people, and
                the customs of all men, getting great blame for so doing, except for some gain? I
                will proceed and carry this matter further. You sold the tenths according to an
                unjust law, in order to sell them for more money. Why, when the tenths were now
                knocked down and sold,&mdash;when nothing could now be added to their sum total,
                but much might be to your own gains,&mdash;why did new edicts appear, made on a
                sudden and to meet an emergency? For I say, that in your third year you issued
                edicts, that a collector might summon a man before the court anywhere he liked; that
                the cultivator might not remove his corn from the threshing-floor, before he had
                settled the claims of the collector; that they should have the tenths delivered at
                the water-side before the first of August. All these edicts, I say, you issued after
                the tenths had been sold. But if you had issued them for the sake of the republic,
                notice would have been given of them at the time of selling; because you were acting
                with a view to your own interest, you, being prompted by your love of gain and by
                the emergency, repaired the omission which had unintentionally occurred. <milestone

                without any profit, or even without the greatest profit to yourself, disregarded the

                at all inconsistent with the opinion you yourself had formed,&mdash;still to
                allow the cultivators of the soil to be harassed and plundered with circumstances of
                the most scandalous injustice? In truth, though you are a man of singular cruelty
                and audacity, still you would be unwilling for a whole province to be alienated from
                you,&mdash;for so many most honourable men to be made your greatest enemies, if
                your desire for money and present booty had not overcome all reason and all

                  key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, and came to <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
                  >Rome</placeName> with many others who had been driven away by that man. He then
                contrived that the collector should assert that Nympho had not made a proper return
                of his number of acres, according to that notable edict, which had no other object
                except making profit of this sort. <milestone n="54" unit="section"/> As Nympho
                wished to defend himself in a regular action, he appoints some excellent judges,
                that same physician Cornelius, (his real name is Artemidorus, a citizen of Perga,
                under which name he had formerly in his own country acted as guide to Verres, and as
                prompter in his exploit of plundering the temple of Diana,) and Volusius the
                soothsayer, and Valerius the crier. Nympho was condemned before he had fairly got
                into court. In what penalty? perhaps you will ask, for there was no fixed sum
                mentioned in the edict In the penalty of all the corn which was on his
                threshing-floors. So Apronius the collector takes, by a penalty for violating an
                edict, and not by any rights connected with his farming the revenue&mdash;not
                the tenth that was due, not corn that had been removed and concealed, but seven
                thousand <foreign lang="la">medimni</foreign> of wheat&mdash;from the allotments
                of Nympho. <milestone n="22" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="55" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>A farm belonging to the wife of <persName><surname>Xeno</surname></persName>
                Menenius, a most noble man, had been let to a settler. The settler, because he could
                not bear the oppressive conduct of the collectors, had fled from his land. Verres
                gave his favourite sentence of condemnation against <persName><surname>Xeno</surname></persName> for not having made a return of his acres. <persName><surname>Xeno</surname></persName>said that it was no business of his; that the
                farm was let. Verres ordered a trial to take place according to this
                formula,&mdash;&ldquo;If it should appear&rdquo; that there were more
                acres in the farm than the settler had returned, then <persName><surname>Xeno</surname></persName> was to be condemned. He said not only that he had not been the
                cultivator of the land, which was quite sufficient, but also that he was neither the
                owner of that farm, nor the lessor of it; that it belonged to his wife; that she
                herself transacted her own affairs; that she had let the land. A man of the very
                highest reputation, and of the greatest authority, defended <persName><surname>Xeno</surname></persName>, Marcus Cossetius. Nevertheless Verres ordered
                a trial, in which the penalty was fixed at eighty thousand <foreign lang="la"
                  >sesterces</foreign>. <persName><surname>Xeno</surname></persName>, although he
                saw that judges were provided for him out of that band of robbers, still said that
                he would stand the trial. Then that fellow, with a loud voice, so that Xeno might
                hear it, orders his slaves of Venus to take care the man does not escape while the
                trial is proceeding, and as soon as it is over to bring him before him. And at the
                same time he said also, that he did not think that, if from his riches he
                disregarded the penalty of a conviction, he would also disregard the scourge. He,
                under the compulsion of this violence and this fear, paid the collectors all that
                Verres commanded. <milestone n="23" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="56" unit="section"

              <p>There is a citizen of Morgentia, named Polemarchus, a virtuous and honourable man.
                He, when seven hundred <foreign lang="la">medimni</foreign> were demanded as the
                tenths due on fifty acres, because he refused to pay them, was summoned before the
                praetor at his own house; and, as he was still in bed, he was introduced into his
                bed-chamber, into which no one else was admitted, except his woman and the
                collector. There he was beaten and kicked about till, though he had refused before
                to pay seven hundred <foreign lang="la">medimni</foreign>, he now promised a
                thousand. Eubulides Grosphus is a man of Centuripa, a man above all others of his

                judges, the most honourable man of a most honourable city, not merely only so much
                corn, but only so much life as pleased Apronius. For by force, by violence, and by
                blows, he was induced to give corn, not as much as he had, but as much as was
                demanded of him, which was even more. <milestone n="57" unit="section"/> Sostratus,
                and Numenius, and Nymphodorus, of the same city, three brothers of kindred
                sentiments, when they had fled from their lands because more corn was demanded of
                them than their lands had produced, were treated thus,&mdash;Apronius collected
                a band of men, came into their allotments, took away all their tools, carried off
                their slaves, and drove off their live stock. Afterwards, when Nymphodorus came to
                  <placeName key="tgn,7003867">Aetna</placeName> to him, and begged to have his
                property restored to him, he ordered the man to be seized and hung up on a wild
                olive, a tree which is the forum there; and an ally and friend of the Roman people,
                a settler and cultivator of your domain, hung suspended from a tree in a city of our
                allies, and in the very forum, for as long a period as Apronius chose. <milestone
                  n="58" unit="section"/> I have now been recounting to you, O judges, the species
                of countless injuries which he has wrought,&mdash;one of each sort. An infinite
                host of evil actions I pass over. Place before your own eyes, keep in your minds,
                these invasions by collectors of the whole of <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName>, their plunderings of the cultivators of the soil, the
                harshness of this man, the absolute reign of Apronius. He despised the Sicilians; he
                did not consider them as men, he thought that they would not be vigorous in avenging
                themselves, and that you would treat their oppression lightly. <milestone n="24"
                  unit="chapter"/><milestone n="59" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>Be it so. He adopted a false opinion about them, and a very injurious one about
                you. But while he deserved so ill of the Sicilians, at least, I suppose, he was
                attentive to the Roman citizens; he favoured them; he was wholly devoted to securing
                their good-will and favour? He attentive to the Roman citizens? There were no men to
                whom he was more severe or more hostile. I say nothing of chains, of imprisonment,
                of scourgings, of executions. I say nothing even of that cross which he wished to be
                a witness to the Roman citizens of his humanity and benevolence to them. I say
                nothing, I say, of all this, and I put all this off to another opportunity. I am
                speaking about the tenths,&mdash;about the condition of the Roman citizens in
                their allotments; and how they were treated you heard from themselves. They have
                told you that their property was taken from them. <milestone n="60" unit="section"/>
                But since there was such a cause for it as there was, these things are to he
                endured,&mdash;I mean, the absence of all influence in justice, of all influence
                in established customs. There are, in short, no evils, O judges, of such magnitude
                that bravo men, of great and free spirit, think them intolerable. What shall we say
                if, while that man was praetor, violent hands were, without any hesitation, laid by
                Apronius on Roman knights, who were not obscure, nor unknown, but honourable, and
                even illustrious? What more do you expect? What more do you think I can say? Must I
                pass as quickly as possible from that man and from his actions, in order to come to
                Apronius, as, when I was in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, I
                promised him that I would do?&mdash;who detained for two days in the public
                place at Leontini, Caius Matrinius, a man, O judges, of the greatest virtue, the
                greatest industry, the highest popularity. Know, O judges, that a Roman knight was
                kept two days without food, without a roof over his head, by a man born in disgrace,
                trained in infamy, practiced in accommodating himself to all Verres's vices and
                lusts; that he was kept and detained by the guards of Apronius two days in the forum
                at Leontini, and not released till he had agreed to submit to his terms. <milestone

              <p>For why, O judges, should I speak of Quintus Lollius, a Roman knight of tried
                probity and honour? (the matter which I am going to mention is clear, notorious, and
                undoubted throughout all <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                >Sicily</placeName>;)&mdash;who, as he was a cultivator of the domain in the
                district of <placeName key="tgn,7003867">Aetna</placeName>, and as his farm belonged
                to Apronius's district as well as the rest, relying on the ancient authority and
                influence of the equestrian order, declared that he would not pay the collectors
                more than was due from him to them. His words are reported to Apronius. He laughed,
                and marveled that Lollius had heard nothing of Matrinius or of his other actions. He
                sends his slaves of Venus to the man. Remark this also, that a collector had
                officers appointed to attend him by the praetor; and see if this is a slight
                argument that he abused the name of the collectors to purposes of his own gain.
                Lollius is brought before Apronius by the slaves of Venus, and dragged along, at a
                convenient moment, when Apronius had just returned from the palaestra, and was lying
                on a couch which he had spread in the forum of Aetna Lollius is placed in the middle
                of that seemly banquet of gladiators. <milestone n="62" unit="section"/> I would
                not, in truth, O judges, believe the things which I am now saying although I heard
                them commonly talked about, if the old man had not himself told them to me in the
                most solemn manner, when he was with tears expressing his thanks to me and to the
                willingness with which I had undertaken this accusation. A Roman knight, I say,
                nearly ninety years old, is placed in the middle of Apronius's banquet, while
                Apronius in the meantime was rubbing his head and face with ointment.
                &ldquo;What is this, Lollius,&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;cannot you behave
                properly, unless you are compelled by severe measures?&rdquo; What was the man
                to do? should he hold his tongue, or answer him? In truth he, a man of that bright
                character, and that age, did not know what to do. Meantime Apronius called for
                supper and wine; and his slaves, who were of no better manners than their master,
                and were born of the same class and in the same rank of life, brought these things
                before the eyes of Lollius. The guests began to laugh, Apronius himself roared;
                unless, perchance, you suppose that he did not laugh in the midst of wine and
                feasting, who even now at the time of his danger and ruin cannot suppress his
                laughter. Not to detain you too long; know, O judges, that Quintus Lollius, under
                the compulsion of these insults, came into the terms and conditions of Apronius.
                  <milestone n="63" unit="section"/> Lollius, enfeebled by old age and disease,
                could not come to give his evidence. What need have we of Lollius? There is no one
                who is ignorant of this, no one of your own friends, no one who is brought forward
                by you, no one at all who, if he is asked, will say that he now hears this for the
                first time. Marcus Lollius, his son, a most excellent young man, is present; you
                shall hear what he says&mdash;For Quintus Lollius, his son, who was the accuser
                of Calidius, a young man both virtuous and bold, and of the highest reputation for
                eloquence, when being excited by these injuries and insults he had set out for
                  <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, was murdered on the way; and the
                crime of his death is imputed indeed to fugitive slaves; but, in reality, no one in
                  <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> doubts that he must be murdered
                because he could not keep to himself his intentions respecting Verres. He, in truth,
                had no doubt that the man who, under the prompting of a mere love of justice, had
                already accused another, would be ready as an accuser for him on his arrival, when
                he was stimulated by the injuries of his father, and indignation at the treatment
                received by his family. <milestone n="26" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="64"

                been able to submit to this unprecedented, and extraordinary, and incredible series
                of injuries and insults? All men are now aware why the whole province sought out
                that man as a defender of its safety, from the effects of whose good faith, and
                diligence, and perseverance Verres could not possibly be saved. You have been
                present at many trials, you know that many guilty and wicked men have been impeached
                within your own recollection, and that of your ancestors. Have you ever seen any

                them with him about the different cities; he ordered banquets to be prepared and
                couches to be spread for him at the public expense, and to be spread for him in the
                forum. Thither he ordered most honourable men to be summoned, not only Sicilians,
                but even Roman knights, so that men of the most thoroughly proved honour were
                detained at his banquet, when none but the most impure and profligate men would join
                him in a banquet. Would you, O most profligate and abandoned of all mortals, when
                you knew these things, when you were hearing of them every day, when you were seeing
                them, would you ever have allowed or endured that such things should have taken
                place, to your own great danger, if they had taken place without enormous profit to
                yourself? Was it the profit made by Apronius, and his most beastly conversation, and
                his flagitious caresses, that had such influence with you, that no care for or
                thought of your own fortunes ever touched your mind? <milestone n="66"

                torrent of collectors spread itself with violence, not only over the fields but also
                over all the other property of the cultivators; not only over the property, but also
                over the rights of liberty and of the state. You see some men suspended from trees;
                others beaten and scourged; others kept as prisoners in the public place; others
                left standing alone at a feast; others condemned by the physician and crier of the
                praetor; and nevertheless the property of all of them is carried off from the fields
                and plundered at the same time. What is all this? Is this the rule of the Roman
                people? Are these the laws of the Roman people? are these their tribunals? are these
                their faithful allies? is this their suburban province? Are not rather all these

                The state of <placeName key="tgn,1043116">Agyrium</placeName> is among the first in
                all <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> for honour;&mdash;a state of
                men wealthy before this man came as praetor, and of excellent cultivators of the
                soil. When this same Apronius had purchased the tenths of that district, he came to
                  <placeName key="tgn,1043116">Agyrium</placeName>; and when he had come thither
                with his regular attendants&mdash;that is to say, with threats and
                violence,&mdash;he began to ask an immense sum, so that when he had got his
                profit, he might depart. He said that he did not wish to have any trouble, nut that,
                when he had got his money, he would depart as soon as possible to some other city.
                All the Sicilians are not contemptible men, if only our magistrates leave them
                alone; but they are many, of sufficient courage, and very economical and temperate,
                and among the very first is this city of which I am now speaking, O judges.

                they will give him the tenths which are due from them, that they will not add to
                them any profit for himself, especially since he had bought them an excellent
                bargain. Apronius informs Verres, whose business it ready was, what was going on.

                most just man, tried to strike his old terror into the wretched Agyrians; he
                threatened that he would appoint their judges out of his own retinue. The Agyrians,

                physician, Valerius, the crier, Tlepolemus, the painter, and judges of that sort;
                not one of whom was a Roman citizen, but Greek robbers of temples, long since
                infamous, and now all Corneliuses. The Agyrians saw that whatever charge Apronius
                brought before whose judges, he would very easily prove; but they preferred to be
                convicted, and so add to his unpopularity and infamy, rather than accede to his
                conditions and terms. They asked what formula would be given to the judges on which
                to try them? He answered, &ldquo;If it appeared that they had acted contrary to
                the edict,&rdquo; on which formula he said that he should pronounce judgment.
                They preferred trying the question according to a most unjust formula, and with most
                profligate judges, rather than come to any settlement with him of their own accord.
                He sent Timarchides privately to them, to warn them, if they were wise, to settle
                the matter. They refused. &ldquo;What, then, will you do? Do you prefer to be
                convicted each of you in a penalty of fifty thousand <foreign lang="la"
                  >sesterces</foreign>?&rdquo; They said they did. Then he said out loud, in the
                hearing of every one, &ldquo;Whoever is condemned, shall be beaten to death with
                rods.&rdquo; On this they began with tears to beg and entreat him to be allowed
                to give up their cornfields, and all their produce, and their allotments, when
                stripped of everything, to Apronius, and to depart themselves without insult and
                annoyance. <milestone n="70" unit="section"/> These were the terms, O judges, on
                which Verres sold the tenths. Hortensius may say, if he pleases, that Verres sold
                them at a high price. <milestone n="29" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>This was the condition of the cultivators of the soil while that man was praetor;
                that they thought themselves exceedingly well off, if they might give up their
                fields when stripped of everything to Apronius, for they wished to escaped the many
                crosses which were set before their eyes. Whatever Apronius had declared to be due,
                that they were forced to give, according to the edict. Suppose he declared more was
                due than the land produced? Just so. How could that be? The magistrates were bound,
                according to his own edict, to compel the payment. Well, but the cultivators could
                recover. Yes, but Artemidorus was the judge. What next? What happened if the
                cultivator had given less than Apronius had demanded? A prosecution of the
                cultivator to recover a fourfold penalty. Before judges taken from what body? From
                that admirable retinue of most honourable men in attendance on the praetor. What
                more? I say that you returned less than the proper number of acres: select judges
                for the matter which is to be tried, namely, your violation of the edict. Out of
                what class? Out of the same retinue. What will be the end of it? If you are
                convicted, (and what doubt can there be about a conviction with those judges?) you
                must be beaten to death with rods. When these are the rules, these the conditions,
                will there be any one so foolish as to think that what was sold were the tenths? Who
                believes that nine parts were left to the cultivator? Who does not perceive that
                that fellow considered as his own gain and plunder the property and possessions and
                fortunes of the cultivators? From fear of the gods the Agyrians said that they would
                do what they were commanded to. <milestone n="30" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="71"

              <p>Listen now to what his orders were; and conceal, if you can, that you are aware of
                what all <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> well knew, that the praetor
                himself was the farmer of the tenths, or rather the lord and sovereign of all the
                allotments in the province. He orders the Agyrians to take the tenths themselves in
                the name of their city, and to give a compliment to Apronius. If he had bought them
                at a high price, since you are a man who inquired into the proper price with great
                diligence, who, as you say, sold them at a high price, why do you think that a
                compliment ought to be added as a present to the purchaser? Be it so; you did think
                so. Why did you order them to add it? What is the meaning; of taking and
                appropriating money, for which the law has a hold on you, if this is not
                it,&mdash;I mean the compelling men by force and despotic power against their
                will to give a compliment to another, that is to say, to give him money? <milestone
                  n="72" unit="section"/> Well, what comes next? If they were ordered to give some
                small compliment to Apronius, the delight of the praetor's life, suppose that it was
                given to Apronius, if it seems to you the compliment to Apronius, and not the
                plunder of the praetor. You order them to take the tenths; to give Apronius a
                compliment,&mdash;thirty-three thousand <foreign lang="la">medimni</foreign> of
                wheat. What is this? One city is compelled by the command of the praetor to give to
                the Roman people out of one district almost food enough to support it for a month.
                Did you sell the tenths at a high price, when such a compliment was given to the
                collector? In truth, if you had inquired carefully into the proper price, then when
                you were selling them, they would rather have given ten thousand <foreign lang="la"
                  >medimni</foreign> more then, than six hundred thousand <foreign lang="la"
                  >sesterces</foreign> afterwards. It seems a great booty. Listen to what follows,
                and remark it carefully, so as to be the less surprised that the Sicilians, being
                compelled by their necessity, entreated aid from their patrons, from the consuls,
                from the senate, from the laws, from the tribunals. <milestone n="73" unit="section"
                /> To pay Apronius for testing the wheat which was given to him, Verres orders the
                Agyrians to pay Apronius three <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign> for every
                  <foreign lang="la">medimnus</foreign>. <milestone n="31" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>What is this? When such a quantity of corn has been extorted and exacted under the
                name of a compliment, is money to be exacted besides for testing the corn? Or could,
                not only Apronius, but any one, if corn was to be served out to the army, disapprove
                of the Sicilian corn, which Verres might have measured on the threshing-floor, if he
                had liked? That vast quantity of corn is given and extorted at your command. That is
                not enough. Money is demanded besides. It is paid. That is too little. For the
                tenths of barley more money is extorted. You order thirty thousand <foreign
                  lang="la">sesterces</foreign> to be paid. And so from one city there are extorted
                by force, by threats, by the despotic power and injustice of the praetor
                thirty-three thousand <foreign lang="la">medimni</foreign> of wheat, and besides
                that, sixty thousand <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign>! Are these things
                obscure? Or, even if all the world wished it, can those things be obscure which you
                did openly, which you ordered in open court, which you extorted when every one was
                looking on? concerning which matters the magistrates and five chief men of Agyrium,
                whom you summoned from their homes for the sake of your own gain, reported your acts
                and commands to their own senate at home; and that report, according to their laws,
                was recorded in the public registers, and the ambassadors of the Agyrians, most
                noble men, are at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and have deposed
                to these facts in evidence. <milestone n="74" unit="section"/> Examine the public

                evidence is read.] You have remarked in this evidence, O judges, that Apollodorus,
                whose surname is Pyragrus, the chief man of his city, have his evidence with tears,
                and said that since the name of the Roman people had been heard by and known to the
                Sicilians, the Agyrians had never either said or done anything contrary to the
                interests of even the meanest of the Roman citizens; but that now they are compelled
                by great injuries, and great suffering to give evidence in a public manner against a
                praetor of the Roman people. You cannot, in truth. O Verres, invalidate the evidence
                of this one city by your defence; so great a weight is there in the fidelity of
                these men, such great indignation is there at their injuries, such great
                conscientiousness is there in the way in which they gave their evidence. But it is

              <p>Let us now, in regular order, proceed to see in what way the city of Herbita, an
                honourable and formerly a wealthy city, was harassed and plundered by him. A city of
                what sort of men? Of excellent agriculturists, men most remote from courts of law,
                from tribunals, and from disputes; whom you, O most profligate of men, ought to have
                spared, whose interests you ought to have consulted, the whole race of whom you

                  addressed by Cicero to the Judges.</note>
                <foreign lang="la">medimni</foreign> of wheat. When Atidius, who was also his
                servant in the matter of tenths, had purchased them, and when he had come to Herbita
                with the title of' prefect, attended by the slaves of Verres, and when a place where
                he might lodge had been assigned him by the public act of the city, the people of
                Herbita are compelled to give him as a profit thirty-seven thousand <foreign
                  lang="la">modii</foreign> of wheat, when the tenths of the wheat had been sold at
                eighteen thousand. And they are compelled to give this vast quantity of wheat in the
                name of their city, since the private cultivators of the soil had already fled from
                their lands, having been plundered and driven away by the injuries of the
                collectors. <milestone n="76" unit="section"/> In the second year, when Apronius had
                bought the tenths of wheat for twenty-five thousand <foreign lang="la"
                  >modii</foreign>, and when he himself had come to Herbita with his whole force and
                his whole band of robbers, the people was compelled to give him in the name of the
                city a present of twenty-six thousand <foreign lang="la">modii</foreign> of wheat,
                and a further gift of two thousand <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign>. I am not
                quite sure about this further gift, whether it was not given to Apronius himself as
                wages for his trouble, and a reward for his impudence. But concerning such an
                immense quantity of wheat, who can doubt that it came to that robber of corn,
                Verres, just as the corn of <placeName key="tgn,1043116">Agyrium</placeName> did?
                But in the third year he adopted in this district the custom of sovereigns.

              <p>They say that the barbarian kings of the Persians and Syrians are accustomed to
                have several wives, and to give to these wives cities in this
                fashion:&mdash;that this city is to dress the woman's waist, that one to dress
                her neck, that to dress her hair; and so they have whole nations not only privy to
                their lusts, but also assistants in it. <milestone n="77" unit="section"/> Learn
                that the licentiousness and lust of that man who thought himself king of the
                Sicilians, was much the same. The name of the wife of Aeschrio, a Syracusan, is
                Pippa, whose name has been made notorious over all <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName> by that man's profligacy, and many verses were inscribed on
                the praetor's tribunal, and over the praetor's head, about that woman. This
                Aeschrio, the imaginary husband of Pippa, is appointed as a new farmer of the tenths
                of Herbita. When the men of Herbita saw that if the business got into Aeschrio's
                hands they should be plundered at the will of a most dissolute woman, they did
                against him as far as they thought that they could go. Aeschrio bid on, for he was
                not afraid that, while Verres was praetor, the woman, who would be really the
                farmer, would ever be allowed to lose by it. The tenths are knocked down to him at
                thirty-five thousand <foreign lang="la">medimni</foreign>, nearly half as much again
                as they had fetched the preceding year. The cultivators were utterly destroyed, and
                so much the more because in the preceding year they had been drained dry, and almost
                ruined. He was aware that they had been sold at so high a price, that more could not
                be squeezed out of the people; so he deducts from the sum total three thousand six
                hundred <foreign lang="la">medimni</foreign>, and enters on the registers thirty-one

              <p>Docimus had bought the tenths of barley belonging to the same district. This
                Docimus is the man who had brought to Verres Tertia, the daughter of Isidorus the
                actor, having taken her from a Rhodian flute-player. The influence of this woman
                Tertia was greater with him than that of Pippa, or of all the other women, and I had
                almost said, was as great in his Sicilian praetorship as that of Chelidon had been
                in his city praetorship. There come to Herbita the two rivals of the praetor, not
                likely to be troublesome to him, infamous agents of most abandoned women. They begin
                to demand, to beg, to threaten; but though they wished it, they were not able to
                imitate Apronius. The Sicilians were not so much afraid of Sicilians; still, as they
                put forth false accusations in every possible way, the Herbitenses undertake to
                appear in court at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>. When they
                had arrived there, they are compelled to give to Aeschrio&mdash;that is, to
                Pippa&mdash;as much as had been deducted from the original purchase-money, three
                thousand six hundred <foreign lang="la">modii</foreign> of wheat. He was not willing
                to give to the woman who was really the farmer too much profits out of the tenths,
                lest in that case she should transfer her attention from her nocturnal gains to the
                farming of the tributes. <milestone n="79" unit="section"/> The people of Herbita
                thought the matter was settled, when that man added,&mdash;&ldquo;And what
                are you going to give out of the barley to my little friend Docimus? What are your
                intentions?&rdquo; He transacted all this business, O judges, in his chamber,
                and in his bed. They said that they had no commission to give anything: &ldquo;I
                do not hear you; pay him fifteen thousand <foreign lang="la"
                >sesterces</foreign>.&rdquo; What were the wretched men to do I or how could
                they refuse? especially when they saw the traces of the woman who was the collector
                fresh in the bed, by which they understood that he had been inflamed to persevere in
                his demand. And so one city of our allies and friends was made tributary of two most
                debauched women while Verres was praetor. And I now assert that that quantity of
                corn and those sums of money were given by the people of Herbita to the collectors
                in the name of the city. And yet by all that corn and all that money they could not
                deliver their fellow citizens from the injuries of the collectors. For after the
                property of the cultivators was destroyed and carried off, bribes were still to be
                given to the collectors to induce them to depart at length from their lands and from
                their cities. <milestone n="80" unit="section"/> And so when Philinus of Herbita, a
                man eloquent and prudent, and noble in his own city, spoke in public of the distress
                of the cultivators, and of their flight, and of the scanty numbers that were left
                behind, you remarked, O judges, the groans of the Roman people, a great crowd of
                whom has always been present at this cause. And concerning the scanty number of the
                cultivators I will speak at another time. <milestone n="35" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>But at this moment a topic, which I had almost passed over, must not be altogether
                forgotten. For, in the name of the immortal gods! how will you, I will not say
                tolerate, but how will you bear even to hear of the sums which Verres subtracted
                from the sum total? <milestone n="81" unit="section"/> Up to this time there has
                been one man only since the first foundation of <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
                  >Rome</placeName>, (and may the immortal gods grant that there may never be
                another,) to whom the republic wholly committed herself, being compelled by the
                necessities of the times and domestic misfortunes. He had such power, that without
                his consent no one could preserve either his property, or his liberty, or his life.
                He had such courage in his audacity, that he was not afraid to say in the public
                assembly, when he was selling the property of Roman citizens, that he was selling
                his own booty. All his actions we not only still maintain, but out of fear of
                greater inconveniences and calamities, we defend them by the public authority. One
                decree alone of his has been remodeled by a resolution of the senate, and a decree
                has been passed, that these men, from the sum total of whose debts he had made a
                deduction, should pay the money into the treasury. The senate laid down this
                principle,&mdash;that even he to whom they had entrusted everything had not
                power to diminish the total amount of revenue acquired and procured by the valour of
                the Roman people. <milestone n="82" unit="section"/> The conscript fathers decided
                that he had no power to remit even to the bravest men any portion of their debts to
                the state. And shall the senators decide that you have lawfully remitted any to a
                most profligate woman? The man, concerning whom the Roman people had established a
                law that his absolute will should be the law to the Roman people, still is found
                fault with in this one particular, out of reverence for their ancient laws. Did you,
                who were liable to almost every law, think that your lust and caprice was to be a
                law to you? He is blamed for remitting a part of that money which he himself had
                acquired. Shall you be pardoned who have remitted part of the revenue due to the

              <p>And in this description of boldness he proceeded even much more shamelessly with
                respect to the tenths of the district of Segesta; for when he had knocked them down
                to this same Docimus, for five thousand <foreign lang="la">modii</foreign> of wheat,
                and had added as an extra present fifteen thousand <foreign lang="la"
                  >sesterces</foreign>, he compelled the people of Segesta to take them of Docimus
                at the same price in the name of their city; and you shall have this proved by the
                public testimony of the Segestans. Read the public testimony [The public testimony
                is read.] You have heard at what price the city took the tenths from
                Docimus,&mdash;at five thousand <foreign lang="la">modii</foreign> of wheat, and
                an extra gift. Learn now at what price he entered them in his accounts as having
                been sold. [The law respecting the sale of tithes, Caius Verres being the praetor,
                is read.] You see that in this item three thousand bushels of wheat are deducted
                from the sum total, and when he had taken all this from the food of the Roman
                people, from the sinews of the revenue, from the blood of the treasury, he gave it
                to Tertia the actress? Shall I call it rather an impudent action, to extort from
                allies of the state, or an infamous one to give it to a prostitute? or a wicked one
                to take it away from the Roman people, or an audacious one to make false entries in
                the public accounts? Can any influence or any bribery deliver you from the severity
                of these judges? And if it should deliver you, do you not still see that the things
                which I am mentioning belong to another count of the prosecution, and to the action
                for peculation? <milestone n="84" unit="section"/> Therefore I will reserve the
                whole of that class of offences, and return to the charge respecting the corn and
                the tenths which I had begun to speak of. </p>
              <p>While this man was laying waste the largest and most fertile districts by his own
                agency, that is to say by Apronius, that second Verres, he had others whom he could
                send, like hounds, among the lesser cities, worthless and infamous men, to whom he

                interpreter of the Greek language, but also in his robberies and other crimes. This
                interpreter, an insignificant and needy man, becomes on a sudden a farmer of tenths.
                He purchases the tenths of the territory of <placeName key="tgn,7008315"
                  >Lipara</placeName>, a poor and barren district, for six hundred <foreign

                pay Valentius thirty thousand <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign> as profit. O ye
                immortal gods! which argument will you take for your defence; that you sold the
                tenths for so much less than you might have done,&mdash;that the city

                this money from the people of <placeName key="tgn,7008315">Lipara</placeName>

                money was given to Valentius. [The public testimony is read.] [The statement how the

                island to one of your companions as a trifling present, and still were these profits
                from corn exacted from it as from the inland states? And therefore the men who for
                so many years, before you came as praetor, were in the habit of ransoming their
                lands from the pirates, now had a price set on themselves, and were compelled to
                ransom themselves from you. <milestone n="38" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="86"

              <p>What more need I say? Was not more extorted, under the name of a compliment, from
                the people of <placeName key="perseus,Tissa">Tissa</placeName>, a very small and
                poor city, but inhabited by very hard-working agriculturists and most frugal men,
                than the whole crop of corn which they had extracted from their land? Among them you
                sent as farmer Diognotus, a slave of Venus, a new class of collector altogether.
                Why, with such a precedent as this, are not the public slaves at <placeName
                  key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> also entrusted with the revenues? In the
                second year of your praetorship the Tissans are compelled against their will to give
                twenty-one thousand <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign> as a compliment. In the

                  >medimni</foreign> of wheat to Diognotus, a slave of Venus, as a compliment! This
                Diognotus, who is making such vast profits out of the public revenues, has no
                deputy, no <foreign lang="la">peculium</foreign> at all. Doubt now, if you can,
                whether this Venereal officer of Verres received such an immense quantity of corn
                for himself, or exacted it for his master. <milestone n="87" unit="section"/> And
                learn this also from the public testimony of the Tissans. [The public testimony of
                the Tissans is read.] Is it only obscurely, O judges, that the praetor himself is
                the farmer, when his officers exact corn from the cities, levy money on them, take
                something more as a compliment for themselves than they are to pay over to the Roman
                people under the name of tenths? This was your idea of equity in your
                command&mdash;this was your idea of the dignity of the praetor, to make the
                slaves of Venus the lords of the Sicilian people. This was the line drawn, these
                were the distinctions of rank, while you were the praetor, that the cultivators of
                the soil were to be considered in the class of slaves, the slaves in the light of

              <p>What more shall I say? Were not the wretched people of Amestratus, after such vast
                tenths had been imposed upon them, that they had nothing left for themselves, still
                compelled to pay money besides? The tenths are knocked down to Marcus Caesius in the
                presence of deputies from Amestratus and Heraclius, one of their deputies, is
                compelled at once to pay twenty-two thousand <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign>.
                What is the meaning of this? What is the meaning of this booty? of this violence? of
                this plundering of the allies? If Heraclius had been commissioned by his senate to
                purchase the tenths, he would have purchased them; if he was not, how could he pay
                money of his own accord? He reports to his fellow citizens that he has paid Caesius
                this money. Learn his report from his letters. <milestone n="89" unit="section"/>
                Read extracts from the public letters. [The public letters are read.] By what decree
                of the senate was this permission given to the deputy? By none. Why did he do so? He
                was compelled. Who says this? The whole city. Read the public testimony. [The public
                testimony is read.] By the same evidence you see that there was extorted from the
                same city in the second year a sum of money in a similar manner, and given to Sextus
                Vennonius. But you compel the Amestratines, needy men, after you have sold their
                tenths for eight hundred <foreign lang="la">medimni</foreign> to Banobalis, a slave
                of Venus, (just notice the names of the farmers,) to add more still as a compliment,
                than they had been sold for, though they had been sold at a high price. They gave
                Banobalis eight hundred <foreign lang="la">medimni</foreign> of wheat, and fifteen
                hundred <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign>. Surely that man would never have
                been so senseless, as to allow more corn to be given out of the domain of the Roman
                people to a slave of Venus than to the Roman people itself, unless all that plunder

                are especially anxious to do, you could prove that these compliments all went to the
                farmers, and that none of them reached you, still these sums, taken and extorted as
                they were by your violence and injustice, ought to ensure your conviction; but, as

                two slaves, to become rich at your own risk and that of your children, do you think
                that any one will doubt that through the instrumentality of those emissaries all

                of some other city than their own, contrary to every resolution of the senate, to
                all their rights and privileges, and to the Rupilian law. Hear the letters which he

              <p>Even if you were not aware that this body excelled all others in dignity, were you
                not at least aware of this, that it furnished the judges? Previously, when the
                equestrian order furnished the judges, infamous and rapacious magistrates in the
                provinces were subservient to the farmers; they honoured all who were in their
                employ; every Roman knight whom they saw in the province they pursued with
                attentions and courtesies; and that conduct was not so advantageous to the guilty,
                as it was a hindrance to many if they had acted in any respect contrary to the
                advantage or inclination of that body. This sort of principle was somehow or other
                diligently reserved among them as if by common consent, that whoever had thought any
                Roman knight deserving of any affront, was to be considered by their whole order as

                minds, even if there were no indignation from any personal injury done to
                themselves, still there would be this thought, that they were affronted in the
                affront offered to another, and that the dignity of their order was contemptuously
                treated and trampled on, which, O judges, appears to me not to be endured with
                patience, for insult has in it a sting which modest and virtuous men can with
                difficulty put up with. <milestone n="96" unit="section"/> You have plundered the

                you now, when they cannot be judges? What will you say when you treat senators also
                with the greatest violence? what else can you say but this, &ldquo;Give me up
                that senator also, in order that the most honourable name of senator may appear to

                in the case of Anneius alone, but in the instance of every senator, so that the name
                of that order had not so much influence in procuring honour as insult for its
                members. In the case of Caius Cassius, a most illustrious and most gallant man,
                though he was consul at that very time, in the first year of his praetorship, he
                behaved with such injustice, that, as his wife, a woman of the highest
                respectability, had lands in Leontini, inherited from her father, he ordered all her
                crops to be taken away for tenths. You shall have him as a witness in this cause, O

                character of the times; so that this order is, as it were, exposed to view, and set
                on an eminence, in order, as it seems, to be the more easily caught by every blast

                engaged about this class of injuries, O judges, in which it is not a case of single
                cultivators being stripped of all their property, but of compliments being exacted
                from the public treasury of each city, for the farmers, in order that at last they
                may depart from the lands and cities glutted and satiated with this immense heap of
                gain. <milestone n="43" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="101" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>Why in the third year of your praetorship did you order the Calactans to carry the
                tenths of their land, which they had been accustomed to pay at Calacta, to Marcus
                Caesius the farmer of Amestratus, a thing which they had never done before you were
                praetor, and which you yourself had never ordered in the two years preceding? Why
                was Theomnastus the Syracusan sent by you into the district of Mutyca, where he so
                harassed the cultivators, that for their second teethe they were unavoidably forced
                to buy wheat, because they had actually none of their own, (a thing which I shall
                prove happened also in the case of other cities.) <milestone n="102" unit="section"

                O judges, endure that a great deal more than has been produced should be exacted
                from our allies, from the cultivators of the domain of the Roman people, from those
                who are labouring for you, are in your service, who are so eager that the Roman
                people should be fed by them, that they only retain for themselves and their
                children enough for their actual subsistence, and should be exacted too with the

                I feel, O judges, that I must now set some bounds to the length of my speech, and
                that I must avoid wearying you. I will no longer dwell on one kind of injury alone,
                and I will leave the other instances out of my speech, though they will still make a

                Roman people, to the extent of one tenth of their produce, and to Caius Verres to
                the extent of all the rest; that to most of the cultivators nothing at all is left,
                that if anything was either remitted to or left to any one, it was only just so much
                as remained of that property by which the avarice of that man had bees satiated.

                explain what I have settled to mention. I will take the third year, because it is
                both the most recent, and because it has been managed by him in such a way that,
                since he knew that he was certainly going to depart, he evidently did not care if he
                left behind him not one cultivator of the soil in all <placeName key="tgn,7003122"

                spoke in the name of their city. You recollect that Artemidorus of <placeName

                name of his city, that Apronius had come to <placeName key="tgn,7003867"
                  >Aetna</placeName> with the slaves of Venus; that he had summoned the magistrates
                before him; that he had ordered a couch to be spread for him in the middle of the
                forum; that he was accustomed every day to feast not only in public, but at the
                public expense; that, when at those feasts the concert began to sound, and slaves
                began to serve him with wine in large goblets, then he used to detain the
                cultivators of the soil, and not only with injustice, but even with insolence, to
                extort, from them whatever quantity of corn he had ordered them to supply.
                  <milestone n="106" unit="section"/> You heard all these things, O judges, all
                which I now pass by and leave unnoticed. I say nothing of the luxury of Apronius,
                nothing of his insolence, nothing of his unexampled profligacy and wickedness; I
                will only speak of the gain and profit made out of one district in one year, so that
                you may the more easily be able to form your conjectures of the whole three years
                and of the whole of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>; but I do not
                mean to say much about the people of <placeName key="tgn,7003867">Aetna</placeName>,
                for they have come hither themselves, they have brought with them their public
                documents; they have proved to you what gains were made by that honest man, the
                intimate friend of the praetor, Apronius. I pray of you learn this from their own
                testimony. Read the testimony of the people of <placeName key="tgn,7003867"

                &ldquo;Three hundred thousand <foreign lang="la">medimni</foreign>; and fifty

                  >modii</foreign> of wheat, and fifty thousand <foreign lang="la"
                  >sesterces</foreign> besides, as a compliment to Apronius? Did the tenths sell for
                so much less than they were really worth? or, though they had been sold at a
                sufficiently high price, was such a quantity of corn and money nevertheless exacted
                by main force from the cultivators? For whichever of these you say was the truth,
                blame and criminality will attach to it. <milestone n="107" unit="section"/> For you
                certainly will not say (what I wish you would say) that this quantity never came to
                Apronius. So I will hold you here, not only by the public covenants and letters, but
                also from the private ones of the cultivators, so as to let you understand that you
                were not mere diligent in executing robberies, than I have been in detecting them.
                Will you be able to bear this? Will any one defend you? Will these men be able to
                endure this, if they are inclined to pronounce a sentence favourable to
                you,&mdash;that Quintus Apronius, at one visit, out of one district, (besides
                all the money which was paid him, and which I have mentioned,) should have taken
                three hundred thousand <foreign lang="la">modii</foreign> of wheat, under the name
                of a compliment? <milestone n="108" unit="section"/> What! are they the men of
                  <placeName key="tgn,7003867">Aetna</placeName> alone who say this? Yes, the
                Centuripans also, who are in occupation of far the largest part of the Aetnaean
                district, to whose ambassadors, most noble men, Andron and Artemon, their senate
                gave commissions which had reference to their city in his public capacity,
                concerning those injuries which the citizens of Centuripa sustained not in their own
                territories, but in those of others. The senate and people of Centuripa did not
                choose to send ambassadors; but the Centuripan cultivators of the soil, which is the
                greatest body of such men in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, a body
                of most honourable and most wealthy men, themselves selected three ambassadors,
                fellow citizens of their own, in order that by their evidence you might be made
                aware of the calamities, not of one district only, but of almost all <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>. For the Centuripans are engaged as
                cultivators of the soil in almost every part of <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName>. And they are the more important and the more trustworthy
                witnesses against you, because, the other cities ore influenced by their own
                distresses alone, the Centuripans as they occupy land in almost every district, have
                felt the injuries and wrongs of the other cities also. <milestone n="46"
                  unit="chapter"/><milestone n="109" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>But as I have said, the case of the men of <placeName key="tgn,7003867"
                  >Aetna</placeName> is clear enough, and established both by public and by private
                documents. The task allotted to my diligence is to be required of me rather in the
                district of Leontini, for this reason, because the Leontini themselves have not
                assisted me much by their public authority. Nor, in truth, while that fellow was
                praetor, did these injuries of the farmers very greatly affect them, or rather, I
                might say, they did them good. This may, perhaps, appear a marvellous or even an
                incredible thing to you, that in such general distress of the cultivators of the
                soil, the Leontini, who were the heads of the corn interest, should have been free
                from injury and calamity. This is the reason, O judges, that in the territory of
                Leontini, no one of the Leontini, with the exception of the single family of
                Mnasistratus, occupies any land. And so, O judges, you shall hear the evidence of
                Mnasistratus, a most honest and virtuous man. Do not expect to hear any others of
                the Leontini, whom not only Apronius, but whom even a tempest in their fields could
                not injure. They in truth not only suffered no inconvenience, but even in the rapine
                of Apronius they found gain and advantage. <milestone n="110" unit="section"/>
                Wherefore, since the city and embassy of the Leontini has failed me on account of
                the cause which I have mentioned, I must devise a plan and contrive a way for myself
                by which I may get at the gain of Apronius, or even at his enormous and wicked
                booty. The tenths of the Leontini territory were sold in the third year of Verres's
                praetorship for thirty-six thousand <foreign lang="la">medimni</foreign> of wheat;
                that is, for two hundred and twenty-six thousand <foreign lang="la">modii</foreign>
                of wheat. A great price, O judges, a great price; and I cannot deny it. Therefore it
                is certain that there must have been a loss, or at all events not a great gain to
                the farmers. For this very often happens to men who have taken a contract at a high
                rate. <milestone n="111" unit="section"/> What will you think if I prove to you
                that, by this one purchase, there were made a hundred thousand <foreign lang="la"
                  >modii</foreign> of profit? what if it was two hundred thousand? what if three?
                what if four hundred thousand was the sum? Will you still doubt for whom that
                immense booty was acquired? Will any one say that I am unfair if from the mere
                magnitude of the gain made I form a conjecture as to the direction of the stolen
                goods and plunder? What if I prove to you, O judges, that those men who are making
                four hundred thousand <foreign lang="la">modii</foreign> of profit would have
                suffered a loss if your iniquity, O Verres, if judges of your retinue had not
                stepped in? Can any one doubt, in a case of so much gain and so much iniquity, that
                you made such immense profit by dishonest means? that for such immense gains you
                were willing to be dishonest? <milestone n="47" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="112"
                  unit="section"/></p>
              <p>How then, O judges, am I to arrive at this knowledge of how much profit was made?
                Not from the accounts of Apronius, for when I sought for them, I could not find
                them, and when I brought him into court, I made him deny that he kept any accounts
                at all. If he was telling lies, why did he remove them out of the way, if they were
                likely to do you no harm? If he really had kept any accounts at all, does not that
                alone prove plainly enough, that it was not his own business that he was conducting?
                For it is a quality of tenths, that they cannot be managed without many papers; for
                it is necessary to keep an account of, and to set down in books the names of all the
                cultivators, and with each name the amount of their tenth. All the cultivators made
                returns of their acres according to your command and regulation; I do not believe
                that any one made a return of a smaller quantity than he had in cultivation, when
                there were so many crosses, so many penalties, so many judges of that retinue before
                his eyes. On an acre of Leontini ground about a <foreign lang="la"
                  >medimnus</foreign> of wheat is usually sown, according to the regular and
                constant allowance of seed. The land returns about eightfold on a fair average, but
                in an extraordinarily favourable season, about tenfold. And whenever that is the
                case, it then happens that the tenth is just the same quantity as was sown; that is
                to say, as many acres as are sown, so many <foreign lang="la">medimni</foreign> are
                due. <milestone n="113" unit="section"/> As this was the case, I say first of all,
                that the tenths of the territory of Leontini were sold for many more thousand
                  <foreign lang="la">medimni</foreign> than there were thousands of acres sown in
                the district of Leontini. But if it was impossible for them to produce more than ten
                  <foreign lang="la">medimni</foreign> on an acre, and if it was fair that a
                  <foreign lang="la">medimnus</foreign> should be paid out of each acre liable to
                the payment of tenths, when the land produced a tenfold crop, which however very
                seldom happened, what was the calculation of the farmer if indeed it was the tenths
                of the cultivator that were being sold, and no his whole property, when he bought
                the tenths for many more <foreign lang="la">medimni</foreign> than there had been
                acres sown? In the Lecutini district the list and return made of acres is not more
                than thirty thousand. <milestone n="48" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>The tenths were sold for thirty-six thousand <foreign lang="la">medimni</foreign>.
                Did Apronius make a blunder, or rather was he mad? Yes, he would indeed have been
                mad if it had been lawful for the cultivators to give only what was due from them,
                and had not rather been compulsory on them to give whatever Apronius commanded.
                  <milestone n="114" unit="section"/> If I prove that no man gave less for his
                tenths than three <foreign lang="la">medimni</foreign> to the acre, you will admit,
                I suppose, that, even supposing the produce amounted to a tenfold crop, no one paid
                less than three tenths. And indeed this was begged as a favour from Apronius, that
                they might be allowed to compound at three <foreign lang="la">medimni</foreign> an
                acre. For, as four and even five were exacted from many people, and as many had not
                only not a grain of corn, but not even a wisp of straw left out of all their crop
                and after all their year's labour; then the cultivators of Centuripa, which are the
                main body of agriculturists in the Leontini district, assembled in one place. They
                sent as a delegate to Apronius, Andron of Centuripa, a man among the first of his
                state for honour and nobility, (the same man whom now the city of Centuripa has sent
                to this trial as a deputy and as a witness,) in order that he might plead with him
                the cause of the cultivators of the soil, and beg of him not to exact of the
                Centuripan cultivators more than three <foreign lang="la">medimni</foreign> for each
                acre. <milestone n="115" unit="section"/> This request was with difficulty obtained
                from Apronius, as a most excessive kindness to those men who were even then safe.
                And when this was obtained, this is what was obtained, forsooth, that they might be
                allowed to pay three tenths instead of one. But if your own interest had not been at
                stake in the matter, O Verres, they would rather have entreated you not to be made
                to pay more than one tenth, than have begged of a promise not to be made to pay more
                than three. Now, that at the present time I may pass over those rules which
                Apronius, in a kingly, or rather in a tyrannical spirit, made with respect to the
                cultivators, and that I may not at present call those men from whom he took all
                their corn, and to whom he left nothing not only of their corn, but nothing even of
                their property; just see how much gain is made of these three <foreign lang="la"
                  >medimni</foreign>, which he considered as a great favour and indulgence.

              <p>The return of acres in the district of Leontini is thirty thousand. This amounts to
                ninety thousand <foreign lang="la">medimni</foreign> of wheat that is to say, to
                five hundred and forty thousand <foreign lang="la">modii</foreign> of wheat. Deduct
                two hundred and sixteen thousand <foreign lang="la">modii</foreign> of wheat, being
                what the tenths were sold for, and there remain three hundred and twenty-four
                thousand <foreign lang="la">modii</foreign> of wheat; add to the sum total of five
                hundred and forty thousand <foreign lang="la">modii</foreign> three fiftieths, that
                is to say, thirty-two thousand four hundred <foreign lang="la">modii</foreign> of
                wheat, (for three fiftieths besides were exacted from every one;) this now amounts
                to three hundred and fifty-six thousand four hundred <foreign lang="la"
                  >modii</foreign> of wheat. But I said that four hundred thousand <foreign
                  lang="la">sesterces</foreign> of profit had been made. For I do not include in
                this calculation those who were not allowed to compound at three <foreign lang="la"
                  >medimni</foreign> an acre. But that by this present calculation I may make out
                the sum which I promised to do, many were compelled besides to pay two <foreign
                  lang="la">sesterces</foreign>, and many even five, with each <foreign lang="la"
                  >medimnus</foreign>, and those who had to pay least paid a sesterce with every
                  <foreign lang="la">medimnus</foreign>. To take the least of these sums, as we
                calculated there were ninety thousand <foreign lang="la">medimni</foreign>, we must
                add to that, according to this new and infamous example here given, ninety thousand
                  <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign>. <milestone n="117" unit="section"/> Will
                he now dare to tell me, that he sold the tenths at a high price, when he took for
                himself more than twice as much as he sent to the Roman people out of the same
                district? You sold the tenths of the Leontine district for two hundred and sixteen
                thousand <foreign lang="la">modii</foreign> of wheat? If you did so according to
                law, it was a fine price; if your caprice was the law, it was a low price; if you
                sold them so that those were called tenths which were in reality a half, you sold
                them at a very low price. For the yearly produce of all <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName> might be sold for much more, if that was what the senate or
                people of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> had desired you to do.
                Indeed, the tenths were often sold for as much, when they were sold according to the
                law of Hiero, as they have been sold for now under the law of Verres. Let me have
                the accounts of the sale of tenths under Caius Norbanus. [The account of the sale of
                the tenths in the Leontine district under Caius Norbanus is read.] And yet, then,
                there were no trials about the return of acres; nor was Artemidorus Cornelius a
                judge, nor did a Sicilian magistrate exact from a cultivator whatever the farmer
                demanded; nor was it entreated as a favour from the farmer to be allowed to compound
                at three <foreign lang="la">medimni</foreign> an acre; nor was a cultivator obliged
                to give an additional present of money, nor to add three-fiftieths of corn. And yet
                a area, quantity of corn was sent to the Roman people. <milestone n="50"
                  unit="chapter"/><milestone n="118" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>But what is the meaning of these fiftieths? what is the meaning of these additional
                presents of money? By what right, and, what is more, in what manner did you do this
                The cultivator gave the money. How or whence did he get it? If he had wished to be
                very liberal, he would have used a more heaped up measure, as men formerly used to
                do in the matter of the tenths, when they were sold by fair laws, and on fair terms.
                He gave the money. Where did he get it? from his corn? As if, while you were
                praetor, he had anything to sell. Something, then, must be taken from his principal,
                in order to add this pecuniary gratuity for Apronius to all the profit which he
                derived from the lands. The next thing is, Did they give it willingly or
                unwillingly? Willingly? They were very fond, I suppose, of Apronius. Unwillingly?
                How, then, were they compelled to do so, except by violence and ill-treatment?
                Again; that man, that most senseless man, in the selling of the tenths, caused
                additional sums to be added to every tenth. It was not much; he added two or three
                thousand <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign>. In the three years he made about
                five hundred thousand <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign>. He did this neither
                according to any precedent, nor by any right; nor did he make any return of that
                money; nor can any man ever imagine how he is going to defend himself against this
                petty charge. </p>
              <p><milestone n="119" unit="section"/> And, as this is the case, do you dare to say
                that you sold the tenths at a high price, when it is evident that you sold the
                property and fortunes of the cultivators, not for the cake of the Roman people, but
                with a view to your own gain. As if any steward, from a farm which had been used to
                produce ten thousand <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign>, having cut down and
                sold the trees, having taken away the buildings and the stock, and having driven off
                all the cattle, sent his master twenty thousand <foreign lang="la"
                  >sesterces</foreign> instead of ten, and made a hundred thousand more for himself.
                At first the master, not knowing the injury that had been done to him, would be
                glad, and be delighted with his steward, because he had got so much more profit out
                of the farm; but afterwards, when he heard that all those things on which the profit
                and cultivation of his farm depends have been removed and sold, he would punish his
                steward with the greatest severity, and think himself very ill used. So also, the
                Roman people, when it hears that Caius Verres has sold the tenths for more than that
                most innocent man, Caius Sacerdos, whom he succeeded, thinks that it has got a good
                steward and guardian over its lands and crops; but when it finds out that he has
                sold all the stock of the cultivators, all the resources of the revenue, and has
                destroyed all the hopes of their posterity by his avarice,&mdash;that he has
                devastated and drained the allotments and the Lands subject to
                tribute,&mdash;that he has made himself most enormous gain and
                booty,&mdash;it will perceive that it has been shamefully treated, and will
                think that man worthy of the severest punishment. <milestone n="51" unit="chapter"
                  /><milestone n="120" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>By what, then, can this be made evident? Chiefly by this fact, that the land of the
                province of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> liable to the payment of
                tenths is deserted through the avarice of that man. Nor does it happen only that
                those who have remained on their lands are now cultivating a smaller number of
                acres, but also very many rich men, farmers on a large scale, and skillful men, have
                deserted large and productive farms, and abandoned their whole allotments. That may
                be very easily ascertained from the public documents of the states; because
                according to the law of Hiero the number of cultivators is every year entered in the
                books by public authority before the magistrates. Read now how many cultivators of
                the Leontine district there were when Verres took the government. Eighty-three. And
                how many made returns in his third year? Thirty-two. I see that there were fifty-one
                cultivators so entirely got rid of that they had no successors. How many cultivators
                were there of the district of Mutyca, when you arrived? Let us see from the public
                documents. A hundred and eighty-eight. How many in your third year? A hundred and
                one. That one district has to regret eighty-seven cultivators, owing to that man's
                ill-treatment, and to that extent our republic has to regret the loss of so many
                heads of families, and demands them back at his hand, since they are the real
                revenues of the Roman people. The district of Herbita had in his first year two
                hundred and fifty-seven cultivators; in his third, a hundred and twenty. From this
                region a hundred and thirty-seven heads of families have fled like banished men. The
                district of Agyrium&mdash;what men lived in that land! how honourable, how
                wealthy they were? &mdash;had two hundred and fifty cultivators in the first
                year of your praetorship. What had it in the third year? Eighty,&mdash;as you
                have heard the Agyrian deputies read from their public documents. <milestone n="52"

              <p>O ye immortal gods! If you had driven away out of the whole of <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> a hundred and seventy cultivators of the
                soil, could you, with impartial judges, escape condemnation? When the one district
                of <placeName key="tgn,1043116">Agyrium</placeName> is less populous by a hundred
                and seventy cultivators, will not you, O judges, form your conjectures of the state
                of the whole province? And you will find nearly the same state of things in every
                district liable to the payment of tenths, and that those to whom anything has been
                left out of a large patrimony, have remained behind with a much smaller stock, and
                cultivating a much smaller number of acres, because they were afraid, if they
                departed, that they should lose all the rest of their fortunes; but as for those to
                whom he had left nothing remaining which they could lose, they have fled not only
                from their farms, but from their cities. The very men who have
                remained&mdash;scarcely a tenth part of the old cultivators of the
                soil&mdash;were about to leave all their lands too, if Metellus had not sent
                letters to them from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, saying that he
                would sell the tenths according to the law of Hiero; and if he had not entreated
                them to sow as much land as they could, which they had always done for their own
                sakes, when no one entreated them, as long as they understood that they were sowing,
                and labouring, and going to expense for themselves and for the Roman
                people,&mdash;not for Verres and Apronius. <milestone n="122" unit="section"/>
                But now, O judges, if you neglect the fortunes of the Sicilians,&mdash;if you
                show no anxiety about the treatment the allies of the Roman people receive from our
                magistrates,&mdash;at all events undertake and defend the common cause of the
                Roman people. I say that the cultivators have been driven out,&mdash;that the
                lands subject to tribute have been devastated and drained by Verres&mdash;that
                the whole province has been depopulated and tyrannised over. All these things I
                prove by the public documents of the cities, and by the private evidence of most
                unimpeachable men. <milestone n="53" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>What would you have more? Do you wait till Lucius Metellus, who by his commands and
                by his power has deterred many witnesses from appearing against Verres shall
                himself, though absent, bear testimony to his wickedness, and dishonesty, and
                audacity? I think not. But he, who was his successor, has had the best opportunity
                of knowing the truth. That is true, but he is hindered by his friendship for him.
                Still, he ought to inform us accurately in what state the province is. He ought,
                still he is not forced to do so. <milestone n="123" unit="section"/> Does any one
                require the evidence of Lucius Metellus against Verres? No one. Does any one demand
                it? I think not What, however, if I prove by the evidence and letters of Lucius
                Metellus that all these things are true? What will you say then? That Metellus
                writes falsely? or that he is desirous of injuring his friend? or that he, though he
                is praetor, does not know in what state the province is? Read the letters of Lucius
                Metellus, which he sent to Cnaeus Pompeius and Marcus Crassus, the consuls, those
                which he sent to Marcus Mummius, the praetor, those which he sent to the quaestors
                of the city. [The letter of Lucius Metellus is read.] &ldquo;I sold the tenths
                according to the law of Hiero.&rdquo; When he writes that he had sold them
                according to the law of Hiero, what is he writing? Why, that he had sold them as all
                others had done, except Verres. When he writes that he had sold them according to
                the law of Hiero, what is he writing? Why, that he had restored the privileges
                granted to the Sicilians by the kindness of our ancestors and taken away by Verres,
                and their rights, and the terms on which they became our allies and friends. He
                mentions at what price he sold the tenths of each district. After that what does he
                write? <milestone n="124" unit="section"/> Read the rest of the
                letter.&mdash;&ldquo;The greatest pains has been taken by me to sell the
                tenths for as good a price as possible.&rdquo; Why then, O Metellus, did you not
                sell them for as much as Verres? &ldquo;Because I found the allotments deserted,
                the fields empty, the province in a wretched and ruined condition.&rdquo; What?
                And as for the land that was sown, how was any one found to sow it? Read the
                letters. [The letters are read.] He says that he had sent letters, and that, when he
                arrived, he had given a positive promise; he had interposed his authority to prevail
                on them, and had all but given hostages to the cultivators that he would be in no
                respect like Verres But what is this about which he says that he took so much pains?
                Read&mdash;&ldquo;To prevail on the cultivators of the soil, who were left,
                to sow as largely as they could.&rdquo; Who were left? What does this
                mean&mdash;left? After what war? after what devastation? What mighty slaughter
                was there in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, or what was there of
                such duration and such disaster while you were praetor, that your successor had to
                collect and recover the cultivators who were left? <milestone n="54" unit="chapter"

              <p>When <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> was harassed in the
                Carthaginian wars, and afterwards, in our fathers' and our own recollection, when
                great bands of fugitive slaves twice occupied the province, still there was no
                destruction of the cultivators of the soil; then, if the sowing was hindered, or the
                crop lost, the yearly revenue was lost too, but the number of owners and cultivators
                of the land remained undiminished. Then those officers who succeeded the praetors
                Marcus Laevinus, or Publius Rupilius, or Marcus Aquillius in that province, had not
                to collect the cultivators who were left. Did Verres and Apronius bring so much more
                distress on the province of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> than
                either Hasdrubal with his army of Carthaginians, or Athenio with his numerous bands
                of runaway slaves, that in those times, as soon as the enemy was subdued, all the
                land was ploughed, and the praetor had not to send letters to beg the cultivator to
                come to him, and entreat him to sow as much land as he could; but now, even after
                the departure of this most ill-omened pestilence, no one could be found who would
                till his land of his own free-will; and very few were left to return to their farms
                and their own familiar household gods, even when urged by the authority of Lucius
                Metellus? <milestone n="126" unit="section"/> Do not you feel, O most audacious and
                most senseless of omen, that you are destroyed by these letters? Do you not see
                that, when your successor addresses those agriculturists who are left, he writes
                this in express words, that they are left, not after war or after any calamity of
                that sort, but after your wickedness, and tyranny, and avarice, and cruelty? Read
                the rest&mdash;&ldquo;But still in such quantities as the difficulty of the
                times and the poverty of the cultivators permitted.&rdquo; The poverty of the
                cultivators, he says. If I, as the accuser, were to dwell so repeatedly on the same
                subject, I should be afraid of wearying your attention, O judges; but Metellus cries
                out, &ldquo;If I had not written letters.&rdquo; That is not
                enough&mdash;&ldquo;If I had not, when on the spot, assured them.&rdquo;
                Even that is not enough&mdash;&ldquo;The cultivators who were
                left,&rdquo; he says. Left? In that mournful word he intimates the condition of
                nearly the whole province of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>. He
                adds, &ldquo;the poverty of the cultivators.&rdquo; <milestone n="55"

              <p>Wait a little, O judges, wait a little, if you can, for confirmation of my speech.
                I say that the cultivators have been driven away by that man's avarice: Metellus
                writes word that those who were left have been reassured by him. I say that the
                fields have been abandoned, and the allotments deserted: Metellus writes word that
                there is great penury among the cultivators. When he writes this, he shows that the
                allies and friends of the Roman people have been cast down, and driven off, and
                stripped of all their fortunes; and yet if any calamity had happened to these men by
                his means, even without any injury to our revenues, you ought to punish him,
                especially while judging according to that law which was established for the sake of
                the allies. But when our allies are oppressed and ruined, and the revenues of the
                Roman people diminished at the same time,&mdash;when our supplies of corn and
                provisions, our wealth, and the safety of the city and of our armies for the future
                is destroyed by his avarice, at least have a regard to the advantage of the Roman
                people, if you have no anxiety to show your regard for our most faithful allies.
                  <milestone n="128" unit="section"/> And that you may be aware that man had no
                consideration for either the revenue or for our posterity, in comparison with
                present gain and booty, see what Metellus writes at the end:&mdash;&ldquo;I
                have taken care of the revenues for the future.&rdquo; He says that he has taken
                care of the revenues for the future. He would not write that he had taken care of
                the revenues, if he had not meant to show this, that you had ruined the revenues.
                For what reason was there for Metellus taking care for the future of the revenues in
                respect of the tenths, and of the whole corn interest, if that man had not diverted
                the revenues of the Roman people to his own profit And Metellus himself, who is
                taking care of the revenues for the future, who is reassembling the cultivators of
                the soil who are left, what does he effect but this, to make those men plough, if
                they can, to whom Verres's satellite Apronius has hardly left one plough remaining,
                but who yet remained on their land in the hope and expectation of Metellus? What
                more? What became of the rest of the Sicilians? What became of that numerous body of
                cultivators who were not only driven away from their farms, but who even fled from
                their cities, from the province, having had all their property and all their
                fortunes taken from them? By what means can they be recalled? How many praetors of
                incorruptible wisdom will be required to re-establish, in process of time, that
                multitude of cultivators in their farms and their habitations? <milestone n="56"

              <p>And that you may not marvel that so great a multitude has fled, as you find, from
                the public documents and from the returns of the cultivators, has fled, know that
                his cruelty and wickedness towards the cultivators was so excessive, (it is an
                incredible statement to make, O judges, but it is both a fact, and one that is
                notorious over all <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>,) that men, on
                account of the insults and licentiousness of the collectors, actually killed
                themselves. It is proved that Diocles of Centuripa, a wealthy man, hung himself the
                very day that it was announced that Apronius had purchased the tenths. A man of high
                birth, Archonidas of Elorum, said that Dyrrachinus, the first man of his city, slew
                himself in the same way, when he heard that the collector had made a return, that,
                according to Verres's edict, he owed him a sum that he could not make good at the
                expense of all his property. </p>

                money. This is a grave charge, a serious charge,&mdash;it is the most serious
                one which has been made in the memory of man, ever since trials for peculation and

                is common) on account of his absolute power, but also on account of its cruelty,
                (which is his especial characteristic,) he heard this charge urged against him a
                thousand times, when it was not carelessness which delayed him from avenging it, but
                the consciousness of his wickedness and avarice that kept him in check. For the
                collectors used to say openly, and, above all the rest, that one who had the
                greatest influence with him, and who was laying waste the most extensive districts,

                notorious that, when the tenths had been sold contrary to the regulations, the laws,
                and the customs of all men, the collectors, while employed in seizing the property
                and fortunes of the cultivators, were used to say that the shares were yours, the
                affair yours, the plunder yours; and that you said nothing, and though you could not
                conceal that you were aware of it, were still able to bear and endure it, because
                the magnitude of the gain obscured the magnitude of the danger, and because the
                desire of money had a good deal more influence over you than the fear of judgment.

                happened If any one had whispered in your ear, and told you that Apronius was in the

                summoned Apronius, and not to have been satisfied yourself with him, till you had
                satisfied the opinion of others with respect to yourself. But when in the crowded
                forum, in a great concourse of people, this charge was urged, in word and presence
                indeed, against Apronius, but in reality against you, could you ever have received
                such a blow in silence, unless you had decided that, say what you would in so

                considered that they were behaving ill in some particular. Would you never have
                addressed Apronius, a man scarcely a free man, profligate, abandoned, infamous, who
                could not preserve, I will not say an honest mind, but not even a pure soul, with
                even one harsh word, and that too when smarting under disgrace and insult yourself?
                And moreover, the respect due to a partnership would not have been so sacred in your

                respecting that partnership, which Rubrius had wished to adopt. He urged them on; he
                pressed it, he gave him no respite; security was given to the amount of five
                thousand <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign>; Scandilius began to demand

                affecting his own liberty, or else confess that he must be convicted by every
                tribunal in the world? The trial is on this formula, &ldquo;that Apronius says
                that you are his partner in the matter of the tenths.&rdquo; The province is
                yours; you are present, judgment is demanded from you yourself. What do you do? What
                do you decree? You say that you will assign judges. You do well; though where will
                there be found judges of such courage as to dare, in his province, when the praetor
                himself is present, to decide in a manner not only contrary to his with, but adverse
                even to his fortunes? <milestone n="136" unit="section"/> However, be it so; the
                case is evident; there was no one who did not say that he had heard this distinctly;
                all the most respectable men were most undoubted witnesses of it; there was no one
                in all Sicily who did not know that the tenths belonged to the praetor, no one who
                had not heard Apronius frequently say so; moreover, there was a fine body of
                settlers at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, many Roman
                knights, men of the highest consideration, out of which number the judges must be
                selected, who could not possibly decide in any other manner. Scandilius does not
                cease to demand judges; then that innocent man, who was so eager to efface that
                suspicion, and to remove it from himself, says that he will assign judges from his

                Scandilius began to demand judges from the body of settlers; then Verres says that
                he will not entrust a trial in which his own character is at stake, to any one
                except his own people. The brokers think it a scandalous thing for a man to protest

                will have a greater influence over senators most carefully chosen, than fear will
                over three judges? But Scandilius says that he will not say a word before a judge
                like Artemidorus, and still he presses the matter on, and loads you with favourable
                conditions, if you choose to avail yourself of them. If you decide that, in the

                you say to that? what do you do? you compel Scandilius to do what? to prosecute the

                that he was, had an opportunity, by punishing Apronius, of relieving himself from
                the most serious disgrace. What punishment does he devise? what penalty for
                Apronius? He compels Scandilius to pay to Apronius five thousand <foreign lang="la"

                You might see the truth in every case, O judges, from this single affair of
                Scandilius. First of all, that this charge about the partnership in the tenths was
                not cooked up at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, was not invented by
                the accuser; it was not (as we are accustomed sometimes to say in making a defence
                for a man) a domestic or back-stairs accusation; it was not originated in a time of
                your danger, but it was an old charge, bruited about long ago, when you were
                praetor, not made up at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> by your
                enemies, but brought to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> from the
                province. <milestone n="142" unit="section"/> At the same time his great favour to
                Apronius may be clearly seen; also the, I will not say confession, but the boast of
                Apronius, about him. Besides all this, you can rake as clearly proved this first,
                that, in his own province, he would not entrust a trim in which his reputation was

                once decide, from what I then proved, that he had sold the tenths under a law quite
                novel, and, therefore, no law at all, contrary to the usage and established
                regulations of all his predecessors? <milestone n="143" unit="section"/> But even if
                I had not such judges as I have, such impartial, such careful, such conscientious
                judges, is there any one whatever who has not long ago formed his opinion and his
                judgment from the magnitude of the injuries done, the dishonesty of the decrees, the
                iniquity of the tribunals? Even although a man may be somewhat careless in
                judging,&mdash;somewhat indifferent to the laws, to his duty to the republic, to
                our allies and friends, what then? Can even such a man doubt of the dishonesty of
                that man, when he is aware that such vast gains were made,&mdash;such iniquitous
                compromises extorted by violence and terror?&mdash;when he knows that cities
                were compelled by violence and imperious commands, by the fear of scourges and
                death, to give such great rewards, not only to Apronius and to men like him, but
                even to the slaves of Venus? <milestone n="144" unit="section"/> But if any one is
                but little influenced by the injuries done to our allies,&mdash;if there be any
                one who is not moved by the flight, the calamities, the banishment, and the suicides
                of the cultivators of the soil; still I cannot doubt that the man who knows, both
                from the documents of the cities and the letter of Lucius Metellus, that <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> has been laid waste and the farms deserted,
                must decide that it is quite impossible that any other than the severest judgment
                should be passed on that man. Will there be any one who can conceal from himself, or
                be indifferent to these facts? I have brought before you trials commenced respecting
                the partnership in the tenths, but prevented by that man from being brought to a
                decision. What is there that any one can possibly desire plainer than this? I have
                no doubt that I have satisfied you, O judges. But I will go further; not, indeed, in
                order that this may be proved more completely to your satisfaction than I feel sure
                that it already is, but that he may at last give over his impudence,&mdash;may
                cease at Last to believe that he can purchase these things which he himself was
                always ready to sell his good faith, his oath, truth, duty, and
                religion;&mdash;that his friends may cease to keep continually saying things

                conscientiousness in giving judgment. I will take Alba for my judge; that man who is
                himself desirous of being considered an unprincipled buffoon: who by the buffoons
                has always been considered as a gladiator, rather than as a buffoon. I will bring
                forward such a case about the tenths that Alba shall confess that Verres, in the
                case of the corn, and in that of the property of the cultivators of the soil has
                been an open and undisguised robber. <milestone n="63" unit="chapter"/><milestone

              <p>He says that he sold the tenths of the Leontine district at a high price. I showed
                at the beginning that he ought not to be considered to have sold them at a high
                price' who in name indeed sold the tenths, but who in reality and by the terms of
                the sale, and through his law, and through his edict, and through the licentiousness
                of the collectors, left no tenths at all to the cultivators of the soil. I proved
                that also, that others had sold the tenths of the Leontine district and of other
                districts also, for a high price; and that they had sold them according to the law
                of Hiero; and that they sold them for even more than you had, and that then no
                cultivator had complained. Nor indeed was there anything of which any one could
                complain, when they were sold according to a law most equitably framed; nor did it
                ever make any difference to the cultivator at what price the tenths were sold. For
                it is not the case that, if they be sold at a high price, the cultivator owes more,
                if at a low price, less. As the crops are produced, so are the tenths sold. But it
                is for the interest of the cultivator, that his crops should be such that the tenths
                may be able to be sold at as high a price as possible. As long as the cultivator
                does not give more than a tenth, it is for his interest that the tenth should be as
                large as possible. <milestone n="148" unit="section"/> But, I imagine, you mean this
                to be the chief article of your defence, that you sold all the tenths at a high
                price, but the tenths of the Leontine district, which produces the most, for two
                hundred and sixteen thousand <foreign lang="la">modii</foreign> of wheat. If I prove
                that you could have sold them for a good deal more, but that you would not knock
                them down to those who were bidding against Apronius, and that you adjudged them to
                Apronius for much less than you might have adjudged them to others;&mdash;if I
                prove this, will even Alba, not only your oldest friend, out even your lover, be
                able to acquit you? <milestone n="64" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>I assert that a Roman knight, a man of the highest honour, Quintus Minucius, with
                others like himself, was willing to add to the tenths of the Leontine district not
                one thousand, not two thousand, not three thousand <foreign lang="la"
                  >modii</foreign> of wheat, but thirty thousand <foreign lang="la">modii</foreign>
                of wheat to the tenths of one single district, and that he was not allowed to become
                the purchaser, that the matter might not escape the grasp of Apronius. <milestone
                  n="149" unit="section"/> You cannot by any means deny this, unless you are
                determined to deny everything. The business was transacted openly, in a full
                assembly, at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>. The whole
                province is the witness, because men are accustomed to flock together thither from
                all parts at the sale or the tenths. And whether you confess this, or whether it be
                proved against you, do you not see in what important and what evident acts you are
                detected. First of all, it is proved that that business and that booty was yours.
                For unless it was, why did you prefer that Acronius (who every one was saying was
                only managing your affairs in the matter of the tenths as your agent) should get the
                tenths of the Leontine district rather than Quintus Minucius? Secondly, that an
                enormous and immense profit was made by you. For if you would not have been
                influenced by thirty thousand <foreign lang="la">modii</foreign> of wheat, at all
                events Minucius would willingly have given thus much as a compliment to Apronius, if
                he had been willing to accept it. <milestone n="150" unit="section"/> How great then
                must we suppose the expectation of booty which he entertained to have been, when he
                despised and scorned such vast present profit: acquired without the slightest
                trouble. Thirdly, Minucius himself would never have wished to have them at such a
                price, if you had been selling the tenths according to the Law of Hiero; but because
                he saw that by your new edicts and most iniquitous resolutions he should get a good
                deal more than tenths, on that account he advanced higher. But Apronius had always
                even a good deal more permitted to him than you had announced in your edict. How
                much gain then can we suppose was made by him to whom everything was permitted; when
                that man was so willing to add so large a compliment, who would not have had the
                same licence if he had bought the tenths? <milestone n="151" unit="section"/>
                Lastly, unquestionably that defence, under which you have constantly thought that
                all your thefts and iniquities could be concealed, is cut from under your feet; that
                you sold the tenths at a high price&mdash;that you consulted the interest of the
                Roman people&mdash;that you provided for plenty of provisions. He cannot say
                this, who cannot deny that he sold the tenths of one district for thirty thousand
                  <foreign lang="la">modii</foreign> less than he might have done; even if I were to
                grant you this, that you did not grant them to Minucius because you had already
                adjudged them to Apronius; for they say that that is what you are in the habit of
                saying, and I am expecting to hear it, and I wish you would make that defence. But,
                even if it were so, still you cannot boast of this as a great thing, that you sold
                the tenths at a high price, when you admit that there were people who were willing
                to buy them at a much higher price. <milestone n="65" unit="chapter"/><milestone

              <p>The avarice, then, and covetousness of this man, his wickedness, and dishonesty,
                and audacity, are proved, O judges, are proved most incontestably. What more shall I
                say What if his own friends and defenders have formed the same opinion that I have?
                What can you have more? On the arrival of Lucius Metellus the praetor, when Verres
                had made all his retinue friends of this also by that sovereign medicine of his,
                money, men applied to Metellus; Apronius was brought before him; his accuser was a
                man of the highest consideration, Caius Gallius, a senator. He demanded of Metellus
                to give him a right of action according to the terms of his edict against Apronius,
                &ldquo;for having taken away property by force or by fear,&rdquo; which
                formula of Octavius, Metellus had both adopted at <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
                  >Rome</placeName>, and now imported into the province. He does not succeed; as
                Metellus said that he did not wish by means of such a trial to prejudge the case of
                Verres himself in a matter affecting his condition as a free citizen. The whole
                retinue of Metellus, grateful men, stood by Apronius. Caius Gallius, a man of our
                order, cannot obtain from Lucius Metellus, his most intimate friend, a trial in
                accordance with his own edict. <milestone n="153" unit="section"/> I do not blame
                Metellus; he spared a friend of his&mdash;a connection, indeed, as I have heard
                him say himself. I do not, I say, blame Metellus; but I do marvel how he not only
                prejudged the case of a man concerning whom he was unwilling that any previous
                decision should take place by means of judges, but even judged most severely and
                harshly respecting him. For, in the first place, if he thought that Apronius would
                be acquitted, there was no reason for his fearing any previous decision. In the
                second place, if Apronius were condemned, all men were likely to think that the
                cause of Verres was involved in his; this at all events Metellus did now decide, and
                he determined that their affairs and their causes were identical, since he
                determined that, if Apronius were condemned, it would be a prejudging of the case of
                Verres. And one fact is at the same time a proof of two things; both that the
                cultivators gave much more than they owed to Apronius because they were constrained
                by violence and fear; and also, that Apronius was transacting Verres's business in
                his own name, since Lucius Metellus determined that Apronius could not be condemned
                without giving a decision at the same time respecting the wickedness and dishonesty
                of Verres. <milestone n="66" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="154" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>I come now to the letter of Timarchides, his freedman and attendant; and when I

                should be laughed at, and despised and scorned by that runaway slave Timarchides.
                &ldquo;If you have Vulteius with you, everything will be mere child's play to
                you.&rdquo; Here Timarchides is greatly mistaken, in thinking either that
                Vulteius can be corrupted by money, or that Metellus is going to discharge the
                duties of his praetorship according to the will of any one man; but he is mistaken
                by forming his conjectures from his own experience. Because he saw that, through his
                own intervention and that of others, many men had been able to do whatever they
                pleased with Verres, without meeting with any difficulty, he thought that there were
                the same means of access to every one. You did very easily whatever you wanted with
                Verres, and found it as easy as child's play to do so, because you knew many of the
                kinds of play in which he indulged. </p>
              <p>&ldquo;Metellus and Vulteius have been impressed with the idea that you have
                ruined the cultivators of the soil.&rdquo; Who attributed the action to
                Apronius, when he had ruined any cultivator? or to Timarchides when he had taken
                money for assigning a trial, or making a decree, or giving any order, or remitting
                any thing? or to Sextus the lictor, when he, as executioner, had put an innocent man
                to death? No one. Every body at the time attributed these things to Verres; whom
                they desire now to see condemned. <milestone n="157" unit="section"/>
                &ldquo;People have dinned into their ears, that you were a partner of the
                praetor's.&rdquo; Do you not see how clear the matter both is and was when even
                Timarchides is afraid of this? Will you not admit that we are not inventing this
                charge against you, but that your freedman has been this long time seeking some
                defence against this charge? Your freedman and officer, one most intimate, and
                indeed connected with you and your children in everything, writes to Apronius, that
                it is universally pointed out to Metellus that Apronius had been your partner in the
                tenths. &ldquo;Make him see the dishonesty of the cultivators: they shall suffer
                for it, if the gods will.&rdquo; What, in the name of the immortal gods, is the
                meaning of that? or on what account can we say that such great and bitter hatred is
                excited against the cultivators? What injury have the cultivators of the soil done
                to Verres, that even his freedman and officer should attack them with so inimical a
                disposition in these letters? <milestone n="68" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>And I would not, O judges, have read to you the letter of this runaway slave, if I
                had not wished you to see from it the precepts, and customs, and system of the whole
                household. Do you see how he advises Apronius? by what means and by what presents he
                may insinuate himself into the intimacy of Metellus? how he may corrupt Vulteius?
                how he may win over with bribes the clerks and the chief officer? He teaches him
                what he has himself seen done. He teaches a stranger the lessons which he has learnt
                at home himself. But in this one thing he makes a mistake, that he thinks there is
                the same road to every one's intimacy. <milestone n="158" unit="section"/> Although
                I am deservedly angry with Metellus, still I will say this which is true. Apronius
                could not corrupt Metellus with bribes, as he had corrupted Verres, nor with
                banquets, nor with women, nor with debauched and profligate conversation, by which
                means he had, I will not say crept into that man's friendship slowly and gradually,
                but had in a very short time got possession of the whole man and his whole retinue.
                But as for the retinue of Metellus, which he speaks of, what was the use of his
                corrupting that, when no judges were appointed out of it to judge the causes of the
                cultivators? <milestone n="159" unit="section"/> For as for what he writes, that the
                son of Metellus was a mere boy, he is greatly mistaken. For there is not the same
                access to the son of every praetor. O Timarchides, the son of Metellus is in the
                province, not a boy, but a virtuous and modest youth, worthy of his rank and name.
                How that boy of yours had behaved in the province, I would not say if I thought it
                the fault of the boy, and not the fault of his father. Did not you, though you knew
                yourself and your own habits of life, O Verres, take with you your son, still clad
                in the robes of a boy, into <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, so that
                even if nature had separated the boy from his father's vices and from every
                resemblance to his family, still habit and training might prevent his degenerating
                from them? <milestone n="160" unit="section"/> Suppose there had been in him the
                disposition of Caius Laelius, of Marcus Cato, still what good could be expected or
                extracted out of one who has lived in the licentious school of his father in such a
                way that he has never seen one modest or sober banquet? who since he has grown up
                has lived in daily revels for three years among immodest women and intemperate men?
                who has never heard a word from his father by which he might become more modest or
                more virtuous? who has never seen his father do anything, which, if he had imitated,
                would not have laid him under the most disgraceful imputation of all, that of being
                considered like his father? <milestone n="69" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="161"

              <p>By which conduct you have done an injury, not only to your son, but also to the
                republic. For you had begotten children, not for yourself alone, but also for your
                country; who might not only be a pleasure to you, but who might some day or other be
                able to be of use to the republic. You ought to have trained and educated them
                according to the customs of your ancestors, and the established system of the state;
                not in your crimes, in your infamy. Were he the able, and modest, and upright son of
                a lazy, and debauched, and worthless father then the republic would have had a
                valuable present from you. Now you have given to the state another Verres instead of
                yourself, if, indeed, he is not worse (If that be possible) in this
                respect,&mdash;that you have turned out such as you are without being bred up in
                the school of a dissolute man, but only under a thief, and a go-between. <note

                <milestone n="162" unit="section"/> What can we expect likely to turn out more
                complete than a person who is by nature your son, by education your pupil, by
                inclination your copyist? Whom, however, I, O judges, would gladly see turn out a
                virtuous and gallant man. For I am not influenced by his enmity, if, indeed, there
                is to be enmity between him and me; for if I am innocent and like myself in
                everything, how will his enmity hurt me? And if, in any respect, I am like Verres,
                an enemy will no more be wanting to me than he has been wanting to him. In truth, O
                judges, the republic ought to be such, and shall be such, being established by the
                impartiality of the tribunals, that an enemy shall never be wanting to the guilty,
                and shall never be able to injure the innocent. There is, therefore, no cause why I
                should not be glad for that son of his to emerge out of his father's vices and
                infamy. And although it may be difficult, yet I do not know whether it be
                impossible; especially if (as is at present the case) the guardians placed over him
                by his friends continue to watch him, since his father is so indifferent to him, and
                so dissolute. <milestone n="163" unit="section"/> But my speech has now digressed
                more than I had intended from the letter of Timarchides: and I said, that when that
                had been read, I would end all I had to say on the charge connected with the tenths;
                from which you have clearly seen that an incalculable amount of corn has been for
                these three years diverted from the republic, and taken illegally from the
                cultivators. <milestone n="70" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>The next thing is, O judges, for me to explain to you the charge about the purchase
                of corn, a theft very large in amount, and exceedingly shameless. And I entreat you
                to listen while I briefly lay before you my statements, being both certain, few in
                number, and important. It was Verres's duty according to a decree of the senate, and
                according to the law of Terentius and to the law of Cassius about corn, to purchase
                corn in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>. There were two descriptions
                of purchase,&mdash;the one the purchase of the second tenths, the other the
                purchase of what was furnished in fair proportions by the different cities. Of corn
                derived from the second tenths the quantity would be as much as had been derived
                from the first tenths; of corn levied on the cities in this way there would be eight
                hundred thousand <foreign lang="la">modii</foreign>. The price fixed for the corn
                collected as the second tenths was three <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign> a
                  <foreign lang="la">modius</foreign>; for that furnished in compliance with the
                levy, four <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign>. Accordingly, for the corn
                furnished in compliance with the levy, there was paid to Verres each year three
                million two hundred thousand <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign>, which he was to
                pay to the cultivators of the soil; and for the second tenths, about nine millions
                of <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign>. And so, during the three years, there was
                nearly thirty-six million six hundred thousand <foreign lang="la"
                  >sesterces</foreign> paid to him for this purchase of corn in <placeName

                enormous sum of money, given to you out of a poor and exhausted treasury; given to
                you for corn,&mdash;that is to say, for what was necessary for the safety and
                life of the citizens; given to you to be paid to the Sicilian cultivators of the
                soil, on whom the republic was imposing such great burdens;&mdash;this great
                sum, I say, was so handled by you, that I can prove, if I choose, that you
                appropriated the whole of this money, and that it all went to your own house. In
                fact, you managed the whole affair in such a way that this which I say can be proved
                to the most impartial judge. But I will have a regard for my own authority, I will
                recollect with what feelings, with what intentions I have undertaken the advocacy of
                this public cause. I will not deal with you in the spirit of an accuser; I will
                invent nothing; I do not wish any one to take for proved, while I am speaking,
                anything of which I myself do not already feel thoroughly convinced. <milestone
                  n="165" unit="section"/> In the ease of this public money, O judges, there are
                three kinds of thefts. In the first place, he put it out among the companies from
                which it had been drawn at twenty-four per cent interest; <note anchored="yes"
                  >Towards the close of the republic the interest of money became due on the first
                  of every month; therefore <foreign lang="la">centesimae usurae</foreign>, which
                  seems to have been reckoned the ordinary rate of interest at <placeName

                    <foreign lang="la">binae centesimae</foreign> were twice as much. Niebuhr is of
                  opinion that the monthly rate of the <foreign lang="la">centesimae</foreign> was
                  of foreign origin, and first adopted at <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
                    >Rome</placeName> in the time of Sulla. The old yearly rate established by the

                  eight per-cent a year. See <bibl>Smith, Dict Ant. p. 525, v.

                nothing at all for corn to very many of the cities; lastly, if he did pay any city,
                he deducted as large a sum as ever he chose. He paid no one whatever as much as was
                due to him. <milestone n="71" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>And first I ask you this&mdash;you, to whom the farmers of the revenue,
                according to the letters of Carpinatius, gave thanks. Was the public money, drawn
                from the treasury, given out of the revenues of the Roman people to purchase corn,
                was it a source of profit to you? Did it bring you in twenty-four per cent interest?
                I dare say you will deny it. For it is a disgraceful and dangerous confession to
                make. <milestone n="166" unit="section"/> And it is a thing very difficult for me to
                prove, for by what witnesses am I to prove it? By the farmers of the revenue? They
                have been treated by him with great honour they will keep silence. By their letters?
                They have been put out of the way by a resolution of the collectors. Which way then
                shall I turn? Shall I leave unmentioned so infamous a business, a crime of such
                audacity and such shamelessness, on account of a dearth of witnesses or of
                documentary proofs? I will not do so, O judges, I will call a witness. Whom? Lucius
                Vettius Chilo, a most honourable and accomplished man of the equestrian order, who
                is such a friend of and so closely connected with Verres, that, even if he were not
                an excellent man, still whatever he said against him would seem to have great
                weight; but who is so good a man that, even if he were ever so great an enemy to
                him, yet his testimony ought to be believed. <milestone n="167" unit="section"/> He
                is annoyed and waiting to see what Vettius will say. He will say nothing because of
                this present occasion; nothing of his free will, nothing of which we can think that
                he might have spoken either way. He sent letters into <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName> to Carpinatius, when he was superintendent of the tax derived
                from the pasture lands, and manager of that company of farmers, which letters I
                found at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, in Carpinatius's
                house, among the portfolios of letters which had been brought to him; and at

                intimate friend of yours, and another manager of the company, in portfolios of
                letters which had been received by him. And from these letters observe, I pray you,
                the impudence of this man's usury. [The letters of Lucius Vettius to Publius
                Servilius, and to Caius Antistius, managers of the company, are read.] </p>
              <p>Vettius says that he will be with you, and will take notice how you make up your

                and by the authority of the company whose letters we are using? or must we seek for

              <p>Vettius, your most intimate friend,&mdash;Vettius, your connection, to whose
                sister you are married,&mdash;Vettius, the brother of your wife, the brother of
                your quaestor, bears witness to your most infamous theft, to your most evident
                embezzlement; for by what other name is a lending of the public money at usury to be
                called? Read what follows. He says that your clerk, O Verres, was the drawer up of
                the bond for this usury: the managers threaten him also in their letters; in fact,
                it happened by chance that two managers were with Vettius. They think it intolerable
                that twenty-four per cent should be taken from them, and they are right to think so.
                For whoever did such a thing before? who ever attempted to do such a
                thing,&mdash;who ever thought that such a thing could be done, as for a
                magistrate to venture to take money as interest from the farmers, though the senate
                had often assisted the farmers by remitting the interests due from them? Certainly
                that man could have no hope of safety, if the farmers&mdash;that is, the Roman
                knights, were the judges. <milestone n="169" unit="section"/> He ought to have less
                hope now, O judges, now that you have to decide; and so much the less, in proportion
                as it is more honourable to be roused by the injuries of others than by one's own.
                What reply do you think of making to all this? Will you deny that you did it? Will
                you defend yourself on the ground that it was lawful for you to do it? How can you
                deny it? Can you deny it, to be convicted by the authority of such important
                letters, by so many farmers appearing as witnesses? But how can you say it was
                lawful? In truth, if I were to prove that you, in your own province, had lent on
                usury your own money, and not the money of the Roman people, still you could not
                escape; but when I prove that you lent the public money, the money decreed to you to
                buy corn with, and that you received interest from the farmers, will you make any
                one believe that this was lawful? a deed than which not only others have never, but
                you yourself have never done a more audacious or more infamous one. I cannot, in
                truth, O judges, say that even that which appears to me to be perfectly
                unprecedented, and about which I am going to speak next&mdash;I mean, the fact
                of his having actually paid very many cities nothing at all for their
                corn&mdash;was either more audacious or more impudent; the booty derived from
                this act was perhaps greater, but the impudence of the other was certainly not less.
                  <milestone n="170" unit="section"/> And since I have said enough about this
                lending at interest, now, I pray you, give your attention to the question of the

                /></p>
              <p>There are many cities in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, O judges,
                of great splendour and of high reputation, and among the very first of these is the
                city of Halesa. You will find no city more faithful to its duties, more rich in
                wealth, more influential in its authority. After that man had ordered it to furnish
                every year sixty thousand <foreign lang="la">modii</foreign> of wheat, he took money
                for the wheat, at the price which wheat bore in <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName> at the time; all the money which he thus received from the
                public treasury, he kept for himself. I was amazed, O judges, when a man of the
                greatest ability, of the highest wisdom, and of the greatest influence, Aeneas of
                Halesa, first stated this to me at Halesa in the senate of Halesa; a man to whom the
                senate by public resolution had given a charge to return me and my brother thanks,
                and at the same time to explain to us the matters which concerned this trial.
                  <milestone n="171" unit="section"/> He proves to me that this was his constant
                custom and system; that, when the entire quantity of corn had been brought to him
                under the name of tenths, then he was accustomed to exact money from the cities, to
                object to the corn delivered, and as for all the corn which he was forced to send to
                  <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, he sent that quantity from his own
                profits and from his own store of corn. I demand the accounts, I inspect the
                documents, I see that the people of Halesa, from whom sixty thousand <foreign
                  lang="la">modii</foreign> had bees levied, had given none, that they had paid
                money to Volcatus, and to Timarchides the clerk. I find a case of plunder of this
                kind, O judges, that the praetor, whose duty it was to buy corn, did not buy it, but
                sell it; and that he embezzles and appropriates the money which he ought to have
                divided among the cities. It did not appear to me any longer to be a theft, but a
                monster and a prodigy; to reject the corn of the cities, and to approve of his own;
                when he had approved of his own, then to put a price on that corn, to take from the
                cities what he had fixed, and to retain what he had received from the Roman people.

              <p>How many degrees of offence in one single act of fraud do you think will be enough,
                if I insist on them severally, to bring the matter to a point where he can go no
                further? You reject the Sicilian corn; why? because you are sending some yourself.
                Have you any <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> of your own, which can
                supply you corn of another sort? When the senate decrees that corn he bought in
                  <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, or when the people order this,
                this, as I imagine, is what they mean, that Sicilian corn is to be brought from
                  <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>. When you reject all the corn of
                  <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, do you send corn to <placeName
                  key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> from <placeName key="tgn,7016833"
                  >Egypt</placeName> or from <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>? You
                reject the corn of Halesa, of Cephalaedis, of Thermae, of Amestras, of <placeName
                  key="perseus,Tyndaris">Tyndaris</placeName>, of Herbita, and of many other cities.
                What has happened then to cause the lands of these people to bear corn of such a
                sort while you were praetor, as they never bore before, so that it can neither be
                approved of by you, nor by the Roman people; especially when the managers of the
                different companies had taken corn, being the tenths, from the same land, and of the
                same year, to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>? What has happened that
                the corn which made part of the tenths was approved, and that that which was bought,
                though out of the same barn, was not approved of? Is there any doubt that all that
                rejection of corn was contrived with the object of raising money? <milestone n="173"
                  unit="section"/> Be it so. You reject the corn of Halesa, you have corn from
                another tribe which you approve of. Buy that which pleases you; dismiss those whose
                corn you have rejected. But from those whom you reject you exact such sum of money
                as may be equivalent to the quantity of corn which you require of their city. Is
                there any doubt what your object has been? I see from the public documents that the
                people of Halesa gave you fifteen <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign> for every
                medimnus&mdash;I will prove from the accounts of the wealthiest of the
                cultivators, that at the same time no one in <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName> sold corn at a higher price. <milestone n="75" unit="chapter"
                /></p>
              <p>What, then, is the reason for your rejecting, or rather what madness is it to
                reject corn which comes from that place from which the senate and the people of
                  <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> ordered it to be brought? which
                comes from that very heap, a part of which, under the name of tenths, you had
                actually approved of? and besides, to exact money from the cities for the purchase
                of cow, when you had already received it from the treasury? Did the Terentian law
                enjoin you to buy corn from the Sicilians with the money of the Sicilians, or to buy
                corn from the Sicilians with the money of the Roman people? <milestone n="174"
                  unit="section"/> But now you see that all that money out of the treasury, which
                ought to have been given to these cities for corn, has been made profit of by that
                man. For you take fifteen <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign> for a <foreign
                  lang="la">medimus</foreign> of wheat; for that is the value of a <foreign
                  lang="la">medimus</foreign> at that time. You keep eighteen <foreign lang="la"
                  >sesterces</foreign>; for that is the price of Sicilian corn, estimated according
                to law. What difference does it make whether you did this, or whether you did not
                reject the corn, but, after the corn was approved and accepted, detained all the
                public money, and paid none to any city whatever? when the valuation of the law is
                such that while it is tolerable to the Sicilians at other times, it ought also to be
                pleasant to them during your praetorship. For a <foreign lang="la">modius</foreign>
                is valued by law at three <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign>. But, while you
                were praetor, it was, as you boast in many letters to your friends, valued at two
                  <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign>. But suppose it was three <foreign
                  lang="la">sesterces</foreign>, since you exacted that price from the cities for
                every <foreign lang="la">modius</foreign>. When, if you had paid the Sicilians as
                much as the Roman people had ordered you to pay, it might have been most pleasing to
                the cultivators, you not only did not choose them to receive what they ought, but
                you even compelled them to pay what was not due from them. <milestone n="175"
                  unit="section"/> And that these things were done in this manner, you may know, O
                judges, both from the public documents of the cities, and from their public
                testimonies; in all which you will find nothing false, nothing invented as suited to
                the times. Everything which we speak of is entered in the returns and made up in a
                regular manner, without any interpolations or irregularities being foisted into the
                people's accounts, but while they are all made up with deliberation and accuracy.
                Read the accounts of the people of Halesa. To whom does he say that money was paid?
                Speak, speak, I say, a little louder. &ldquo;To Volcatius, to Timarchides, to
                Maevius.&rdquo; <milestone n="76" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>What is all this, O Verres? have you not left yourself even this argument in your
                defence, that they are the managers of the companies who have been concerned in
                those matters? that they are the managers who have rejected the corn? that they are
                the managers who have settled the affair with the cities for money? and that it is
                they also who have taken money from you in the name of those cities? and, moreover,
                that they have bought corn for themselves; and that all these things do not at all
                concern you? It would, in truth, be an insufficient and a wretched defence for a
                praetor to say this, &ldquo;I never touched the corn, I never saw it, I gave the
                managers of the companies the power of approving of rejecting it; the managers
                extorted money from the cities but I paid to the managers the money which I ought to
                have paid to the people.&rdquo; <milestone n="176" unit="section"/> This is, as
                I have said, an insufficient, or rather, a profligate defence against an accusation.
                But still, even this one, if you were to wish to use it, you cannot use. Volcatius,
                the delight of yourself and your friends, forbids you to make mention of the
                manager; and Timarchides, the prop of your household, stops the mouth of your
                defence; who, as well as Volcatius, had money paid to him from the cities. But now
                your clerk, with that golden ring of his, which he procured out of these matters,
                will not allow you to avail yourself of that argument. What then remains for you,
                except to confess that you sent to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>
                corn which had been bought with the money of the Sicilians? that you appropriated
                the public money to your own purposes? O you habit of sinning, what delight you
                afford to the wicked and the audacious, when chastisement is afar off, and when
                impunity attends you! <milestone n="177" unit="section"/> This is not the first time
                that that man has been guilty of that sort of peculation, but now for the first time
                is he convicted. We have seen money paid to him from the treasury, while he was
                quaestor, for the expense of a consular army; we saw, a few months afterwards, both
                army and consul stripped of everything All that money lay hid in that obscurity and
                darkness which at that time had seized upon the whole republic. After that, he
                discharged the duties of the quaestorship to which he succeeded under Dolabella. He
                embezzled a vast sum of money; but he mixed up his accounts of that money with the
                confusion consequent on the conviction of Dolabella. Immense sums of money were
                entrusted to him when praetor. You will not find him a man to lick up these most
                infamous profits nervously and gently; he did not hesitate to swallow up at a gulp
                the whole of the public money. That wicked covetousness, when it is implanted in a
                man's nature, creeps on in such a way, when the habit of sinning has emancipated
                itself from restraint, that it is not able to put any limits to its audacity.
                  <milestone n="178" unit="section"/> At length it is detected, and it is detected
                in affairs of great importance, and of undoubted certainty. And it seems to me that,
                by the interposition of the gods, this man too has become involved in such
                dishonesty, as not only to suffer punishment for the crimes which he has lately
                committed, but also to be overwhelmed with the vengeance due to the sins which he
                committed against Carbo and against Dolabella. <milestone n="77" unit="chapter"
                /></p>
              <p>There is in truth also another new feature in this crime, O judges, which will
                remove all doubts as to his criminality on the former charge respecting the tenths.
                For, to say nothing of this fact, that very many of the cultivators of the soil had
                not corn enough for the second tenths, and for those eight thousand <foreign
                  lang="la">modii</foreign> which they were bound to sell to the Roman people, but
                that they bought them of your agent, that is, of Apronius; which is a clear proof
                that you had left the cultivators actually nothing: to pass over this, which teas
                been clearly set forth in many men's evidence, can anything be more certain than
                this,&mdash;that all the corn of <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                >Sicily</placeName>, and all the crops of the land liable to the payment of tenths,
                were for three years in your power and in your barns? <milestone n="179"
                  unit="section"/> for when you were demanding of the cities money for corn, whence
                was the corn to be procured for you to send to <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
                  >Rome</placeName>, if you had it not all collected and locked up? Therefore, in
                the affair of that corn, the first profit of all was that of the corn itself, which
                had been taken by violence from the cultivators; the next profit was because that
                very corn which had been procured by you during your three years, you sold not once,
                but twice; not for one payment, but for two, though it was one and the same lot of
                corn; once to the cities, for fifteen <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign> a
                  <foreign lang="la">medimnus</foreign>, a second time to the Roman people, from
                whom you got eighteen <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign> a <foreign lang="la"
                  >medimus</foreign> for the very same corn. <milestone n="180" unit="section"/> But
                perhaps you approved besides of the corn of the Centuripans, of the Agrigentines,
                and of some others, and paid money to these nations. There may be some cities in
                that number whose corn you were unwilling to object to. What then? Was all the money
                that was owed for corn paid to these cities? Find me one&mdash;not one people,
                but one cultivator. See, seek, look around, if perchance there is any single man in
                that province in which you were governor for three years, who does not wish you to
                be ruined. Produce me one, I say, out of all those cultivators who contributed money
                even to raise a statue to you, who will say that everything that was due for corn
                was paid. I pledge myself, O judges, that none will say so. <milestone n="78"
                  unit="chapter"/><milestone n="181" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>Out of all the money which it was your duty to pay to the cultivators, you were in
                the habit of making deductions on certain pretexts; first of all for the
                examination, and for the difference in the exchanges; secondly, for some stealing
                money or other. All these names, O judges, do not belong to any legal demand, but to
                the most infamous robberies. For what difference of exchange can there be when all
                use one kind of money? And what is sealing money How has this name got introduced
                into the accounts of a magistrate? how came it to be connected with the public
                money? For the third description of deduction was such as if it were not only
                lawful, but even proper; and not only proper, but absolutely necessary. Two
                fiftieths were deducted from the entire sum in the name of the clerk. Who gave you
                leave to do this?&mdash;what law? what authority of the senate? Moreover where
                was the justice of your clerk taking such a sum, whether it was taken from the
                property of the cultivators, or from the revenues of the Roman people? <milestone
                  n="182" unit="section"/> For if that sum can he deducted without injury to the
                cultivators of the soil, let the Roman people have it, especially in the existing
                difficulties of the treasury; but if the Roman people intended it to be paid to the
                cultivators, and if it is just that it should be, then shall your officer, hired at
                small wages paid by the people, plunder the property of the cultivators? And shall
                Hortensius excite against me in this cause the whole body of clerks? and shall he
                say that their interests are undermined by me, and their lights opposed? as if this
                were allowed to the clerks by any precedent or by any right. Why should I go back to
                old times? or why should I make mention of those clerks, who, it is evident, were
                most upright and conscientious men? It does not escape my observation, O judges,
                that old examples are now listened to and considered as imaginary fables I will go
                only to the present wretched and profligate time. You, O Hortensius, have lately
                been quaestor. You can say what your clerks did; I say this of mine; when, in that
                same <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, I was paying the cities money
                for their corn, and had with me two most economical men as clerks, Lucius Manilius
                and Lucius Sergius, then I say that not only these two fiftieths were not deducted,
                but that not one single coin was deducted from any one. <milestone n="79"
                  unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>I would say that all the credit of this was to be attributed to me, O judges, if
                they had ever asked this of me, if they had ever thought of it. <milestone n="183"
                  unit="section"/> For why should a clerk make this deduction, and not rather the
                muleteer who brought the corn down? or the courier, by whose arrival they heard of
                its coming and made the demand? or the crier, who ordered them to appear? or the
                lictor and the slave of Venus, who carried the money? What part of the business or
                what seasonable assistance can a scrivener pretend to, that, I will not say such
                high wages should be given him, but, that a division of such a large sum should take
                place with him? Oh they are a very honourable body of men;&mdash;who denies it?
                or what has that to do with this business? But they are an honourable body, because
                to their integrity are entrusted the public accounts and the safety of the
                magistrates. Ask, therefore, of those scriveners who are worthy of their body,
                masters of households, virtuous and honourable men, what is the meaning of those
                fiftieths? In a moment you will all clearly see that the whole affair is
                unprecedented and scandalous. <milestone n="184" unit="section"/> Bring me back to

                to come forward, but have only come with more dignity to give their evidence in this
                trial of yours. Where did all these presents come from? from the spoils of what

                for the present; who themselves had laid aside their golden rings, and had taken

                support your liberality and kindness? Moreover, what was the preface to this

              <p>I have spoken, O judges, of the corn collected as tenths; I have spoken of that

                corn, which ought to have weight with every one, both from the vastness of the sum
                involved, and from the description of the injustice done; and more than either,
                because against this charge he is provided, not with some ingenious defence, but
                with a most scandalous confession of it. For though it was lawful for him, both by a
                decree of the senate, and also by the laws, to take corn and lay it up in the
                granaries, and though the senate had valued that corn at four <foreign lang="la"
                  >sesterces</foreign> for a <foreign lang="la">modius</foreign> of wheat, two for
                one of barley, Verres, having first added to the quantity of wheat, valued each

                this, O Hortensius; do not you think about this; I know that many virtuous, and

                soil and with cities, the corn which ought to have been taken and laid up in the
                granary, and have taken money instead of corn; I know what is accustomed to be done;
                I know what is lawful to be done; nothing which has been previously the custom of
                virtuous men is found fault with ill the conduct of Verres. <milestone n="189"
                  unit="section"/> This is what I find fault with, that, when a <foreign lang="la"
                  >modius</foreign> of wheat in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> cost
                two <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign>, as his letter which was sent to you
                declares, or at most, three, as has also already been made clear from all the
                evidence and all the accounts of the cultivators, he exacted from the cultivators
                three <foreign lang="la">denarii</foreign> for every <foreign lang="la"
                  >modius</foreign> of wheat. <milestone n="82" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>This is the charge; I wish you to understand, that my accusation turns not on the
                fact of his having valued the corn, nor even of his having valued it at three
                  <foreign lang="la">denarii</foreign> but on that of his having increased the
                quantity of corn, and consequently the amount of the valuation. In truth this
                valuation originated, O judges, at first not in the convenience of the praetors or
                consuls, but in the advantage to the cultivators and the cities. For originally, no
                one was so impudent as to demand money when it was corn that was due; certainly this
                proceeded in the first instance from the cultivator or from the city which was
                required to furnish corn; when they had either sold the corn, or wished to keep it,
                or were not willing to carry it to that place where it was required to be delivered,
                they begged as a kindness and a favour, that they might be allowed, instead of the
                corn, to give the value of the corn. From such a commencement as this, and from the
                liberality and accommodating spirit of the magistrates the custom of valuations was
                introduced. <milestone n="190" unit="section"/> More covetous, magistrates
                succeeded; who, in their avarice, devised not only a plan for their own gain, but
                also a way of escape, and a plea for their defence. They adopted a custom of always
                requiring corn to be delivered at the most remote and inconvenient places, in order
                that, through the difficulty of carriage, the cultivators might be more easily
                brought to the valuation which they wished. In a case of this kind it is easier to
                form one's opinion, than to make out a case for blame; because we can think the man
                who does this avaricious, but we cannot easily make out a charge against him;
                because it appears that we must grant this to our magistrates, that they may have
                power to receive the corn in any place they choose; therefore this is what many
                perhaps have done, not, however, so many out that those whom we recollect, or whom
                we have heard of as the most upright magistrates, have declined to do it. <milestone
                  n="83" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="191" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>I ask of you now, O Hortensius, with which of these classes you are going to
                compare the conduct of Verres? With those, I suppose, who, influenced by their own
                kindness, have granted, as a favour and as a convenience to the cities, permission
                to give money instead of corn. And so I suppose the cultivators begged of him, that,
                as they could not sell a <foreign lang="la">modius</foreign> of wheat for three
                  <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign>, they may be allowed to pay three <foreign
                  lang="la">denarii</foreign> instead of each <foreign lang="la">modius</foreign>.
                Or, since you do not dare to say this, will you take refuge in that assertion, that,
                being influenced by the difficulty of carriage, they preferred to give three
                  <foreign lang="la">denarii</foreign>? Of what carriage? Wishing not to have to
                carry it from what place to what place? from <placeName key="tgn,7002320"
                  >Philomelium</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,7002499">Ephesus</placeName>? I
                see what is the difference between the price of corn at different places; I see too
                how many days' journey it is; I see that it is for the advantage of the Philomelians
                rather to pay in <placeName key="tgn,7002613">Phrygia</placeName> the price which
                corn bears in <placeName key="tgn,7002499">Ephesus</placeName>, than to carry it to
                  <placeName key="tgn,7002499">Ephesus</placeName>, or to send both money and agents
                to <placeName key="tgn,7002499">Ephesus</placeName> to buy corn. <milestone n="192"
                  unit="section"/> But what can there be like that in <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName>? <placeName key="tgn,7003916">Enna</placeName> is a completely
                inland town. Compel (that is the utmost stretch of your authority) the people of
                  <placeName key="tgn,7003916">Enna</placeName> to deliver their corn at the
                waterside; they will take it to Phintia, or to Halesa, or to <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003947">Catina</placeName>, places all very distant from one another,
                the same day that you issue the order; though there is not even need of any carriage
                at all; for all this profit of the valuation, O judges, arises from the variety in
                the price of corn. For a magistrate in a province can manage this,&mdash;namely,
                to receive it where it is dearest. And therefore that is the way valuations are
                managed in <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> and in <placeName
                  key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, and in those provinces in which corn is not
                everywhere the same price. But in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>
                what difference did it make to any one in what place he delivered it? for he had not
                to carry it; and wherever he was ordered to carry it, there he might buy the same
                quantity of corn which he sold at home. <milestone n="193" unit="section"/>
                Wherefore, if, O Hortensius, you wish to show that anything, in the matter of the
                valuation, was done by him like what has been done by others, you must show that at
                any place in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, while Verres was
                praetor, a <foreign lang="la">modius</foreign> of wheat ever cost three <foreign

              <p>See what a defence I have opened to you; how unjust to our allies, how far removed
                from the good of the republic, how utterly foreign to the intention and meaning of
                the law. Do you, when I am prepared to deliver you corn on my own farm, in my own
                city,&mdash;in the very place, in short, in which you are, in which you live, in
                which you manage all your business and conduct the affairs of the
                province,&mdash;do you, I say, select for me some remote and desert corner of
                the island? Do you bid me deliver it there, whither it is very inconvenient to carry
                it? where I cannot purchase it? <milestone n="194" unit="section"/> It is a shameful
                action, O judges, intolerable, permitted to no one by law, but perhaps not yet
                punished in any instance. Still this very thing, which I say ought not to be
                endured, I grant to you, O Verres; I make you a present of it. If in any place of
                that province corn was at the price at which he valued it, then I think that this
                charge ought not to have any weight against him. But when it was fetching two
                  <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign>, or even three at the outside, in any
                district of the province which you choose to name, you exacted twelve. If there
                cannot be any dispute between you and me either about the price of corn, or about
                your valuation, why are you sitting there? What are you waiting for? What will you
                say in your defence? Does money appear to have been appropriated by you contrary to
                the laws, contrary to the interests of the republic, to the great injury of our
                allies? Or will you say in your defence, that all this has been done lawfully,
                regularly, in a manner advantageous to the republic, without injury to any one?
                  <milestone n="195" unit="section"/> When the senate had given you money out of the
                treasury, and had paid you money which you were to pay the cultivators, a <foreign
                  lang="la">denarius</foreign> for every <foreign lang="la">modius</foreign>, what
                was it your duty to do? If you had wished to do what Lucius Piso, surnamed Thrifty,
                who first made the law about extortion, would have done, when you had bought the
                corn at the regular price, you would have returned whatever money there was over. If
                you wished to act as men desirous of gaining popularity, or as kind-hearted men
                would, as the senate had valued the corn at more than the regular price, you would
                have paid for it according to the valuation of the senate, and not according to the
                market price. Or if, as many do, a conduct which produces some profit indeed, but
                still an honest and allowable one, you would not have bought corn, since it was
                cheaper than they expected, but you would have retained the money which the senate
                had granted you for furnishing the granary. <milestone n="85" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>But what is it that you have done? What presence has it, I will not say of justice,
                but even of any ordinary roguery or impudence? For, indeed, there is not usually
                anything which men, however dishonest, dare to do openly in their magistracy, for
                which they cannot give, if not a good excuse, still some excuse or other. <milestone

                  >sesterces</foreign> for it. But I don't want the corn, I will take the money. I
                had hoped, says the cultivator, that I should have touched the <foreign lang="la"
                  >denarii</foreign>; but if you must have money, consider what is the price of corn

                great a booty I shall get.&rdquo; Speak, speak, says the cultivator, a little
                plainer. The senate desires that you should pay me money,&mdash;that I should
                deliver corn to you. Will you retain that money which the senate intended should be
                paid to me, and take two <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign> a-<foreign lang="la"

                you call this plunder and robbery granary-money? <milestone n="198" unit="section"/>
                This one injury,&mdash;this single distress, was wanting to the cultivators
                under your praetorship, to complete the ruin of the remainder of their fortunes. For
                what remaining injury could be done to the man who, owing to this injury, was forced
                not only to dose all his corn, but even to sell all his tools and stock? He had no
                way to turn. From what produce could he find the money to pay you? Under the name of
                tenths, as much had been taken from him as the caprice of Apronius chose; for the
                second tenths and for the corn that had been purchased either nothing had been paid,
                or only so much as the clerk had left behind, or perhaps it was even taken for
                nothing, as you have had proved to you. <milestone n="86" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>Is money also to be extorted from the cultivators? How? By what right? by what
                precedent? For when the crops of the cultivator were carried off and plundered with
                every kind of injustice, the cultivator appeared to lose what he had himself raised
                with his plough, for which he had toiled, what his land and his cornfields had
                produced. <milestone n="199" unit="section"/> But amid this terrible ill-treatment,
                there was still this wretched consolation,&mdash;that he seemed only to be
                losing what, under another praetor, he could get again out of the same land. But now
                it is necessary for the cultivator&mdash;to give money, which he does not get
                out of the land&mdash;to sell his oxen, and his plough itself, and all his tools
                For you are not to think this. &ldquo;The man has also possessions in ready
                money; he has also possessions inland, near the city.&rdquo; For when a burden
                is imposed on a cultivator of the soil, it is not the mean and ability of the man
                that is to be considered, whether he has any property besides; but the quality and
                description of his land, what that can endure, what that can suffer, what that can
                and ought to produce. Although those men have been drained and ruined by Verres in
                every possible manner, still you ought to decide what contribution you consider the
                cultivator ought to render to the republic on account of his land, and what charges
                he can support. You impose the payment of tenths on them. They endure that. A second
                tenth. You think they must be subservient to your necessities,&mdash;that they
                must, besides that, supply you with more if you choose to purchase it They will so
                supply you if you choose. <milestone n="200" unit="section"/> How severe all this
                is, and how little, after all these deductions are made, can be left of clear profit
                for the owners, I think you, from your own farming experience, can guess. Add, now,
                to all this, the edicts, the regulations, the injuries of Verres,&mdash;add the
                reign and the rapine of Apronius, and the slaves of Apronius, in the land subject to
                the payment of tenths. Although I pass over all this; I am speaking of the granary.
                Is it your intention that the Sicilians should give corn to our magistrates for
                their granaries for nothing? What can be more scandalous, what can be more
                iniquitous than that? And yet, know you that this would have seemed to the
                cultivators a thing to be wished for, to be begged for, while that man was praetor.

              <p>Sositenus is a citizen of Entella; a man of the greatest prudence, and of the
                noblest birth in his city. You have heard what he said when he was sent by the
                public authority to this trial as a deputy, together with Artemon and Meniscus, men
                of the highest character. He, when in the senate at Entella he was discussing with
                me the injustice of Verres, said this: that, if the question of the granaries and of
                the valuation were conceded, the Sicilians were willing to promise the senate corn
                for the granary without payment, so that we need not for the future vote such large
                sums to our magistrates. <milestone n="201" unit="section"/> I am sure that you
                clearly perceive how advantageous this would be for the Sicilians not because of the
                justice of such a condition, but in the way of choosing the least of two evils; for
                the man who had given Verres a thousand <foreign lang="la">modii</foreign> for the
                granary as his share of the contribution required, would have given two, or, at
                most, three thousand <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign>, but the same man has
                now been compelled for the same quantity of corn to give eight thousand <foreign
                  lang="la">sesterces</foreign>. A cultivator could not stand this for three years,
                at least not out of his own produce. He must inevitably have sold his stock. But if
                the land can endure this contribution and this tribute,&mdash;that is to say, if
                  <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> can bear and support it, let it
                pay it to the Roman people rather than to our magistrates. It is a great sum, a
                great and splendid revenue. If you can obtain it without damage to the province,
                without injury to our allies, I do not object at all. Let as much be given to the
                magistrates for their granary as has always been given. What Verres demands besides,
                that, if they cannot provide it, let them refuse. If they can provide it, let it be
                the revenue of the Roman people rather than the plunder of the praetor. <milestone
                  n="202" unit="section"/> In the next place, why is that valuation established for
                only one description of corn? If it is just and endurable, then <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> owes the Roman people tenths; let it give
                three <foreign lang="la">denarii</foreign> for each single <foreign lang="la"
                  >modius</foreign> of wheat; let it keep the corn itself. Money has been paid to
                you, O Verres,&mdash;one sum with which you were to buy corn for the granary,
                the other with which you were to buy corn from the cities to send to <placeName
                  key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. You keep at your own house the money which
                has been given to you; and besides that, you receive a vast sum in your own name. Do
                the same with respect to that corn which belongs to the Roman people; exact money
                from the cities according to the same valuation, and give back what you have
                received,&mdash;then the treasury of the Roman people will be better filled than
                it ever has been. <milestone n="203" unit="section"/> But <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> could not endure that in the case of the
                public corn; she did indeed bear it in the case of my own. Just as if that valuation
                was more just when your advantage was concerned, than when that of the Roman people
                was; or, as if the conduct which I speak of and that which you adopted, differed
                only in the description of the injury, and not in the magnitude of the sum involved.
                But that granary they can by no means bear, not even if everything else be remitted;
                not even if they were for ever hereafter delivered from all the injuries and
                distresses which they have suffered while you were praetor, still they say that they

                discussed in the presence of a numerous assembly,) that, in the very matter in which

                properly; not by reference to right, nor to equity, nor to law, nor because it was

                namely, of having taken money to influence your legal decisions, by the same
                argument, that others have done so too? Even if I were to admit the assertion, still
                I should not admit it as any defence. For it would be better that by your

                others, than that, owing to your acquittal, others should be thought to have

                of all foreign nations. In a case of this sort, in speaking of customs of this sort,

                says that others have also done the same, he will not want examples; but the

                Although, what are those numerous instances of wicked men? For when in a cause of

                begun to say that anything has frequently been done, those who hear him are

              <p>For such instances usually have both a great deal of authority in proving any

                and the Catos and the Laelii, and will you say that they have done the same thing?
                Then, even though the act might not please me, still I should not be able to fight
                against the authority of those men. But, since you will not be able to produce them,
                will you bring forward these moderns, Quintus Catulus the father, Caius Marcius,
                Quintus Scaevola, Marcus Scaurus, Quintus Metellus? who have all governed provinces,
                and who have all levied corn on the ground of filling the granary. The authority of

                examples will you bring me back? Will you lead me away from those men who have spent
                their lives in the service of the republic at a time when manners were very strict,
                and when the opinion of men was considered of great weight, and when the courts of
                justice were severe, to the existing caprice and licentiousness of men of the
                present age? And do you seek precedents for your defence among those men, as a
                warning to whom the Roman people have decided that they are in need of some severe
                examples? I do not, indeed, altogether condemn the manners of the present time, as
                long as we follow those examples which the Roman people approves of; not those which
                it condemns. I will not look around me, I will not go out of doors to seek for any
                one, while we have as judges those chiefs of the city, Publius Servilius and Quintus
                Catulus, who are men of such authority, and distinguished for such exploits, that
                they may be classed in that number of ancient and most illustrious men of whom I

                since you are fond of modern instances, what they did. Will you not? Quintus Catulus
                used corn, but he exacted no money. Publius Servilius, though he commanded an army
                for five years, and by that means might have made an incalculable sum of money,
                thought that nothing was lawful for himself which he had not seen his father and his
                grandfather, Quintus Metellus, do. Shall Caius Verres be found, who will say that
                everything is lawful for him which is profitable? Will he allege in his defence that
                he has done in accordance with the example set by others, what none, except wicked

                itself, (I will not go abroad to look for examples,) I will take examples out of the

                governed the province of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> when you
                were proconsul. Under your command were any sums of money extorted, under the name
                of money for the granary? I do not give you any credit for this. There are other
                exploits, other designs of yours worthy of the highest praise, measures by which you
                recovered and set up again an afflicted and ruined province. For even Lepidus whom
                you succeeded had not committed this fraud about the granary. What precedents then
                have you in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> affecting this charge
                about the granary, if you cannot defend yourself from the accusation by quoting any
                action even of Lepidus, much less any action of Marcellus? <milestone n="213"
                  unit="section"/> Are you going to bring me back to the valuation of the corn, and
                the exaction of money by Marcus Antonius? Just so, says he; to the valuation of
                Marcus Antonius. For this is what he seemed to mean by his signs and nods. Out of
                all the praetors of the Roman people then, and consuls, and generals, have you
                selected Marcus Antonius, and even the most infamous action done by him, for your
                imitation? And here is it difficult for me to say, or for the judges to think, that
                in that unlimited authority Marcus Antonius behaved himself in such a manner, that
                it is by far more injurious to Verres to say that as he, in a most infamous
                transaction, wished to imitate Antonius, than if he were able to allege in his
                defence, that he had never in his whole life done anything like Marcus Antonius? Men
                in trials are accustomed to allege, in making a defence against an accusation, not
                what any one did, but what he did that was good. In the middle of his course of
                injustice and covetousness death overtook Antony, while he was still both doing and
                planning many things contrary to the safety of the allies many things contrary to
                the advantage of our provinces. Will you defend the audacity of Verres by the
                example of Antonius, as if the senate and people of <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
                  >Rome</placeName> approved of all his actions and designs? <milestone n="92"
                  unit="chapter"/><milestone n="214" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>But Sacerdos did the same. You name an upright man, and one endued with the
                greatest wisdom; but he can only be thought to have done the same thing, if he did
                it with the same intention. For the mere fact of the valuation has never been found
                fault with by me; but the equity of it depends on the advantage to, and willingness
                of the cultivator. No valuation can be found fault with, which is not only not
                disadvantageous, but which is even pleasing to the cultivator. Sacerdos, when he
                came into the province, commanded corn to be provided for the granary. As before the
                new harvest came in a <foreign lang="la">modius</foreign> of wheat was five <foreign
                  lang="la">denarii</foreign>, the cities begged of him to have a valuation. The
                valuation wee somewhat lower than the actual market price, for he valued it at three
                  <foreign lang="la">denarii</foreign>. You see that the same fact of a valuation,
                through the dissimilarity of the occasion, was a cause of praise in his instance, of
                accusation in yours. In his instance it was a kindness, in yours an injury.
                  <milestone n="215" unit="section"/> The same year Antonius valued corn at three
                  <foreign lang="la">denarii</foreign>, after the harvest, in a season of exceeding
                cheapness, when the cultivators would rather give the corn for nothing, and he said
                that he had valued it at the same price as Sacerdos; and he spoke truly, but yet' by
                the same valuation the one had relieved the cultivators, the other had ruined them.
                And if it were not the case that the whole value of corn must be estimated by the
                season, and the market price, not by the abundance, nor by the total amount, these
                  <foreign lang="la">modii</foreign> and a half of yours, O Hortensius, would never
                have been so agreeable; in distributing which to the Roman people, for every head,
                small as the quantity was, you did an action which was most agreeable to all men;
                for the dearness of corn caused that, which seemed a small thing in reality, to
                appear at that time a great one. If you had given such a largess to the Roman people
                in a time of cheapness, your kindness would have been derided and despised.
                  <milestone n="93" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="216" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>Do not, therefore, say that Verres did the same as Sacerdos had done, since he did
                not do it on the same occasion, nor when wheat was at a similar price; say rather,
                since you have a competent authority to quote, that he did for three years what
                Antonius did on his arrival, and with reference to scarcely a month's provisions,
                and defend his innocence by the act and authority of Marcus Antonius. For what will
                you say of Sextus Peducaeus, a most brave and honest man? What cultivator ever
                complained of him? or who did not think that his praetorship was the most impartial
                and the most active one that has ever been known up to this time? He governed the
                province for two years, when one year wee a year of cheapness, the other a year of
                the greatest dearness. Did any cultivator either give him money in the cheap season,
                or in the dear season complain of the valuation of his corn? Oh, but provisions were
                very abundant that dear season. <milestone n="217" unit="section"/> I believe they
                were; that is not a new thing nor a blamable one. We very lately saw Caius Sentius,
                a man of old-fashioned and extraordinary incorruptibility, on account of the
                dearness of food which existed in <placeName key="tgn,7006667"
                >Macedonia</placeName>, make a great deal of money by furnishing provisions. So that
                I do not grudge you your profits, if any have come to you legally; I complain of
                your injustice; I impeach your dishonesty; I cat your avarice into court, and
                arraign it before this tribunal. </p>
              <p>But if you wish to excite a suspicion that this charge belongs to more men and more
                provinces than one, I will not be afraid of that defence of yours, but I will
                profess myself the defender of all the provinces. In truth I say this, and I say it
                with a loud voice, &ldquo;Wherever this has been done, it has been done
                wickedly; whoever has done it is deserving of punishment.&rdquo; <milestone
                  n="94" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="218" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>For, in the name of the immortal gods, see, O judges, look forward with your mind's
                eye at what will be the result. Many men have exacted large sums from unwilling
                cities, and from unwilling cultivators, in this way, under pretence of filling the
                granary. (I have no idea of any one person having done so except him, but I grant
                you this, and I admit that many have.) In the case of this man you see the matter
                brought before a court of justice; what can you do? can you, when you are judges in
                a case of embezzlement which is brought before you, overlook the misappropriation of
                so large a sum? or can you, though the law was made for the sake of the allies, turn
                a deaf ear to the complaints of the allies? <milestone n="219" unit="section"/>
                However, I give up this point too to you. Disregard what is past, if you please; but
                do not destroy their hopes for the future, and ruin all the provinces; guard against
                this,&mdash;against opening, by your authority, a visible and broad way for
                avarice, which up to this time has been in the habit of advancing by secret and
                narrow paths; for if you approve of this, and if you decide that it is lawful for
                money to be taken on that pretext, at all events there is no one except the most
                foolish of men who will not for the future do what as yet no one except the most
                dishonest of men ever has done; they are dishonest men who exact money contrary to
                the laws, they are fools who omit to do what it has been decided that they may do.
                  <milestone n="220" unit="section"/> In the next place, see, O judges, what a
                boundless licence for plundering people of money you will he giving to men. If the
                man who exacts three <foreign lang="la">denarii</foreign> is acquitted, some one
                else will exact four, five, presently ten, or even twenty. What reproof will he meet
                with? At what degree of injury will the severity of the judge first begin to make a
                stand? How many <foreign lang="la">denarii</foreign> will it be that will be quite
                intolerable? and at what point will the iniquity and dishonesty of the valuation be
                first arraigned? For it is not the amount, but the description of valuation that
                will be approved of by you. Nor can you decide in this manner, that it is lawful for
                a valuation to be made when the price fixed is three <foreign lang="la"
                  >denarii</foreign>, but not lawful when the price fixed is ten; for when a
                departure is once made from the standard of the market price, and when the affair is
                once so changed that it is not the advantage of the cultivators which is the rule,
                but the will of the praetor, then the manner of valuing no longer depends on law and
                duty, but on the caprice and avarice of men. <milestone n="95" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>Wherefore, if in giving your decisions you once pass over the boundary of equity
                and law, know that you impose on those who come after no limit to dishonesty and
                avarice in valuing. <milestone n="221" unit="section"/>See, therefore, how many
                things are required of you at once. Acquit the man who confesses that he has taken
                immense sums, doing at the same time the greatest injury to our allies. That is not
                enough. There are also many others who have done the same thing. Acquit them also,
                if there are any; so as to release as many rogues as possible by one decision. Even
                that is not enough. Cause that it may be lawful to those who come after them to do
                the same thing. It shall be lawful. Even this is too little. Allow it to be lawful
                for every one to value corn at whatever price he pleases. He may so value it. You
                see now, in truth, O judges, that if this valuation be approved of by you, there
                will be no limit hereafter to any man's avarice, nor any punishment for dishonesty.
                  <milestone n="222" unit="section"/> What, therefore, O Hortensius, are you about?
                You are the consul elect, you have had a province allotted to you. When you speak on
                the subject of the valuation of corn, we shall listen to you as if you were avowing
                that you will do what you defend as having been legitimately done by Verres; and as
                if you were very eager that that should be lawful for you which you say was lawful
                for him. But if that is to be lawful, there is nothing which you can imagine any one
                likely to do hereafter, in consequence of which he can possibly be condemned for
                extortion. For whatever sum of money any one covets, that amount it will be lawful
                for him to acquire, under the plea of the granary, and by means of the highness of
                the valuation. <milestone n="96" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="223" unit="section"
                /></p>
              <p>But there is a thing, which, even if Hortensius does not say it openly in defending
                Verres, he still does say in such a manner that you may suspect and think that this
                matter concerns the advantage of the senators; that it concerns the advantage of
                those who are judges, and who think that they will some day or other be in the
                provinces themselves as governors or as lieutenants. But you must think that we have
                splendid judges, if you think them likely to show indulgence to the faults of
                others, in order the more easily to be allowed to commit faults themselves. Do we
                then wish the Roman people, do we wish the provinces, and our allies, and foreign
                nations to think that, if senators are the judges, this particular manner of
                extorting immense sums of money with the greatest injustice will never be in any way
                chastised? But if that be the case, what can we say against that praetor who every
                day occupies the senate, who insists upon it that the republic can not prosper, if
                the office of judge is not restored to the equestrian order? <milestone n="224"
                  unit="section"/> But if he begins to agitate this one point, that there is one
                description of extortion, common to all the senators, and now almost legalized in
                the case of that order, by which immense sums are taken from the allies with the
                greatest injustice; and that this cannot possibly be repressed by tribunals of
                senators, but that, while the equestrian order furnished the senators, it never was
                committed; who, then, can resist him? Who will be so desirous of gratifying you, who
                will be such a partisan of your order, as to be able to oppose the transference of
                the appointment of judges to that body? <milestone n="97" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>And I wish he were able to make a defence to this charge by any argument, however
                false, as long as it is natural and customary. You could then decide with less
                danger to yourselves, with less danger to all the provinces. Did he deny that he had
                adopted this valuation? You would appear to have believed the man in that statement,
                not to have approved of his action. He cannot possibly deny it. It is proved by all
                  <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>. Out of all that numerous band of
                cultivators, there is not one from whom money has not been exacted on the plea of
                the granary. <milestone n="225" unit="section"/> I wish he were able to say even
                this, that that affair does not concern him; that the whole business relating to
                corn was managed by the quaestors. Even that he cannot say, because his own letters
                are read which were sent to the cities, written on the subject of the three <foreign
                  lang="la">denarii</foreign>. What then is his defence? &ldquo;I have done what
                you accuse me of; I have extorted immense sums on the plea of the granary; but it
                was lawful for me to do so, and it will be lawful for you if you take
                care.&rdquo; A dangerous thing for the provinces for any classes of injury to be
                established by judicial decision to a dangerous thing for our order, for the Roman
                people to think that these men, who themselves are subject to the laws, cannot
                defend the laws with strictness when they are judges. And while that man was
                praetor, O judges, there was not only no limit to his valuing corn, but there was
                none either to his demands of corn. Nor did he command that only to be supplied that
                was due, but as much as was advantageous for himself. I will put before you the sum
                total of all the corn commanded to be furnished for the granary, as collected out of
                the public documents, and the testimonies of the cities You will find, O judges,
                that man commanded the cities to supply five times as much as it was lawful for him
                to take for the granary. What can be added to this impudence, if he both valued it
                at such a price that men could not endure it, and also commanded so much more to be
                supplied than was permitted to him by the laws to require? <milestone n="226"
                  unit="section"/>
              </p>
              <p>Wherefore, now that you have heard the whole business of the corn, O judges, you
                can easily see that <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, that most
                productive and most desirable province, has been lost to the Roman people, unless
                you recover it by your condemnation of that man. For what is <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, if you take away the cultivation of its
                land, and if you extinguish the multitude and the very name of the cultivators of
                the soil? For what can there be left of disaster which has not come to those unhappy
                cultivators, with every circumstance of injury and insult? They were liable, indeed,
                to pay tenths, but they have scarcely had a tenth left for themselves. When money
                has been due to them, it has not been paid; though the senate intended them to
                supply corn for the granary according to a very equitable valuation, they have been
                compelled to sell even the tools with which they cultivate their lands. <milestone
                  n="98" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="227" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>I have already said, O judges, that even if you remove all these injuries, still
                that the occupation of cultivating land is maintained owing to the hopes and a
                certain sort of pleasure which it gives, rather than because of the profit and
                emolument arising from it. In truth every year constant labour and constant expense
                is incurred in the hope of a result which is casual and uncertain. Moreover, the
                crop does not command a high price, except in a disastrous harvest. But if there has
                been a great abundance of crops gathered, then there is cheapness in selling them.
                So that you may see that the corn must be badly sold if it is got in well, or else
                that the crop must be bad if you get a good price for it. And the whole business of
                agriculture is such, that it is regulated not by reason or by industry, but by those
                most uncertain things,&mdash;the weather and the winds. When from agriculture
                one tenth is extracted by law and on fair terms,&mdash;when a second is levied
                by a new regulation, on account of the necessity of procuring a sufficient supply
                for ourselves,&mdash;when, besides, corn is purchased every year by public
                authority,&mdash;and when, after all that, more still is ordered by magistrates
                and lieutenants to be supplied for the granary,&mdash;what, or how much is there
                after all this of his own crop which the cultivator or owner can have at his own
                disposal, for his own profit? <milestone n="228" unit="section"/> And if all this is
                endured,&mdash;if by their care, and expense, and labour, they consult your
                advantage and that of the Roman people rather than themselves and their own
                profit,&mdash;still, ought they also to bear these new edicts and commands of
                the praetors, and the imperiousness of Apronius, and the robberies and rapine of the
                slaves of Venus? Ought they also to supply corn which ought to be purchased of them
                without getting any payment for it? Ought they also, though they are willing to
                supply corn for the granary without payment, to be forced to pay large sums too?
                Ought they also to endure all these injures and all these losses accompanied with
                the greatest insult and contumely? Therefore, O judges, those things which they have
                not at all been able to bear, they have not borne. You know that over the whole of
                  <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> the allotments of land are
                deserted and abandoned by their owners. Nor is there anything else to be gained by
                this trial, except that our most ancient and faithful allies, the Sicilians, Roman
                settlers, and the cultivators of the soil, owing to your strictness and your care,
                may return to their farms and to their homes under my guidance and through my

                <p>The subject of this oration is the manner in which Verres had plundered not only
                  private individuals, but even some temples, of valuable statues, and other works
                  of art. Among the instances given some of the most prominent are the plunder of
                  Heius, a Messanian, of Philarchus, of Centuripa, of several other private
                  citizens, of Antiochus, the king; and of the temples of Diana, Mercury, and
                    <placeName key="tgn,7010621">Ceres</placeName>. A French translator in
                  commenting on this oration says, with reference to the slighting way in which
                  Cicero speaks of the works of art thus stolen,&mdash;&ldquo;The Romans
                  struggled for some time against the seductive power of the arts of <placeName

                  unlettered, and rude barbarians who had conquered her by force. Faithful to the
                  ancient maxims of the republic, Cicero in this oration speaks only with a sort of
                  disdain of the arts and works of the most famous artists. He even pretends
                  sometimes not to be too well acquainted with the names of the most celebrated
                  statuaries; he often repeats, and with a kind of affectation, that he knows very
                  little of painting or sculpture; and rather prides himself, as one may say, on his
                  ignorance. He seems to regard a taste for art as unworthy of the Romans, and the
                  finest <foreign lang="fr">chefs d' oeuvre</foreign> as children's toys, fit to
                  amuse the trifling and frivolous minds of the Greeks, whose name he usually
                  expresses by a contemptuous diminutive, (<foreign lang="la">Graeculi</foreign>,)
                  but little calculated to fix the attention, or attract the esteem or wishes of a
                  Roman mind. ******</p>
                <p>In general there runs through these orations a tone more calculated to render
                  Verres ridiculous, than to make one feel how much there was in all his attempts
                  which was odious and horrible. The orator even permitted himself some
                  pleasantries, for which his taste has been, perhaps too severely, called in
                  question. Cicero had no dislike to puns, and has played a good deal on the name of
                  Verres, which means a boar. He was too eager to acquire the reputation of a wit.
                  It is true that the person of Verres was sufficiently inviting as a subject for
                  ridicule. He was one of those gross men overloaded with fat in whom the bulk of
                  body appears to stifle all delicacy of moral feeling. As he had tried to carry off
                  a statue of Hercules which his people could with difficulty move upon its
                  pedestal, Cicero calls this the thirteenth of the labours of Hercules. And playing
                  continually on the name of Verres, he compares him to the boar of Erymanthus. At
                  another time he calls him the dragnet of <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                    >Sicily</placeName>, because the name Verres has some resemblance to the word
                    <foreign lang="la">everriculum</foreign>, which signifies a dragnet.&rdquo; </p>
                <p>Hortensius endeavoured to defend Verres from the charge of having stolen these
                  statues, &amp;c. of which he admits that he had become the possessor, by
                  contending that he had bought them. But it was contrary to the laws for a
                  magistrate to purchase any such articles in his province; and Cicero shows also
                  that the prices alleged to have been given are so wholly disproportionate to their
                  value, that it is ridiculous to assert that the things had been purchased and not
                  taken by force. </p>

              <p>I come now to what Verres himself calls his passion what his friends call his
                disease, his madness; what the Sicilians call his rapine; what I am to call it, I
                know not. I will state the whole affair to you, and do you consider it according to
                its own importance and not by the importance of its name. First of all, O judges,
                suffer me to make you acquainted with the description of this conduct of his; and
                then, perhaps, you will not be very much puzzled to know by what name to call it. I
                say that in all <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, in all that wealthy
                and ancient province, that in that number of towns and families of such exceeding
                riches, there was no silver vessel, no Corinthian or Delian plate, no jewel or
                pearl, nothing made of gold or ivory, no statue of marble or brass or ivory, no
                picture whether painted or embroidered, that he did not seek out, that he did not
                inspect, that, if he liked it, he did not take away. <milestone n="2" unit="section"
                /> I seem to be making a very extensive charge; listen now to the manner in which I
                make it. For I am not embracing everything in one charge for the sake of making an
                impression, or of exaggerating his guilt. When I say that he left nothing whatever
                of the sort in the whole province, know that I am speaking according to the strict
                meaning of the words, and not in the spirit of an accuser. I will speak even more
                plainly; I will say that he has left nothing in any one's house, nothing even in the
                towns, nothing in public places, not even in the temples, nothing in the possession
                of any Sicilian, nothing in the possession of any Roman citizen; that he has left
                nothing, in short, which either came before his eyes or was suggested to his mind,
                whether private property or public, or profane or sacred, in all <placeName

                most constantly open, most especially hospitable to all our fellow-citizens. That
                house before the arrival of Verres was so splendidly adorned, as to be an ornament
                even to the city. For <placeName key="tgn,7003897">Messana</placeName> itself, which
                is admirable on account of its situation, its fortifications, and its harbour, is
                very empty and bare of those things in which Verres delights. <milestone n="4"
                  unit="section"/> There was in the house of Heius a private chapel of great
                sacredness, handed down to him from his ancestors, very ancient; in which he had
                four very beautiful statues, made with the greatest skill, and of very high
                character; calculated not only to delight Verres, that clever and accomplished man,
                but even any one of us whom he calls the mob:&mdash;one, a statue of Cupid, in
                marble, a work of Praxiteles; for in truth, while I have been inquiring into that
                man's conduct, I have learnt the names of the workmen; it was the same workman, as I
                imagine, who made that celebrated Cupid of the same figure as this which is at
                  <placeName key="tgn,5004258">Thespiae</placeName>, on account of which people go
                to see <placeName key="tgn,5004258">Thespiae</placeName>, for there is no other
                reason for going to see it; and therefore that great man Lucius Mummius, when he
                carried away from that town the statues of the Muses which are now before the temple
                of Good Fortune, and the other statues which were not consecrated, did not touch
                this marble Cupid, because it had been consecrated. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"
                  /><milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>But to return to that private chapel; there was this statue, which I am speaking
                of, of Cupid, made of marble. On the other side there was a Hercules, beautifully
                made of brass; that was said to be the work of Myron, as I believe, and it
                undoubtedly was so. Also before those gods there were little altars, which might
                indicate to any one the holiness of the chapel. There were besides two brazen
                statues, of no very great size, but of marvellous beauty, in the dress and robes of
                virgins, which with uplifted hands were supporting some sacred vessels which were
                placed on their heads, after the fashion of the Athenian virgins. They were called
                the Canephorae, but their maker was.... (who? who was he? thank you, you are quite
                right,) they called him Polycletus. Whenever any one of our citizens went to
                  <placeName key="tgn,7003897">Messana</placeName>, he used to go and see these
                statues. They were open every day for people to go to see them. The house was not
                more an ornament to its master, than it was to the city. </p>
              <p><milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Caius Claudius, whose aedileship we know to have
                been a most splendid affair, used this statue of Cupid, as long as he kept the forum
                decorated in honour of the immortal gods and the Roman people. And as he was
                connected by ties of hospitality with the Heii, and was the patron of the Mamertine
                people,&mdash;as he availed himself of their kindness to lend him this, so he
                was careful to restore it There have lately been noble men of the same kind, O
                judges;&mdash;why do I say lately, Yes, we have seen some very lately, a very
                little while ago indeed, who have adorned the forum and the public buildings, not
                with the spoils of the provinces, but with ornaments belonging to their
                friends,&mdash;with splendid things lent by their own connections, not with the
                produce of the thefts of guilty men,&mdash;and who afterwards have restored the
                statues and decorations, each to its proper owner; men who have not taken things
                away out of the cities of our allies for the sake of a four-day festival, under
                presence of the shows to be exhibited in their aedileship, and after that carried
                them off to their own homes, and their own villas. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                All these statues which I have mentioned, O judges, Verres took away from Heius, out
                of his private chapel. Be left, I say, not one of those things, nor anything else,
                except one old wooden figure.&mdash;Good Fortune, as I believe; that, forsooth,

                speak of upright, innocent, conscientious men, but so many covetous, so many
                audacious, so many infamous men as there have been, not one of them all was violent
                enough, or seemed to himself powerful enough or noble enough, to venture to ask for,
                or to take away, or even to touch anything in that chapel. Shall Verres take away
                everything which is most beautiful everywhere? Shall it not be allowed to any one
                besides to have anything? Shall that one house of his contain so many wealthy
                houses? Was it for this reason that none of his predecessors ever touched these
                things, that he might be able to carry them off? Was this the reason why Caius
                Claudius Pulcher restored them, that Caius Verres might be able to steal them? But
                that Cupid had no wish for the house of a pimp and the establishment of a harlot; he
                was quite content to stay in that chapel where he was hereditary; he knew that he
                had been left to Heius by his ancestors, with the rest of the sacred things which he
                inherited; he did not require the heir of a prostitute. <milestone n="8"

                refuted by one word. &ldquo;I bought it,&rdquo; says he. O ye immortal gods,
                what a splendid defence! we sent a broker into the province with military command
                and with the forces, to buy up all the statues, all the paintings, all the silver
                plate and gold plate, and ivory, and jewels, and to leave nothing to any body. For
                this defence seems to me to be got ready for everything; that he bought them. In the

                them, since against all this class of accusations you are going to use this defence
                alone, I ask what sort of tribunals you thought that there would be at <placeName

                  conferred by a special law, and was limited, if not by the terms in which it was
                  conferred, at least by usage. It could not be held or exercised within the

              <p>Remark the care of our ancestors, who as yet suspected no such conduct as this, but
                yet provided against the things which might happen in affairs of small importance.
                They thought that no one who had gone as governor or as lieutenant into a province
                would be so insane as to buy silver, for that was given him out of the public fends;
                or raiment, for that was afforded him by the laws; they thought he might buy a
                slave, a thing which we all use, and which is not provided by the laws. They made a
                law, therefore, &ldquo;that no one should buy a slave except in the room of a

                What was the reason why they so carefully kept us from making purchases in the

                when the seller was not allowed to sell on his own terms. And they were aware that,
                in the provinces, if he who was there with the command and power <note
                  anchored="yes">The Latin word in each case is <foreign lang="la"
                    >potestas</foreign>. &ldquo;According to Paulus, <foreign lang="la"
                    >potestas</foreign>, as applied to a magistrate, is equivalent to <foreign

                  applied to magistrates who had not the <foreign lang="la">imperium</foreign> as,

                    >potestas</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">imperium</foreign> are often opposed

                  other Roman terms, had both a wider signification and a narrower one; in its wider
                  signification it might mean all the power that was delegated to any person by the
                  state, whatever might be the extent of that power; in its narrower signification,
                  it was on the one hand equivalent to <foreign lang="la">imperium</foreign> and on
                  the other, it expressed the power of these functionaries who had not the <foreign

                in any one's possession, and was allowed to do so, it would come to pass that he
                would get whatever he chose, whether it was to be sold or not, at whatever price he
                pleased. Some one will say, &ldquo;Do not deal with Verres in that manner; do
                not try and examine his actions by the standard of old-fashioned conscientiousness;
                allow him to have bought them without being punished for it, provided he bought them
                in a fair way, not through any arbitrary exercise of power, nor from any one against
                his will, or by violence.&rdquo; I will so deal with him. If Heius had anything
                for sale, if he sold it for the price at which he valued it, I give up inquiring why
                you bought it. <milestone n="6" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="11" unit="section"

              <p>What then are we to do? Are we to use arguments in a case of this sort? We must
                ask, I suppose, whether Heius was in debt, whether he had an auction,&mdash;if
                he had, whether he was in such difficulties about money matters, whether he was
                oppressed by such want, by such necessity, as to strip his private chapel, to sell
                his paternal gods. But I see that the man had no auction; that he never sold
                anything except the produce of his land; that he not only had no debts, but that he
                had always abundance of ready money. Even if all these things were contrary to what
                I say they were, still I say that he would not have sold things which had been so
                many years in the household and chapel of his ancestors. &ldquo;What will you
                say if he was persuaded by the greatness of the sum given him for them?&rdquo;
                It is not probable that a man, rich as he was, honourable as he was, should have
                preferred money to his own religious feelings and to the memorials of his ancestors.

                led away from their habits and principles by large sums of money.&rdquo; Let us

                riches, by no means covetous, away from decency, from affection, and from religion.
                You ordered him, I suppose, to enter in his account books, &ldquo;All these
                statues of Praxiteles, of Myron, of Polycletus, were sold to Verres for six thousand
                five hundred <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign>.&rdquo; Read the extracts
                from his accounts&mdash; [The accounts of Heius are read.] I am delighted that
                the illustrious names of these workmen, whom those men extol to the skies, have
                fallen so low in the estimation of Verres&mdash;the Cupid of Praxiteles for
                sixteen hundred <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign>. From that forsooth has come
                the proverb &ldquo;I had rather buy it than ask for it.&rdquo; <milestone
                  n="7" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="13" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>Some one will say, &ldquo;What! do you value those things at a very high
                price?&rdquo; But I am not valuing them according to any calculation of my own,
                or any need which I have for them; but I think that the matter ought to be looked at
                by you in this light,&mdash;what is the value of these things in the opinion of
                those men who are judges of these things; at what price they are accustomed to be
                sold; at what price these very things could be sold, if they were sold openly and
                freely; lastly, at what price Verres himself values them. For he would never have
                been so foolish, if he had thought that Cupid worth only four hundred <foreign
                  lang="la">denarii</foreign>, as to allow himself to be made a subject for the
                common conversation and general reproach of men. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>
                Who then of you all is ignorant at how great a price these things are valued? Have
                we not seen at an auction a brazen statue of no great size sold for a hundred and
                twenty thousand <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign>? What if I were to choose to
                name men who have bought similar things for no less a price, or even for a higher
                one? Can I not do so? In truth, the only limit to the valuation of such things is
                the desire which any one has for them, for it is difficult to set bounds to the
                price unless you first set bounds to the wish. I see then that Heius was neither led
                by his inclination, nor by any temporary difficulties, nor by the greatness of the
                sum given, to sell these statues; and that you, under the presence of purchase which
                you put forward, in reality seized and took away these things by force, through
                fear, by your power and authority, from that man, whom, along with the rest of our
                allies in that country, the Roman people had entrusted not only to your power, but
                also to your upright exercise of it. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> What can
                there be, judges, so desirable for me in making this charge, as that Heius should
                say this same thing? Nothing certainly; but let us not wish for what is difficult to
                be obtained. Heius is a Mamertine. The state of the Mamertines alone, by a common
                resolution, praises that man in the name of the city. To all the rest of the
                Sicilians he is an object of hatred; by the Mamertines alone is he liked. But of
                that deputation which has been sent to utter his praises, Heius is the chief man; in
                truth, he is the chief man of his city, and too much occupied in discharging the
                public duties imposed upon him to speak of his private injuries. <milestone n="16"
                  unit="section"/> Though I was aware of and had given weight to these
                considerations, still, O judges, I trusted myself to Heius. I produced him at the
                first pleading; and indeed I did it without any danger, for what answer could Heius
                give even if he turned out a dishonest man, and unlike himself? Could he say that
                these statues were at his house, and not with Verres? How could he say anything of
                that sort? If he were the basest of men, and were inclined to lie most shamelessly,
                he would say this; that he had had them for sale, and that he had sold them at the
                price he wanted for them. The man the most noble in all his city, who was especially
                anxious that you should have a high opinion of his conscientiousness and of his
                worth, says first, that he spoke in Verres's praise by the public authority of his
                city, because that commission had been given to him; secondly; that he had not had
                these things for sale, and that, if he had been allowed to do what he wished, he
                could never have been induced by any terms to sell those things which were in his
                private chapel, having been left to him and handed down to him from his ancestors.

                say; the assistant in your crimes, the witness of your lusts, the receiver of your
                booty and your thefts. For the most honourable man of that city is present, a deputy
                sent from his home on account of this very trial, the chief actor in the panegyric
                on you; who praises you by the public order of his city, for so he has been charged
                and commanded to do. Although you recollect, O judges, what he answered when he was
                asked about the ship; that it had been built by public labour, at the public
                expense, and that a Mamertine senator had been appointed by the public authority to
                superintend its building. Heius in his private capacity flees to you for aid, O
                judges; he avails himself of this law, the common fortress of our allies, by which
                this tribunal is established. Although there is a law for recovering money which has
                been unjustly extorted, he says that he does not seem to recover any money; which
                though it has been taken from him, he does not so much care about: but he says he
                does demand back from you the sacred images belonging to his ancestors, he does
                demand back from you his hereditary household god? <milestone n="18" unit="section"
                /> Have you any shame, O Verres? have you any religion? have you any fear, You have
                lived in Heius's house at <placeName key="tgn,7003897">Messana</placeName>; you saw
                him almost daily performing sacred rites in his private chapel before those gods. He
                is not influenced by money; he does not even ask to have those things restored which
                were merely ornaments. Keep the Canephorae; restore the images of the gods. And
                because he said this, because after a given time he, an ally and friend of the Roman
                people, addressed his complaints to you in a moderate tone, because he was very
                attentive to religious obligation not only while demanding back his paternal gods,
                but also in giving his evidence on oath; know that one of the deputies has been sent
                back to <placeName key="tgn,7003897">Messana</placeName>, that very man who
                superintended the building of that ship at the public expense, to demand from the
                senate that Heius should be condemned to an ignominious punishment. <milestone n="9"

              <p>O most insane of men, what did you think? that you should obtain what you
                requested? Did you not know how greatly he was esteemed by his fellow-citizens; how
                great his influence was considered? But suppose you had obtained your request;
                suppose that the Mamertines had passed any severe vote against Heius, what do you
                think would have been the authority of their panegyric, if they had decreed
                punishment to the man who it was notorious had given true evidence? Although, what
                sort of praise is that, when he who utters it, being questioned, is compelled to
                give answers injurious to him whom he is praising? What! are not those who are
                praising you, my witnesses? Heius is an encomiast of yours; he has done you the most
                serious injury. I will bring forward the rest; they will gladly be silent about all
                that they are allowed to suppress; they will say what they cannot help saying,
                unwillingly. Can they deny that a transport of the largest size was built for that
                man at <placeName key="tgn,7003897">Messana</placeName>? Let them deny it if they
                can. Can they deny that a Mamertine senator was appointed by the public authority to
                superintend the building of that ship? I wish they would deny it. There are other
                points also which I prefer reserving unmentioned at present, in order to give as
                little time as possible to them for planning and arranging their perjury. <milestone

                these men come to your relief with their authority, who neither ought to help you if
                they were able, nor could do so if they wished; on whom in their private capacity
                you have inflicted many injuries, and put many affronts, while in their city you
                have dishonoured many families for ever by your adulteries and crimes &ldquo;But
                you have been of public service to their city.&rdquo; Not without great injury

                  >Sicily</placeName>. They were bound to supply and they used to supply sixty
                thousand <foreign lang="la">modii</foreign> of wheat to the Roman people for
                payment; that was remitted by you of your own sole authority. The republic was
                injured because by your means its right of dominion over one city was disparaged;
                the Sicilians were injured, because this quantity was not deducted from the total
                amount of the corn to be provided by the island, but was only transferred to the
                cities of Centuripa and Halesa, whose inhabitants were exempt from that tax; and on
                them a greater burden was imposed than they were able to bear. <milestone n="21"
                  unit="section"/> It was your duty to require them to furnish a ship, in compliance
                with the treaty. You remitted it for three years. During all those years you never
                demanded one soldier. You acted as pirates are accustomed to act, who, though they
                are the common enemies of all men, still select some friends, whom they not only
                spare, but even enrich with their booty; and especially such as have a town in a
                convenient situation, where they often, and sometimes even necessarily, put in with
                their vessels. <milestone n="10" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>The town of Phaselis, which Publius Servilius took, had not been in former times a
                city of Cilicians and pirates. The Lycians, a Greek tribe, inhabited it; but because
                it was in such a situation as it was, and because it projected into the sea, so that
                pirates from <placeName key="tgn,7002470">Cilicia</placeName> often necessarily
                touched at it when departing on an expedition, and were also often borne thither on
                their retreats, the pirates connected that city with themselves; at first by
                commercial intercourse, and afterwards by a regular alliance. <milestone n="22"
                  unit="section"/> The city of the Mamertines was not formerly of bad character; it
                was even a city hostile to dishonest men, and detained the luggage of Caius Cato,
                the one who was consul But then what sort of a man was he? a most eminent and most
                influential man; who however, though he had been consul, was convicted. So Caius
                Cato, the grandson of two most illustrious men, Lucius Paullus and Marcus Cato, and
                the son of the sister of Publius Africanus; who, even when convicted, at a time when
                severe judgments were in the habit of being passed, found the damages to which he
                was liable only estimated at eighteen thousand <foreign lang="la"
                  >sesterces</foreign>; with this man, I say, the Mamertines were angry, who have
                often expended a greater sum than the damages in the action against Cato were laid
                at, in one banquet for Timarchides. <milestone n="23" unit="section"/> But this city
                was the Phaselis for that robber and pirate of <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName>. Hither everything was brought from all quarters; with them it
                was left; whatever required to be concealed, they kept separate and stored away. By
                their agency he contrived everything which he wished put on board ship privately,
                and exported secretly; and in their harbour he contrived to have a vessel of the
                largest size built for him to send to <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>
                loaded with plunder. In return for these services, he gave them immunity from all
                expense, all labour, all military service, in short, from everything. For three
                years they were the only people, not only in <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName>, but, according to my opinion, in the whole world at such a
                time, who enjoyed excuse, relief, freedom, and immunity from every sort of expense,
                and trouble, and office. <milestone n="24" unit="section"/> Hence arose that Verrean
                festival; hence it was that he ventured to order Sextus Cominius to be dragged
                before him at a banquet, at whom he attempted to throw a goblet, whom he ordered to
                be seized by the throat, and to be hurried from the banquet and thrown into a dark
                prison; hence came that cross, on which, in the sight of many men, he suspended a
                Roman citizen; that cross which he never ventured to erect anywhere except among
                that people, whom he had made sharers in all his crimes and robberies. <milestone

              <p>Do you, O Mamertines, dare to come to praise any one? By what authority? by that
                which you ought to have with the Senatorial order? by that which you ought to have
                with the Roman people? <milestone n="25" unit="section"/> Is there any city, not
                only in our provinces, but in the most distant nations, either so powerful, or so

                Senator of the Roman people to his house and to his home? An honour which is paid
                not only to the man, but in the first place to the Roman people, by whose indulgence
                we have risen to this order, and secondly to the authority of this order; and unless
                that is respected among our allies, where will be the name and dignity of the empire
                among foreign nations? The Mamertines did not give me any public
                invitation&mdash;when I say me, that is a trifle, but when they did not invite a
                Senator of the Roman people, they withheld an honour due not to the man but to his
                order. For to Tullius himself, the most splendid and magnificent house of Cnaeus
                Pompeius Basilicus was opened; with whom he would have lodged even if he had been
                invited by you. There was also the most honourable house of the Percennii, who are
                now also called Pompeius; where Lucius my brother lodged and was received by them
                with the greatest eagerness. A Senator of the Roman people, as far as depended on
                you as a body, lay in your town, and passed the night in the public streets. No
                other city ever did such a thing. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; say you, &ldquo;for
                you were instituting a prosecution against our friend.&rdquo; Will you put your
                own interpretation on what private business I have of my own, by diminishing the
                honour due to the Senate? <milestone n="26" unit="section"/> But I will make my
                complaint of this conduct, if ever the time comes that there is any discussion
                concerning you among that body, which, up to this time, has been affronted by no one
                but you. With what face have you presented yourself before the eyes of the Roman
                people? when you have not yet pulled down that cross, which is even now stained with
                the blood of a Roman citizen, which is fixed up in your city by the harbour, and
                have not thrown it into the sea and purified all that place, before you came to
                  <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and before this tribunal. On the
                territory of the Mamertines, connected with us by treaty, at peace with us, is that
                monument of your cruelty raised. Is not your city the only one where, when any one
                arrives at it from <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, he sees the cross
                of a Roman citizen before he sees any friend of the Roman people? which you are in

                  >Rhegium</placeName>, whose city you envy, and to your inhabitants, Roman citizens
                as they are, to make them think less of themselves, and be less inclined to despise
                you, when they see the privileges of our citizenship extinguished by such a

                stole from the wardrobe would be less notorious than what he had stolen from the
                private chapel. But how did he get it? I cannot relate it more plainly than Heius
                himself related it before you. When I asked, whether any other part of his property

                  lang="la">sesterces</foreign>, which you could easily sell for two hundred
                thousand? It was worth that, believe me. You would have been able to defend yourself
                if you had given that sum for it. No one would then have asked how much it was
                worth. If you could only prove that you had bought it, you could easily make your
                cause and your conduct appear reasonable to any one. But as it is, you have no way
                of getting out of your difficulty about the tapestry. What shall I say next?
                  <milestone n="29" unit="section"/> Did you take away by force some splendid
                harness, which is said to have belonged to King Hiero, from Philarchus of Centuripa,
                a wealthy and high-born man, or did you buy it of him? When I was in <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, this is what I heard from the Centuripans
                and from everybody else, for the case was very notorious; people said that you had
                taken away this harness from Philarchus of Centuripa, and other very beautiful
                harness from Aristus of <placeName key="perseus,Panormus">Panormus</placeName>, and
                a third set from Gratippus of Tyndarus. Indeed, if Philarchus had sold it to you,
                you would not, after the prosecution was instituted against you, have promised to
                restore it. But because you saw that many people knew of it, you thought that if you
                restored it to him, you would only have so much the less, but the original
                transaction would be proved against you nevertheless; and so you did not restore it.
                Philarchus said in his evidence, that when he became acquainted with this disease of
                yours, as your friends call it, he wished to conceal from you the knowledge of the
                existence of this harness; that when he was summoned by you, he said that he had not
                got any; and indeed, that he had removed them to another person's house, that they
                might not be found; but that your instinct was so great, that you saw them by the
                assistance of the very man in whose custody they were deposited; that then he could
                not deny that you had found him out, and so that the harness was taken from him
                against his will, and without any payment. <milestone n="13" unit="chapter"

              <p>Now, O judges, it is worth your while to know how he was accustomed to find and
                trace out all these things. There are two brothers, citizens of <placeName
                  key="perseus,Cibyra">Cibyra</placeName>, Tlepolemus and Hiero, one of whom, I
                believe, was accustomed to model in wax, the other was a painter. I fancy these men,
                as they had become suspected by their fellow-citizens of having plundered the temple
                of Apollo at <placeName key="perseus,Cibyra">Cibyra</placeName>, fearing a trial and
                the punishment of the law, had fled from their homes. As they had known that Verres
                was a great connoisseur of such works as theirs, at the time that he, as you learnt
                from the witnesses, came to <placeName key="perseus,Cibyra">Cibyra</placeName> with
                fictitious bills of exchange, they, when flying from their homes as exiles, came to
                him when he was in <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>. He has kept them
                with him ever since that time; and in the robberies he committed, and in the booty
                he acquired during his lieutenancy, he greatly availed himself of their assistance
                and their advice. <milestone n="31" unit="section"/> These are the men who were
                meant when Quintus Tadius made an entry in his books that he had given things by
                Verres's order to some Greek painters. They were already well known to, and had been
                thoroughly tried by him, when he took them with him into <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>. And when they arrived there, they scented
                cut and tracked everything in so marvellous a manner, (you might have thought they
                were bloodhounds,) that, wherever anything was they found it out by some means or
                other. Some things they found out by threatening, some by promising; this by means
                of slaves, that through freemen; one thing by a friend, another by an enemy.
                Whatever pleased them was sure to be lost. They whose plate was demanded had nothing
                else to hope, than that Tlepolemus and Hiero might not approve of it. <milestone
                  n="14" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="32" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>I will relate to you this fact, O judges, most truly. I recollect that Pamphilus of
                  <placeName key="tgn,7003850">Lilybaeum</placeName>, a connection of mine by ties
                of hospitality, and a personal friend of mine, a man of the highest birth, told me,
                that when that man had taken from him, by his absolute power, an ewer made by the
                hand of Boethus, of exquisite workmanship and great weight, he went home very sad in
                truth, and greatly agitated, because a vessel of that sort, which had been left to
                him by his father and his forefathers, and which he was accustomed to use on days of
                festival, and on the arrival of ancient friends, had been taken from him. While I
                was sitting at home, said he, in great indignation, up comes one of the slaves of
                Venus; he orders me immediately to bring to the praetor some embossed goblets. I was
                greatly vexed, said he; I had two; I order them both to be taken out of the closet,
                lest any worse thing should happen, and to be brought after me to the praetor's
                house. When I got there the praetor was asleep; the Cibyratic brothers were walking
                about, and when they saw me, they said, Pamphilus, where are the cups? I show them
                with great grief;&mdash;they praise them.&mdash;I begin to complain that I
                shall have nothing left of any value at all, if my cups too were taken away. Then
                they, when they see me vexed, say, What are you willing to give us to prevent these
                from being taken from you? To make my story short, I said that I would give six
                hundred <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign>. Meantime the praetor summons us; he
                asks for the cups. Then they began to say to the praetor, that they had thought from
                what they had heard, that Pamphilus's cups were of some value, but that they were
                miserable things, quite unworthy of Verres's having them among his plate. He said,
                he thought so too. <milestone n="33" unit="section"/> So Pamphilus saved his
                exquisite goblets. And indeed, before I heard this, though I knew that it was a very
                trifling sort of accomplishment to understand things of that sort, yet I used to
                wonder that he had any knowledge of them at all, as I knew that in nothing whatever
                had he any qualities like a man. <milestone n="15" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>But when I heard this, I then for the first time understood that that was the use
                of these two Cibyratic brothers; that in his robberies he used his own hands, but
                their eyes. But he was so covetous of that splendid reputation of being thought to
                be a judge of such matters, that lately, (just observe the man's madness,) after his
                case was adjourned, when he was already as good as condemned, and civilly dead, at
                the time of the games of the circus, when early in the morning the couches were
                spread in preparation for a banquet at the house of Lucius Sisenna, a man of the
                first consideration, and when the plate was all set out, and when, as was suited to
                the dignity of Lucius Sisenna, the house was full of honourable men, he came to the
                plate, and began in a leisurely way to examine and consider every separate piece.
                Some marveled at the folly of the man, who, while his trial was actually going on,
                was increasing the suspicion of that covetousness of which he was accused; others
                marveled at his insensibility, that any such things could come into his head, when
                the time for judgment in his cause was so near at hand, and when so many witnesses
                had spoken against him. But Sisenna's servants, who, I suppose, had heard the
                evidence which had been given against him, never took their eyes off him, and never
                departed out of reach of the plate. <milestone n="34" unit="section"/> It is the
                part of a sagacious judge, from small circumstances to form his opinion of every
                man's covetousness or incontinence. And will any one believe that this man when
                praetor, was able to keep either his covetousness or his hands from the plate of the
                Sicilians, when, though a defendant, and a defendant within two days of judgment, a
                man in reality, and in the opinion of all men as good as already condemned, he could
                not in a large assembly restrain himself from handling and examining the plate of
                Lucius Sisenna? <milestone n="16" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="35" unit="section"

              <p>But that my discourse may return to <placeName key="tgn,7003850"
                  >Lilybaeum</placeName>, from which I have made this digression, there is a man
                named Diocles, the son-in-law of Pamphilus, of that Pamphilus from whom the ewer was
                taken away, whose surname is Popillius. From this man he took away every article on
                his sideboard where his plate was set out. He may say, if he pleases, that he had
                bought them. In fact, in this case, by reason of the magnitude of the robbery, an
                entry of it, I imagine, has been made in the account-books. He ordered Timarchides
                to value the plate. How did he do it? At as low a price as any one ever valued any
                thing presented to an actor. Although I have been for some time acting foolishly in
                saying as much about your purchases, and in asking whether you bought the things,
                and how, and at what price you bought them, when I can settle all that by one word.
                Produce me a written list of what plate you acquired in the province of <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, from whom, and at what price you bought each
                article. <milestone n="36" unit="section"/> What will you do? Though I ought not to
                ask you for these accounts, for I ought to have your account-books and to produce
                them. But you say that you never kept any accounts of your expenses in these years.
                Make me out at least this one which I am asking for, the account of the plate, and I
                will not mind the rest at present. &ldquo;I have no writings of the sort; I
                cannot produce any accounts.&rdquo; What then is to be done? What do you think
                that these judges can do? Your house was full of most beautiful statues already,
                before your praetorship; many were placed in your villas, many were deposited with
                your friends; many were given and presented to other people; yet you have no
                accounts speaking of any single one having been bought. All the plate in <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> has been taken away. There is nothing left to
                any one that can be called his own. A scandalous defence is invented, that the
                praetor bought all that plate; and yet that cannot be proved by any accounts. If you
                do produce any accounts, still there is no entry in them how you have acquired what
                you have got. But of these years during which you say that you bought the greatest
                number of things, you produce no accounts at all. Must you not inevitably be,
                condemned, both by the accounts which you do, and by those which you do not produce?
                  <milestone n="17" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="37" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>You also took away at <placeName key="tgn,7003850">Lilybaeum</placeName> whatever
                silver vessels you chose from Marcus Caelius, a Roman knight, a most excellent young
                man. You did not hesitate to take away the whole furniture, of Caius Cacurius, a
                most active and accomplished man, and of the greatest influence in his city. You
                took away, with the knowledge of every body, a very large and very beautiful table
                of citron-wood from Quintus Lutatius Diodorus, who, owing to the kind exertion of
                his interest by Quintus Catulus, was made a Roman citizen by Lucius Sulla. I do not
                object to you that you stripped and plundered a most worthy imitator of yours in his
                whole character, Apollonius, the son of Nico, a citizen of <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003849">Drepanum</placeName>, who is now called Aulus Clodius, of all
                his exquisitely wrought silver plate;&mdash;I say nothing of that. For he does
                not think that any injury has been done to him, because you came to his assistance
                when he was a ruined man, with the rope round his neck, and shared with him the
                property belonging to their father, of which he had plundered his wards at Drepanum.
                I am even very glad if you took anything from him, and I say that nothing was ever
                better done by you. But it certainly was not right that the statue of Apollo should
                have been taken away from Lyso of <placeName key="tgn,7003850"
                >Lilybaeum</placeName>, I a most eminent man, with whom you had been staying as a
                guest. But you will say that you bought it&mdash;I know that&mdash;for six
                hundred <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign>. So I suppose: I know it, I say; I
                will produce the accounts; and yet that ought not to have been done. Will you say
                that the drinking vessels with emblems of <placeName key="tgn,7003850"
                  >Lilybaeum</placeName> on them were, bought from Heius, the minor to whom
                Marcellus is guardian, whom you had plundered of a large sum of money, or will you
                confess that they were taken by force? <milestone n="38" unit="section"/>
              </p>
              <p>But why do I enumerate all his ordinary iniquities in affairs of this sort, which
                appear to consist only in robberies committed by him, and in losses borne by those
                whom he plundered? Listen, if you please, O judges, to an action of such a sort as
                will prove to you clearly his extraordinary madness and frenzy, rather than any
                ordinary covetousness. <milestone n="18" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>There is a man of <placeName key="tgn,7005730">Melita</placeName>, called Diodorus,
                who has already given evidence before you. He has been now living at <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003850">Lilybaeum</placeName> many years; a man of great nobility at
                home, and of great credit and popularity with the people among whom he has settled,
                on account of his virtue. It is reported to Verres of this man that he has some
                exceedingly fine specimens of chased work; and among them two goblets called
                Thericlean, <note anchored="yes">&ldquo;Thericles was a potter in the time of
                  Aristophanes, who made earthenware vessels of a peculiar black clay. In subsequent
                  time, any goblets made in imitation of his, whether of wood, silver, or glass,
                  were called Thericlean.&rdquo;&mdash;Graevius.</note> made by the hand of
                mentor with the most exquisite skill. And when Verres heard of this, he was inflamed
                with such a desire, not only of beholding, but also of appropriating them, that he
                summoned Diodorus, and demanded them. He replied, as was natural for a man who took
                great pride in them, that he had not got them at <placeName key="tgn,7003850"
                  >Lilybaeum</placeName>; that he had left them at <placeName key="tgn,7005730"
                  >Melita</placeName>, in the house of a relation of his. <milestone n="39"
                  unit="section"/> On this he immediately sends men on whom he can rely to
                  <placeName key="tgn,7005730">Melita</placeName>; he writes to certain inhabitants
                of <placeName key="tgn,7005730">Melita</placeName> to search out those vessels for
                him; he desires Diodorus to give them letters to that relation of his&mdash;the
                time appeared to him endless till he could see those pieces of plate. Diodorus, a
                prudent and careful man, who wished to keep his own property, writes to his relation
                to make answer to those men who came from Verres, that he had sent the cups to
                  <placeName key="tgn,7003850">Lilybaeum</placeName> a few days before. In the
                meantime he himself leaves the place. He preferred leaving his home, to staying in
                it and losing that exquisitely wrought silver work. But when Verres heard of this,
                he was so agitated that he seemed to every one to be raving, and to be beyond all
                question mad. Because he could not steal the plate himself, he said that he had been
                robbed by Diodorus of some exquisitely wrought vessels; he poured out threats
                against the absent Diodorus; he used to roar out before people; sometimes he could
                not restrain his tears. We have heard in the mythology of Eriphyla being so covetous
                that when she had seen a necklace, made, I suppose, of gold and jewels, she was so
                excited by its beauty, that she betrayed her husband for the sake of it. His
                covetousness was similar; but in one respect more violent and more senseless,
                because she was desiring a thing which she had seen, while his wishes were excited
                not only by his eyes, but even by his ears. <milestone n="19" unit="chapter"
                  /><milestone n="40" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>He orders Diodorus to be sought for over the whole province. He had by this time
                struck his camp, packed up his baggage, and left <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName>. Verres, in order by some means or other to bring the man back
                to the province, devises this plan, if it is to be called a plan, and not rather a
                piece of madness. He sets up one of the men he calls his hounds, to say that he
                wishes to institute a prosecution against Diodorus of <placeName key="tgn,7005730"
                  >Melita</placeName> for a capital offence. At first all men wondered at such a
                thing being imputed to Diodorus, a most quiet man, and as far removed as any man
                from all suspicion, not only of crime, but of even the slightest irregularity. But
                it soon became evident, that all this was done for the sake of his silver. Verres
                does not hesitate to order the prosecution to be instituted; and that, I imagine,
                was the first instance of his allowing an accusation to be made against an absent
                man. <milestone n="41" unit="section"/> The matter was notorious over all <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, that men were prosecuted for capital
                offences because the praetor coveted their chased silver plate; and that
                prosecutions were instituted against them not only when they were present, but even
                in their absence. Diodorus goes to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>,
                and putting on mourning, calls on all his patrons and friends; relates the affair to
                every one. Earnest letters are written to Verres by his father, and by his friends,
                warning him to take care what he did, and what steps he took respecting Diodorus;
                that the matter was notorious and very unpopular; that he must be out of his senses;
                that this one charge would ruin him if he did not take care. At that time he
                considered his father, if not in the light of a parent, at least in that of a man.
                He had not yet sufficiently prepared himself for a trial; it was his first year in
                the province; he was not, as he was by the time of the affair of Sthenius, loaded
                with money. And so his frenzy was checked a little, not by shame, but by fear and
                alarm. He does not dare to condemn Diodorus; he takes his name out of the list of
                defendants while he is absent. In the meantime Diodorus, for nearly three years, as
                long as that man was praetor, was banished from the province and from his home.
                  <milestone n="42" unit="section"/> Every one else, not only Sicilians, but Roman
                citizens too, settled this in their minds, that, since he had carried his
                covetousness to such an extent, there was nothing which any one could expect to
                preserve or retain in his own possession if it was admired ever so little by Verres.
                  <milestone n="20" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>But after they understood that that brave man, Quintus Arrius, whom the province
                was eagerly looking for, was not his successor, they then settled that they could
                keep nothing so carefully shut up or hidden away, as not to be most open and visible
                to his covetousness. After that, he took away from an honourable and highly esteemed
                Roman knight, named Cnaeus Salidius, whose son he knew to be a senator of the Roman
                people and a judge, some beautiful silver horses which had belonged to Quintus
                Maximus. I did not mean to say this, O judges, for he bought those, he did not steal
                them; <milestone n="43" unit="section"/> I wish I had not mentioned them. Now he
                will boast, and have a fine ride on these horses. &ldquo;I bought them, I have
                paid the money for them.&rdquo; I have no doubt account books also will be
                produced. It is well worth while. Give me then the account-books. You are at liberty
                to get rid of this charge respecting Calidius, as long as I can get a sight of these
                accounts; still, if you had bought them, what ground had Calidius for complaining at
                  <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, that, though he had been living so
                many years in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> as a trader, you were
                the only person who had so despised and so insulted him, as to plunder him in common
                with all the rest of the Sicilians? what ground had he for declaring that he would
                demand his plate back again from you, if he had sold it to you of his own free will?
                Moreover, how could you avoid restoring it to Cnaeus Calidius; especially when he
                was such an intimate friend of Lucius Sisenna, your defender, and as you had
                restored their property to the other friends of Sisenna? <milestone n="44"
                  unit="section"/> Lastly, I do not suppose you will deny that by the intervention
                of Potamo, a friend of yours, you restored his plate to Lucius Cordius, an
                honourable man, but not more highly esteemed than Cnaeus Calidius; and it was he who
                made the cause of the rest more difficult to plead before you; for though you had
                promised many men to restore them their property, yet, after Cordius had stated in
                his evidence that you had restored him his, you desisted from making any more
                restorations, because you saw that you lost your plunder, and yet could not escape
                the evidence against you. Under all other praetors Cnaeus Calidius, a Roman knight,
                was allowed to have plate finely wrought; he was permitted to be able from his own
                stores to adorn and furnish a banquet handsomely, when he had invited a magistrate
                or any superior officer. Many men in power and authority have been with Cnaeus
                Calidius at his house; no one was ever found so mad as to take from him that
                admirable and splendid plate; no one was found bold enough to ask for it; no one
                impudent enough to beg him to sell it. <milestone n="45" unit="section"/> For it is
                an arrogant thing, an intolerable thing, O judges, for a praetor to say to an
                honourable, and rich, and well-appointed man in his province, &ldquo;Sell me
                those chased goblets.&rdquo; For it is saying, &ldquo;You do not deserve to
                have things which are so beautifully made; they are better suited to a man of my
                stamp.&rdquo; Are you, O Verres, more worthy than Calidius? whom (not to compare
                your way of life with his, for they are not to be compared, but) I will compare you
                with in respect of this very dignity owing to which you make yourself out his
                superior. You gave eighty thousand <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign> to
                canvassing agents to procure your election as praetor; you gave three hundred
                thousand to an accuser not to press hardly upon you: do you, on that account, look
                down upon and despise the equestrian order? Is it on that account that it seemed to
                you a scandalous thing that Calidius should have anything that you admired rather
                than that you should? <milestone n="21" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="46"
                  unit="section"/></p>
              <p>He has been long boasting of this transaction with Calidius, and telling every one
                that he bought the things. Did you also buy that censer of Lucius Papilius, a man of
                the highest reputation, wealth, and honour, and a Roman knight? who stated in his
                evidence that, when you had begged for it to look at, you returned it with the
                emblems torn off; so that you may understand that it is all taste in that man, not
                avarice; that it is the fine work that he covets, not the silver. Nor was this
                abstinence exercised only in the case of Papirius; he practiced exactly the same
                conduct with respect to every censer in <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName>; and it is quite incredible how many beautifully wrought
                censers there were. I imagine that, when <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName> was at the height of its power and opulence, there were
                extensive workshops in that island; for before that man went thither as praetor
                there was no house tolerably rich, in which there were not these things, even if
                there was no other silver plate besides; namely, a large dish with figures and
                images of the gods embossed on it, a goblet which the women used for sacred
                purposes, and a censer. And all these were antique, and executed with the most
                admirable skill, so that one may suspect everything else in <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> was on a similar scale of magnificence; but
                that though fortune had deprived them of much, those things were still preserved
                among them which were retained for purposes of religion. <milestone n="47"
                  unit="section"/> I said just now, O judges, that there were many censers, in
                almost every house in fact; I assert also, that now there is not even one left. What
                is the meaning of this? what monster, what prodigy did we send into the province?
                Does it not appear to you that he desired, when he returned to <placeName
                  key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, to satisfy not the covetousness of one man,
                not his own eyes only, but the insane passion of every covetous man, for as soon as
                he ever came into any city, immediately the Cibyratic hounds of his were slipped, to
                search and find cut everything. If they found any large vessel, any considerable
                work, they brought it to him with joy; if they could hunt out any smaller vessel of
                the same sort, they looked on those as a sort of lesser game, whether they were
                dishes, cups, censers, or anything else. What weepings of women, what lamentations
                do you suppose took place over these things? things which may perhaps seem
                insignificant to you, but which excite great and bitter indignation, especially
                among women, who grieve when those things are torn from their hands which they have
                been accustomed to use in religious ceremonies, which they have received from their
                ancestors, and which have always been in their family. <milestone n="22"

              <p>Do not now wait while I follow up this charge from door to door, and show you that
                he stole a goblet from Aeschylus, the Tyndaritan; a dish from another citizen of
                  <placeName key="perseus,Tyndaris">Tyndaris</placeName> named Thraso; a censer from
                Nymphodorus of <placeName key="tgn,7003808">Agrigentum</placeName>. When I produce
                my witnesses from <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> he may select whom
                he pleases for me to examine about dishes, goblets, and censers. Not only no town,
                no single house that is tolerably well off will be found to have been free from the
                injurious treatment of this man; who, even if he had come to a banquet, if he saw
                any finely wrought plate, could not, O judges, keep his hands from it. There is a
                man named Cnaeus Pompeius Philo, who was a native of <placeName
                  key="perseus,Tyndaris">Tyndaris</placeName>; he gave Verres a supper at his visa
                in the country near <placeName key="perseus,Tyndaris">Tyndaris</placeName>; he did
                what Sicilians did not dare to do, but what, because he was a citizen of <placeName
                  key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, he thought he could do with impunity, he put
                before him a dish on which were some exceedingly beautiful figures. Verres, the
                moment he saw it, determined to rob his host's table of that memorial of the Penates
                and of the gods of hospitality. But yet, in accordance with what I have said before
                of his great moderation, he restored the rest of the silver after he had torn off
                the figures; so free was he from all avarice! <milestone n="49" unit="section"/>
                What want you more? Did he not do the same thing to Eupolemus of Calacta, a noble
                man, connected with, and an intimate friend of the Luculli; a man who is now serving
                in the army under Lucius Lucullus? He was supping with him; the rest of the silver
                which he had set before him had no ornament on it, lest he himself should also be
                left without any ornament; but there were also two goblets, of no large size, but
                with figures on them. He, as if he had been a professional diner-out, who was not to
                go away without a present, on the spot, in the sight of all the other guests, tore
                off the figures. I do not attempt to enumerate all his exploits of this sort; it is
                neither necessary nor possible. I only produce to you tokens and samples of each
                description of his varied and universal rascality. Nor did he behave in these
                affairs as if he would some day or other be called to account for them, but
                altogether as if he was either never likely to be prosecuted, or else as if the more
                he stole, the less would be his danger when he was brought before the court;
                inasmuch as he did these things which I am speaking of not secretly, not by the
                instrumentality of friends or agents, but openly, from his high position, by his own
                power and authority. <milestone n="23" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="50"

              <p>When he had come to <placeName key="tgn,7003947">Catina</placeName>, a wealthy,
                honourable, influential city, he ordered Dionysiarchus the proagorus, that is to
                say, the chief magistrate, to be summoned before him; he openly orders him to take
                care that all the silver plate which was in anybody's house at <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003947">Catina</placeName>, was collected together and brought to him.
                Did you not hear Philarchus of Centuripa, a man of the highest position as to noble
                birth, and virtue, and riches, say the same thing on his oath; namely, that Verres
                had charged and commanded him to collect together, and order to be conveyed to him,
                all the silver plate at Centuripa, by far the largest and wealthiest city in all
                  <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>? In the same manner at <placeName
                  key="tgn,1043116">Agyrium</placeName>, all the Corinthian vessels there were
                there, in accordance with his command, were transported to <placeName
                  key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> by the agency of Apollodorus, whom you
                have heard as a witness. <milestone n="51" unit="section"/> But the most
                extraordinary conduct of all was this; when that painstaking and industrious praetor
                had arrived at Haluntium, he would not himself go up into the town, because the
                ascent was steep and difficult; but he ordered Archagathus of Haluntium, one of the
                noblest men, not merely in his own city, but in all <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName>, to be summoned before him, and gave him a chance to take care
                that all the chased silver that there was at Haluntium, and every specimen of
                Corinthian work too, should be at once taken down from the town to the seaside.
                Archagathus went up into the town. That noble man, as one who wished to be loved and
                esteemed by his fellow citizens, was very indignant at having such an office imposed
                upon him, and did not know what to do. He announces the commands he has received. He
                orders every one to produce what they had. There was great consternation, for the
                tyrant himself had not gone away to any distance; lying on a litter by the sea-side
                below the town, he was waiting for Archagathus and the silver plate. What a
                gathering of people do you suppose took place in the sown? what an uproar? what
                weeping of women? they who saw it would have said that the Trojan horse had been
                introduced, and that the city was taken. <milestone n="52" unit="section"/> Vessels
                were brought out without their cases; others were wrenched out of the hands of
                women; many people's doors were broken open, and their locks forced. For what else
                can you suppose? Even if ever, at a time of war and tumult, arms are demanded of
                private citizens, still men give them unwillingly, though they know that they are
                giving them for the common safety. Do not suppose then that any one produced his
                carved plate out of his house for another man to steal, without the greatest
                distress. Everything is brought down to the shore. The Cibyratic brothers are
                summoned; they condemn some articles; whatever they approve of has its figures in
                relief or its embossed emblems torn off. And so the Haluntines, having had all their
                ornaments wrenched off, returned home with the plain silver. <milestone n="24"

              <p>Was there ever, O judges, a dragnet of such a sort as this in that province? People
                have sometimes during their year of office diverted some part of the public property
                to their own use, in the most secret manner; sometimes they even secretly plundered
                some private citizen of something; and still they were condemned. And if you ask me,
                though I am detracting somewhat from my own credit by saying so, I think those were
                the real accusers, who traced the robberies of such men as this by scent, or by some
                lightly imprinted footsteps; for what is it that we are doing in respect of Verres,
                who has wallowed in the mud till we can find him out by the traces of his whole
                body? Is it a great undertaking to say anything against a man, who while he was
                passing by a place, having his litter put down to rest for a little time, plundered
                a whole city, house by house; without condescending to any pretences, openly, by his
                own authority, and by an absolute command? But still, that he might be able to say
                that he had bought them, he orders Archagathus to give those men, to whom the plate
                had belonged, some little money, just for form's sake. Archagathus found a few who
                would accept the money, and those he paid. And still Verres never paid Archagathus
                that money. Archagathus intended to claim it at <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
                  >Rome</placeName>; but Cnaeus Lentulus Marcellinus demanded him, as you heard him
                state himself. Read the evidence of Archagathus, and of Lentulus,&mdash;
                  <milestone n="54" unit="section"/> and that you may not imagine that the man
                wished to heap up such a mass of figures without any reason, just see at what rate
                he valued you, and the opinion of the Roman people, and the laws, and the courts of
                justice, and the Sicilian witnesses and traders. After he had collected such a vast
                number of figures that he had not left one single figure to anybody, he established
                an immense shop in the palace at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse"
                  >Syracuse</placeName>; he openly orders all the manufacturers, and carvers, and
                goldsmiths to be summoned&mdash;and he himself had many in his own employ; he
                collects a great multitude of men; he kept them employed uninterruptedly for eight
                months, though all that time no vessels were made of anything but gold. In that time
                he had so skillfully wrought the figures which he had torn off the goblets and
                censers, into golden goblets, or had so ingeniously joined them into golden cups,
                that you would say that they had been made for that very purpose; and he, the
                praetor, who says that it was owing to his vigilance that peace was maintained in
                  <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, was accustomed to sit in his

                who knew Lucius Piso, the father of this Lucius Piso, who was praetor. When he was
                praetor in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, in which province he was
                slain, somehow or other, while he was practicing his exercises in arms, the golden
                ring which he had was broken and crushed. As he wanted to get himself another ring,
                he ordered a goldsmith to be summoned into the forum before his throne of office, at
                  <placeName key="tgn,7002817">Corduba</placeName>, and openly weighed him out the
                gold. He ordered the man to set up his bench in the forum, and to make him a ring in
                the presence of every one. Perhaps in truth some may say that he was too exact, and
                to this extent any one who chooses may blame him, but no further. Still such conduct
                was allowable for him, for he was the son of Lucius Piso, of that man who first made
                the law about extortion and embezzlement. <milestone n="57" unit="section"/> It is
                quite ridiculous for me to speak of Verres now, when I have just been speaking of
                Piso the Thrifty; still, see what a difference there is between the men: that man,
                while he was making some sideboards full of golden vessels, did not care what his
                reputation was, not only in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, but
                also at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> in the court of justice; the
                other wished all <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName> to know to half an
                ounce how much gold it took to make a praetor's ring. Forsooth, as the one proved
                his right to his name, so did the other to his surname. <milestone n="26"

              <p>It is utterly impossible for me either to retain in my memory, or to embrace in my
                speech, all his exploits. I wish just to touch briefly on the different kinds of
                deeds, done by him, just as here the ring of Piso reminded me of what had otherwise
                entirely escaped my recollection. From how many honourable men do you imagine that
                that man tore the golden rings from off their fingers? He never hesitated to do so
                whenever he was pleased with either the jewels or the fashion of the ring belonging
                to any one. I am going to mention an incredible fact, but still one so notorious
                that I do not think that he himself will deny it. <milestone n="58" unit="section"/>
                When a letter had been brought to Valentius his interpreter from <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003808">Agrigentum</placeName>, by chance Verres himself noticed the
                impression on the seal; he was pleased with it, he asked where the letter came from;
                he was told, from <placeName key="tgn,7003808">Agrigentum</placeName>. He sent
                letters to the men with whom he was accustomed to communicate, ordering that ring to
                be brought to him as soon as possible. And accordingly, in compliance with his
                letter, it was torn off the finger of a master of a family, a certain Lucius Titius,
                a Roman citizen. But that covetousness of his is quite beyond belief. For as he
                wished to provide three hundred couches beautifully covered, with all other
                decorations for a banquet, for the different rooms which he has, not only at
                  <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, but in his different villas, he
                collected such a number, that there was no wealthy house in all <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> where he did not set up an embroiderer's

              <p> There is a woman, a citizen of Segesta, very rich, and nobly born, by name
                  <placeName key="perseus,Lamia">Lamia</placeName>. She, having her house full of
                spinning jennies, for three years was making him robes and coverlets, all dyed with

                Lyso at <placeName key="tgn,7003850">Lilybaeum</placeName>; Critolaus at <placeName

                  >Syracuse</placeName> Aeschrio, Cleomenes, and Theomnastus; at Elorum Archonides
                and Megistus. My voice will fail me before the names of the men whom he employed in
                this way will; he himself supplied the purple&mdash;his friends supplied only
                the work, I dare say; for I have no wish to accuse him in every particular, as if it
                were not enough for me, with a view to accuse him, that he should have had so much
                to give, that he should have wished to carry away so many things; and, besides all
                that, this thing which he admits, namely, that he should have employed the work of
                his friends in affairs of this sort. <milestone n="60" unit="section"/> But now do
                you suppose that brazen couches and brazen candelabra were made at Syracuse for any
                one but for him the whole of that three years? He bought them, I suppose; but I am
                informing you so fully, O judges, of what that man did in his province as praetor,
                that he may not by chance appear to any one to have been careless, and not to have

              <p>I come now, not to a theft, not to avarice, not to covetousness, but to an action
                of that sort that every kind of wickedness seems to be contained in it, and to be in
                it; by which the immortal gods were insulted, the reputation and authority of the
                name of the Roman people was impaired, hospitality was betrayed and plundered, all
                the kings who were most friendly to us, and the nations which are under their rule
                and dominion, were alienated from us by his wickedness. <milestone n="61"
                  unit="section"/> For you know that the kings of <placeName key="tgn,1000140"
                  >Syria</placeName>, the boyish sons of King Antiochus, have lately been at
                  <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. And they came not on account of
                the kingdom of <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>; for that they had
                obtained possession of without dispute, as they had received it from their father
                and their ancestors; but they thought that the kingdom of <placeName
                  key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> belonged to them and to Selene their mother.
                When they, being hindered by the critical state of the republic at that time, were
                not able to obtain the discussion of the subject as they wished before the senate,
                they departed for <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>, their paternal
                kingdom. One of them&mdash;the one whose name is Antiochus&mdash;wished to
                make his journey through <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>. And so,
                while Verres was praetor, he came to <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse"
                  >Syracuse</placeName>. <milestone n="62" unit="section"/> On this Verres thought
                that an inheritance had come to him, because a man whom he had heard, and on other
                accounts suspected had many splendid things with him, had come into his kingdom and
                into his power. He sends him presents&mdash;liberal enough&mdash;for all
                domestic uses; as much wine and oil as he thought fit; and as much wheat as he could
                want, out of his tenths. After that he invites the king himself to supper. He
                decorates a couch abundantly and magnificently. He sets out the numerous, and
                beautiful silver vessels, in which he was so rich; for he had not yet made all those
                golden ones. He takes care that the banquet shall be splendidly appointed and
                provided in every particular. Why need I make a long story of it? The king departed
                thinking that Verres was superbly provided with everything, and that he himself had
                been magnificently treated. After that, he himself invites the praetor to supper. He
                displays all his treasures; much silver, also not a few goblets of gold, which, as
                is the custom of kings, and especially in <placeName key="tgn,1000140"
                  >Syria</placeName>, were studded all over with most splendid jewels. There was
                also a vessel for wine, a ladle hollowed out of one single large precious stone,
                with a golden handle, concerning which, I think, you heard Quintus Minutius speak, a
                sufficiently capable judge, and sufficiently credible witness. <milestone n="63"
                  unit="section"/> Verres took each separate piece of plate into his hands, praised
                it&mdash;admired it. The king was delighted that that banquet was tolerably
                pleasant and agreeable to a praetor of the Roman people. After the banquet was over,
                Verres thought of nothing else, as the facts themselves showed, than how he might
                plunder and strip the king of everything before he departed from the province. He
                sends to ask for the most exquisite of the vessels which he had seen at Antiochus's
                lodgings. He said that he wished to show them to his engravers. The king, who did
                not know the man, most willingly sent them, without any suspicion of his intention.
                He sends also to borrow the jeweled ladle. He said that he wished to examine it more
                attentively; that also is sent to him. <milestone n="28" unit="chapter"/><milestone

              <p>Now, O judges, mark what followed; things which you have already heard, and which
                the Roman people will not hear now for the first time, and which have been reported
                abroad among foreign nations to the furthest corners of the earth. The kings, whom I
                have spoken of, had brought to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> a
                candelabrum of the finest jewels, made with most extraordinary skill, in order to
                place it in the Capitol; but as they found that temple not yet finished, they could
                not place it there. Nor were they willing to display it and produce it in common, in
                order that it might seem more splendid when it was placed at its proper time in the
                shrine of the great and good <persName><surname>Jupiter</surname></persName>; and
                brighter; also, as its beauty would come fresh and untarnished before the eyes of
                men. They determined, therefore, to take it back with them into <placeName
                  key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>, with the intention, when they should hear
                that the image of the great and good <persName><surname>Jupiter</surname></persName> was dedicated, of sending ambassadors who should bring that
                exquisite and most beautiful present, with other offerings, to the Capitol.
                  <milestone n="65" unit="section"/> The matter, I know not how, got to his ears.
                For the king had wished it kept entirely concealed; not because he feared or
                suspected anything, but because he did not wish many to feast their eyes on it
                before the Roman people. He begs the king, and entreats him most earnestly to send
                it to him; he says that he longs to look at it himself, and that he will not allow
                any one else to see it. Antiochus, being both of a childlike and royal disposition,
                suspected nothing of that man's dishonesty, and orders his servants to take it as
                secretly as possible, and well wrapped up, to the praetor's house. And when they
                brought it there, and placed it on a table, having taken off the coverings, Verres
                began to exclaim that it was a thing worthy of the kingdom of <placeName
                  key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>, worthy of being a royal present, worthy of
                the Capitol. In truth, it was of such splendour as a thing must be which is made of
                the most brilliant and beautiful jewels; of such variety of pattern that the skill
                of the workmanship seemed to vie with the richness of the materials; and of such a
                size that it might easily be seen that it had been made not for the furniture of
                men, but for the decoration of a most noble temple. And when he appeared to have
                examined it sufficiently, the servants begin to take it up to carry it back again.
                He says that he wishes to examine it over and over again; that he is not half
                satiated with the sight of it; he orders them to depart and to leave the
                candelabrum. So they then return to Antiochus empty-handed. <milestone n="29"
                  unit="chapter"/><milestone n="66" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>The king at first feared nothing, suspected nothing. One day passed&mdash;two
                days&mdash;many days. It was not brought back. Then the king sends to Verres to
                beg him to return it, if he will be so good. He bids the slaves come again. The king
                begins to think it strange. He sends a second time. It is not returned. He himself
                calls on the man; he begs him to restore it to him. Think of the face and marvellous
                impudence of the man. That thing which he knew, and which he had heard from the king
                himself was to be placed in the Capitol, which he knew was being kept for the great
                and good <persName><surname>Jupiter</surname></persName>, and for the Roman people,
                that he began to ask and entreat earnestly to have given to him. When the king said
                that he was prevented from complying by the reverence due to Jupiter Capitolinus,
                and by his regard for the opinion of men, because many nations were witnesses to the
                fact of the candelabrum having been made for a present to the god, the fellow began
                to threaten him most violently. When he sees that he is no more influenced by
                threats than he had been by prayers, on a sadden he orders him to leave his province
                before night. He says, that he has found out that pirates from his kingdom were
                coming against <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>. <milestone n="67"

                suppose I am bringing forward a charge about which there is any obscurity, or
                imagining anything which rests on mere suspicion,) weeping, and calling gods and men
                to witness, began to cry out that Caius Verres had taken from him a candelabrum made
                of jewels, which he was about to send to the Capitol, and which he wished to be in
                that most splendid temple as a memorial to the Roman people of his alliance with and
                friendship for them. He said that he did not care about the other works made of gold
                and jewels belonging to him which were in Verres's hands, but that it was a
                miserable and scandalous thing for this to be taken from him. And that, although it
                had long ago been consecrated in the minds and intentions of himself and his
                brother, still, that he then, before that assembled body of Roman citizens, offered,
                and gave, and dedicated, and consecrated it to the great and good <persName><surname>Jupiter</surname></persName>, and that he invoked <persName><surname>Jupiter</surname></persName> himself as a witness of his intention and of

              <p>What voice, what lungs, what power of mine can adequately express the indignation

                ancient and honourable sovereigns, had been our firmest friends; though he himself
                is monarch of a most opulent and extensive kingdom, is turned headlong out of a
                province of the Roman people. <milestone n="68" unit="section"/> How do you suppose
                that foreign nations will take this? How do you suppose the news of this exploit of
                yours will be received in the dominions of other kings, and in the most distant
                countries of the world, when they hear that a king has been insulted by a praetor of
                the Roman people in his province? that a guest of the Roman people has been
                plundered? a friend and ally of the Roman people insultingly driven out? Know that
                your name and that of the Roman people will be an object of hatred and detestation
                to foreign nations. If this unheard-of insolence of Verres is to pass unpunished,
                all men will think, especially as the reputation of our men for avarice and
                covetousness has been very extensively spread, that this is not his crime only, but
                that of those who have approved of it. Many kings, many free cities, many opulent
                and powerful private men, cherish intentions of ornamenting the Capitol in such a
                way as the dignity of the temple and the reputation of our empire requires. And if
                they understand that you show a proper indignation at this kingly present being
                intercepted, they will then think that their zeal and their presents will be
                acceptable to you and to the Roman people. But if they hear that you have been
                indifferent to the complaint of so great a king, in so remarkable a case, in one of
                such bitter injustice, they will not be so crazy as to spend their time, and labour,
                and expense on things which they do not think will be acceptable to you. <milestone

                follow it up; to reclaim the candelabrum, and to prosecute this cause. So that I do
                not doubt what ought to be your feelings as judge in this prosecution, when before
                any one else as judge you ought to be a much more vehement advocate and accuser than

              <p>And to you, O judges, what can appear more scandalous or more intolerable than
                this? Shall Verres have at his own house a candelabrum, made of jewels and gold,
                belonging to the great and good <persName><surname>Jupiter</surname></persName>?
                Shall that ornament be set out in his house at banquets which will be one scene of
                adultery and debauchery, with the brilliancy of which the temple of the great and
                good <persName><surname>Jupiter</surname></persName> ought to glow and to be
                lighted up? Shall the decorations of the Capitol be placed in the house of that most
                infamous debauchee with the other ornaments which he has inherited from Chelidon?
                What do you suppose will ever be considered sacred or holy by him, when he does not
                now think himself liable to punishment for such enormous wickedness? who dares to
                come into this court of justice, where he cannot, like all others who are arraigned,
                pray to the great and good <persName><surname>Jupiter</surname></persName>, and
                entreat help from him? from whom even the immortal gods are reclaiming their
                property, before that tribunal which was appointed for the benefit of men, that they
                might recover what had been extorted unjustly from them? Do we marvel that Minerva

                by a king. <milestone n="72" unit="section"/> And, accordingly, after he had once

                himself in his province for three years in such a manner that war was thought to

              <p>Segesta is a very ancient town in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>,
                O judges, which its inhabitants assert was founded by Aeneas when he was flying from
                  <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> and coming to this country. And
                accordingly the Segestans think that they are connected with the Roman people, not
                only by a perpetual alliance and friendship, but even by some relationship. This
                town, as the state of the Segestans was at war with the Carthaginians on its own
                account and of its own accord, was formerly stormed and destroyed by the
                Carthaginians; and everything which could be any ornament to the city was
                transported from thence to <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>.
                There was among the Segestans a statue of Diana, of brass, not only invested with
                the most sacred character, but also wrought with the most exquisite skill and
                beauty. When transferred to <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>,
                it only changed its situation and its worshippers; it retained its former sanctity.
                For on account of its eminent beauty it seemed, even to their enemies, worthy of
                being most religiously worshipped. <milestone n="73" unit="section"/> Some ages
                afterwards, Publius Scipio took <placeName key="perseus,Carthage"
                  >Carthage</placeName>, in the third Punic war; after which victory, (remark the
                virtue and carefulness of the man, so that you may both rejoice at your national
                examples of most eminent virtue, and may also judge tire incredible audacity of
                Verres worthy of the greater hatred by contrasting it with that virtue,) he summoned
                all the Sicilians, because he knew that during a long period of time <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> had repeatedly been ravaged by the
                Carthaginians, and bids them seek for all they had lost, and promises them to take
                the greatest pains to ensure the restoration to the different cities of everything
                which had belonged to them. Then those things which had formerly been removed from
                Himera, and which I have mentioned before, were restored to the people of Thermae;
                some things were restored to the Gelans, some to the Agrigentines; among which was
                that noble bull, which that most cruel of all tyrants, Phalaris, is said to have
                had, into which he was accustomed to put men for punishment, and to put fire under.
                And when Scipio restored that bull to the Agrigentines, he is reported to have said,
                that he thought it reasonable for them to consider whether it was more advantageous
                to the Sicilians to be subject to their own princes, or to be under the dominion of
                the Roman people, when they had the same thing as a monument of the cruelty of their
                domestic masters, and of our liberality. <milestone n="34" unit="chapter"
                  /><milestone n="74" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>At that time the same Diana of which I am speaking is restored with the greatest
                care to the Segestans. It is taken back to <placeName key="perseus,Segesta"
                  >Segesta</placeName>; it is replaced in its ancient situation, to the greatest joy
                and delight of all the citizens. It was placed at Segesta on a very lofty pedestal,
                on which was cut in large letters the name of Publius Africanus; and a statement was
                also engraved that &ldquo;he had restored it after having taken <placeName
                  key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>.&rdquo; It was worshipped by the
                citizens; it was visited by all strangers; when I was quaestor it was the very first
                thing, they showed me. It was a very large and tall statue with a flowing robe, but
                in spite of its large size it gave the idea of the age and dress of a virgin; her
                arrows hung from her shoulder, in her left hand she carried her bow, her right hand
                held a burning torch. <milestone n="75" unit="section"/> When that enemy of all
                sacred things, that violator of all religious scruples saw it, he began to burn with
                covetousness and insanity, as if he himself had been struck with that torch. He
                commands the magistrates to take the statue down and give it to him; and declares to
                them that nothing can be more agreeable to him. But they said that it was impossible
                for them to do so; that they were prevented from doing so, not only by the most
                extreme religious reverence, but also by the greatest respect for their own laws and
                courts of justice. Then he began to entreat this favour of them, then to threaten
                them, then to try and excite their hopes, then to arouse their fears. They opposed
                to his demands the name of Africanus; they said that it was the gift of the Roman
                people; that they themselves had no right over a thing which a most illustrious
                general, having taken a city of the enemy, had chosen to stand there as a monument
                of the victory of the Roman people. <milestone n="76" unit="section"/> As he did not
                relax in his demand, but urged it every day with daily increasing earnestness, the
                matter was brought before their senate. His demand raises a violent outcry on all
                sides. And so at that time, and at his first arrival at <placeName
                  key="perseus,Segesta">Segesta</placeName>, it is refused. Afterwards, whatever
                burdens could be imposed on any city in respect of exacting sailors and rowers, or
                in levying corn, he imposed on the Segestans beyond all other cities, and a good
                deal more than they could bear. Besides that, he used to summon their magistrates
                before him; he used to send for all the most noble and most virtuous of the
                citizens, to hurry them about with him to all the courts of justice in the province,
                to threaten every one of them separately to be the ruin of him, and to announce to
                them all in a body that he would utterly destroy their city. Therefore, at last, the
                Segestans, subdued by much ill-treatment and by great fear, resolved to obey the
                command of the praetor. With great grief and lamentation on the part of the whole
                city, with many tears and wailings on the part of all the men and women, a contract
                is advertised for taking down the statue of Diana. <milestone n="35" unit="chapter"
                  /><milestone n="77" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>See now with what religious reverence it is regarded. Know, O judges, that among
                all the Segestans none was found, whether free man or slave, whether citizen or
                foreigner, to dare to touch that statue. Know that some barbarian workmen were
                brought from <placeName key="tgn,7003850">Lilybaeum</placeName>; they at length,
                ignorant of the whole business, and of the religious character of the image, agreed
                to take it down for a sum of money, and took it down. And when it was being taken
                out of the city, how great was the concourse of women! how great was the weeping of
                the old men! some of whom even recollected that day when that same Diana being
                brought back to Segesta from <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>,
                had announced to them, by its return, the victory of the Roman people. How different
                from that time did this day seem! then the general of the Roman people, a most
                illustrious man, was bringing back to the Segestans the gods of their fathers,
                recovered from an enemy's city; now a most base and profligate praetor of the same
                Roman people, was taking away, with the most nefarious wickedness, those very same
                gods from a city of his allies. What is more notorious throughout all <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> than that all the matrons and virgins of
                Segesta came together when Diana was being taken out of their city? that they
                anointed her with precious unguents? that they crowned her with chaplets and
                flowers? that they attended her to the borders of their territory with frankincense
                and burning perfumes? <milestone n="78" unit="section"/> If at the time you, by
                reason of your covetousness and audacity, did not, while in command, fear these
                religious feelings of the population, do you not fear them now, at a time of such
                peril to yourself and to your children? What man, against the will of the immortal
                gods, or what god, when you so trample on all the religious reverence due to them,
                do you think will come to your assistance? Has that Diana inspired you, while in
                quiet and at leisure, with no religious awe;&mdash;she, who though she had seen
                two cities, in which she was placed stormed and burnt, was yet twice preserved from
                the flames and weapons of two wars; she who, though she changed her situation owing
                to the victory of the Carthaginians, yet did not lose her holy character; and who,
                by the valour of Publius Africanus afterwards recovered her old worship, together
                with her old situation? And when this crime had been executed, as the pedestal was
                empty, and the name of Publius Africanus carved on it, the affair appeared
                scandalous and intolerable to every one, that not only was religion trampled on, but
                also that Caius Verres had taken away the glory of the exploits, the memorial of the
                virtues, the monument of the victory of Publius Africanus, that most gallant of men.
                  <milestone n="79" unit="section"/> But when he was told afterwards of the pedestal
                and the inscription, he thought that men would forget the whole affair, if he took
                away the pedestal to which was serving as a sort of signpost to point out his crime.
                And so, by his command, the Segestans contracted to take away the pedestal too; and
                the terms of that contract were read to you from the public registers of the
                Segestans, at the former pleading. <milestone n="36" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>Now, O Publius Scipio, I appeal to you; to you, I say, a most virtuous and
                accomplished youth; from you I request and demand that assistance which is due to
                your family and to your name. Why do you take the part of that man who has embezzled
                the credit and honour of your family? Why do you wish him to be defended? Why am I
                undertaking what is properly your business? Why am I supporting a burden which ought
                to fall on you?&mdash;Marcus Tullius is reclaiming the monuments of Publius
                Africanus; Publius Scipio is defending the man who took them away. Though it is a
                principle handed down to us from our ancestors, for every one to defend the
                monuments of his ancestors, in such a way as not even to allow them to be decorated
                by one of another name, will you take the part of that man who is not charged merely
                with having in some degree spoilt the view of the monuments of Publius Scipio, but
                who has entirely removed and destroyed them? <milestone n="80" unit="section"/> Who
                then, in the name of the immortal gods, will defend the memory of Publius Scipio now
                that he is dead? who will defend the memorials and evidences of his valour, if you
                desert and abandon them; and not only allow them to be plundered and taken away, but
                even defend their plunderer and destroyer? The Segestans are present, your clients,
                the allies and friends of the Roman people. They inform you that Publius Africanus,
                when he had destroyed <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>,
                restored the image of Diana to their ancestors; and that was set up among the
                Segestans arid dedicated in the name of that general;&mdash;that Verres has had
                it taken down and carried away, and as far as that is concerned, has utterly effaced
                and extinguished the name of Publius Scipio. They entreat and pray you to restore
                the object of their worship to them, its proper credit and glory to your own family,
                so enabling them by your assistance to recover from the house of a robber, what they
                recovered from the city of their enemies by the beneficence of Publius Africanus.
                  <milestone n="37" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>What can you reply to them with honour, or what can they do but implore the aid of
                you and your good faith? They are present, they do implore it. You, O Publius, can
                protect the honour of your family renown; you can, you have every advantage which
                either fortune or nature ever gives to men. I do not wish to anticipate you in
                gathering the fruit that belongs to you; I am not covetous of the glory which ought
                to belong to another. It does not correspond to the modesty of my disposition, while
                Publius Scipio, a most promising young man, is alive and well, to put myself forward
                as the defender and advocate of the memorials of Publius Scipio. <milestone n="81"
                  unit="section"/> Wherefore, if you will undertake the advocacy of your family
                renown, it will behoove me not only to be silent about your monuments, but even to
                be glad that the fortune of Publius Africanus, though dead, is such, that his honour
                is defended by those who are of the same family as himself, and that it requires no
                adventitious assistance. But if your friendship with that man is an obstacle to
                you,&mdash;if you think that this thing which I demand of you is not so
                intimately connected with your duty,&mdash;then I, as your <foreign lang="la"
                  >locum tenens</foreign>, will succeed to your office, I will undertake that
                business which I have thought not to belong to me. Let that proud aristocracy give
                up complaining that the Roman people willingly gives, and at all times has given,
                honours to new and diligent men. It is a foolish complaint that virtue should be of
                the greatest influence in that city which by its virtue governs all nations. Let the
                image of Publius Africanus be in the houses of other men; let heroes now dead be
                adorned with virtue and glory. He was such a man, he deserved so well of the Roman
                people, that he deserves to be recommended to the affection, not of one single
                family, but of the whole state. And so it partly does belong to me also to defend
                his honours with all my power, because I belong to that city which he rendered
                great, and illustrious, and renowned; and especially, because I practice, to the
                utmost of my power, those virtues in which he was preeminent,&mdash;equity,
                industry, temperance, the protection of the unhappy, and hatred of the dishonest; a
                relationship in pursuits and habits which is almost as important as that of which
                you boast, the relationship of name and family. <milestone n="38" unit="chapter"
                  /><milestone n="82" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>I reclaim from you, O Verres, the monument of Publius Africanus; I abandon the
                cause of the Sicilians, which I undertook; let there be no trial of you for
                extortion at present; never mind the injuries of the Segestans; let the pedestal of
                Publius Africanus be restored; let the name of that invincible commander be engraved
                on it anew; let that most beautiful statue, which was recovered when <placeName
                  key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> was taken, be replaced. It is not I,
                the defender of the Sicilians,&mdash;it is not I, your
                prosecutor,&mdash;they are not the Segestans who demand this of you; but he who
                has taken on himself the defence and the preservation of the renown and glory of
                Publius Africanus. I am not afraid of not being able to give a good account of my
                performance of this duty to Publius Servilius the judge; who, as he has performed
                great exploits, and raised very many monuments of his good deeds, and has a natural
                anxiety about them, will be glad, forsooth, to leave them an object of care and
                protection not only to his own posterity, but to all brave men and good citizens;
                and not as a mark for the plunder of rogues. I am not afraid of its displeasing you,
                O Quintus Catulus, to whom the most superb and splendid monument in the whole world
                belongs, that there should be as many guardians of such monuments as possible, or

                another. <milestone n="83" unit="section"/> And indeed I am so far moved by the
                other robberies and atrocities of that fellow, as to think them worthy of great
                reproof; but that might be sufficient for them. But in this instance I am roused to
                such indignation, that nothing appears to me possible to be more scandalous or more
                intolerable. Shall Verres adorn his house, full of adultery, full of debauchery,
                full of infamy, with the monuments of Africanus? Shall Verres face the memorial of
                that most temperate and religious man, the image of the ever virgin Diana, in that
                house in which the iniquities of harlots and pimps are incessantly being practised?

              <p>But is this the only monument of Africanus which you have violated? What! did you
                take away from the people of <placeName key="perseus,Tyndaris">Tyndaris</placeName>
                an image of Mercury most beautifully made, and placed there by the beneficence of
                the same Scipio? And how? O ye immortal gods! How audaciously, how infamously, how
                shamelessly did you do so! You have lately, judges, heard the deputies from
                  <placeName key="perseus,Tyndaris">Tyndaris</placeName>, most honourable men, and
                the chief men of that city, say that the Mercury, which in their sacred
                anniversaries was worshipped among them with the extremest religious reverence,
                which Publius Africanus, after he had taken <placeName key="perseus,Carthage"
                  >Carthage</placeName>, had given to the Tyndaritans, not only as a monument of his
                victory, but as a memorial and evidence of their loyalty to and alliance with the
                Roman people, had been taken away by the violence, and wickedness, and arbitrary
                power of this man; who, when he first came to their city, in a moment, as if it were
                not only a becoming, but an indispensable thing to be done?&mdash;as if the
                senate had ordered it and the Roman people had sanctioned it,&mdash;in a moment,
                I say, ordered them to take the statue down and to transport it to <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003897">Messana</placeName>. <milestone n="85" unit="section"/> And as
                this appeared a scandalous thing to those who were present and who heard it, it was
                not persevered in by him during the first period of his visit; but when he departed,
                he ordered Sopater, their chief magistrate, whose statement you have heard, to take
                it down. When he refused, he threatened him violently; and then he left the city.
                The magistrate refers the matter to the senate; there is a violent outcry on all
                sides. To make my story short, some time afterwards he comes to that city again.
                Immediately he asks about the statue. He is answered that the senate will not allow
                it to be removed; that capital punishment is threatened to any one who should touch
                it without the orders of the senate: the impiety of removing is also urged. Then
                says he, &ldquo;What do you mean by talking to me of impiety? or about
                punishment? or about the senate? I will not leave you alive; you shall be scourged
                to death if the statue is not given up.&rdquo; Sopater with tears reports the
                matter to the senate a second time, and relates to them the covetousness and the
                threats of Verres. The senate gives Sopater no answer, but breaks up in agitation
                and perplexity. Sopater, being summoned by the praetor's messenger, informs him of
                the state of the case, and says that it is absolutely impossible. <milestone n="40"
                  unit="chapter"/><milestone n="86" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>And all these things (for I do not think that I ought to omit any particular of his
                impudence) were done openly in the middle of the assembly, while Verres was sitting
                on his chair of office, in a lofty situation. It was the depth of winter; the
                weather, as you heard Sopater himself state, was bitterly cold; heavy rain was
                falling; when that fellow orders the lictors to throw Sopater headlong down from the
                portico on which he himself was sitting, and to strip him naked. The command was
                scarcely, out of his mouth, before you might have seen him stripped and surrounded
                by the lictors. All thought that the unhappy and innocent man was going to be
                scourged. They were mistaken. Do you think that Verres would scourge without any
                reason an ally and friend of the Roman people? He is not so wicked. All vices are
                not to be found in that man; he was never cruel. He treated the man with great
                gentleness and clemency. In the middle of the forum there are some statues of the
                Marcelli, as there are in most of the other towns of <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName>; out of these he selected the statue of Caius Marcellus, whose
                services to that city and to the whole province were most recent and most important.
                On that statue he orders Sopater, a man of noble birth in his city, and at that very
                time invested with the chief magistracy, to be placed astride and bound to it.
                  <milestone n="87" unit="section"/> What torture he suffered when he was bound
                naked in the open air, in the rain and in the cold, must be manifest to every body.
                Nor did he put an end to this insult and barbarity, till the people and the whole
                multitude, moved by the atrocity of his conduct and by pity for his victim,
                compelled the senate by their outcries to promise him that statue of Mercury. They
                cried out that the immortal gods themselves would avenge the act, and that in the
                meantime it was not fit that an innocent man should be murdered. Then the senate
                comes to him in a body, and promises him the statue. And so Sopater is taken down
                scarcely alive from the statue of Marcellus, to which he had almost become frozen. I
                cannot adequately accuse that man if I were to wish to do so; it requires not only
                genius, but an extraordinary amount of skill. <milestone n="41" unit="chapter"
                  /><milestone n="88" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>This appears to be a single crime, this of the Tyndaritan Mercury, and it is
                brought forward by me as a single one; but there are many crimes contained in
                it&mdash;only I do not know how to separate and distinguish them. It is a case
                of money extorted, for he took away from the allies a statue worth a large sum of
                money. It is a case of embezzlement, because he did not hesitate to appropriate a
                public statue belonging to the Roman people, taken from the spoils of the enemy,
                placed where it was in the name of our general. It is a case of treason, because he
                dared to overturn and to carry away monuments of our empire, of our glory, and of
                our exploits. It is a case of impiety, because he violated the most solemn
                principles of religion. It is a case of inhumanity, because he invented a new and
                extraordinary description of punishment for an innocent man, an ally and friend of
                our nation. <milestone n="89" unit="section"/> But what the other crime is, that I
                am unable to say; I know not by what name to call the crime which he committed with
                respect to the statue of Caius Marcellus. What is the meaning of it? Is it because
                he was the patron of the Sicilians? What then? What has that to do with it? Ought
                that fact to have had influence to procure assistance, or to bring disaster on his
                clients and friends? Was it your object to show that patrons were no protection
                against your violence? Who is there who would not be aware that there is greater
                power in the authority of a bad man who is present, than in the protection of good
                men who are absent? Or do you merely wish to prove by this conduct, your
                unprecedented insolence, and pride, and obstinacy? You thought, I imagine, that you
                were taking something from the dignity of the Marcelli? And therefore now the
                Marcelli are not the patrons of the Sicilians. Verres has been substituted in their
                place. <milestone n="90" unit="section"/> What virtue or what dignity did you think
                existed in you, that you should attempt to transfer to yourself, and to take away
                from these most trusty and most ancient patrons, so illustrious a body of clients as
                that splendid province? Can you with your stupidity, and worthlessness, and laziness
                defend the cause, I will not say of all <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName>, but even of one, the very meanest of the Sicilians? Was the
                statue of Marcellus to serve you for a pillory for the clients of the Marcelli? Did
                you out of his honour seek for punishments for those very men who had held him in
                honour? What followed? What did you think would happen to your statues? was it that
                which did happen? For the people of <placeName key="perseus,Tyndaris"
                  >Tyndaris</placeName> threw down the statue of Verres, which he had ordered to be
                erected in his own honour near the Marcelli, and even on a higher pedestal, the very
                moment that they heard that a successor had been appointed to him. <milestone n="42"
                  unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>The fortune of the Sicilians has then given you Caius Marcellus for a judge, so
                that we may now surrender you, fettered and bound, to appease the injured sanctity
                of him to whose statue Sicilians were bound while you were praetor. <milestone
                  n="91" unit="section"/> And in the first place, O judges, that man said that the
                people of <placeName key="perseus,Tyndaris">Tyndaris</placeName> had sold this
                statue to Caius Marcellus Aeserninus, who is here present. And he hoped that Caius
                Marcellus himself would assert thus much for his sake though it never seemed to me
                to be very likely that a young man born in that rank, the patron of <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, would lend his name to that fellow to enable
                him to transfer his guilt to another. But still I made such provision, and took such
                precaution against every possible bearing of the case, that if ally one had been
                found who was ever so anxious to take the guilt and crime of Verres upon himself,
                still he would not have taken anything by his motion, for I brought down to court
                such witnesses, and I had with me such written documents, that it could not have
                been possible to have entertained a doubt about that man's actions. <milestone
                  n="92" unit="section"/> There are public documents to prove that that Mercury was
                transported to <placeName key="tgn,7003897">Messana</placeName> at the expense of
                the state. They state at what expense; and that a man named Poleas was ordered by
                the public authority to superintend the business&mdash;what more would you have?
                Where is he? He is close at hand, he is a witness, by the command of Sopater the

                he? He is a witness&mdash;you have seen the man, and you have heard his
                statement. Demetrius, the master of the gymnastic school, superintended the pulling
                down of the statue, because he was appointed to manage that business; What? is it we
                who say this? No, he is present himself; moreover, that Verres himself lately
                promised at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, that he would restore
                that statue to the deputies, if the evidence already given in the affair were

                against him, has been stated before you by Zosippus and Hismenias, most noble men,

              <p>What? did you not also at <placeName key="tgn,7003808">Agrigentum</placeName> take
                away a monument of the same Publius Scipio, a most beautiful statue of Apollo, on
                whose thigh there was the name of Myron, inscribed in diminutive silver letters, out
                of that most holy temple of Aesculapius? And when, O judges, he had privately
                committed that atrocity, and when in that most nefarious crime and robbery he had
                employed some of the most worthless men of the city as his guides and assistants,
                the whole city was greatly excited. For the Agrigentines were regretting at the same
                time the kindness of Africanus, and a national object of their worship, and an
                ornament of their city, and a record of their victory, and an evidence of their
                alliance with us. And therefore a command is imposed on those men who were the chief
                men of the city, and a charge is given to the quaestors and aediles to keep watch by
                night over the sacred edifices. And, indeed, at <placeName key="tgn,7003808"
                  >Agrigentum</placeName>, (I imagine, on account of the great number and virtue of
                these men, and because great numbers of Roman citizens, gallant and intrepid and
                honourable men, live and trade in that town among the Agrigentines in the greatest
                harmony,) he did not dare openly to carry off, or even to beg for the things that
                took his fancy. <milestone n="94" unit="section"/> There is a temple of Hercules at
                  <placeName key="tgn,7003808">Agrigentum</placeName>, not far from the forum,
                considered very holy and greatly reverenced among the citizens. In it there is a
                brazen image of Hercules himself, than which I cannot easily tell where I have seen
                anything finer; (although I am not very much of a judge of those matters, though I
                have seen plenty of specimens;) so greatly venerated among them, O judges, that his
                mouth and his chin are a little worn away, because men in addressing their prayers
                and congratulations to him, are accustomed not only to worship the statue, but even
                to kiss it. While Verres was at <placeName key="tgn,7003808">Agrigentum</placeName>,
                on a sudden, one stormy night, a great assemblage of armed slaves, and a great
                attack on this temple by them, takes place, under the leading of Timarchides. A cry
                is raised by the watchmen and guardians of the temple. And, at first, when they
                attempted to resist them and to defend the temple, they are driven back much injured
                with sticks and bludgeons. Afterwards, when the bolts were forced open, and the
                doors dashed in, they endeavour to pull down the statue and to overthrow it with
                levers; meantime, from the outcries of the keepers, a report got abroad over the
                whole city, that the national gods were being stormed, not by the unexpected
                invasion of enemies, or by the sudden irruption of pirates, but that a well armed
                and fully equipped band of fugitive slaves from the house and retinue of the praetor
                had attacked them. <milestone n="95" unit="section"/> No one in <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003808">Agrigentum</placeName> was either so advanced in age, or so
                infirm in strength, as not to rise up on that night, awakened by that news, and to
                seize whatever weapon chance put into his hands. So in a very short time men are
                assembled at the temple from every part of the city. Already, for more than an hour,
                numbers of men had been labouring at pulling down that statue; and all that time it
                gave no sign of being shaken in any part; while some, putting levers under it, were
                endeavouring to throw it down, and others, having bound cords to all its limbs, were
                trying to pull it towards them. On a sudden all the Agrigentines collect together at
                the place; stones are thrown in numbers; the nocturnal soldiers of that illustrious
                commander run away&mdash;but they take with them two very small statues, in
                order not to return to that robber of all holy things entirely empty-handed. The
                Sicilians are never in such distress as not to be able to say something facetious
                and neat; as they did on this occasion. And so they said that this enormous boar had
                a right to be accounted one of the labours of Hercules, no less than the other boar
                of Erymanthus. <milestone n="44" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="96" unit="section"
                /></p>
              <p>The people of Assorum, gallant and loyal men, afterwards imitated this brave
                conduct of the Agrigentines, though they did not come of so powerful or so
                distinguished a city. There is a river called Chrysas, which flows through the
                territories of Assorum. Chrysas, among that people, is considered a god, and is
                worshipped with the greatest reverence. His temple is in the fields, near the road
                which goes from Assorum to <placeName key="tgn,7003916">Enna</placeName>. In it
                there is an image of Chrysas, exquisitely made of marble. He did not dare to beg
                that of the Assorians on account of the extraordinary sanctity of that temple; so he
                entrusts the business to Tlepolemus and Hiero. They, having prepared and armed a
                body of men, come by night; they break in the doors of the temple; the keepers of
                the temple and the guardians hear them in time. A trumpet the signal of alarm well
                known to all the neighbourhood, is sounded; men come in from the country, Tlepolemus
                is turned out and put to fight; nor was anything missed out of the temple of Chrysas
                except one very diminutive image of brass. <milestone n="97" unit="section"/> There
                is a temple of the mighty mother Cybele at Enguinum, for I must new not only mention
                each instance with the greatest brevity, but I must even pass over a great many, in
                order to come to the greater and more remarkable thefts and atrocities of this sort
                which this man has committed. In this temple that same Publius Scipio, a man
                excelling in every possible good quality, had placed breastplates and helmets of
                brass of Corinthian workmanship, and some huge ewers of a similar description, and
                wrought with the same exquisite skill, and had inscribed his own name upon them. Why
                should I make any more statements or utter any further complaints about that man's
                conduct? He took away, O judges, every one of those things. He left nothing in that
                most holy temple except the traces of the religion he had trampled on, and the name
                of Publius Scipio. The spoils won from the enemy, the memorials of our commanders,
                the ornaments and decorations of our temples, will hereafter, when these illustrious
                names are lost, be reckoned in the furniture and appointments of Caius Verres.
                  <milestone n="98" unit="section"/> Are you, forsooth, the only man who delights in
                Corinthian vases? Are you the best judge in the world of the mixture of that

                Scipio, that most learned and accomplished mall, under stand it too? But do you, a
                man without one single virtue, without education, without natural ability, and

                in temperance, but in judgment and taste; for it was because he thoroughly
                understood how beautiful they were, that he thought that they were made, not for the
                luxury of men, but for the ornamenting of temples and cities, in order that they
                might appear to our posterity to be holy and sacred monuments. <milestone n="45"

              <p>Listen also, O judges, to the man's singular covetousness, audacity and madness,
                especially in polluting those sacred things, which not only may not be touched with
                the hands, but which may not be violated even in thought. There is a shrine of
                <persName><surname>Ceres</surname></persName> among the Catenans of the same holy
                nature as the one at home, and worshipped as the goddess is worshipped among foreign
                nations, and in almost every country in the world. In the inmost part of that shrine
                there was an extremely ancient statue of <persName><surname>Ceres</surname></persName>, as to which men were not only ignorant of what sort it was,
                but even of its existence. For the entrance into that shrine does not belong to men,
                the sacred ceremonies are accustomed to be performed by women and virgins. Verres's
                slaves stole this statue by night out of that most holy and most ancient temple. The
                next day the priestesses of <persName><surname>Ceres</surname></persName>, and the
                female attendants of that temple, women of great age, noble and of proved virtue,
                report the affair to their magistrates. It appeared to all a most bitter, and
                scandalous, and miserable business. <milestone n="100" unit="section"/> Then that
                man, influenced by the atrocity of the action, in order that all suspicion of that
                crime might be removed from himself, employs some one connected with him by ties of
                hospitality to find a man whom he might accuse of having done it, and bids him take
                care that he be convicted of the accusation, so that he himself might not be subject
                to the charge. The matter is not delayed. For when he had departed from <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003947">Catina</placeName>, an information is laid against a certain
                slave. He is accused; false witnesses are suborned against him; the whole senate
                sits in judgment on the affair, according to the laws of the Catenans. The
                priestesses are summoned; they are examined secretly in the senate-house, and asked
                what had been done, and how they thought that the statue had been carried off. They
                answer that the servants of the praetor had been seen in the temple. The matter,
                which previously had not been very obscure, began to be clear enough by the evidence
                of the priestesses. The judges deliberate; the innocent slave is acquitted by every
                vote, in order that you may the more easily be able to condemn this man by all your
                votes. <milestone n="101" unit="section"/> For what is it that you ask, O Verres?
                What do you hope for? What do you expect? What god or man do you think will come to
                your assistance? Did you send slaves to that place to plunder a temple, where it was
                not lawful for free citizens to go, not even for the purpose of praying? Did you not
                hesitate to lay violent hands on those things from which the laws of religion
                enjoined you to keep even your eyes? Although it was not even because you were
                charmed by the eye that you were led into this wicked and nefarious conduct; for you
                coveted what you had never seen. You took a violent fancy, I say, to that which you
                had not previously beheld. From your ears did you conceive this covetousness, so
                violent that no fear, no religious scruple, no power of the gods, no regard for the
                opinion of men could restrain it. <milestone n="102" unit="section"/> Oh! but you
                had heard of it, I suppose, from some good man, from some good authority. How could
                you have done that, when you could never have heard of it from any man at all? You
                heard of it, therefore, from a woman; since men could not have seen it nor known of
                it. What sort of woman do you think that she must have been, O judges? What a modest
                woman must she have been to converse with Verres! What a pious woman, to show him a
                plan for robbing a temple! But it is no great wonder if those sacred ceremonies
                which are performed by the most extreme chastity of virgins and matrons were
                violated by his adultery and profligacy. <milestone n="46" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>What, then, are we to think? Is this the only thing that he began to desire from
                mere hearing, when he had never seen it himself? No, there were many other things
                besides; of which I will select the plundering of that most noble and ancient
                temple, concerning which you heard witnesses give their evidence at the former
                pleading. Now, I beseech you, listen to the same story once more, and attend
                carefully as you hitherto have done. <milestone n="103" unit="section"/> There is an
                island called <placeName key="tgn,7005730">Melita</placeName>, O judges, separated
                from <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> by a sufficiently wide and
                perilous navigation, in which there is a town of the same name, to which Verres
                never went, though it was for three years a manufactory to him for weaving women's
                garments. Not far from that town, on a promontory, is an ancient temple of Juno,
                which was always considered so holy, that it was not only always kept inviolate and
                sacred in those Punic wars, which in those regions were carried on almost wholly by
                the naval forces, but even by the bands of pirates which ravage those seas.
                Moreover, it has been handed down to us by tradition, that once, when the fleet of
                King Masinissa was forced to put into these ports, the king's lieutenant took away
                some ivory teeth of an incredible size out of the temple, and carried them into
                  <placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>, and gave them to Masinissa; that
                at first the king was delighted with the present, but afterwards, when he heard
                where they had come from, he immediately sent trustworthy men in a quinquereme to
                take those teeth back; and that there was engraved on them in Punic characters,
                &ldquo;that Masinissa the king had accepted them ignorantly; but that, when he
                knew the truth, he had taken care that they should be replaced and
                restored.&rdquo; There was besides an immense quantity of ivory, and many
                ornaments, among which were some ivory victories of ancient workmanship, and wrought
                with exquisite skill. <milestone n="104" unit="section"/> Not to dwell too long on
                this, he took care to have all these things taken down and carried off at one swoop
                by means of the slaves of the Venus whom he had sent thither for that purpose.

              <p>O ye immortal gods! what sort of man is it that I am accusing? Who is it that I am
                prosecuting according to our laws, and by this regular process? Concerning whom is
                it that you are going to give your judicial decision? The deputies from <placeName
                  key="tgn,7005730">Melita</placeName> sent by the public authority of their state,
                say that the shrine of Juno was plundered; that that man left nothing in that most
                holy temple; that that place, to which the fleets of enemies often came, where
                pirates are accustomed to winter almost every year, and which no pirate ever
                violated, no enemy ever attacked before, was so plundered by that single man, that
                nothing whatever was left in it. What, then, now are we to say of him as a
                defendant, of me as an accuser, of this tribunal? Is he proved guilty of grave
                crimes, or is he brought into this court on mere suspicion? Gods are proved to have
                been carried off, temples to have been plundered, cities to have been stripped of
                everything. And of those actions he has left himself no power of denying one, no
                plea for defending one. In every particular he is convicted by me; he is detected by
                the witnesses; he is overwhelmed by his own admissions; he is caught in the evident
                commission of guilt; and even now he remains here, and in silence recognises his own
                crimes as I enumerate them. </p>

                to go back rather far, and trace the earliest recollections of the religious

              <p>It is an old opinion, O judges, which can be proved from the most ancient records
                and monuments of the Greeks, that the whole island of <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName> was consecrated to <persName><surname>Ceres</surname></persName> and Libera. Not only did all other nations think so but the
                Sicilians themselves were so convinced of it, that it appeared a deeply rooted and
                innate belief in their minds. For they believe that these goddesses were born in
                these districts, and that corn was first discovered in this land, and that Libera
                was carried off, the same goddess whom they call Proserpina, from a grove in the
                territory of <placeName key="tgn,7003916">Enna</placeName>, a place which, because
                it is situated in the centre of the island, is called the navel of <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>. And when <persName><surname>Ceres</surname></persName> wished to seek her and trace her out, she is said to have lit
                her torches at those flames which burst out at the summit of <placeName

                speaking of are said to have been done, is in a high and lofty situation, on the top
                of which is a large level plain, and springs of water which are never dry. And the
                whole of the plain is cut off and separated, so as to be difficult of approach.
                Around it are many lakes and groves, and beautiful flowers at every season of the
                year; so that the place itself appears to testify to that abduction of the virgin
                which we have heard of from our boyhood. <note anchored="yes">We have the same
                  advantage as, or rather greater advantages than Cicero in this respect, for we
                  have heard the story from our boyhood told far more beautifully than any Sicilian
                  ever imagined it. See <bibl n="Ov. Fast. 4.419">Ovid Fasti, iv. 419</bibl>.</note>
                Near it is a cave turned towards the north, of unfathomable depth, where they say
                that Father Pluto suddenly rose out of the earth in his chariot, and carried the
                virgin off from that spot, and that on a sudden, at no great distance from
                  <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, he went down beneath the
                earth, and that immediately a lake sprang up in that place; and there to this day

              <p>On account of the antiquity of this belief, because in those places the traces and

                often attest her influence and divine powers. Her present help is often brought to
                many in critical circumstances, so that this island appears not only to be loved,
                but also to be watched over and protected by her. <milestone n="108" unit="section"
                /> Nor is it the Sicilians only, but even all other tribes and nations greatly
                worship <persName><surname>Ceres</surname></persName> of <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003916">Enna</placeName>. In truth, if initiation into those sacred
                mysteries of the Athenians sought for with the greatest avidity, to which people
                <persName><surname>Ceres</surname></persName> is said to have come in that long
                wandering of hers, and then she brought them corn. How much greater reverence ought
                to be paid to her by those people among whom it is certain that she was born, and
                first discovered corn. And, therefore, in the time of our fathers, at a most
                disastrous and critical time to the republic, when, after the death of Tiberius
                Gracchus, there was a fear that great dangers were portended to the state by various
                prodigies, in the consulship of Publius Mucius and Lucius Calpurnius, recourse was
                had to the Sibylline books, in which it was found set down, &ldquo;that the most
                ancient <persName><surname>Ceres</surname></persName> ought to be
                appeased.&rdquo; Then, priests of the Roman people, selected from the most

                and magnificent temple of <persName><surname>Ceres</surname></persName>,
                nevertheless went as far as <placeName key="tgn,7003916">Enna</placeName>. For such
                was the authority and antiquity of the reputation for holiness of that place, that
                when they went thither, they seemed to be going not to a temple of <persName><surname>Ceres</surname></persName>, but to <persName><surname>Ceres</surname></persName> herself. <milestone n="109" unit="section"/> I will not din

                the most ancient, the most holy, the very chief of all sacred things which are

                They are very colossal and very beautiful, but not exceedingly ancient. There was
                one of brass, of moderate size, but extraordinary workmanship, with the torches in

                the holy veneration due to their temple, which they wished should have atonement
                made to them by the punishment of that most atrocious and audacious man. They said
                that they could endure everything else, that to everything else they were

                nor did the runaways flee from their masters as far as you flee from all laws and
                from all right; nor were the barbarians as barbarous in language and in race as you
                were in your nature and your habits; nor were the enemies as much enemies to men as
                you are to the immortal gods. How, then, can a man beg for any mercy who has
                surpassed slaves in baseness, runaway slaves in rashness, barbarians in wickedness,

              <p>You heard Theodorus and Numinius and Nicasio, deputies from <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003916">Enna</placeName>, say, in the name of their state, that they had
                this commission from their fellow-citizens, to go to Verres, and to demand from him
                the restoration of the statues of <persName><surname>Ceres</surname></persName> and
                of Victory. And if they obtained it then they were to adhere to the ancient customs
                of the state of <placeName key="tgn,7003916">Enna</placeName>, not to give any
                public testimony against him although he had oppressed <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName>, since these were the principles which they had received from
                their ancestors. But if he did not restore them, then they were to go before the
                tribunal, to inform the judges of the injuries they had received, but, far above all
                things, to complain of the insults to their religion. And, in the name of the
                immortal gods I entreat you, O judges, do not you despise, do not you scorn or think
                lightly of their complaints. The injuries done to our allies are the present
                question; the authority of the laws is at stake; the reputation and the honesty of
                our courts of justice is at stake. And though all these are great considerations,
                yet this is the greatest of all,&mdash;the whole province is so imbued with
                religious feeling, such a superstitious dread arising out of that man's conduct has
                seized upon the minds of all the Sicilians, that whatever public or private
                misfortunes happen, appear to befall them because of that man's wickedness.
                  <milestone n="114" unit="section"/> You have heard the Centuripans, the Agyrians,
                the Catenans, the Herbitans, the Ennans, and many other deputies say, in the name of
                their states, how great was the solitude in their districts, how great the
                devastation, how universal the flight of the cultivators of the soil how deserted,
                how uncultivated, how desolate every place was. And although there are many and
                various injuries done by that man to which these things are owing, still this one
                cause, in the opinion of the Sicilians, is the most weighty of all; for, because of
                the insults offered to <persName><surname>Ceres</surname></persName>, they believe
                that all the crops and gifts of <persName><surname>Ceres</surname></persName> have
                perished in these districts. Bring remedies, O judges, to the insulted religion of
                the allies; preserve your own, for this is not a foreign religion, nor one with
                which you have no concern. But even if it were, if you were unwilling to adopt it
                yourselves, still you ought to be willing to inflict heavy punishment on the man who
                had violated it. <milestone n="115" unit="section"/> But now that the common
                religion of all nations is attacked in this way, now that these sacred observances
                are violated which our ancestors adopted and imported from foreign countries, and
                have honoured ever since,&mdash;sacred observances, which they called Greek
                observances, as in truth they were,&mdash;even if we were to wish to be
                indifferent and cold about these matters, how could we be so? <milestone n="52"

              <p>I will mention the sacking of one city, also, and that the most beautiful and
                highly decorated of all, the city of <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse"
                  >Syracuse</placeName>. And I will produce my proofs of that, O judges, in order at
                length to conclude and bring to an end the whole history of offences of this sort.
                There is scarcely any one of you who has not often heard how <placeName
                  key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> was taken by Marcus Marcellus, and who
                has not sometimes also read the account in our annals. Compare this peace with that
                war; the visit of this praetor with the victory of that general; the debauched
                retinue of the one with the invincible army of the other; the lust of Verres with
                the continence of Marcellus;&mdash;and you will say that <placeName
                  key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> was built by the man who took it; was
                taken by the man who received it well established and flourishing. <milestone
                  n="116" unit="section"/> And for the present I omit those things which will be
                mentioned, and have been already mentioned by me in an irregular manner in different
                parts of my speech&mdash;what the market-place of the Syracusans, which at the
                entrance of Marcellus was preserved unpolluted by slaughter, on the arrival of
                Verres overflowed with the blood of innocent Sicilians; that the harbour of the
                Syracusans, which at that time was shut against both our fleets and those of the
                Carthaginians, was, while Verres was praetor, open to Cilician pirates, or even to a
                single piratical galley. I say nothing of the violence offered to people of noble
                birth, of the ravishment of matrons, atrocities which then, when the city was taken,
                were not committed, neither through the hatred of enemies, nor through military
                licence, nor through the customs of war or the rights of victory. I pass over, I
                say, all these things which were done by that man for three whole years. Listen
                rather to acts which are connected with those matters of which I have hitherto been
                speaking. <milestone n="117" unit="section"/> You have often heard that the city of
                  <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> is the greatest of the
                Greek cities, and the most beautiful of all. It is so, O judges, as it is said to
                be; for it is so by its situation, which is strongly fortified, and which is on
                every side by which you can approach it, whether by sea or land, very beautiful to
                behold. And it has harbours almost enclosed within the walls, and in the sight of
                the whole city, harbours which have different entrances, but which meet together,
                and are connected at the other end. By their union a part of the town, which is
                called the island, being separated from the rest by a narrow arm of the sea, is
                again joined to and connected with the other by a bridge. <milestone n="53"
                  unit="chapter"/><milestone n="118" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>That city is so great that it may be said to consist of four cities of the largest
                size; one of which, as I have said, is that &ldquo;Island,&rdquo; which,
                surrounded by two harbours, projects out towards the mouth and entrance of each. In
                it there is a palace which did belong to king Hiero, which our praetors are in the
                habit of using; in it are many sacred buildings, but two, which have a great
                pre-eminence over all the others,&mdash;one a temple of Diana, and the other
                one, which before the arrival of that man was the most ornamented of all, sacred to
                Minerva. At the end of this island is a fountain of sweet water, the name of which
                is Arethusa, of incredible size, very full of fish, which would be entirely
                overwhelmed by the waves of the sea, if it were not protected from the sea by a
                rampart and dam of stone. <milestone n="119" unit="section"/> There is also another
                city at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, the name of which is
                Achradina, in which there is a very large forum, most beautiful porticoes, a highly
                decorated town-hall, a most spacious senate-house, and a superb temple of Jupiter
                Olympius; and the other districts of the city are joined together by one broad
                unbroken street, and divided by many cross streets, and by private houses. There is
                a third city, which because in that district there is an ancient temple of Fortune,
                is called Tyche, in which there is a spacious gymnasium, and many sacred buildings,
                and that district is the most frequented and the most populous. There is also a
                fourth city, which, because it is the last built, is called <placeName
                  key="tgn,1094981">Neapolis</placeName>, <note anchored="yes"><placeName
                    key="tgn,1094981">Neapolis</placeName> meaning &ldquo;new city,&rdquo;
                  or as we might say, <placeName key="tgn,7014109">Newtown</placeName>, from the

                which there is a very large theatre, and, besides that there are two temples of
                great beauty, one of <persName><surname>Ceres</surname></persName>, the other of
                Libera, and a statue of Apollo, which is called Temenites, very beautiful and of
                colossal size; which, if he could have moved them, he would not have hesitated to
                carry off. <milestone n="54" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="120" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>Now I will return to Marcellus, that I may not appear to have entered into this
                statement without any reason. He, when with his powerful army he had taken this
                splendid city, did not think it for the credit of the Roman people to destroy and
                extinguish this splendour, especially as no danger could possibly arise from it, and
                therefore he spared all the buildings, public as well as private, sacred as well as
                ordinary, as if he had come with his army for the purpose of defending them, not of
                taking them by storm. With respect to the decorations of the city, he had a regard
                to his own victory, and a regard to humanity, he thought it was due to his victory
                to transport man, things to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> which
                might be an ornament to this city, and due to humanity not utterly to strip the
                city, especially as it was one which he was anxious to preserve. <milestone n="121"
                  unit="section"/> In this division of the ornaments, the victory of Marcellus did
                not covet more for the Roman people than his humanity reserved to the Syracusans.
                The things which were transported to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>
                we see before the temples of Honour and of Virtue, and also in other places. He put
                nothing in his own house, nothing in his gardens, nothing in his suburban villa; he
                thought that his house could only be an ornament to the city if he abstained from
                carrying the ornaments which belonged to the city to his own house. But he left many
                things of extraordinary beauty at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse"
                  >Syracuse</placeName>; he violated not the respect due to any god; he laid hands
                on none. Compare Verres with him; not to compare the man with the man,&mdash;no
                such injury must be done to such a man as that, dead though he be; but to compare a
                state of peace with one of war, a state of law and order, and regular jurisdiction,
                with one of violence and martial law, and the supremacy of arms; to compare the
                arrival and retinue of the one with the victory and army of the other. <milestone
                  n="55" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="122" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>There is a temple of Minerva in the island, of which I have already spoken, which
                Marcellus did not touch, which he left full of its treasures and ornaments, but
                which was so stripped and plundered by Verres, that it seems to have been in the
                hands, not of any enemy,&mdash;for enemies, even in war, respect the rites of
                religion, and the customs of the country,&mdash;but of some barbarian pirates.
                There was a cavalry battle of their king Agathocles, exquisitely painted in a series
                of pictures, and with these pictures the inside walls of the temple were covered.
                Nothing could be more noble than those paintings; there was nothing at <placeName
                  key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> that was thought more worthy going to
                see. These pictures, Marcus Marcellus, though by that victory of his he had divested
                everything of its sacred inviolability of character, still, out of respect for
                religion, never touched; Verres, though, in consequence of the long peace, and the
                loyalty of the Syracusan people, he had received them as sacred and under the
                protection of religion, took away all those pictures, and left naked and unsightly
                those walls whose decorations had remained inviolate for so many ages, and had
                escaped so many wars: <milestone n="123" unit="section"/> Marcellus, who had vowed
                that if he took <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> he would
                erect two temples at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, was unwilling
                to adorn the temple which he was going to build with these treasures which were his
                by right of capture; Verres, who was bound by no vows to Honour or Virtue, as
                Marcellus was, but only to Venus and to Cupid, attempted to plunder the temple of
                Minerva. The one was unwilling to adorn gods in the spoil taken from gods, the other
                transferred the decorations of the virgin Minerva to the house of a prostitute.
                Besides this, he took away out of the same temple twenty-seven more pictures
                beautifully painted; among which were likenesses of the kings and tyrants of
                  <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, which delighted one, not only by
                the skill of the painter, but also by reminding us of the men, and by enabling us to
                recognise their persons. And see now, how much worse a tyrant this man proved to the
                Syracusans than any of the old ones, as they, cruel as they were, still adorned the
                temples of the immortal gods, while this man took away the monuments and ornaments
                from the gods. <milestone n="56" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="124" unit="section"
                /></p>
              <p>But now what shall I say of the folding-doors of that temple? I am afraid that
                those who have not seen these things may think that I am speaking too highly of, and
                exaggerating everything, though no one ought to suspect that I should be so
                inconsiderate as to be selling that so many men of the highest reputation,
                especially when they are judges in this cause, who have been at <placeName
                  key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, and who have seen all these things
                themselves, should be witnesses to my rashness and falsehood. I am able to prove
                this distinctly, O judges, that no more magnificent doors, none more beautifully
                wrought of gold and ivory, ever existed in an, temple. It is incredible how many
                Greeks have left written accounts of the beauty of these doors: they, perhaps, may
                admire and extol them too much; be it so, still it is more honourable for our
                republic, O judges, that our general, in a time of war, should have left those
                things which appeared to them so beautiful, than that our praetor should have
                carried them off in a time of peace. On the folding-doors were some subjects most
                minutely executed in ivory; all these he caused to be taken out; he tore off and
                took away a very tine head of the Gorgon with snakes for hair; and he showed, too,
                that he was influenced not only by admiration for the workmanship, but by a desire
                of money and gain; for he did not hesitate to take away also all the golden knobs
                from these folding-doors, which were numerous and heavy; and it was not the
                workmanship of these, but the weight which pleased him. And so he left the
                folding-doors in such state, that, though they had formerly contributed greatly to
                the ornament of the temple, they now seemed to have been made only for the purpose
                of shutting it up. <milestone n="125" unit="section"/> Am I to speak also of the
                spears made of grass? for I saw that you were excited at the name of them when the
                witnesses mentioned them. They were such that it was sufficient to have seen them
                once, as there was neither any manual labour in them, nor any beauty, but simply an
                incredible size, which it would be quite sufficient even to hear of, and too much to
                see them more than once. Did you covet even those? <milestone n="57" unit="chapter"
                  /><milestone n="126" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>For the Sappho which was taken away out of the town-hall affords you so reasonable
                an excuse, that it may seem almost allowable and pardonable. That work of Silanion,
                so perfect, so elegant, so elaborate, (I will not say what private man, but) what
                nation could be so worthy to possess, as the most elegant and learned Verres?
                Certainly, nothing will be said against it. If any one of us, who are not as happy,
                who cannot be as refined as that man, should wish to behold anything of the sort,
                let him go to the temple of Good Fortune, to the monument of Catulus, to the portico
                of Metellus; let him take pains to get admittance into the Tusculan villa of any one
                of those men; let him see the forum when decorated, if Verres is ever so kind as to
                lend any of his treasures to the aediles. Shall Verres have all these things at
                home? shall Verres have his house full of his villas crammed with, the ornaments of
                temples and cities? Will you still, O judges, bear with the hobby, as he calls it,
                and pleasures of this vile artisan? a man who was born in such a rank, educated in
                such a way, and who is so formed both in mind and body, that he appears a much
                fitter person to take down statues than to appropriate them. <milestone n="127"
                  unit="section"/> And how great a regret this Sappho which he carried off left
                behind her, can scarcely be told; for in the first place it was admirably made, and,
                besides, it had a very noble Greek epigram engraved upon the pedestal; and would not
                that learned man, that Grecian, who is such an acute judge of these matters, who is
                the only man who understands them, if he had understood one letter of Greek, have
                taken that away too? for now, because it is engraved on an empty pedestal, it both
                declares what was once, on the pedestal, and proves that it has been taken away.
                What shall I say more? Did you not take away the statue of Paean from out of the
                temple of Aesculapius, beautifully made, sacred, and holy as it was? a statue which
                all men went to see for its beauty, and worshipped for its sacred character. What
                more? was not the statue of Aristaeus openly taken away by your command out of the
                temple of Bacchus? <milestone n="128" unit="section"/> What more? did you not take
                away out of the temple of <persName><surname>Jupiter</surname></persName> that most
                holy statue of Jupiter Imperator, which the Greeks call <foreign lang="greek"
                  >*)/ourios</foreign>, most beautifully made? What next? did you hesitate to take
                away out of the temple of Libera, that most exquisite bust of Parian marble, which
                we used to go to see? And that Paean used to be worshipped among that people
                together with Aesculapius, with anniversary sacrifices. Aristaeus, who being, as the
                Greeks report, the son of Bacchus, is said to have been the inventor of oil, was
                consecrated among them together with his father Bacchus, in the same temple.

              <p>But how great do you suppose was the honour paid to Jupiter Imperator in his own
                temple? You may collect it from this consideration, if you recollect how great was
                the religious reverence attached to that statue of the same appearance and form
                which Flaminius brought out of <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>,
                and placed in the Capitol. In truth, there were said to be in the whole world three
                statues of Jupiter Imperator, of the same class, all beautifully made: one was that
                one from <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, which we have seen in
                the Capitol; a second was the one at the narrow straits, which are the mouth of the
                  <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Euxine Sea</placeName>; the third was that which was
                at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, till Verres came as
                praetor. Flaminius removed the first from its habitation, but only to place it in
                the Capitol, that is to say, in the house of Jupiter upon earth. <milestone n="130"
                  unit="section"/> But as to the one that is at the entrance of the Euxine, that,
                though so many wars have proceeded from the shores of that sea, and though so many
                have been poured into <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName>, has still
                remained inviolate and untouched to this day. This third one, which was at
                  <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, which Marcus Marcellus,
                when in arms and victorious, had seen, which he had spared to the religion of the
                place, which both the citizens of, and settlers in <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse"
                  >Syracuse</placeName> were used to worship, and strangers not only visited, but
                often venerated, Caius Verres took away from the temple of <persName><surname>Jupiter</surname></persName>. <milestone n="131" unit="section"/> To
                return again to Marcellus. Judge of the case, O judges, in this way; think that more
                gods were lost to the Syracusans owing to the arrival of Verres, than even were
                owing to the victory of Marcellus. In truth, he is said to have sought diligently
                for the great Archimedes, a man of the highest genius and skill, and to have been
                greatly concerned when he heard that he had been killed; but that other man sought
                for everything which he did seek for, not for the purpose of preserving it, but of
                carrying it away. <milestone n="59" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>At present, then, all those things which might appear more insignificant, I will on
                that account pass over&mdash;how he took away Delphic tables made of marble,
                beautiful goblets of brass, an immense number of Corinthian vases, out of every
                saved temple at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>; <milestone
                  n="132" unit="section"/> and therefore, O judges, those men who are accustomed to
                take strangers about to all those things which are worth going to see, and to show
                them every separate thing, whom they call mystagogi, (or cicerones,) now have their
                description of things reversed; for as they formerly used to show what there was in
                every place, so now they show what has been taken from every place. </p>
              <p>What do you think, then? Do you think that those men are affected with but a
                moderate indignation? Not so, O judges: in the first place, because all men are
                influenced by religious feeling, and think that their paternal gods, whom they have
                received from their ancestors, are to be carefully worshipped and retained by
                themselves; and secondly, because this sort of ornament, these works and specimens
                of art, these statues and paintings, delight men of Greek extraction to an excessive
                degree; therefore by their complaints we can understand that these things appear
                most bitter to those men, which perhaps may seem trifling and contemptible to us.
                Believe me, O judges, although I am aware to a certainty that you yourselves hear
                the same things, that though both our allies and foreign nations have during these
                past years sustained many calamities and injuries, yet men of Greek extraction have
                not been, and are not, more indignant at any than at this ruthless plundering of
                their temples and altars. <milestone n="133" unit="section"/> Although that man may
                say that he bought these things, as he is accustomed to say, yet, believe me in
                this, O judges,&mdash;no city in all <placeName key="tgn,1000004"
                  >Asia</placeName> or in all <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> has
                ever sold one statue, one picture, or one decoration of the city, of its own free
                will to anybody. Unless, perchance, you suppose that, after strict judicial
                decisions had ceased to take place at <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
                >Rome</placeName>, the Greeks then began to sell these things, which they not only
                did not sell when there were courts of justice open, but which they even used to buy
                up; or unless you think that Lucius Crassus, Quintus Scaevola, Caius Claudius, most,
                powerful men, whose most splendid aedileships we have seen had no dealings in those
                sort of matters with the Greeks, but that those men had such dealings who became
                aediles after the destruction of the courts of justice. <milestone n="60"
                  unit="chapter"/><milestone n="134" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>Know also that that false presence of purchase was more bitter to the cities than
                if any one were privately to filch things, or boldly to steal them and carry them
                off. For they think it the most excessive baseness, that it should be entered on the
                public records that the city was induced by a price, and by a small price too, to
                sell and alienate those things which it had received from men of old. In truth, the
                Greeks delight to a marvellous degree in those things, which we despise. And
                therefore our ancestors willingly allowed those things to remain in numbers among
                the allies, in order that they might be as splendid and as flourishing as possible
                under our dominion; and among those nations whom they rendered taxable or tributary,

                those men from whose cities these things are carried away. <milestone n="61"

              <p>And to say nothing of other nations, judge of the Syracusans themselves. For when I
                went to <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, I originally
                believed what I had heard at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> from
                that man's friends, that the city of <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse"
                  >Syracuse</placeName>, on account of the inheritance of Heraclius, was no less
                friendly to him than the city of the Mamertines, because of their participation in
                all his booty and robberies. And at the same time I was afraid that, owing to the
                influence of the high-born and beautiful women at whose will he had directed all the
                measures of his praetorship for three years, and of the men to whom they were
                married, I should be opposed not only by an excessive lenity, but even by a feeling
                of liberality towards that man, if I were to seek for any evidence out of the public
                records of the Syracusans. <milestone n="137" unit="section"/> Therefore when at
                  <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> I was chiefly with Roman
                citizens; I copied out their papers; I inquired into their injuries. As I was a long
                time occupied by that business, in order to rest a little and to give my mind a
                respite from care, I returned to those fine documents of Carpinatius; in which, in
                company with some of the most honourable knights of the body of Roman settlers, I
                unraveled the case of those Verrutii, whom I have mentioned before, but I expected
                no aid at all, either publicly or privately, from the Syracusans, nor had I any idea
                of asking for any. While I was doing this, on a sudden Heraclius came to me, who was
                in office at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, a man of high
                birth, who had been priest of <persName><surname>Jupiter</surname></persName>,
                which is the highest honour among the Syracusans; he requests of me and of my
                brother, if we have no objection, to go to their senate; that they were at that
                moment assembled in full numbers in the senate-house, and he said that he made this
                request to us to attend by command of the senate. <milestone n="138" unit="section"
                /> At first we were in doubt what to do; but afterwards it soon occurred to us that
                we ought not to shun that assembly or that place. <milestone n="62" unit="chapter"
                /></p>
              <p>Therefore we came to the senate-house; they all rise at our entry to do us honour.
                We sat down at the request of the magistrates. Diodorus the son of Timarchides, who
                was the first man in that body both in influence and in age, and also as it seemed
                to me in experience and knowledge of business, began to speak; and the first
                sentence of his speech was to this effect&mdash;That the senate and people of
                  <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> were grieved and indignant,
                that, though in all the other cities of <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName> I had informed the senate and people of what I proposed for
                their advantage or for their safety, and though I had received from them all
                commissions, deputies, letters and evidence, yet in that city I had done nothing of
                that sort. I answered, that deputies from the Syracusans had not been present at
                  <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> in that assembly of the Sicilians
                when my assistance was entreated by the common resolution of all the deputations,
                and when the cause of the whole of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>
                was entrusted to me; and that I could not ask that any decree should be passed
                against Caius Verres in that senate-house in which I saw a gilt statue of Caius
                Verres. <milestone n="139" unit="section"/> And after I said that, such a groaning
                ensued at the sight and mention of the statue, that it appeared to have been placed
                in the senate-house as a monument of his wickednesses and not of his services. Then
                every one for himself, as fast as each could manage to speak, began to give me
                information of those things which I have just now mentioned; to tell me that the
                city was plundered&mdash;the temples stripped of their treasures&mdash;that
                of the inheritance of Heraclius, which he had adjudged to the men of the palaestra,
                he had taken by far the greatest share himself; and indeed, that they could not
                expect that he should care for the men of the palaestra, when he had taken away even
                the god who was the inventor of oil; that that statue had neither been made at the
                public expense, nor erected by public authority, but that those men who had been the
                sharers in the plunder of the inheritance of Heraclius, had had it made and placed
                where it was; and that those same men had been the deputies at <placeName
                  key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, who had been his assistants in dishonesty,
                his partners in his thefts and the witnesses of his debaucheries; and that therefore
                I ought the less to wonder if they were wanting to the unanimity of the deputies and
                to the safety of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>. <milestone n="63"
                  unit="chapter"/><milestone n="140" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>When I perceived that their indignation at that man's injuries was not only not
                less, but almost greater than that of the rest of the Sicilians, then I explained my
                own intentions to them, and my whole plan and system with reference to the whole of
                the business which I had undertaken; then I exhorted them not to be wanting to the
                common cause and the common safety, and to rescind that panegyric which they had
                voted a few days before, being compelled, a, they said, by violence and fear.
                Accordingly, O judges, the Syracusans, that man's clients and friends, do this.
                First of all, they produce to me the public documents which they had carefully
                stored up in the most sacred part of the treasury; in which they show me that
                everything, which I have said had been taken away, was entered, and even more things
                than I was able to mention. And they were entered in this way. &ldquo;What had
                been taken out of the temple of Minerva .. This,... and that.&rdquo;
                &ldquo;What was missing out of the temple of <persName><surname>Jupiter</surname></persName>.&rdquo; &ldquo;What was missing out of the temple of
                Bacchus.&rdquo; As each individual had had the charge of protecting and
                preserving those things, so it was entered; that each, when according to law he gave
                in his accounts, being bound to give up what he had received, had begged that he
                might be pardoned for the absence of these things and that all had accordingly been
                released from liability on that account, and that it was kept secret; all which
                documents I took care to have sealed up with the public seal and brought away.
                  <milestone n="141" unit="section"/> But concerning the public panegyric on him
                this explanation was given: that at first, when the letters arrived from Verres
                about the panegyric, a little while before my arrival, nothing had been decreed; and
                after that, when some of his friends urged them that it ought to be decreed, they
                were rejected with the greatest outcry and the bitterest reproaches; but when I was
                on the point of arriving, then he who at that time was the chief governor had
                commanded them to decree it, and that it had been decreed in such a manner that the
                panegyric did him more damage than it could have done him good. So now, judges, do
                you receive the truth of that matter from me just as it was shown to me by them.
                  <milestone n="64" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="142" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>It is a custom at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, that, if
                a motion on any subject is brought before the senate, whoever wishes, gives his
                opinion on it. No one is asked by name for his sentiments; nevertheless, those are
                accustomed to speak first of their own accord, and naturally, according as they are
                superior in honour or in age; and that precedence is yielded to them by the rest;
                but, if at any time all are silent, then they are compelled to speak by lot. This
                was the custom when the motion was made respecting the panegyric of Verres. On which
                subject at first great numbers speak, in order to delay coming to any vote, and
                interpose this objection, that formerly, when they had heard that there was a
                prosecution instituted against Sextus Peducaeus, who had deserved admirably well of
                that city and of the whole province, and when, in return for his numerous and
                important services, they wished to vote a panegyric on him, they had been prohibited
                from doing so by Caius Verres; and that it would be an unjust thing, although
                Peducaeus had now no need of their praise, still not to vote that which at one time
                they had been eager to vote, before decreeing what they would only decree from
                compulsion. <milestone n="143" unit="section"/> All shout in assent, and say
                approvingly that that is what ought to be done. So the question about Peducaeus is
                put to the senate. Each man gave his opinion in order, according as he had
                precedence in age and honour. You may learn this from the resolution itself; for the
                opinions delivered by the chief men are generally recorded. Read&mdash; [The
                list of speeches made on the subject of Sextus Peducaeus is read.] It says who were
                the chief supporters of the motion. The vote is carried. Then the question about
                Verres is put. Tell me, I pray, what happened. [The list of speeches made on the
                subject of Caius Verres....] Well what comes next? [As no one rose, and no one
                delivered his opinion....] What is this? [They proceed by lot.] Why was this? Was no
                one a willing praiser of your praetorship, or a willing defender of you from danger,
                especially when by being so he might have gained favour with the praetor? No one.
                Those very men who used to feast with you, your advisers and accomplices, did not
                venture to utter a word. In that very senate-house in which a statue of yourself and
                a naked statue of your son were standing, was there no one whom even your naked son
                in a province stripped naked could move to compassion? <milestone n="144"
                  unit="section"/> Moreover they inform me also of this, that they had passed the
                vote of panegyric in such a form that all men might see that it was not a panegyric,
                but rather a satire, to remind every one of his shameful and disastrous praetorship.
                For in truth it was drawn up in these words. &ldquo;Because he had scourged no
                one.&rdquo; From which you are to understand, that he had caused most noble and
                innocent men to be executed. &ldquo;Because he had administered the affairs of
                the province with vigilance,&rdquo; when all his vigils were well known to have
                been devoted to debauchery and adultery; moreover, there was this clause added,
                which the defendant could never venture to produce, and the accuser would never
                cease to dwell upon; &ldquo;Because Verres had kept all pirates at a distance
                from the island of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>;&rdquo; men
                who in his time had entered even into the &ldquo;island&rdquo; of <placeName
                  key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>. <milestone n="145" unit="section"/>
                And after I had received this information from them, I departed from the
                senate-house with my brother, in order that they might decree what they chose.
                  <milestone n="65" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>Immediately they pass a decree. First, &ldquo;That my brother Lucius should be
                connected with the city by ties of hospitably;&rdquo; because he had shown the
                same goodwill to the Syracusans that I had always felt myself. That they not only
                wrote at that time, but also had engraved on brazen tablets and presented to us.
                Truly very fond of you are your Syracusans whom you are always talking of, who think
                it quite a sufficient reason for forming an intimate connection with your accuser,
                that he is going to be your accuser, and that he has come among them for the purpose
                of prosecuting inquiries against you. After that, a decree is passed, not with any
                difference of opinion, but almost unanimously, &ldquo;That the panegyric which
                had been decreed to Caius Verres, be rescinded.&rdquo; <milestone n="146"
                  unit="section"/> But, when not only the vote had been come to, but when it had
                even been drawn up in due form and entered in the records, an appeal is made to the
                praetor. But who makes this appeal? Any magistrate? No. Any senator? Not even that.
                Any Syracusan? Far from it. Who, then, appeals to the praetor? The man who had been
                Verres's quaestor, Caesetius. Oh, the ridiculous business! Oh, the deserted man! O
                man despaired of and abandoned by the Sicilian magistracy! In order to prevent the
                Sicilians passing a resolution of the senate, or from obtaining their rights
                according to their own customs and their own laws, an appeal is made to the praetor,
                not by any friend of his, not by any connection, not, in short, by any Sicilian, but
                by his own quaestor. Who saw this? Who heard it? That just and wise praetor orders
                the senate to be adjourned. A great multitude flocks to me. First of all, the
                senators cry out that their rights are being taken away; that their liberty is being
                taken away. The people praise the senate and thank them. The Roman citizens do not
                leave me. And on that day I had no harder task, than with all my exertions to
                prevent violent hands being laid on the man who made that appeal. <milestone n="147"
                  unit="section"/> When we had gone before the praetor's tribunal, he deliberates,
                forsooth, diligently and carefully what decision he shall give; for, before I say
                one word, he rises from his seat and departs. And so we departed from the forum when
                it was now nearly evening. <milestone n="66" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>The next day, the first thing in the morning, I beg of him to allow the Syracusans
                to give me a copy of the resolution which they had passed the day before. But he
                refuses, and says that it is a great shame for me to have made a speech in a Greek
                senate; and that, as for my having spoken in the Greek language to Greeks, that was
                a thing which could not be endured at all. I answered the man as I could, as I
                chose, and as I ought. Among other things, I recollect that I said that it was easy
                to be seen how great was the difference between him and the great Numidicus, the
                real and genuine Metellus. That that Metellus had refused to assist with his
                panegyric Lucius Lucullus, his sister's husband, with whom he was on the very best
                terms, but that he was procuring panegyrics from cities for a man totally
                unconnected with himself, by violence and compulsion. <milestone n="148"
                  unit="section"/> But when I understood that it was many recent messengers, and
                many letters, not of introduction but of credit, that had had so much influence over
                him, at the suggestion of the Syracusans themselves I make a seizure of those
                documents in which the resolutions of the senate were recorded. And now behold a
                fresh confusion and strife. That, however, you may not suppose that he was without
                any friends or connections at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse"
                >Syracuse</placeName>, that he was entirely desolate and forsaken, a man of the name
                of Theomnastus, a man ridiculously crazy, whom the Syracusans call Theoractus. <note
                  anchored="yes">Theoractus seems a sort of nickname, to indicate his insanity,
                  being derived from <foreign lang="greek">*qeo/s</foreign>, God, and <foreign

                man in such a condition, that the boys follow him, and that every one laughs at him
                every time he opens his mouth. But his craziness, which is ridiculous to others, was
                then in truth very troublesome to me. For while he was foaming at the mouth, his
                eyes glaring, and he crying out as loud as he could that I was attacking him with
                violence, we came together before the tribunal. <milestone n="149" unit="section"/>
                Then I began to beg to be allowed to seal up and carry away the records. He spoke
                against me; he denied that there had been any regular resolution of the senate
                passed, since an appeal had been made to the praetor. He said that a copy of it
                ought not to be given to me. I read the act, that I was to be allowed all documents
                and records. He, like a crazy man as he was, urged that our laws had nothing to do
                with him. That intelligent praetor decided that he did not choose, as the resolution
                of the senate had no business ever to be ratified, to allow me to take a copy of it
                to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. Not to make a long story of it,
                if I had not threatened the man vigorously, if I had not read to him the provisions
                of the act passed in this case, and the penalties enacted by it, I should not have
                been allowed to have the documents. But that crazy fellow, who had declaimed against
                me most violently on behalf of Verres, when he found he did not succeed, in order I
                suppose to recover my favour, gives me a book in which all Verres's Syracusan thefts
                were set down, which I had already been informed of by, and had a list of from them.

              <p>Now, then, let the Mamertines praise you, who are the only men of all that large
                province who wish you to get off, but let them praise you on condition that Heius,
                who is the chief man of that deputation, is present; let them praise you on
                condition that they are here, ready to reply to me on those points concerning which
                they are questioned. And that they may not be taken by surprise on a sudden, this is
                what I shall ask them:&mdash;Are they bound to furnish a ship to the Roman
                people? They will admit it. Have they supplied it while Verres was praetor? They
                will say, No. Have they built an enormous transport at the public expense which they
                have given to Verres? They will not be able to deny it. Has Verres taken corn from
                them to send to the Roman people, as his predecessor did? They will say, No. What
                soldiers or sailors have they furnished during those three years? They will say they
                furnished none at all. They will not be able to deny that <placeName

                all his robberies. They will confess that an immense quantity of things were
                exported from that city; and besides that, that this large vessel given to him by
                the Mamertines, departed loaded when the praetor left <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName>. <milestone n="151" unit="section"/> You are welcome, then, to
                that panegyric of the Mamertines. As for the city of <placeName
                  key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, we see that that feels towards you as
                it has been treated by you; and among them that infamous Verrean festival,
                instituted by you, has been abolished. In truth, it was a most unseemly thing for
                honours such as belong to the gods to be paid to the man who had carried off the
                images of the gods. In truth, that conduct of the Syracusans would be deservedly
                reproached, If, when they had struck a most celebrated and solemn day of festival
                games out of their annals, because on that day <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse"
                  >Syracuse</placeName> was said to have been taken by Marcellus, they should,
                notwithstanding, celebrate a day of festival in the name of Verres; though he had
                plundered the Syracusans of all which that day of disaster had left them. But
                observe the shamelessness and arrogance of the man, O judges, who not only
                instituted this disgraceful and ridiculous Verrean festival out of the money of
                Heraclius, but who also ordered the Marcellean festival to be abolished, in order
                that they might every year offer sacrifices to the man by whose means they had lost
                the sacred festivals which they had ever observed, and had lost their national
                deities, and that they might take away the festival days in honour of that family by
                whose means they had recovered all their other festivals.</p>

                <head>The Argument.</head>
                <p>This speech is divided into three divisions. First of all Cicero speaks of the
                  conduct of Verres with respect to the war of the runaway slaves, which arose out
                  of the relics of the war of Spartacus, which was brought to a termination just
                  before the end of Verres's praetorship. In the second place he speaks of his
                  conduct with respect to the pirates and banditti, who at that time infested the
                  sea and the coasts of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>. And in the
                  third place he impeaches him on account of the punishments he had inflicted on
                  Roman citizens. But this last topic takes up, comparatively speaking, but a small
                  part of the oration, though it has given the title to the whole oration. In the
                  first two divisions of the speech Cicero is mainly occupied in replying to
                  Hortensius, who had highly extolled Verres's military conduct and valour. </p>
              </argument>
              <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/>
              <milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
              <p>I see, O judges, that it is not doubtful to any one of you that Caius Verres most
                openly plundered everything in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>,
                whether sacred or profane, whether private or public property; and that, not only
                without the slightest scruple, but without even the very least disguise, he
                practiced every possible description of robbery and plunder. But a very heightened
                and pompous defence of him is put forward in reply to me, which I must consider very
                carefully beforehand, O judges, how I am to resist. For his cause is stated in this
                way; that by his valour, and by his singular vigilance exerted at a critical and
                perilous time, the province of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> was
                preserved in safety from fugitive slaves, and from the dangers of war. <milestone
                  n="2" unit="section"/> What am I to do, O judges? In what way am I to shape my
                accusation? which way am I to turn? For to all my attacks the appellation of a
                gallant general is opposed, as a wall of defence. I am acquainted with the
                topic;&mdash;I see how Hortensius is going to boast himself. He will dilate upon
                the dangers of the war, the critical time of the republic, the scarcity of able
                generals; and that he will entreat of you, he will even claim as a right belonging
                to himself, that you do not suffer so great a general to be taken from the Roman
                people through the evidence of the Sicilians; that you do not allow his glory as a
                general to be overclouded by accusations of avarice. <milestone n="3" unit="section"
                /> I cannot dissemble my alarm, O judges; I am afraid that Caius Verres, on account
                of this amazing warlike valour of his, may escape with impunity from the
                consequences of all his actions. For it occurs to me, what great influence, what
                exceeding authority, the oration of Marcus Antonius was supposed to have had at the
                trial of Marcus Aquillius; who, as he was not only skillful as an orator, but bold
                also, when he had nearly finished his speech, took hold of Marcus Aquillius and
                placed him in the sight of every one, and tore his robe away from his chest, in
                order that the Roman people and the judges might see his scars, all received in
                front; and at the same time he enlarged a good deal on that wound which he had
                received on his head from the general of the enemy; and worked up the men who were
                to judge in the cause to such a pitch, that they were greatly afraid lest the man
                whom fortune had saved from the weapons of the enemy, and who had not spared
                himself, should appear to have been saved not to receive praise from the Roman
                people, but to endure the cruelty of the judges. Now again this same plan and method
                of defence is to be tried by the opposite party. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                The same object is aimed at. He may be a thief, he may be a robber of temples, he
                may he the very chief man in every sort of vice and criminality; but he is a gallant
                general and a fortunate one, and he must be preserved for the critical emergencies
                of the republic. <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>I will not plead against you according to strict law; I will not urge that point,
                which perhaps I ought to carry if I did, that as this trial is appointed to take
                place according to a particular formula, the point that required to be proved by
                you, is not what gallant exploits you may have performed in war, but how you have
                kept your hands from other people's money,&mdash;I will not, I say, urge this;
                but I will ask, as I perceive you are desirous that I should, what has been your
                conduct and what have been your great exploits in war. <milestone n="5"
                  unit="section"/>
              </p>
              <p>What will you say? That in the war of the runaway slaves <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> was delivered by your valour? It is a great
                praise; a very honourable boast. But in what war? For we have understood that after
                that war which Marcus Aquillius finished, there has been no war of fugitive slaves
                in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>. Oh! but there was in <placeName
                  key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>. I admit that; a great and formidable war. Do
                you then attempt to claim for yourself any part of the credit arising from that war?
                Do you think that you are to share any of the glory of that victory with Marcus
                Crassus or Cnaeus Pompeius? I do not suppose that even this will be too great a
                stretch for your impudence, to venture to say something of that sort. You, forsooth,
                hindered any part of the forces of these slaves from passing over from <placeName
                  key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> into <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName>? Where? When? From what part of <placeName key="tgn,1000080"
                  >Italy</placeName>, as they never attempted to approach <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> in any ships or vessels of any sort? For we
                never heard anything whatever of such an attempt; but we have heard that care was
                taken, by the courage and prudence of Marcus Crassus, that most valiant man, that
                the runaways should not make boats so as to be able to cross the strait to
                  <placeName key="tgn,7003897">Messana</placeName>; an attempt from which it would
                not have been so important to have cut them off, if there were supposed to have been
                any forces in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> able to oppose their

              <p>What has the proximity of the countries to do with either side of the argument in
                discussing this topic? Will you say that access was very easy to the enemy, or that
                the contagion and temptation of imitating that war was a dangerous one? Every access
                to the island was not only difficult to, but was entirely cut off from men who had
                no ships; so that it was more easy for those men, to whom you say that <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> was so near, to go to the shore of the ocean
                than to Cape Pelorus. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> But as for the contagious
                nature to that servile war, why is it spoken of by you more than by all the rest of
                the officers who were governors of the other provinces? Is it because before that
                time there had been wars of runaway slaves in <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName>? But that is the very cause why that province is now and has
                been in the least danger. For ever since Marcus Aquillius left it all the
                regulations and edicts of the praetors have been to this effect, that no slave
                should ever be seen with a weapon. What I am going to mention is an old story, and
                one, probably, owing to the severity of the example, not unknown to any one of you.
                They tell a story that Lucius Domitius was praetor in <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName>, and that an immense boar was brought to him; that he,
                marveling at the size of the beast, asked who had killed it. When he was told that
                it was such-an-one's shepherd, he ordered him to be summoned before him; that the
                shepherd came eagerly to the praetor, expecting praise and reward; that Domitius
                asked him how he had slain so huge a beast; that he answered &ldquo;With a
                hunting spear;&rdquo; and that he was instantly crucified by order of the
                praetor. This may, perhaps, appear harsh: I say nothing either way; all that I
                understand from the story is, that Domitius preferred to appear cruel in punishing,
                to seeming negligent in overlooking offences. <milestone n="4" unit="chapter"
                  /><milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>Therefore, while these were the established regulations of the province, Caius
                Norbanus, a man neither very active nor very valiant, was at perfect ease, at the
                very moment that all <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> was raging with
                the servile war. For at that time <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>
                easily took care of itself, so that no war could possibly arise there. In truth, as
                no two things are so closely united as the traders are with the Sicilians, by habit,
                by interest, by reason, and by community of sentiment; and as the Sicilians have all
                their affairs in such a state that it is most desirable for them to be at peace; and
                as they are so attached to the sway of the Roman people that they would be very
                sorry that its power should be diminished or altered; and as ever since the servile
                war all such dangers as these have been provided for, both by the regulations of the
                praetors, and by the discipline of the masters; there is no conceivable domestic
                evil which can arise out of the province itself. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                What then do you say? Were there no disturbances of slaves in <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> while Verres was praetor? Are no conspiracies
                said to have taken place? None at all that have ever come to the knowledge of the
                senate and people of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>; none which that
                man has thought worth writing public despatches to <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
                  >Rome</placeName> about; and yet I do suspect that the body of slaves had begun to
                be less orderly in some parts of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>;
                and I infer that, not so much from any overt act, as from the actions and decrees of
                Verres. And see with how little of a hostile feeling I am going to conduct this
                case. I myself will mention and bring forward the things which he wishes to have
                mentioned, and which as yet you have never heard of. <milestone n="10"
                  unit="section"/> In the district of Triocala, a place which the fugitive slaves
                had occupied before, the family of a certain Sicilian called Leonidas was implicated
                in suspicion of a conspiracy. Information of the matter was laid before Verres.
                Immediately, as was natural, by his command, the men who had been named were
                arrested and taken to <placeName key="tgn,7003850">Lilybaeum</placeName>. Their
                master was summoned to appear, and after the case had been heard they were
                condemned. <milestone n="5" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>What happened afterwards? What do you suppose? Perhaps you expect to hear of some
                robbery or plunder;&mdash;do not look on all occasions for the same
                things&mdash;when a man is in fear of war, what room is there for petty thefts?
                However, even if there was any opportunity for such a thing in this matter, it was
                overlooked. Perhaps he could have got some money out of Leonidas when he summoned
                him to appear. There was besides room for bargaining, (and that was an opportunity
                that he was not new to,) to get the cause adjourned; and a second chance, to get the
                slaves acquitted. But when the slaves had been condemned, what opportunity of
                plundering could there be? They must be brought up for punishment. For there were
                the witnesses who were sitting on the bench; the public records were witnesses; that
                most splendid city of <placeName key="tgn,7003850">Lilybaeum</placeName> was a
                witness; that most honourable and numerous assembly of Roman citizens was a witness.
                Nothing can be done; they must be brought up. Accordingly, they are brought up, and
                fastened to the stake. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Even now, O judges, you
                seem to me to be waiting to see what happened next; because that man never did
                anything without some gain and some booty. What could be done in such a case? What
                is profitable? Expect then to hear of some crime as infamous as you please; but I
                will outdo all your expectation. The men who had been convicted of wickedness and
                conspiracy, who had been delivered up for punishment, who had been bound to the
                stake, on a sudden, in the sight of many thousands of men, are unbound and restored
                to Leonidas their master. What can you say on this topic, O most insane of men?
                except, indeed, that which I do not ask you; what, in short, in so nefarious a
                business, although there can be no doubt about it, still, even if there were a
                doubt, ought not to be asked; namely, what or how much money you took to release
                them, and how you managed it. I give up the whole of this to you; and I release you
                from this anxiety; for I am not afraid of any one believing that you, without any
                payment, undertook an action which no man in the world except you could have been
                induced to undertake by any sum of money whatever. But about that system of thieving
                and plundering of yours I say nothing;&mdash;what I am now discussing is your
                renown as a general. <milestone n="6" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="12"

              <p>What do you say, O you admirable guardian and defender of the province? Did you
                dare to snatch from the very jaws of death and to release slaves whom you had
                decided were eager to take arms and to make war in <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName>, and whom in accordance with the opinion of your colleagues on
                the bench you had sentenced, after they had been already delivered up to punishment
                after the manner of our ancestors and had been bound to the stake, in order to
                reserve for Roman citizens the cross which you had erected for condemned slaves?
                Ruined cities, when their affairs are all desperate, are often accustomed to these
                disastrous scenes, to have those who have been condemned restored to their original
                position; those who have been bound, released; those who have been banished,
                restored; decisions which have been given, rescinded. And when such events take
                place, there is no one who is not aware that that state is hastening to its fall.
                When such things take place, there is no one who thinks that there is any hope of
                safety left. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> And whenever these things do take
                place, their effect has been to cause popular or high-born men to be relieved from
                punishment or exile; still, not by the very men who have passed the sentences;
                still, not instantly; still, not if they have been convicted of those crimes which
                affected the lives and property of all the citizens. Still this is an utterly
                unprecedented step, and of such a character as to appear credible rather from
                consideration of who the criminal is, than from consideration of the case itself
                That a man should have released slaves; that that very man who had sentenced them
                should release them; that he should release them, in a moment, out of the very jaws
                of death, that he should release slaves convicted of a crime which affected the life
                and existence of every free man&mdash; <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> O
                splendid general, not to be compared now to Marcus Aquillius, a most valiant man,
                but to the Paulli, the Scipios, and the Marii! That a man should have had such
                foresight at a time of such alarm and danger to the province! As he saw that the
                minds of all the slaves in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> were in
                an unsettled state on account of the war of the runaway slaves in <placeName
                  key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, what was the great terror he struck into them
                to prevent any one's daring to stir? He ordered them to be arrested&mdash;who
                would not he alarmed? He ordered their masters to plead their cause&mdash;what
                could be so terrible to slaves? He pronounced &ldquo;That they appeared to have
                done....&rdquo; He seems to have extinguished the rising flame by the pain and
                death of a few. What follows next? Scourgings, and burnings, and all those extreme
                agonies which are part of the punishment of condemned criminals, and which strike
                terror into the rest, torture and the cross? From all these punishments they are
                released. Who can doubt that he must have overwhelmed the minds of the slaves with
                the most abject fear, when they saw a praetor so good-natured as to allow the lives
                of men condemned of wickedness and conspiracy to be redeemed from punishment, the
                very executioner acting as the go-between to negotiate the terms? <milestone n="7"

              <p>What more? Did you not act in the same manner in the case of Aristodemus of

                  >Megara</placeName>? What more? Did that unquiet state of the slaves, and that
                sudden suspicion of war, inspire you with any additional diligence in guarding the
                province, or with a new plan for acquiring most scandalous gain? When at your
                instigation the steward of Eumenides of Halicya, a highborn and honourable man of
                great wealth, was accused of some crime, you got sixty thousand <foreign lang="la"
                  >sesterces</foreign> from his master, and he lately explained to us, as a witness
                on his oath, how you managed it. From Caius Matrinius, a Roman knight, you took in

                hundred thousand <foreign lang="la">sesterces</foreign>, because you said that his

                Caius Matrinius, who paid you that money, deposed to this fact; Caius Matrinius
                himself made the same statement, and that most illustrious man, Cnaeus Lentulus the
                censor, who quite recently has both sent letters to you himself, and has procured
                others to be sent to you for the purpose of doing honour to Caius Matrinius, will
                prove the same thing. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> What more? Is it possible
                to pass over the case of Apollonius, the son of Diocles, a Panormitan, whose surname
                is Geminus? Can anything be mentioned which is more notorious in the whole of
                  <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>? anything which is more
                scandalous? anything which is more fully proved? This man Verres, as soon as he came
                to <placeName key="perseus,Panormus">Panormus</placeName>, ordered to be summoned
                before him, and to be cited before his tribunal, in the presence of a great number
                of the Roman settlers in that city. Men immediately began to talk; to wonder how it
                was that Apollonius, a wealthy man, had so long remained free from his attacks.
                &ldquo;He has devised some plan; he has brought some charge against him; a rich
                man is not summoned in a hurry by Verres without some object.&rdquo; All are in
                the greatest state of anxiety to see what is to happen, when on a sudden Apollonius
                himself runs up, out of breath, with his young son; for his father, a very old man,
                had been for some time confined to his bed. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/>
                Verres names one of his slaves, who he said was the manager of his flocks; says that
                he has formed a conspiracy, and excited slaves in other households. He had actually
                no such slave in his family at all. He orders him to be produced instantly.
                Apollonius asserts that he has no slave whatever of that name. Verres orders the man
                to be hurried from the tribunal, and to be cast into prison. He began to cry out,
                while he was being hurried off, that the, unhappy man that he was, had done nothing;
                had committed no offence; that his money was all out at loan, that ready money he
                had none. While he kept making these declarations in a very numerous assembly of
                people, so that every one could understand that he was treated with this bitter
                injustice and violence because he had not given Verres money,&mdash;while, I
                say, he kept making these statements about his money at the top of his voice, he was
                thrown into prison. <milestone n="8" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="18"

              <p>See now the consistency of the praetor, and of that praetor who, now being on his
                trial, is not defended as a tolerable praetor, but is extolled as an admirable
                general. While a war of slaves was dreaded, he released condemned slaves from the
                same punishment which he inflicted on their masters who were not condemned. He threw
                into prison, under pretence of a servile war, without a trial, Apollonius, a most
                wealthy man, who if the runaway slaves had kindled a war in <placeName

                the slaves whom he himself, with the agreement of his assessors, decided had
                conspired together for the purpose of war, those, without the consent of his
                assessors, of his own accord, he released from all punishment. <milestone n="19"
                  unit="section"/> What more shall I say? If anything was done by Apollonius to
                justify his being punished, shall we conduct this affair in such a manner as to
                impute it as a crime to the defendant, as to seek to excite ill-feeling against him,
                if he has judged a man rather too harshly? I will not act in so bitter a spirit. I
                will not adopt the usual method of accusers, so as to disparage anything which may
                have been done mercifully, as having been so done out of indifference; or, if
                anything has been punished with severity, so as to pervert that into a charge of

                were ever so much in fault, still an honourable man of a most honourable city ought
                not to have been so severely punished without a trial. <milestone n="21"

              <p>All those topics I will abandon, I will spare you them. For I know beforehand what
                Hortensius will say in your defence. He will confess that with Verres neither the
                old age of Apollonius's father, nor the youth of his son, nor the tears of both, had
                more influence than the advantage and safety of the republic. He will say that the
                affairs of the republic cannot be administered without terror and severity; he will
                ask why the <foreign lang="la">fasces</foreign> are borne before the praetors, why
                the axes are given to them, why prisons have been built, why so many punishments
                have been established against the wicked by the usage of our ancestors. And when he
                has said all this with becoming gravity and sternness, I will ask him why Verres all
                of a sudden ordered this same Apollonius to be released from prison, without any
                fresh circumstances having been brought to light, without any defence having been
                made, or any trial having taken place? And I will affirm that there is so much
                suspicion attached to this charge, that, without any arguments of mine, I will allow
                the judges to form their own opinion as to what a system of plundering this was, how
                infamous, how scandalous, and what an immense and boundless field it opens for
                inordinate gain. <milestone n="23" unit="section"/> For first of all consider for a
                moment how many and how grievous were the evils which that man inflicted on
                Apollonius; and then calculate them and estimate them by money. You will find that
                they were all so continued in the case of this one wealthy man, as by their example
                to cause a fear of similar suffering and danger to all others. In the first place,
                there was a sudden accusation of a capital and detestable crime; judge what you
                think this worth, and how many have bought themselves off from such charges. In the
                next place, there is an accusation without an accuser, a sentence without any bench
                of judges, a condemnation without any defence having been made. Estimate the money
                to be got by all these transactions, and then suppose that Apollonius alone was an
                actual victim to these atrocities, but that all the rest, as many as they were,
                delivered themselves from these sufferings by money. Lastly, there were darkness,
                chains, imprisonment, punishment within the prison, seclusion from the sight of his
                parents and of his children, a denial of the free air and common light of heaven;
                but these things, which a man might freely give his life to escape, I am unable to
                estimate by the standard of money. <milestone n="24" unit="section"/> From all these
                things did Apollonius after a long time ransom himself, when he was worn out with
                suffering and misery; but still he taught the rest to meet that man's wickedness and
                avarice beforehand. Unless you think that a wealthy man was selected for so
                incredible an accusation without any object of gain; or that, again, he was on a
                sudden released from prison without any corresponding reason; or that this method of
                plundering was used and tried in the case of that man alone, and that terror was
                not, by means of his example, held out to and struck into every rich man in
                  <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>. <milestone n="10" unit="chapter"

              <p>I wish, O judges, to be prompted by him, since I am speaking of his military
                renown, if by accident I pass over anything. For I seem to myself to have spoken of
                all his exploits which are connected with his suspicion of a servile war; at all
                events I have not omitted anything intentionally. You are in possession of the man's
                wisdom, and diligence, and vigilance; and of his guardianship and defence of the
                province. The main thing is, as there are many classes of generals, for you to know
                to what class he belongs. But that, in the present dearth of brave men, you may not
                be ignorant of such a commander as he is, know,&mdash;I beg you, O judges, to be
                aware, that his is not the wisdom of Quintus Maximus, nor the promptness of action
                belonging to that great man the elder Africanus, nor the singular prudence of the
                Africanus of later times, nor the method and discipline of Paulus Aemilius, nor the
                vigour and courage of Caius Marcus; but that he is to be esteemed and taken care of
                as belonging to quite a different class of generals. <milestone n="26"
                  unit="section"/> In the first place, see how easy and pleasant to himself Verres
                by his own ingenuity and wisdom made the labour of marches, which is a labour of the
                greatest importance in all military affairs, and most especially necessary in
                  <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>. First, in the winter season he
                devises for himself this admirable remedy against the severity of the cold and the
                violence of storms and floods; he selected the city of <placeName
                  key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, the situation of which and the nature
                of its soil and atmosphere are said to be such that there never yet was a day of
                such violent and turbulent storms, that men could not see the sun at some time or
                other in the day. Here that gallant general was quartered in the winter months, so
                securely that it was not easy to see him, I will not say out of the house, but even
                out of bed. So the shortness of the day was consumed in banquets, the length of the
                night in adulteries and debaucheries. <milestone n="27" unit="section"/> But when it
                began to be spring, the beginning of which he was not used to date from the west
                wind, or from any star, but he thought that spring was beginning when he had seen
                the rose, then he devoted himself to labour and to marches; and in these he proved
                himself so patient and active that no one ever once saw him sitting on a horse.
                  <milestone n="11" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>For, as was the custom of the kings of <placeName key="tgn,7016608"
                  >Bithynia</placeName>, he was borne on a litter carried by eight men, in which was
                a cushion, very beautiful, of Melitan manufacture, stuffed with roses. And he
                himself had one chaplet on his head, another on his neck, and kept putting a network
                bag to his nose, made of the finest thread, with minute interstices, full of roses.
                Having performed his march in this manner, when he came to any town he was carried
                in the same litter up to his chamber. Thither came the magistrates of the Sicilians,
                thither came the Roman knights, as you have heard many of them state on their oaths;
                there disputes were secretly communicated to him; and from thence, a little while
                afterwards, decrees were openly brought down. Then, when for a while he had
                dispensed the laws for bribery, and not out of considerations of justice, he thought
                that now the rest of his time was due to Venus and to Bacchus. <milestone n="28"
                  unit="section"/> And when speaking of this, I must not omit the admirable and
                singular diligence of this great general. For know that there is no town in all
                  <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> of those in which the praetors are
                accustomed to stay and hold their court, in which there was not some woman selected
                for him out of some respectable family, to gratify his lust. Some of them were even
                openly present at his banquets. If there were some a little modest, they used to
                come at the proper time, and avoided the light of day, and the crowd. And these
                banquets were celebrated, not with the orderly silence of the banquets of praetors
                and generals of the Roman people, nor with that modesty which is usually found at
                the entertainments of magistrates, but with the most excessive noise and licence of
                conversation sometimes even affairs proceeded to blows and fighting. For that strict
                and diligent praetor, who had never obeyed the laws of the Roman people, observed
                most carefully those rules which are laid down for drinking parties. And accordingly
                the ends of these banquets were such that men were often carried out from the feast
                as from a battle; others were left on the ground as dead; numbers lay prostrate
                without sense or feeling, so that any one who beheld the scene would have supposed
                that he was looking not on a banquet of a praetor, but on the battle of <placeName

                  /><milestone n="29" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>But when the middle of summer began to be felt, the time that all the praetors in
                  <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> have been accustomed to devote to
                their journeys, because they think that the best time for travelling over the
                province where the corn is on the threshing-floor, because at that time all the
                members of a household are collected together, and the number of a person's slaves
                is seen, and the work that is done is most easily observed; the abundance of the
                harvest invites travel and the season of the year is no obstacle to it; then, I say,
                when all other praetors are used to travel about, that general of a new sort pitched
                himself a permanent camp in the most beautiful spot in <placeName
                  key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>. <milestone n="30" unit="section"/>
                For at the very entrance and mouth of the harbour, where first the bay begins to
                curve from the shore of the open sea towards the city, he pitched tents of fine
                linen curtains; thither he migrated from the praetorian palace which had belonged to
                king Hiero, and lived here so that during the whole summer no one ever saw him out
                of his tent. And to that tent no one had access unless he was either a boon
                companion, or a minister of his lust. Hither came all the women with whom he had any
                intrigue, and of these it is incredible how great a number there was at <placeName
                  key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>. Hither came men worthy of that man's
                friendship, worthy associates in that course of life also those banquets. Among such
                men and such women as these, his son, now grown up, spent his time; in order that if
                nature removed him at all from the likeness to his father, still use and constant
                training might make him resemble him. <milestone n="31" unit="section"/> That Tertia
                whom I have spoken of before, having been tempted by trick and artifice to leave her
                Rhodian flute-player and to come hither, is reported to have caused great
                disturbance in that camp; as the wife of Cleomenes the Syracusan, a woman of noble
                birth, and the wife of Aeschrio, a woman of very respectable patronage, were very
                indignant that the daughter of Isidorus the buffoon should be admitted into their
                company. But that Hannibal, who thought that in his army there ought to be no
                rivalry of birth, but only of merit, was so much in love with this Tertia, that he
                carried her with him out of the province. <milestone n="13" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>And all that time, while that man, clad in a purple cloak and a tunic reaching to
                his ankles, was reveling in banquets with women, men were not offended, nor in the
                least vexed that the magistrate was absent from the forum that the laws were not
                administered, that the courts of justice were not held; that all that shore
                resounded with women's vices, and music and songs. They were not, I say, at all
                vexed at there being a total silence in the forum, no pleading, and no law. For it
                was not law or the court of justice that seemed to be absent from the forum, but
                violence and cruelty, and the bitter and shameful robbery of good men. <milestone
                  n="32" unit="section"/> Do you then, O Hortensius, defend this man on the ground
                of his having been a general? Do you endeavour to conceal his thefts, his rapine,
                his cupidity, his cruelty, his pride, his wickedness, his audacity, by dwelling on
                the greatness of his exploits and his renown as a commander? No doubt I have cause
                to fear here, that at the end of your defence you may have recourse to the old
                conduct of Antonius, and to his mode of ending a speech; that Verres may be brought
                forward, his breast bared, that the Roman people may see his scars, inflicted by the
                bites of women, traces of lust and profligacy. <milestone n="33" unit="section"/>
                May the gods grant that you may venture to make mention of military affairs and of

                be aware, not only what he has been as a commander, but also how he behaved as a
                soldier in his campaigns. That first campaign of his shall be brought up again, in
                which he was, as he says himself, subservient to others, not their master. The camp

                brought: up again, where, though he were assiduous in his attendance, he still lost

                /> But afterwards, when he had become hardened by a long course of such
                infamy,&mdash;when he had sated others, not himself,&mdash;why need I relate
                what sort of man he turned out? what carefully guarded defences of modesty and
                chastity he broke down by violence and audacity? or why should I connect the
                disgrace of an, one else with his profligacy? I will not do so, O judges. I will
                pass over all old stories; I will only mention two recent achievements of his,
                without fixing infamy on any one else; and by those you will be able to conjecture
                the rest. One of them is, that it was so notorious to every one, that during the
                consulship of Lucius Lucullus and Marcus Cotta, no one ever came up from any
                municipal town to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> on any law
                business, who was so ill-informed of what was going on as not to know that all the
                laws of the Roman people were regulated by the will and pleasure of Chelidon the
                prostitute. The other is that, after he had left the city in the robe of
                war,&mdash;after he had pronounced the solemn vows for the success of his
                administration, and for the common welfare of the republic, he was accustomed, for
                the sake of committing adultery, to be brought back into the city, at night, in a
                litter, to a woman who, though the wife of one man, was common to all men, contrary
                to law, contrary to what was required by the auspices, contrary to everything which
                is held sacred among gods and men. <milestone n="14" unit="chapter"/><milestone

                So may your good opinion and that of the Roman people approve of my intentions, and
                sanction my hopes for the rest of my life, as I have received those offices with
                which the Roman people has as yet entrusted me with the feeling that I was bound to
                a conscientious discharge of every possible duty. I was appointed quaestor with the
                feeling that that honour was not given to me so much as lent and entrusted to me. I
                obtained the quaestorship in the province of <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName>, and considered that every man's eyes were turned upon me
                alone. So that I thought that I and my quaestorship were being exhibited on some
                theatre open to the whole world; so that I denied myself all those things which seem
                to be indulgences, not merely to those irregular passions, but even those which are
                coveted by nature itself and by necessity. <milestone n="36" unit="section"/> Now I
                am aedile elect, I consider what it is that I have received from the Roman people; I
                consider that I am bound to celebrate holy games with the most solemn ceremonies to
                <persName><surname>Ceres</surname></persName>, to Bacchus, and to Libera; that I
                am bound to render Flora propitious to the Roman nation and people by the splendour
                of her games; that it is my office to celebrate those most ancient games, which were
                the first that were ever called Roman games, with the greatest dignity and with all
                possible religious observance, in honour of Juno, <persName><surname>Jupiter</surname></persName>, and Minerva; that the charge of protecting all the sacred
                buildings and the whole city is entrusted to me; that as a recompense for all that
                labour and anxiety these honours are granted to me,&mdash;an honourable
                precedence in delivering my opinion in the senate; a <foreign lang="la">toga

                that all the gods may be propitious to me, as I do not receive by any means so much
                pleasure from all these things, (though the honours conferred on me by the people
                are most acceptable to me,) as I feel anxiety, and as I will take pains, that this
                aedileship may not seem to have been given to some one of the candidates, because it
                could not be helped, but to have been conferred on me because it was proper that it
                should be, and to have been conferred by the deliberate judgment of the people.

                time,&mdash;but when you were appointed, as I have said, were you not roused by
                the very voice of the crier, who made such frequent announcements that you had been

                some part of the republic had been entrusted to you? that for that one year you must
                do without the house of a prostitute? When it fell to you by lot to preside in the
                court of justice, did you never consider what an important affair, what a burden you

                man's life protected, no woman's chastity fortified, against your cupidity and
                audacity; in which you behaved yourself in such a way that, being detected in
                everything, you take refuge in an imaginary war of runaway slaves; by which you now
                perceive, that not only no defence is procured for you, but that an immense body of
                accusations is raised up against you; unless, indeed, you are going to speak of the
                relics of the war in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, and the
                disaster of Temsa. <note anchored="yes">Temsa is a town of the Bruttii, whither some
                  of the relics of Spartacus's army had fled. Verres had passed through it, or close
                  to it, on his return from <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>.</note>
                But when your fortune recently conducted you to that place, at a most seasonable
                time, if you had any courage, or any energy, you were found to be the same man that
                you had ever been. <milestone n="16" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="40"

              <p>When the men of <placeName key="tgn,7008769">Valentia</placeName> had come to you,
                and when a noble and an eloquent man, Marcus Marius, was addressing you on their
                behalf, begging you to undertake the business, and, as the power and the name of
                praetor belonged to you, to act as their chief and leader in extinguishing that
                small band that was at Temsa, you not only shunned that task, but at that very time,
                while you were on the shore, that dear Tertia of yours, whom you were carrying with
                you, was there in the sight of all men. And to the deputies from <placeName
                  key="tgn,7008769">Valentia</placeName>, such an illustrious and noble
                municipality, you gave no answer at all in matters of such moment, while you were
                still in your dark-coloured tunic and cloak. What can you, O judges, suppose that
                this man did while on his journey? what can you suppose he did in the province
                itself who, when he was on his way from his province, not to celebrate a triumph,
                but to be put on his trial, did not avoid a scandal which could not have been
                accompanied by any pleasure. <milestone n="41" unit="section"/> Oh! the noble murmur
                of the crowd in the temple of Bellona! You recollect, O judges, when it was getting
                towards evening, and when mention had been made a short time before of this disaster
                at Temsa, when no one was found who could be sent into those districts with a
                military command, that some one said that Verres was not far from Temsa. You
                recollect how universally every one murmured; how openly the chief men repudiated
                the suggestion. And does the man who has been convicted of so many accusations by so
                many witnesses, now place any hope in the votes of those judges, who have already
                openly condemned him, even before his cause was heard? <milestone n="17"

              <p>Be it so. He has gained no credit either from any war of the runaway slaves, or
                from the suspicion of such a war; because there has neither been any such war, nor
                danger of any such war in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>; nor were
                any precautions taken by him to prevent such a war. But, at all events, against any
                war of pirates he had a fleet well equipped, and he exhibited extraordinary energy
                in that matter. And therefore, while he was praetor, the province was admirably
                defended. I will speak of the war with the pirates, and of the Sicilian fleet, when
                I have first of all solemnly stated, that with respect to this matter alone, he
                committed all his most enormous crimes,&mdash;crimes of avarice, of treason, of
                insanity, of lust and of cruelty. I beg of you to give your most diligent attention,
                as you have hitherto given it, while I briefly detail the events that took place.

              </p>
              <p>In the first place, I say, that the naval affairs were managed, not with the view
                of defending the province, but of acquiring money under presence of providing a
                fleet. Though this had been the custom of former praetors, to impose a contribution
                of ships and of a fixed number of sailors and soldiers on each city, yet you imposed
                no contribution on the very important and wealthy city of the Mamertines. What money
                the Mamertines gave you secretly for that indulgence, will be seen hereafter; we
                will ascertain that from their own letters and witnesses. <milestone n="44"
                  unit="section"/> But I assert, that a merchant vessel of the largest size, like a
                trireme, very beautiful, and highly ornamented, was openly built at the public
                expense, with the knowledge of all <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>,
                and given and presented to you by the magistrates and senate of the Mamertines. This
                ship, laden with Sicilian booty, itself being also a part of that booty, put into
                  <placeName key="perseus,Velia">Velia</placeName>, at the same time that he himself
                left the province laden with many articles, and especially with such as he did not
                like to send to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> along with the rest
                of the fruits of his robberies before he arrived himself, because they were the most
                valuable, and those which he was most fond of. I myself have lately seen that vessel
                at <placeName key="perseus,Velia">Velia</placeName>, O judges, and many other men
                have seen it too; a very beautiful and highly ornamented ship, which, indeed, seemed
                to all who beheld her, to be now looking for the banishment, and to be waiting for
                the departure of her owner. <milestone n="18" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="45"
                  unit="section"/></p>
              <p>What answer will you make to me now? Unless, perhaps, you say what, although it
                cannot possibly be admitted as an excuse, yet must be urged in a trial for
                extortion, that that ship was built with your own money. Dare, at least, to say this
                which is necessary. Do not be afraid, O Hortensius, of my asking how it became
                lawful for a senator to build a ship? Those are old and dead laws, as you are
                accustomed to call them, which forbid it. There was such a republic here, once, O
                judges; there was such strictness in the tribunals, that an accuser would have
                thought such a transaction worthy to be classed among the most serious crimes. For
                what did you want of a ship? when, if you were going anywhere on account of the
                state, ships were provided for you at the public expense, both to convey you, and to
                guard you? But it is not possible for you to go anywhere on your own private
                account, nor to send for articles across the sea from those countries in which it is
                not lawful for you to have any possessions, or any dealings. <milestone n="46"
                  unit="section"/> Then, why have you prepared anything contrary to the laws? This
                charge would have had weight in the ancient severity and dignity of the republic.
                Now, I not only do not accuse you on account of this offence, but I do not even
                reprove you with an ordinary reprimand. Lastly, did you never think that this would
                be discreditable to you? did you never think it would be ground for an accusation,
                or cause for unpopularity, to have a transport openly built for you, in a most
                frequented place in that province in which you had the supreme command? What did you
                suppose that they said who saw it? What did you suppose that they thought who heard
                of it? Did they think that you were going to take that vessel to <placeName
                  key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, empty? that you were going to let it out as a
                sailing boat, when you got to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>? No one
                would even believe that you had in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>
                any farm on the coast, and that you were preparing a merchant vessel for the purpose
                of moving your crops. Did you wish every man's conversation to be such as for men to
                say openly that you were preparing that ship to carry all your plunder from
                  <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, and to go to and fro for the
                booty which you had left behind? <milestone n="47" unit="section"/> But, however, I
                give up and grant the whole of this, if you say that the vessel was built with your
                money. But, O most demented of men, are you not aware that this ground was cut from
                under your feet by those very friends of yours, the Mamertines themselves, in the
                previous pleading? For Heius, the chief man of the city,&mdash;the chief man of
                that deputation which was sent to utter a panegyric on you, said that the ship had
                been built for you by the public labour of the Mamertines, and that a Mamertine
                Senator had been appointed by public authority to superintend the building of it.
                The only thing that remains is the materials. And this you yourself compelled the
                Rhegians to furnish at the public expense, as they say themselves (not that you can
                deny it), because the Mamertines have no proper materials. <milestone n="19"
                  unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>If both the materials of which the vessel is built, and if those who built it, were
                provided by your authority, not at your expense, what, then, is the secret thing
                which you say was paid for with your money? Oh! but the Mamertines have no enemies
                respecting it in their public accounts. <milestone n="48" unit="section"/> In the
                first place, I can understand that it may be possible that they did not disburse any
                money out of the treasury. In fact, even the Capitol, as it was built in the time of
                our ancestors, was able to be built and completed by public authority, but without
                any public payment, workmen being pressed into the service, and a fair quota of work
                being exacted from each person respectively. In the next place, I see this also,
                (which I will prove when I produce my witnesses, from the accounts of the Mamertines
                themselves,) that a great deal of money was spent by that man which was entered as
                paid for imaginary contracts for works that never existed. For it is not at all
                strange that the Mamertines should in their accounts have shown a regard for that
                man's safety, from whom they had received the greatest benefits, and whom they had
                known to be much more friendly to them than he was to the Roman people. But if it is
                any argument that the Mamertines did not give you money, because they have not got
                it down in their accounts, let it be an argument also that the ship cost you
                nothing, because you have no entry to produce of having bought it, or having made a
                contract with any one to build it for you. </p>
              <p>
                <milestone n="49" unit="section"/> Oh! but you did not command the Mamertines to
                furnish a ship, because they are one of the confederate cities. Thank God, we have a
                man trained by the hands of the Fetiales; <note anchored="yes">The <foreign
                    lang="la">Fetiales</foreign> were a college of Roman priests, who acted as the
                  guardians of the public faith; it was their province to determine the
                  circumstances under which satisfaction was to be demanded from, or hostilities
                  declared against any foreign state. They were the especial arbiters of peace, of
                  war, and of treaties. Their number was probably twenty. They were selected from
                  the most noble families, and their office was held for life. The name is of
                  uncertain derivation&mdash;See Smith, Dict. Ant. p. 416, <foreign lang="la">in
                    voce</foreign>.</note> a man above all others pious and careful in all that
                belongs to public religion. Let all the men who have been praetors before you be
                given up to the Mamertines, because they have commanded them to furnish ships
                contrary to the provisions of the treaty. But still you, O you pious and scrupulous
                man, how was it that you commanded the people of <placeName
                  key="perseus,Tauromenium">Tauromenium</placeName>, which is also a confederate
                city, to furnish a ship? Will you make any one believe that, while the case of both
                the states was exactly the same, the law that you administered, and the condition in
                which you left each, was so different, without money being the cause of the
                difference? <milestone n="50" unit="section"/> What, if I prove, O judges, that
                these two treaties with the two states were of such a nature, that in the case of
                the people of <placeName key="perseus,Tauromenium">Tauromenium</placeName> it was
                expressly provided for and guarded against in the treaty, &ldquo;that they were
                not bound to furnish a vessel;&rdquo; but that in the case of the Mamertines it
                was set down and written in the treaty itself, &ldquo;that they were bound to
                furnish a vessel;&rdquo; but that Verres, in opposition to both treaties,
                compelled the Tauromenians to furnish one, and excused the Mamertines? Can it, then,
                be doubtful to any one that, while Verres was praetor, that merchant-vessel was a
                greater assistance to the Mamertines than the treaty was to the Tauromenians? Let
                the treaties be read. [The treaties of the Mamertines and the Tauromenians with the
                Roman people are read.] <milestone n="20" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>By that act therefore, of kindness, as you call it&mdash;of corruption and
                dishonesty, as the case itself proves,&mdash;you detracted from the majesty of
                the republic, you diminished the reinforcements of the Roman people&mdash;you
                diminished their resources, acquired by the valour and wisdom of their ancestors;
                you destroyed their imperial rights, and the terms on which the allies became such,
                and all recollection of the treaty. They who by the express words of the treaty were
                bound to send at their own expense and risk a ship properly armed and equipped with
                everything necessary, even as far as the ocean if we ordered them to do so, those
                men bought from you for money a release from the terms of the treaty, and a release
                from the lights of sovereignty which we had over them, so as to be excused from even
                sailing in that narrow sea before their own houses and homes, from defending their
                own walls and harbours. <milestone n="51" unit="section"/> How much labour, and
                trouble, and money, do you suppose the Mamertines at the time of making this treaty
                would willingly have devoted to the object of preventing this bireme from being
                mentioned in it, if they could by any possibility have obtained such a favour from
                our ancestors? For when this heavy burden was imposed on the city, there was
                contained somehow or other in that treaty of alliance some badge, as it were, of
                slavery. That which then, when their services were recent, before the matter was
                finally determined, when the Roman people were in no difficulties, they could not
                obtain by treaty from our ancestors; that now, when they have done us no new
                service, after so many years,&mdash;now that it has been enforced every year by
                our right of sovereignty, and has been invariably observed&mdash;now, I say,
                when we are in great want of vessels, they have obtained from Caius Verres by
                bribery. </p>
              <p>Oh! but this is all that they have gained, exemption from furnishing a ship! Have
                the Mamertines for the last three years furnished one sailor, one soldier, to serve
                either in fleet or in garrison, all the time you have been praetor? <milestone

              <p>Lastly, when according to the resolution of the senate, and also according to the
                Terentian and Cassian law, corn was to be bought in equal proportions from all the
                cities of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, from that light burden
                also, which they shared too with all the other cities, you relieved the
                Mamertines.&mdash;You will say that the Mamertines do not owe corn. How do not
                owe corn? Do you mean to say they were not bound to sell us corn? For this corn was
                not a contribution to be exacted, but a supply to be purchased. By your permission,
                then, by your interpretation of the treaty, the Mamertines were not bound to assist
                the Roman people, even by supplying their markets, and furnishing them with
                provisions. <milestone n="53" unit="section"/> And what city, then, was bound to
                supply these things? As for those who cultivate the public domains, it is settled
                what they are bound to furnish by the Censorian Law. Why did you exact from them
                anything besides that in another class of contribution? What? Do those who are
                liable to the payment of tenths owe anything more than a single tenth, according to
                the Law of Hiero? Why have you fixed in their case also how much corn they were to
                be bound to sell to us, that being another description of contribution? Those who
                are exempt undoubtedly owe nothing. But you not only exacted this from them, but
                even by way of making them give more than they possibly could, you added to their
                burden those sixty thousand <foreign lang="la">modii</foreign> from which you
                excused the Mamertines. And this is not what I say, that this was not rightly
                exacted from the others; what I say is, that it was a scandalous thing to excuse the
                Mamertines, whose case was exactly the same, and from whom all previous praetors had
                exacted the same contribution that they did from the rest, and had paid them for it
                according to the resolution of the senate, and the law. And in order to drive in
                this indulgence with a big nail, as one may say, he takes cognisance of the cause of
                the Mamertines while sitting on the bench with his assessors, and pronounces
                judgment, that he, according to the decision of the bench, does not demand any corn
                from the Mamertines. <milestone n="54" unit="section"/> Listen to the decree of the
                mercenary praetor from his own note-book; and take notice how great his gravity is
                in framing a degree, how great his dignity is in pronouncing it. Read the next
                memorandum of his decrees. [The decree, extracted from Verres's note-book, is read.] </p>
              <p>He says, &ldquo;what he does this willingly,&rdquo; and therefore he makes
                the entry in his book. What then? suppose you had not used this word
                  &ldquo;<emph>willingly</emph>,&rdquo; should we, forsooth, have supposed
                that you made this profit unwillingly? &ldquo;And by the advice of the

                Did it seem to you, when you heard their names, that a list of assessors to a
                praetor was being read, or a roll of the troop and company of a most infamous
                bandit? <milestone n="55" unit="section"/> Here are interpreters of treaties,
                settlers of the terms of alliances, authorities as to religious obligations! Corn
                was never bought in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> by public order,
                without the Mamertines being ordered to furnish their just proportion, till that
                fellow appointed this select and admirable bench of his, in order to get money from
                them, and to act up to his invariable character. Therefore, that decree had just the
                weight that the authority of that man ought to have, who sold a decree to those men
                from whom it had been his duty to buy corn. For Lucius Metellus, the moment he
                arrived as his successor, required corn of the Mamertines, according to the
                regulations and appointment of Caius Sacerdos and Sextus Peducaeus. <milestone

              <p>Then the Mamertines perceived that they could not longer retain the privilege which
                they had bought from its unprincipled author. Come now, you, who were desirous to be
                thought such a scrupulous interpreter of treaties, tell us why you compelled the
                Tauromenians and the Netians to furnish corn; for both of those are confederate
                cities. And the Netians were not wanting to themselves, for as soon as you
                pronounced your decision that you willingly excused the Mamertines, they came before
                you, and proved to you that their case under the treaty was exactly the same. You
                could not make a different decree in a case which was identical with the other. You
                pronounce that the Netians are not bound to furnish corn, and still you exact it
                from them. Give me the papers of this same praetor referring to his decrees, and to
                the corn that was ordered to be supplied, and to the wheat that was bought. [The
                papers of the praetor referring to the decrees, to the corn ordered to be supplied,

              <p>In a case of such enormous and shameful inconsistency, what can we suspect, O
                judges, rather than that which is inevitable; either that money was not given to him
                by the Netians when he demanded it, or else that the Mamertines were given to
                understand that they had disposed of all their bribes and presents very
                advantageously, when others, whose case was identical with theirs, could not obtain
                the same privileges? <milestone n="57" unit="section"/>

              <p>Will he here again venture to make mention to me of the panegyric of the
                Mamertines? for who is there of you, O judges, who is not aware how many weapons
                that furnishes against him? In the first place, as in courts of justice it is more
                respectable for a man who cannot produce ten witnesses to speak to his character, to
                produce none at all, than not to complete the number made as it were legitimate by
                usage; so there are a great many cities in <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName> over which you were governor for three years; almost all the
                rest accuse you; a few insignificant ones, kept back by fear, say nothing; one
                speaks in your favour. What does all this show except that you are aware how
                advantageous genuine evidence to a person's character is; but that, nevertheless,
                your administration of the province was such that you are forced of necessity to do
                without that advantage? <milestone n="58" unit="section"/>
              </p>
              <p>In the next place, as I said before on another occasion, what sort of a panegyric
                is that, when the chief men of the deputation commissioned to utter it, stated, both
                that a ship had been built for you at the public expense, and also that they
                themselves had been plundered and pillaged by you in respect of their private
                property? Lastly, what else is it that these people do, when they are the only
                people in all Sicily who praise you, beyond proving to us that you gave them
                everything of which you robbed our republic? What colony is there in <placeName

                municipality is there enjoying such immunities, as to have had for all these years
                such a profitable exemption from all burdens, as the city of the Mamertines has had
                for three years? They alone have not given what they were bound to give according to
                the treaties; they alone, as long as that man was praetor, enjoyed immunity from all
                burdens; they alone under that man's authority lived in such a condition that they
                gave nothing to the Roman people, and refused nothing to Verres. <milestone n="23"

              <p>But to return to the fleet, from which topic I have been digressing; you accepted a
                ship from the Mamertines contrary to the laws; you granted them relaxation contrary
                to the treaties; so that you behaved like a rogue twice in the case of one city, as
                you both granted indulgences which you had no right to grant, and accepted what it
                was not lawful for you to accept. You ought to have exacted a ship from them fit to
                sail against robbers, not to carry off the produce of your robberies; one which
                might have defended the province from being despoiled, not one that was to bear away
                the fresh spoils of the province. The Mamertines gave you both a city to which you
                might carry all the plunder you amassed from all quarters, and also a ship, in which
                you might take it away. That town was a receptacle for your plunder, those men were
                the witnesses to and guardians of your plunder; they supplied to you both a
                repository for your thefts, and a conveyance for them. In consequence, even when you
                had lost a fleet by your own avarice and worthlessness, you did not venture to
                require a ship of the Mamertines, at a time when our want of ships was so excessive,
                and the distress of the province so great, that, even if it had been necessary to
                beg as supplicants for a ship, they would have granted it. But all your power either
                of commanding a vessel to be furnished, or of begging for one, was crippled, not by
                the bireme supplied to the Roman people, but by that splendid merchant vessel given
                to the praetor. That was the price of your authority, of the reinforcement they were
                bound to supply, of exemption from the requirements of law, and usage, and of the
                treaty. <milestone n="60" unit="section"/>

              <p>You have now the case of the trusty assistance of one city lost to us and sold. Now

                  unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>Each city was always accustomed to give to its admiral the money necessary for the
                expense of the fleet, for provisions, for pay, and for all such things. The admiral
                did not dare to give the sailors any ground for accusing him, and was, besides,
                bound to render an account of the money to his fellow-citizens. In the whole
                business all the trouble and all the risk was his. This, I say, was the regular
                course not only in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, but in every
                province, even in the case of the pay and expense of the Latin allies, at the time
                when we were accustomed to employ their assistance. Verres was the first man, ever
                since our dominion was established, who ordered that all that money should be paid
                to him by the cities, in order that whoever he chose to appoint might have the
                handling of that money. <milestone n="61" unit="section"/> Who can doubt why you
                were the first man to change the ancient custom of all your predecessors, to
                disregard the great advantage of having the money pass through the hands of others,
                and to undertake a work of such difficulty, so liable to accusation,&mdash;a
                task of such delicacy, inseparable from suspicion? After that, other sources of gain
                are established arising from this one article of the navy; just listen to their
                number, O judges;&mdash;he receives money from the cities to excuse them from
                furnishing sailors; the sailors that are furnished he releases for a bribe; he makes
                a profit of the whole of thee pay of those who are thus released; he does not pay
                the rest all that he ought to pay. All this you shall have proved to you by the
                evidence of the cities. Read the evidence of the cities. [The evidence of the cities

              <p>Did you ever hear of such a man? Did you ever hear, O judges, of such impudence? of
                such audacity? to impose on the cities the payment of a sum of money in proportion
                to the number of soldiers, and to fix a regular price, six hundred <foreign
                  lang="la">sesterces</foreign>, for the discharge of each sailor! and as those who
                paid that sum were released from service for the whole summer, Verres pocketed all
                that he received both for their pay and for their maintenance. And by this means he
                made a double profit of the discharge of one person. And this most insane of men, at
                a time of frequent invasion of pirates, and of imminent danger to the province, did
                this so openly, that the pirates themselves were aware of it, and the whole province
                was a witness to it. </p>

                <milestone n="63" unit="section"/> When, owing to this man's inordinate avarice,
                there was a fleet indeed in name in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>,
                but in reality empty ships, fit only to carry plunder for the praetor, not to strike
                terror into pirates; nevertheless, while Publius Caesetius and Publius Tadius were
                sailing about with these ten half-manned ships, they, I will not say took, but led
                away with them one ship, laden with the spoils of the pirates, evidently overwhelmed
                and sinking with the burden of its freight. That vessel was full of a number of most
                beautiful quilts, full of quantities of well-wrought plate, and of coined money;
                full of embroidered robes. This one vessel was not taken by our fleet, but was found
                at <placeName key="tgn,7017133">Megaris</placeName>, a place not far from <placeName
                  key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>. And when the news was brought to him,
                although he was lying in his tent on the shore, with a lot of women, drunk, still he
                roused himself, and immediately sent to the quaestor and to his own lieutenant many
                men to act as guards, in order that everything might be brought to him to see in an
                uninjured state, as soon as possible. <milestone n="64" unit="section"/> The vessel
                is brought to <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>. All expect
                that the pirates will be punished. He, as if it was not a case of pirates being
                taken, but of a booty being brought to him, considers all the prisoners who were old
                or ugly as enemies; those who had any beauty, or youth, or skill in anything, he
                takes away: some he distributed among his clerks, his retinue, and his son; six
                skillful musicians he sends to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> as a
                present to some friend of his. All that night he spent in unloading the ship. No one
                sees the captain of the pirate vessel, who ought to have been executed. And to this
                very day every one believes, (how much truth there is in the belief, you also may be
                able to conjecture,) that Verres secretly took money of the pirates for the release
                of the captain of the pirates. <milestone n="26" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="65"

              <p>It is only a conjecture; but no one can be a good judge who is not influenced by
                such certain grounds of suspicion. You know the man, you know the custom of all
                men,&mdash;how gladly any one who has taken a chief of pirates or of the enemy,
                allows him to be seen openly by all men. But of all the body of citizens and
                settlers at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, I never saw one
                man, O judges, who said that he had seen that captain of the pirates who had been
                taken; though all men, as is the regular custom, flocked to the prison, asked for
                him, and were anxious to see him. What happened to make that man be kept so
                carefully out of sight, that no one was ever able to get a glimpse of him, even by
                accident? Though all the seafaring men at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse"
                  >Syracuse</placeName>, who had often heard of the name of that captain, who had
                often been alarmed by him, wished to feed their eyes on, and to gratify their minds
                with his torture and execution, yet no one was allowed even to see him. <milestone
                  n="66" unit="section"/> One man, Publius Servilius, took more captains of pirates
                alive than all our commanders put together had done before. Was any one at any time
                denied the enjoyment of being allowed to see a captive pirate? On the contrary:
                wherever Servilius went he afforded every one that most delightful spectacle, of
                pirates taken prisoners and in chains. Therefore, people everywhere ran to meet him,
                so that the, assembled not only in the towns through which the pirates were led, but
                from all neighbouring towns also, for the purpose of seeing them. And why was it
                that that triumph was of all triumphs the most acceptable and the most delightful to
                the Roman people? Because nothing is sweeter than victory. But there is no more
                certain evidence of victory than to set those whom you have often been afraid of,
                led in chains to execution. <milestone n="67" unit="section"/> Why did you not act
                in this manner? Why was that pirate so concealed as if it were impiety to behold
                him? Why did you not execute him? For what object did you reserve him? Have you ever
                heard of any captain of pirates having been taken prisoner before, who was not
                executed? Tell me one original whose conduct you imitated; tell me one precedent.
                You kept the captain of the pirates alive in order, I suppose, to lead him in your
                triumph in front of your chariot. For, indeed, there was nothing wanting but for the
                naval triumph to be decreed to you on the occasion of a most beautiful fleet of the
                Roman people having been lost, and the province plundered. <milestone n="27"

              <p>Come now&mdash;you thought it better that the captain of the pirates should be
                kept in custody, according to a novel practice, than that he should be put to death
                according to universal precedent. What then is that custody? Among what people?
                Where is he kept? You have all heard of the Syracusan stone-quarries. Many of you
                are acquainted with them. It is a vast work and splendid; the work of the old kings
                and tyrants. The whole of it is cut out of rock excavated to a marvellous depth, and
                carved out by the labour of great multitudes of men. Nothing can either be made or
                imagined so closed against all escape, so hedged in on all sides, so safe for
                keeping prisoners in. Into these quarries men are commanded to be brought even from
                other cities in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, if they are
                commanded by the public authorities to be kept in custody. <milestone n="69"
                  unit="section"/> Because he had imprisoned there many Roman citizens who were his
                prisoners, and because he ordered the other pirates to be put there too, he was
                aware that if he committed this counterfeit captain of the pirates to the same
                custody, a great many men in those quarries would inquire for the real captain. And
                therefore he does not venture to commit the man to this best of all and safest of
                all places of confinement. In fact he is afraid of the whole of <placeName

                Perhaps to <placeName key="tgn,7003850">Lilybaeum</placeName>. I see; he was not
                then so entirely afraid of the seafaring men? By no means, O judges. To <placeName
                  key="perseus,Panormus">Panormus</placeName> then? I understand; although indeed,
                since he was taken within the Syracusan district, he ought, at all events, to have
                been kept in prison at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, if he
                was not to be executed there. <milestone n="70" unit="section"/> Not at <placeName
                  key="perseus,Panormus">Panormus</placeName> even. What then? where do you suppose
                it was? He sends him away to men the furthest removed from all fear or suspicion of
                pirates, as unconnected as possible with, all navigation or maritime
                affairs&mdash;to the Centuripans, a thoroughly inland people, complete farmers,
                who would never have been alarmed at the name of a naval pirate, but who, while you
                were praetor, had lived in dread of that chief of all land pirates, Apronius. And,
                that every one might easily see that Verres's object was, that that counterfeit
                might easily and cheerfully pretend to be what he was not, he enjoins the
                Centuripans to take case that he is supplied as comfortably and liberally as
                possible with food and with all things. <milestone n="28" unit="chapter"/><milestone

              <p>In the meantime, the Syracusans, acute and humane men, who were capable not only of
                seeing what was evident, but also of conjecturing what was hidden, kept an account
                every day of the pirates who were put to death; how many there ought to be they
                calculated from the size of the vessel itself which had been taken, and from the
                number of oars. He, because he had removed and taken away all who had any skill in
                anything, or any beauty, suspected that there would be an outcry if he had all the
                pirates fastened to the stake at once, as is the usual custom, because so many more
                had been taken away than were left: although on this account he had determined to
                bring them out in different parties, at different times, still in the whole city
                there was no one who did not keep a strict account and list of them; and they did
                not only wish to see the rest, but they openly demanded and claimed it. <milestone

                man began to substitute, in the room of those of the pirates whom he had taken into
                his own house, the Roman citizens whom he had previously thrown into prison; some of
                whom he accused of having been soldiers of Sertorius, and said that they had been

                pirates, while they were engaged in commerce, or else sailing with some other
                object, he accused of having been with the pirates of their own free will: and
                therefore some Roman citizens, with their heads muffled up; that they might not be
                recognised, were taken from prison to the fatal stake and to execution; others,
                though they were recognised by many Roman citizens, and though all attempted to
                defend them, were put to death. But of their most shameful death did most cruel
                tortures I will speak when I begin to discuss this topic; and I will speak with such
                feelings, that, if in the course of that complaint which I shall make of that man's
                cruelty, and of the most scandalous execution of Roman citizens, not only my
                strength, but even my life should fail me, I should think it delightful and
                honourable. <milestone n="73" unit="section"/> These then are his exploits, this is
                his splendid victory; a piratical galley was captured, the captain was released, the
                musicians were sent to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>; those with
                any good looks, any youth, or ally skill, were taken home by him; Roman citizens
                were tortured and executed in their room, and to make up their number; all the store
                of robes was taken away, all the silver and gold was taken by him and appropriated
                to his own use. <milestone n="29" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>But how did he defend himself at the former pleading? He who had been silent for so
                many days, on a sudden sprang up at the evidence of Marcus Annius, a most
                illustrious man, when he said that a Roman citizen had been executed, and that the
                captain of the pirates had not. Being roused by the consciousness of his wickedness,
                and by the frenzy which was inspired by his crimes, he said that, because be knew
                that he should be accused of having taken money, and of not having executed the real
                captain of the pirates, he had on that account not executed him, and he said that
                two captains of pirates were now in confinement in his house. <milestone n="74"
                  unit="section"/> See the clemency, or rather the marvellous and unexampled
                patience of the Roman people! Annius, a Roman knight, says that a Roman citizen was
                put to death by the hand of the executioner. You say nothing. He says that the
                captain of the pirates was not executed. You admit it. At that a groan and outcry
                arises from all the assembly; though nevertheless the Roman people checked
                themselves, and forbore to inflict present punishment on you, and left you in safety
                for the present, being reserved for the severity of the judges. You, who knew that
                you should be accused, how did you know it? how came you ever to suspect it? You had
                no enemy. Even if you had, still you had not lived in such a way as to have any fear
                of a court of justice before yourselves. Did conscience, as often happens, make you
                timid and suspicious? Can you, then, who, when you were in command, were even then
                in fear of tribunals and accusations, now that you are on your trial as a criminal,
                and that the case is proved against you by so many witnesses, can you, I say, doubt
                of your condemnation? <milestone n="75" unit="section"/> But if you were afraid of
                this accusation,&mdash;that some one might say that you had substituted some one
                else, whom you had caused to be executed for the captain of the pirates, did you
                think that it would be a stronger argument in your defence, to produce among
                strangers a long time after, (because I required and compelled you to do so,) a man
                who you said was the captain of the pirates; or to execute him, while the affair was
                still of recent date, at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>,
                among people who knew him well, in the sight of almost all <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>? See how great a difference it makes which
                was done. In the one case there could have been no blame attached to you; in the
                other you have no defence. And accordingly, all men have always done the one thing;
                but I can find no one before you yourself, who has ever done the other. You detained
                the pirate alive. Till when? As long as you were in command. Why did you do so? On
                what account? According to what precedent? Why did you detain him so long? Why, I
                say, while the Roman citizens who were taken in the pirate's company were
                immediately put to death, did you give the pirates themselves so long a lease of
                life? <milestone n="76" unit="section"/> However, so be it. Let your conduct be
                responsible all the time that you were praetor. Did you still, when you became a
                private man, and when you became defendant&mdash;yes, and when you were all but
                condemned,&mdash;did you still, I say, detain the captain of our enemies in your
                private house? One month, a second month, almost a year, in fact, after they were
                taken, were the pirates in your house; where they would be still, if it had not been
                for me, that is to say, if it had not been for Marcus Acilius Glabrio, the praetor,
                who, at my demand, ordered them to be brought up and to be committed to prison.
                  <milestone n="30" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>What is the law in such a case? What is the general custom? What are the
                precedents? Can any private man in the whole world detain within the walls of his
                own house the most bitter and unceasing enemy of the Roman people or, I should
                rather say, the common enemy of every race and nation?<milestone n="77"
                  unit="section"/> What more shall I say? What would you say, if the very day before
                you were compelled by me to confess that, though you had put Roman citizens to
                death, the pirate captain was alive and in your house&mdash;if, I say, the very
                day before, he had escaped from your house, and had been able to collect an army
                against the Roman people? Would you say, &ldquo;He dwelt with me, he was in my
                house; in order the more easily to refute the accusations of my enemies, I reserved
                this man alive and in safety for my trial?&rdquo; Is it so? Will you defend
                yourself from danger, at the risk of the whole community? Will you regulate the time
                of the punishments which are due to conquered enemies, by what is convenient for
                yourself, not by what is expedient for the Roman people? Shall an enemy of the Roman
                people be kept in private custody? But even those who have triumphs, and who on that
                account keep the generals of the enemy alive a longer time, in order that, while
                they are led in triumph, the Roman people may enjoy an ennobling spectacle, and a
                splendid fruit of victory; nevertheless, when they begin to turn their chariot from
                the forum towards the Capitol, order them to be taken back to prison, and the same
                day brings to the conquerors the end of their authority, and to the conquered the
                end of their lives. <milestone n="78" unit="section"/> And now, can I suppose that
                any one doubts that you would never have allowed (especially as you made sure, as
                you say, that a prosecution would be instituted against you) that pirate to escape
                execution, and to live to increase your danger which was ever before your eyes? For
                indeed, suppose he had died, whom could you (who say that you were afraid of a
                prosecution) have convinced of it? When it was notorious that the captain of the
                pirates had been seen by no one at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse"
                  >Syracuse</placeName>, and that all desired to see him; when no one had any doubt
                that he had been released by you for a sum of money; when it was a common topic of
                conversation that some one had been substituted in his place, who you wished to make
                believe was the man; when you yourself had confessed that you had, for so long a
                time before, been afraid of that accusation; if you had said that he had died, who
                would have believed you? <milestone n="79" unit="section"/> Now, when you produce
                this man of yours, whoever he may be, still you see that you are laughed at. What
                would you have done if he had escaped? if he had broken his bonds, as Nico, that
                most celebrated pirate did, who was afterwards retaken by Publius Servilius, with
                the same good fortune as he had originally taken him with; what would you have said
                then? But the case was this.&mdash;If once that real captain of the pirates was
                put to death, you would not get that money. If this counterfeit one had died or had
                escaped, it would not have been difficult to substitute another in the room of one
                who was himself only a substitute. I have said more than I intended of that pirate
                captain; and yet I have passed over those things which are the most certain proofs
                of this crime. For I wish the whole of this accusation to remain untouched for the
                present. There is a certain place for its discussion, a certain law to be mentioned
                in connection with it, a certain tribunal for whose judgment it is reserved.

              <p>Though enriched with all this booty, with these slaves, with this silver plate, and
                these robes, he was still no more diligent than before in equipping the fleet, in
                recalling and provisioning the troops; though that would not only have tended to the
                safety of the province, but might have been even profitable to himself. For in the
                height of summer, when all other praetors have been accustomed to visit all the
                province, and to travel about, or to sail about,&mdash;at a time when there was
                such fear of and such danger from the pirates; at that time he was not content, for
                the purpose of his luxury and lust, with his own kingly palace which had belonged to
                king Hiero, and which the praetors are in the habit of using. He ordered, as I have
                stated already, tents, such as he was wont to use at the summer season, erected of
                fine linen curtains, to be pitched on the seashore; on that part of the shore which
                is within the island of <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>,
                behind the fountain of Arethusa; close to the entrance and mouth of the harbour, in
                a very pleasant situation, and one far enough removed from overlookers. <milestone
                  n="81" unit="section"/> Here the praetor of the Roman people, the guardian and
                defender of the province, lived for sixty days of the summer in such a style that he
                had banquets of women every day, while no man was admitted except himself and his
                youthful son. Although, indeed, I might have made no exception, but might have said
                that there was no man there at all, as there were only these two. Sometimes also his
                freedman Timarchides was admitted. But the women were all wives of citizens, of
                noble birth, except one the daughter of an actor named Isidorus, whom he, out of
                love, had seduced away from a Rhodian flute player. There was a woman called Pippa,
                the wife of Aeschrio the Syracusan, concerning which woman many verses, which were
                made on Verres's fondness for her, are quoted over all <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName>. <milestone n="82" unit="section"/> There was a woman too,
                called Nice, with a very beautiful face, as it is said, the wife of Cleomenes the
                Syracusan. Cleomenes, her husband, was greatly attached to her, but still he had
                neither the power nor the courage to oppose the lust of the praetor; and at the same
                time he was bound to him by many presents and many good offices. But at that time
                Verres, though you well know how great his impudence is, still could not, as her
                husband was at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, be quite easy
                in his mind at keeping her with him so many days on the seashore. Accordingly, he
                contrives a very singular plan. He gives the command of the fleet, which his
                lieutenant had had, to Cleomenes. He orders Cleomenes, a Syracusan, to command a
                fleet of the Roman people. He does this, in order that he might not only be absent
                from home all the time that he was at sea, but that he might be so willingly, being
                placed in a post of great honour and profit; and that he himself in the meantime,
                the husband being sent away to a distance, might have her with him,&mdash;I will
                not say more easily than before, for who ever opposed his lust? but with a rather
                more tranquil mind, as he had got rid of him, not as a husband but as a
                rival.&mdash;Cleomenes, a Syracusan, takes the command of a fleet of our allies
                and friends. <milestone n="32" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="83" unit="section"

              <p>What topic of accusation or complaint shall I urge first, O judges? That the power,
                and honour, and authority of a lieutenant, of a quaestor, yes, even of a praetor,
                was given to a Sicilian? If you were so occupied with feasts and women as to be
                prevented from taking the command yourself, where were your quaestors? where were
                your lieutenants? where was the corn valued at three <foreign lang="la"
                  >denarii</foreign>? where were the mules? where were the tents? where were all the
                numerous and splendid badges of honour conferred and bestowed by the senate and
                people of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> on their magistrates and
                lieutenants? Lastly, where were your prefects and tribunes? If there was no Roman
                citizen worthy of that employment, what had become of the cities which had always
                remained true to the alliance and friendship of the Roman people? What had become of
                the city of Segesta? of the city of Centuripa? which both by old services, by good
                faith, by antiquity of alliance, and even by relationship, are connected with the
                name of the Roman people. <milestone n="84" unit="section"/> O ye immortal gods!
                What shall we say, when Cleomenes, a Syracusan, is ordered to command the soldiers,
                and the ships, and the officers of these very cities? Has not Verres by such an
                action taken away all the honour due to worth, to justice, and to old services? Have
                we ever once waged war in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, that we
                have not had the Centuripans for our friends, and the Syracusans for our enemies?
                And I am speaking now only by way of recollection of past time, not as meaning
                insult to that city. And therefore that most illustrious man and consummate general,
                Marcus Marcellus, by whose valour <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse"
                  >Syracuse</placeName> was taken, by whose clemency it was preserved, forbade any
                Syracusan to dwell in that part of the city which is called the Island. To this day,
                I say, it is contrary to law for any Syracusan to dwell in that part of the city.
                For it is a place which even a very few men can defend. And therefore he would not
                entrust it to any but the most faithful men; and he had another reason too, because
                in that part of the city there is access to ships from the open sea. Therefore he
                did not think fit to entrust the keys of the place to those who had often excluded
                our armies. <milestone n="85" unit="section"/> See now how great is the difference
                between your lust and the authority of our ancestors; between your love and frenzy,
                and their wisdom and prudence. They took away from the Syracusans all access to the
                shore; you have given them the command of the sea. They would not allow a Syracusans
                to dwell in that part of the city which ships could approach; you appointed a
                Syracusan to command the fleet and the ships. You gave those men a part of our
                sovereignty, from whom they took a part of their own city; and you ordered those
                allies of ours to be obedient to the Syracusans, to whose aid it is owing that the
                Syracusans are obedient to us. <milestone n="33" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="86"

              <p>Cleomenes leaves the harbour in a Centuripan trireme. A Segestan vessel comes next;
                then a Tyndaritan ship; then one from Herbita, one from Heraclia, one from
                  <placeName key="perseus,Apollonia">Apollonia</placeName>, one from Haluntium; a
                fine fleet to look at, but helpless and useless because of the discharge of its
                fighting men, and of its rowers. That diligent praetor surveyed the fleet under his
                orders, as long as it was passing by his scene of profligate revelry. And he too,
                who for many days had not been seen, then for a short time afforded the sailors a
                sight of himself. The praetor of the Roman people stood in his slippers, clad in a
                purple cloak, and a tunic reaching down to his ankles, leaning on a prostitute on
                the shore. And since that time, many Sicilians and Roman citizens have often seen
                him in this very dress. <milestone n="87" unit="section"/> After the fleet had
                proceeded a little way, and had arrived, after five days' sailing, at Pachynum, the
                sailors, being compelled by hunger, gather the roots of the wild palm, of which
                there was a great quantity in that neighbourhood, as there is in most parts of
                  <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, and support themselves in a
                miserable and wretched way on these. But Cleomenes, who considered himself another
                Verres, not only in luxury and worthlessness, but in power also, spent, like him,
                all his days in drinking in a tent which he had pitched on the seashore. <milestone
                  n="34" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>But all of a sudden, while Cleomenes was drunk, and all his crews famishing, news
                is brought that a fleet of pirates is in the harbour of Odyssea; for that is the
                name of the place. But our fleet was in the harbour of Pachynum. But Cleomenes,
                because there was a garrison of troops (in name, if not in reality) in that place,
                fancied that, with the soldiers he drew from thence, he might make up his proper
                complement of sailors and rowers. The same system was found to nave been put in
                practice by that most covetous man with respect to the troops, that had been adopted
                towards the fleet, for only a few remained, and the rest had been discharged.
                  <milestone n="88" unit="section"/> Cleomenes, as commander-in-chief, in a
                Centuripan quadrireme ordered the mast to be erected, the sails to be set, the
                anchor to be weighed, and made signal for the rest of the ships to follow him. This
                Centuripan vessel was an extraordinarily fast sailer; for, while Verres was praetor,
                no one had any opportunity of knowing what each ship could do with oars; although in
                order to do honour and to show favour to Cleomenes, there was a much smaller
                deficiency of rowers and soldiers in that quadrireme. The quadrireme, almost flying,
                had already got out of sight, while the other ships were still hard at work in their
                original station. <milestone n="89" unit="section"/> However those who were left
                behind displayed a good deal of courage. Although they were few in numbers, still
                they cried out, that whatever might be the event, they were willing to fight; and
                they preferred losing by the sword the little life and strength that hunger had left
                them. And if Cleomenes had not run away so long before, there would have been some
                means of making resistance, for that ship was the only one with a deck, and was
                large enough to have been a bulwark to the rest, and if it had been engaged in
                battle with the pirates, it would have looked like a city among those piratical
                galleys; but at that time the sailors being helpless, and deserted by their
                commander and prefect of the fleet, began of necessity to hold the same course that
                he had held. <milestone n="90" unit="section"/> Accordingly they all sailed towards
                Elorum, as Cleomenes had done; but they indeed were not so much flying from the
                attack of the pirates as following their commander. Then as each was last in flight,
                he was first in danger, for the pirates came upon the last ships first, and so the
                Haluntian vessel is taken first, which was commanded by an Haluntian of noble birth,
                Philarchus by name, whom the Locrians afterwards ransomed at the public expense from
                those pirates, and from whom, on his oath, you at the former pleading learnt the
                whole of the circumstances and their cause. The Apollonian vessel is taken next, and
                Anthropinus, its captain, is slain. <milestone n="35" unit="chapter"/><milestone

              <p>While all this was going on, in the meantime Cleomenes had already arrived at
                Elorum, already he had hastened on land from the ship, and had left the quadrireme
                tossing about in the surf. The rest of the captains of ships, when the
                commander-in-chief had landed, as they had no possible means either of resisting or
                of escaping by sea, ran their ships ashore at Elorum, and followed Cleomenes. Then
                Heracleo, the captain of the pirates, being suddenly victorious, beyond all his
                hopes, not through any valour of his own, but owing to the avarice and worthlessness
                of Verres, as soon as evening came on, ordered a most beautiful fleet belonging to
                the Roman people, having been driven on shore and abandoned, to be set fire to and
                burnt. <milestone n="92" unit="section"/> O what a miserable and bitter time for the
                province of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>! O what an event,
                calamitous and fatal to many innocent people! O what unexampled worthlessness and
                infamy of that man! On one and the same night, the praetor was burning with the
                flame of the most disgraceful love, a fleet of the Roman people with the fire of
                pirates. It was a stormy night when the news of this terrible disaster was brought
                to Syracuse&mdash;men run to the praetor's house, to which his women had
                conducted him back a little while before from his splendid banquet, with songs and
                music. Cleomenes, although it was night, still does not dare to show himself in
                public. He shuts himself up in his house, but his wife was not there to console her
                husband in his misfortunes. <milestone n="93" unit="section"/> But the discipline of
                this noble commander-in-chief was so strict in his own house, that though the event
                was so important, the news so serious, still no one could be admitted; no one dared
                either to wake him if asleep, or to address him if awake. But now, when the affair
                had become known to everybody, a vast multitude was collecting in every part of the
                city; for the arrival of the pirates was not given notice of, as had formerly been
                the custom, by a fire raised on a watchtower, or a hill, but both the disaster that
                had already been sustained, and the danger that was impending, were notified by the
                conflagration of the fleet itself. <milestone n="36" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>When the praetor was inquired for, and when it was plain that no one had told him
                the news, a rush of people towards his house takes place with great impetuosity and
                loud cries. <milestone n="94" unit="section"/> Then, he himself, being roused, comes
                forth; he hears the whole news from Timarchides; he takes his military cloak. It was
                now nearly dawn. He comes forth into the middle of the crowd, bewildered with wine,
                and sleep, and debauchery. He is received by all with such a shout that it seemed to
                bring before his eyes a resemblance to the dangers of <placeName key="tgn,7002579"

                appeared greater than that, because, though both the mobs hated him equally, the
                numbers here were much greater. People began to talk to one another of his tent on
                the shore, of his flagitious banquets; the names of his women were called out by the
                crowd; men asked him openly where he had been, and what he had been doing for so
                many days together, during which no one had seen him. Then they demanded Cleomenes,
                who had been appointed commander-in-chief by him; and nothing was ever nearer
                happening than the transference of the precedent of <placeName key="tgn,7018163"

                the time, regard was had to the impending danger, regard was had, too, to their
                common dignity and character, because the body of settlers of Roman citizens at

                still half asleep and stupefied; they take arms; they fill the whole forum and the
                island, which is a considerable portion of the whole city. The pirates having
                remained at Elorum that single night, left our ships still smoking, and began to
                sail to <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>; for as they,
                forsooth, had often heard that nothing could be finer than the fortifications and
                harbour of <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, they had made up
                their minds that if they did not see them while Verres was praetor, they should
                never see them at all. <milestone n="37" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="96"
                  unit="section"/></p>
              <p>And first of all they came to those summer quarters of the praetor, landing at that
                very part of the shore where he, having pitched his tents, had set up his camp of
                luxury while all this was going on. But when they found the place empty, and
                understood that the praetor had removed his quarters from that place, they
                immediately, without any fear, began to penetrate to the harbour itself. When I say
                into the harbour, O judges, (for I must explain myself carefully for the sake of
                those who are unacquainted with the place,) I mean that the pirates came into the
                city, and into the most central parts of the city; for that town is not closed in by
                the harbour, but the harbour itself is surrounded and closed in by the town; so that
                it is not only the innermost walls that are washed by the sea, but the harbour, if I
                may so say, flows into the very bosom of the city. <milestone n="97" unit="section"
                /> Here, while you were praetor, Heracleo, the captain of the pirates, with four
                small galleys, sailed about at his pleasure. O ye immortal gods! a piratical galley,
                while the representative of the Roman people, its name and its forces were all in
                  <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, came up to the very forum,
                and to all the quays of the city. Those most glorious fleets of the Carthaginians,
                when they were at the very height of their naval power, though they often made the
                attempt in many wars, were never able to advance so far. Even the naval glory of the
                Roman people, invincible as it was till your praetorship, in all the Punic and
                Sicilian wars never penetrated so far. The situation of the place is such that the
                Syracusans usually saw their enemies armed and victorious within their walls, in the
                city, and in the forum, before they saw any enemy's ship in their harbour.
                  <milestone n="98" unit="section"/> Here, while you were praetor, galleys of
                pirates sailed about, where previously the only fleet that had ever entered in the
                history of the world, was the Athenian fleet of three hundred ships, which forced
                its way in by its weight and its numbers; and that fleet was in that very harbour
                defeated and destroyed, owing to the natural character of the place and harbour.
                Here first was the power of that splendid city defeated, weakened, and impaired. In
                this harbour, shipwreck was made of the nobleness and dominion and glory of

              <p>Did a pirate penetrate to that part of the city which he could not approach without
                leaving a great part of the city not only on his flanks but in his rear? He passed
                by the whole island, which is at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse"
                  >Syracuse</placeName> a very considerable part of the city, having its own
                distinct name, and separate walls; in which part, as I said before, our ancestors
                forbade any Syracusan to dwell, because they knew that the harbour would be in the
                power of whatever people were occupying that district of the city. <milestone n="99"
                  unit="section"/> And how did he wander through it? He threw down around him the
                roots of the wild palms which he had found in our ships, in order that all men might
                become acquainted with the dishonesty of Verres, and the disaster of <placeName

                the discovery of corn, had delivered all other nations from! While you were praetor
                the Sicilian soldiers were fed on the roots of wild palms, pirates on Sicilian corn.
                  <milestone n="100" unit="section"/> O miserable and bitter spectacle! that the
                glory of the city and the name of the Roman people should be a laughingstock; that
                in the face of all that body of inhabitants and all that multitude of people, a
                pirate in a piratical galley should celebrate a triumph in the harbour of <placeName

                while the oars of the pirates were actually besprinkling the eyes of that most
                worthless and cowardly praetor. </p>
              <p>After the pirates had left the harbour, not because of any alarm, but because they
                were weary of staying there, these men began to inquire the cause of so great a
                disaster. All began to say, and to argue openly, that it was by no means strange,
                that when the soldiers and the crews had been dismissed, and the rest had been
                destroyed by want and famine, while the praetor was spending all his time in
                drinking with his women, such a disgrace and calamity should have fallen upon them.
                  <milestone n="101" unit="section"/> And all the reproaches which they heaped upon
                him, all the infamy that they attributed to him, was confirmed by the statements of
                those men who had been appointed by their own cities to command their ships; the
                rest of whom had fled to <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>
                after the loss of the fleet. Each of them stated how many men they knew had been
                discharged out of their respective ships. The matter was clear, and his avarice was
                proved not only by arguments, but also by undeniable witnesses. <milestone n="39"
                  unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>The man is informed that nothing is done in the forum and in the assembly all that
                day, except putting questions to the naval captains how the fleet was lost. That
                they made answer, and informed every one that it was owing to the discharge of the
                rowers, the want of food of the rest, the cowardice and desertion of Cleomenes. And
                when he heard this, he began to form this design. He had long since made up his mind
                that a prosecution would be instituted against him, long before this happened, as
                you have heard him say himself at the former pleading. He saw that if those naval
                captains were produced as witnesses against him, he should not be able to stand
                against so serious an accusation. He forms at first a plan, foolish indeed, but
                still merciful. <milestone n="102" unit="section"/> He orders Cleomenes and the
                naval captains to be summoned before him. They come. He accuses them of having held
                this language about himself; he begs them to cease from holding it; and begs every
                one there to say that he had had in his ship as large a crew as he ought to have
                had, and that none had been discharged. They promise him to do whatever he wished.
                He does not delay. He immediately summons his friends. He then asks of all the
                captains separately how many sailors each had had on board his ship. Each of them
                answers as he had been enjoined to. He makes an entry of their answers in his
                journal. He seals it up, prudent man that he is, with the seals of his friends; in
                order forsooth, to use this evidence against this charge, if ever it should be
                necessary. <milestone n="103" unit="section"/> I imagine that senseless man must
                have been laughed at by his own counselors, and warned that these documents would do
                him no good; that if the charge were made, there would be even more suspicion owing
                to these extraordinary precautions of the praetor. He had already behaved with such
                folly in many cases, as even publicly to order whatever he pleased to be expunged
                out of, or entered in the records of different cities. All which things he now finds
                out are of no use to him, since he is convicted by documents, and witnesses, and
                authorities which are all undeniable. <milestone n="40" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>When he sees that their confession, and all the evidence which he has manufactured,
                and his journals, will be of no use to him, he then adopts the design, not of a
                worthless praetor, (for even that might have been endured,) but an inhuman and
                senseless tyrant. He determines, that if he wishes to palliate that accusation, (for
                he did not suppose that he could get rid of it altogether,) all the naval captains,
                the witnesses of his wickedness, must be put to death. <milestone n="104"
                  unit="section"/> The next consideration was,&mdash;&ldquo;What am I to do
                with Cleomenes? Can I put those men to death whom I placed under his command, and
                spare him whom I placed in command and authority over them? Can I punish those men
                who followed Cleomenes, and pardon Cleomenes who bade them fly with him, and follow
                him? Can I be severe to those men who had vessels not only devoid of crews, but
                devoid of decks, and be merciful to him who was the only man who had a decked ship,
                and whose ship, too, was not stripped bare like those of the others?&rdquo;
                Cleomenes must die too. What signify his promises? what do the curses that he will
                heap on him? what do the pledges of friendship and mutual embraces? what does that
                comradeship in the service, of a woman on that most luxurious sea-shore signify? It
                was utterly impossible that Cleomenes could be spared. He summons Cleomenes.
                  <milestone n="105" unit="section"/> He tells him that he has made up his mind to
                execute all the naval captains; that considerations of his own personal danger
                required such a step. &ldquo;I will spare you alone, and I will endure the blame
                of all that disaster myself, and all possible reproaches for my inconsistency,
                rather than act cruelly to you on the one hand, or, on the other hand, leave so many
                and such important witnesses against me in safety and in life.&rdquo; Cleomenes
                thanks him: approves of his intention; and says that that is what must be done. But
                he reminds him, of what he had forgotten, that it will not he possible for him to
                put Phalargus the Centuripan, one of the naval captains, to death, because he had
                been with him himself in the Centuripan quadrireme. What, then, is he to do? Shall
                that man, of such a city as that, a most noble youth, be left to be a witness? At
                present, says Cleomenes, for it must be so; but afterwards we will take care that it
                shall be put out of his power to injure us. <milestone n="41" unit="chapter"

              <p>After all this was settled and determined, Verres immediately advances from his
                praetorian house, inflamed with wickedness, frenzy, and cruelty. He comes into the
                forum. He orders the naval captains to be summoned. They immediately come with all
                speed, as men who were afraid of nothing, and suspected nothing. He orders those
                unhappy and innocent men to be loaded with chains. They began to invoke the good
                faith of the praetor, and to ask why he did so? Then he says that this is the
                reason,&mdash;because they had betrayed the fleet to the pirates. There is a
                great outcry, and great astonishment on the part of the people, that there should be
                so much impudence and audacity in the man as to attribute to others the origin of a
                calamity which had happened entirely owing to his own avarice; or to bring against
                others a charge of treason, when he himself was thought to be a partner of the
                pirates; and lastly, they marveled at this charge not being originated till fifteen
                days after the fleet had been lost. <milestone n="107" unit="section"/> While these
                things were happening, inquiry was made where Cleomenes was: not that any one
                thought him, such as he was, worthy of any punishment for that disaster; for what
                could Cleomenes have done, (for it is not in my nature to accuse any one
                falsely,)&mdash;what, I say, could Cleomenes have done of any consequence, when
                his ships had been dismantled by the avarice of Verres? And they see him sitting by
                the side of the praetor, and whispering familiarly in his ear, as he was accustomed
                to do. But then it did seem a most scandalous thing to every one, that most
                honourable men, chosen by their own cities, should be put in chains and in prison,
                but that Cleomenes, on account of his partnership with him in debauchery and infamy,
                should be the praetor's most familiar friend. <milestone n="108" unit="section"/>
                However, an accuser is produced against them, a certain Naevius Turpio, who, when
                Caius Sacerdos was praetor, had been convicted of an assault; a very suitable tool
                for the audacity of Verres; a man whom he had frequently employed in matters
                connected with the tenths, in capital prosecutions, and in every sort of false
                accusation, as a scout and emissary. <milestone n="42" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>The parents and relations of these unfortunate young men came to <placeName
                  key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, being aroused by the sudden news of
                this misfortune. They see their children loaded with chains, bearing on their necks
                and shoulders the punishment due to the avarice of Verres. They come forward, they
                defend them, they raise an outcry; they implore your good faith which at no time and
                no place had ever any existence. The father of one came forward, Dexis the
                Tyndaritan; a man of the noblest family, connected by ties of hospitality with you
                yourself, at whose house you had been, whom you had called your friend. When you saw
                him, a man of such high rank in such distress could not his tears, could not his old
                age could not the claims of hospitality and the name of friend recall you back from
                your wickedness to some degree of humanity? <milestone n="109" unit="section"/> But
                why do I speak of the claims of hospitality with reference to so inhuman a monster?
                He who entered Sthenius of Thermae, his own connection, whose house, while received
                in it in hospitality, he had plundered and stripped, in the list of criminals in his
                defence, and who, without allowing him to make any defence, condemned him to death;
                are we now to expect the claims and duties of hospitality from him? Are we dealing
                with a cruel man or with a savage and inhuman monster? Could not the tears of a
                father for the danger of his innocent son move you? As you had left your father at
                home, and kept your son with you, did neither your son who was present remind you of
                the affection of children, nor your father who was absent call to your recollection
                the indulgence of a father? <milestone n="110" unit="section"/> Your friend
                Aristeus, the son of Dexion, was in chains. Why was this? He had betrayed the fleet.
                For what bribe? He had deserted the army. What had Cleomenes done? He had done
                nothing at all. Yet you had presented him with a golden crown for his valour. He had
                discharged the sailors. But you had received from them all the price of their
                discharge. Another father, from another district, was Eubulida of Herlita: a man of
                great reputation in his city, and of high birth; who, because he had injured
                Cleomenes in defending his son, had been left nearly destitute. But what was there
                which any one could say or allege in his defence? They are not allowed to name
                Cleomenes. But the cause compels them to do so. You shall die if you do name him,
                (for he never threatened any one with trifling punishment.) But there were no
                rowers. What! are you accusing the praetor? Break his neck. If one is not allowed to
                name either the praetor, or the rival of the praetor, when the whole case turns on
                the conduct of these two men, what is to be done? <milestone n="43" unit="chapter"

              <p>Heraclius of Segesta also pleads his cause; a man of the very noblest descent in
                his own city. Listen, O judges, as your humanity requires of you, for you will hear
                of great cruelties and injuries inflicted on the allies. Know then that the case of
                Heraclius was this:&mdash;that on account of a severe complaint in his eyes he
                had not gone to sea at all; but by his order who had the command, he had remained in
                his quarters at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>. He certainly
                never betrayed the fleet; he did not run away in a fright; he did not desert the
                army; if he had, he might have been punished when the fleet was setting out from
                  <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>. But he was in just the
                same condition as if he had been detected in some manifest crime; though no charge
                at all could be brought against him, not ever so falsely. <milestone n="112"
                  unit="section"/> Among these naval captains was a citizen of Heraclia, of the name
                of Junius, (for they have some Latin names of that sort,) a man, as long as he
                lived, illustrious in his own city, and after his death celebrated over all
                  <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>. In that man there was courage
                enough, not only to attack Verres, for that indeed, as he saw that he was sure to
                die, he was aware that he could do without any danger; but when his death was
                settled, while his mother was sitting in his prison, night and day weeping, he wrote
                out the defence which his cause required; and now there is no one in all <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> who is not in possession of that defence, who
                does not read it, who is not constantly reminded by that oration, of your wickedness
                and cruelty. In it he states how many sailors he received from his city; how many
                Verres discharged, and for how much he discharged each of them; how many he had
                left. He makes similar statements with respect to the other ships and when he
                uttered these statements before you, he was scourged on the eyes. But when death was
                staring him in the face, he could easily endure pain of body; he cried out, what he
                has left also in writing, &ldquo;That it was an infamous thing that the tears of
                an unchaste woman on behalf of the safety of Cleomenes should have more influence
                with you, than those of his mother for his life.&rdquo; <milestone n="113"
                  unit="section"/> Afterwards I see that this also is stated, which, if the Roman
                people has formed a correct estimate of your characters, O judges, he, at the very
                hour of death, truly prophesied of you,&mdash;&ldquo;That it was not
                possible for Verres to efface his own crimes by murdering the witnesses; that he, in
                the shades below, should be a still more serious witness against him, in the opinion
                of sensible judges, than if he were produced alive in a court of justice; for that
                then, if he were alive he would only be a witness to prove his avarice; but now,
                when he had been, put to death, he should be a witness of his wickedness, and
                audacity, and cruelty.&rdquo; What follows is very
                fine,&mdash;&ldquo;That, when your cause came to be tried, it would not be
                only the bands of witnesses, but the punishments inflicted on the innocent, and the
                furies that haunt the wicked, that would attend your trial; that he thought his own
                misfortune the lighter, because he had seen before now the edge of your axes, and
                the countenance and hand of Sextus your executioner, when in an assembly of Roman
                citizens, Roman citizens were publicly executed by your command.&rdquo;
                  <milestone n="114" unit="section"/> Not to dwell too long on this, Junius used
                most freely that liberty which you have given the allies, even at the moment of
                bitter punishment, such as was only fit for slaves. <milestone n="44" unit="chapter"

              <p>He condemns them all, with the approval of his assessors. And yet, in so important
                an affair, in a cause in which so many men and so many citizens were concerned, he
                neither sent for Publius Vettius, his quaestor, to take his advice; nor for Publius
                Cervius, an admirable man, his lieutenant, who, because he had been lieutenant in
                  <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, while he was praetor was the
                first man rejected by him as a judge; but he condemns them all in conformity with
                the opinion expressed by a lot of robbers, that is, by his own retinue. <milestone
                  n="115" unit="section"/> On this all the Sicilians, our most faithful and most
                ancient allies, who have had the greatest kindnesses conferred on them by our
                ancestors, were greatly agitated, and alarmed at their own danger, and at the peril
                of all their fortunes. That that noted clemency and mildness of our dominion should
                have been changed into such cruelty and inhumanity! That so many men should be
                condemned at one time for no crime! That that infamous praetor should seek for a
                defence for his own robberies by the most shameful murder of innocent men! Nothing,
                O judges, appears possible to be added to such wickedness, insanity, and
                barbarity&mdash;and it is true that nothing can; for if it be compared with the
                iniquity of other men it will greatly surpass it all. <milestone n="116"
                  unit="section"/> But he is his own rival; his object is always to outdo his last
                crime by some new wickedness. I had said that Phalargus the Centuripan was made an
                exception by Cleomenes, because he had sailed in his quadrireme. Still because that
                young man was alarmed, as he saw that his case was identical with that of those men
                who had been put to death, though perfectly innocent; Timarchides came to him, and
                tells him that he is in no danger at all of being put to death, but warns him to
                take care lest he should be sentenced to be scourged. To make my story short, you
                heard the young man himself say, that because of his fear of being scourged he paid
                money to Timarchides. <milestone n="117" unit="section"/> These are but light crimes
                in such a criminal as this. A naval captain of a most noble city ransoms himself
                from the danger of being scourged with a bribe&mdash;it was a human weakness.
                Another gave money to save himself from being condemned&mdash;it is a common
                thing. The Roman people does not wish Verres to be prosecuted on obsolete
                accusations; it demands new charges against him; it requires something which it has
                not heard before; it thinks that it is not a praetor of Sicily, but some most cruel
                tyrant that is being brought before the court. <milestone n="45" unit="chapter"
                /></p>
              <p>The condemned men are consigned to prison. They are sentenced to execution. Even
                the wretched parents of the naval captains are punished; they are prevented from
                visiting their sons; they are prevented from supplying their down children with food
                and raiment. <milestone n="118" unit="section"/> These very fathers, whom you see
                here, lay on the threshold, and the wretched mothers spent their nights at the door
                of the prison, denied the parting embrace of their children, though they prayed for
                nothing but to be allowed to receive their son's dying breath. The porter of the
                prison, the executioner of the praetor, was there; the death and terror of both
                allies and citizens; the lictor Sextius, to whom every groan and every agony of
                every one was a certain gain&mdash;&ldquo;To visit him, you must give so
                much; to be allowed to take him food into the prison, so much.&rdquo; No one
                refused. &ldquo;What now, what will you give me to put your son to death at one
                blow of my axe? to save him from longer torture? to spare him repeated blows? to
                take care that he shall give up the ghost without any sense of pain or
                torture?&rdquo; Even for this object money was given to the lictor. <milestone
                  n="119" unit="section"/> Oh great and intolerable agony! oh terrible and bitter
                ill-fortune! Parents were compelled to purchase, not the life of their children, but
                a swiftness of execution for them. And the young men themselves also negotiated with
                Sextius about the same execution, and about that one blow; and at last, children
                entreated their parents to give money to the lictor for the sake of shortening their
                sufferings. Many and terrible sufferings have been invented for parents and
                relations; many&mdash;still death is the last of all. It shall not be. Is there
                any further advance that cruelty can make? One stall be found&mdash;for, when
                their children have been executed and slain, their bodies shall be exposed to wild
                beasts. If this is a miserable thing for a parent to endure, let him pay money for
                leave to bury him. You heard Onasus the Segestan, a man of noble birth, say that he
                had paid money to Timarchides for leave to bury the naval captain, Heraclius. And
                this (that you may not be able to say, &ldquo;Yes, the fathers come, angry at
                the loss of their sons,&rdquo;) is stated by a man of the highest consideration,
                a man of the noblest birth; and he does not state it with respect to any son of his
                own. And as to this, who was there at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse"
                  >Syracuse</placeName> at that time, who did not hear, and who does not know that
                these bargains for permission to bury were made with Timarchides by the living
                relations of those who had been put to death? Did they not speak openly with
                Timarchides? Were not all the relations of all the men present? Were not the
                funerals of living men openly bargained for? And then, when all those matters were
                settled and arranged, the men are brought out of prison and tied to the stake.

                are delighted that the witnesses of your avarice are put out of the way: you were
                mistaken, O Verres, you were greatly mistaken, when you thought that you could wash

                You were borne on headlong in your frenzy, when you thought that you could heal the

                neither to you nor to them; yet, out of this very body of naval captains some are

                avert by its prayers the death and execution of one most honourable and most

              <p>Whither shall the allies flee for refuge? Whose help shall they implore? by what
                hope shall they still be retained in the desire to live, if you abandon them? Shall
                they come to the senate and beg them to punish Verres? That is not a usual course;
                it is not in accordance with the duty of the senate. Shall they betake themselves to
                the Roman people? The people will easily find all excuse; for they will say that
                they have established a law for the sake of the allies, and that they have appointed
                you as guardians and vindicators of that law. This then is the only place to which
                they can flee; this is the harbour, this is the citadel, this is the altar of the
                allies; to which indeed they do not at present betake themselves with the same views
                as they formerly used to entertain in seeking to recover their property. They are
                not seeking to recover silver, nor gold, nor robes, nor slaves, nor ornaments which
                have been carried off from their cities and their temples;&mdash;they fear, like
                ignorant men, that the Roman people now allows such things and permits them to be
                done. For we have now for many years been suffering; and we are silent when we see
                that all the money of all the nations has come into the hands of a few men; which we
                seem to tolerate and to permit with the more equanimity, because none of these
                robbers conceals what he is doing; none of them take the least trouble to keep their
                covetousness in any obscurity. <milestone n="127" unit="section"/> In our most
                beautiful and highly decorated city what statue, or what painting is there, which
                has not been taken and brought away from conquered enemies? But the villas of those
                men are adorned and filled with numerous and most beautiful spoils of our most
                faithful allies. Where do you think is the wealth of foreign nations, which they are
                all now deprived of, when you see <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                >Athens</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7016140">Pergamos</placeName>, <placeName

                these things, as I was saying, your allies abandon and are indifferent to now. They
                took care by their own services and loyalty not to be deprived of their property by
                the public authority of the Roman people; though they were unable to resist the
                covetousness of a few individuals, yet they could in some degree satiate it; but now
                not only as all their power of resisting taken away, but also all their means also
                of supplying such demands. Therefore they do not care about their property; they do
                not seek to recover their money, though that is nominally the subject of this
                prosecution; that they abandon and are indifferent to;&mdash;in this dress in

              <p>Behold, behold, O judges, the miserable and squalid condition of our allies.
                Sthenius, the Thermitan, whom you see here, with this uncombed hair and mourning
                robe, though his whole house has been stripped of everything, makes no mention of
                your robberies, O Verres; he claims to recover his own safety from you, nothing
                more. For you, by your lust and wickedness, have removed him entirely from his
                country, in which he flourished as a leading man, illustrious for his many virtues
                and distinguished services. This man Dexio, whom you see now present, demands of
                you, not the public treasures of which you stripped <placeName
                  key="perseus,Tyndaris">Tyndaris</placeName>, nor the wealth of which you robbed
                him as a private individual, but, wretched that he is, he demands of you his most
                virtuous, his most innocent, his only son. He does not want to carry back home a sum
                of money obtained from you as damages, but he seeks out of your calamity some
                consolation for the ashes and bones of his son. This other man here, the aged
                Eubulida, has not, at the close of life, undertaken such fatigue and so long a
                journey, to recover any of his property, but to see you condemned with the same eyes
                that beheld the bleeding neck of his own son. <milestone n="129" unit="section"/> If
                it had not been for Lucius Metellus, O judges, the mothers of those men, their wives
                and sisters, were on their way hither; and one of them, when I arrived at <placeName
                  key="tgn,7008299">Heraclea</placeName> late at night, came to meet me with all the
                matrons of that city, and with many torches; and so, styling me her saviour, calling
                you her executioner, uttering in an imploring manner the name of her son, she fell
                down, wretched as she was, at my feet, as if I were able to raise her son from the
                shades below. In the other cities also the aged mothers, and even the little
                children of those miserable men did the same thing; while the helpless age of each
                class appeared especially to stand in need of my labour and diligence, of your good
                faith and pity. <milestone n="130" unit="section"/> Therefore, O judges, this
                complaint was brought to me by <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> most
                especially and beyond all other complaints. I have undertaken this task, induced by
                the tears of others, not by any desire of my own for glory; in order that false
                condemnation, and imprisonment, and chains, and axes, and the torture of our allies,
                and the execution of innocent men, and last of all, that the bodies of the lifeless
                dead, and the agony of living parents and relations, may not he a source of profit
                to our magistrates. If, by that man's condemnation obtained through your good faith
                and strict justice, O judges, I remove this fear from <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName>, I shall think enough has been done in discharge of my duty,
                and enough to satisfy their wishes who have entreated this assistance from me.
                  <milestone n="50" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="131" unit="section"/></p>
              <p>Wherefore, if by any chance you find one who attempts to defend him from this
                accusation in the matter of the fleet, let him defend him thus; let him leave out
                those common topics which have nothing to do with the business&mdash;that I am
                attributing to him blame which belongs to fortune; that I am imputing to him
                disaster as a crime; that I am accusing him of the loss of a fleet, when, in the
                uncertain risks of war which are common to both sides, many gallant men have often
                met with disasters both by land and sea. I am imputing to you nothing in which
                fortune was concerned; you have no pretext for bringing up the disasters of others;
                you have nothing to do with collecting instances of the misfortunes of many others.
                I say the ships were dismantled; I say the rowers and sailors were discharged; I say
                the rest had been living on the roots of wild palms; that a Sicilian was appointed
                to command a fleet of the Roman people; a Syracusan to command our allies and
                friends; I say that, all that time, and for many preceding days, you were spending
                your time in drunken revels on the sea-shore with your concubines; and I produce my
                informants and witnesses, who prove all these charges. <milestone n="132"
                  unit="section"/> Do I seem to be insulting you in your calamity; to be cutting you
                off from your legitimate excuse of blaming fortune? Do I appear to be attacking and
                reproaching you for the ordinary chances of war? Although the men who are indeed
                accustomed to object to the results of fortune being made a charge against them, are
                those who have committed themselves to her, and have encountered her perils and
                vicissitudes. But in that disaster of yours, fortune had no share at all. For men
                are accustomed to try the fortune of war, and to encounter danger in battles, not in
                banquets. But in that disaster of yours we cannot say that Mars had any share; we
                may say that Venus had. But if it is not right that the disasters of fortune should
                be imputed to you, why did you not allow her some weight in furnishing excuses and
                defence for those innocent men? <milestone n="133" unit="section"/> You must also
                deprive yourself of the argument, that you are now accused and held up to odium by
                me, for having punished and executed men according to the custom of our ancestors by
                accusation does not turn on any one's punishment. I do not say that no one ought to
                have been put to death; I do not say that all fear is to be removed from military
                service, severity from command, or punishment from guilt. I confess that there are
                many precedents for severe and terrible punishments inflicted not only on our
                allies, but even on our citizens and soldiers. <milestone n="51" unit="chapter"
                /></p>
              <p>You may therefore omit all such topics as these. I prove that the fault was not in
                the naval captains, but in you. I accuse you of having discharged the soldiers and
                rowers for a bribe. The rest of the naval captains say the came. The confederate
                city of the Netians bears public testimony to the truth of this charge. The cities
                of Herbita, of Amestras, of <placeName key="tgn,7003916">Enna</placeName>, of
                  <placeName key="tgn,1043116">Agyrium</placeName>, of <placeName
                  key="perseus,Tyndaris">Tyndaris</placeName>, and the Ionians, all give their
                public testimony to the same effect. Last of all, your own witness, your own
                commander, your own host, Cleomenes, says this,&mdash;that he had landed on the
                coast in order to collect soldiers from Pachynum, where there was a garrison of
                troops, in order to put them on board the fleet; which he certainly would not have
                done if the ships had had their complement. For the system of ships when fully
                equipped and fully manned is such that you have no room, I will not say for many
                more, but for even one single man more. <milestone n="134" unit="section"/> I say,
                moreover, that those very sailors who were left, were worn out and disabled by
                famine, and by a want of every necessary. I say, that either all were free from
                blame, or that if blame must be attributable to some one, the greatest blame must be
                due to him who had the best ship, the largest crew, and the chief command; or, that
                if all were to blame, Cleomenes ought not to have been a spectator of the death and
                torture of those men. I say, besides, that in those executions, to allow of that
                traffic in tears, of that bargaining for an effective wound and a deadly blow, of
                that bargaining for the funeral and sepulture of the victims, was impiety.
                  <milestone n="135" unit="section"/> Wherefore, if you will make me any answer at
                all, say this,&mdash;that the fleet was properly equipped and fully manned; that
                no fighting-men were absent, that no bench was without its rower; that ample corn
                was supplied to the rowers; that the naval captains are liars; that all those
                honourable cities are liars; that all <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName> is a liar;&mdash;that you were betrayed by Cleomenes, when
                he said that he had landed on the coast to get soldiers from Pachynum; that it was
                courage, and not troops that he needed;&mdash;that Cleomenes, while fighting
                most gallantly, was abandoned and deserted by these men, and that no money was paid
                to any one for leave to bury the dead.&mdash;If you say this, you shall be
                convicted of falsehood; if you say anything else, you will not be refuting what has

              <p>Here will you dare to say also, &ldquo;Among my judges that one is my intimate
                friend, that one is a friend of my father?&rdquo; Is it not the case that the
                more acquainted or connected with you any one is, the more he is ashamed at the
                charges brought against you? He is your father's friend&mdash;If your father
                himself were your judge, what, in the name of the immortal gods, could you do when
                he said this to you? ldquo;You, being in a province as praetor of the Roman people,
                when you had to carry on a naval war, three years excused the Mamertines from
                supplying the ship, which by treaty they were bound to supply; by those same
                Mamertines a transport of the largest size was built for you at the public expense;
                you exacted money from the cities on the pretest of the fleet; you discharged the
                rowers for a bribe; when a pirate vessel had been taken by your quaestor, and by
                your lieutenant, you removed the captain of the pirates from every one's sight; you
                ventured to put to death men who were called Roman citizens, who were recognised as
                such by many; you dared to take to your own house pirates, and to bring the captain
                of the pirates into the court of justice from your own house. <milestone n="137"
                  unit="section"/> You, in that splendid province, in the sight of our most faithful
                allies, and of most honourable Roman citizens, lay for many days together on the
                sea-shore in revelry and debauchery, and that at a time of the greatest alarm and
                danger to the province. All those days no one could find you at your own house, no
                one could see you in the forum; you entertained the mothers of families of our
                allies and friends at those banquets; among women of that sort you placed your
                youthful son, my grandson, in order that his father's life might furnish examples of
                iniquity to a time of life which is particularly unsteady and open to temptation;
                you, while praetor in your province, were seen in a tunic and purple cloak; you, to
                gratify your passion and lust, took away the command of the fleet from a lieutenant
                of the Roman people, and gave it to a Syracusan; your soldiers in the province of
                  <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> were in want of provisions and of
                corn; owing to your luxury and avarice, a fleet belonging to the Roman people was
                taken and burnt by pirates; <milestone n="138" unit="section"/> in your praetorship,
                for the first time since <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> was
                a city, did pirates sail about in that harbour, which no enemy had ever entered;
                moreover, you did not seek to cover these numerous and terrible disgraces of yours
                by any concealment on your part, nor did you seek to make men forget them by keeping
                silence respecting them, but you even without any cause tore the captains of the
                ships from the embrace of their parents, who were your own friends and connections,
                and hurried them to death and torture; nor, in witnessing the grief and tears of
                those parents, did any recollection of my name soften your heart; the blood of
                innocent men was not only a pleasure but also a profit to you.&rdquo; <milestone

              <p>If your own father were to say this to you, could you entreat pardon from him?
                could you dare to beg even him to forgive you? <milestone n="139" unit="section"/>
                Enough has been done by me, O judges, to satisfy the Sicilians, enough to discharge
                my duty and obligation to them, enough to acquit me of my promise and of the labour
                which I have undertaken. The remainder of the accusation, O judges, is one which I
                have not received from any one, but which is, if I may so say, innate in me; it is
                one which has not been brought to me, but which is deeply fixed and implanted in all
                my feelings; it is one which concerns not the safety of the allies, but the life and
                existence of Roman citizens, that is to say, of every one of us. And in urging this,
                do not, O judges, expect to hear any arguments from me, as if the matter were
                doubtful. Everything which I am going to say about the punishment of Roman citizens,
                will be so evident and notorious, that I could produce all <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> as witnesses to prove it. For some insanity,
                the frequent companion of wickedness and audacity, urged on that man's unrestrained
                ferocity of disposition and inhuman nature to such frenzy, that he never hesitated,
                openly, in the presence of the whole body of citizens and settlers, to employ
                against Roman citizens those punishments which have been instituted only for slaves
                convicted of crime. <milestone n="140" unit="section"/> Why need I tell you how many
                men he has scourged? I will only say that, most briefly, O judges, while that man
                was praetor there was no discrimination whatever in the infliction of that sort of
                punishment; and, accordingly, the hands of the lictor were habitually laid on the
                persons of the Roman citizens, even without any actual order from Verres. <milestone
                  n="54" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>Can you deny this, O Verres, that in the forum, at <placeName key="tgn,7003850"
                  >Lilybaeum</placeName>, in the presence of a numerous body of inhabitants, Caius
                Servilius, a Roman citizen, an old trader of the body of settlers at <placeName
                  key="perseus,Panormus">Panormus</placeName>, was beaten to the ground by rods and
                scourges before your tribunal, before your very feet? Dare first to deny this, if
                you can. No one was at <placeName key="tgn,7003850">Lilybaeum</placeName> who did
                not see it. No one was in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> who did
                not hear of it. I assert that a Roman citizen fell down before your eyes, exhausted
                by the scourging of your lictors. <milestone n="141" unit="section"/> For what
                reason? O ye immortal gods!&mdash;though in asking that I am doing injury to the
                common cause of all the citizens, and to the privilege of citizenship, for I am
                asking what reason there was in the case of Servilius for this treatment, as if
                there could be any reason for its being legally inflicted on any Roman citizen.
                Pardon me this one error, O judges, for I will not in the rest of the cases ask for
                any reason. He had spoken rather freely of the dishonesty and worthlessness of
                Verres. And as soon as he was informed of this, he orders the man to <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003850">Lilybaeum</placeName> to give security in a prosecution
                instituted against him by one of the slaves of Verres. He gives security. He comes
                to <placeName key="tgn,7003850">Lilybaeum</placeName>. Verres begins to compel him,
                though no one proceeded with any action against him, though no one made any claim on
                him, to be bound over in the sum of two thousand <foreign lang="la"
                  >sesterces</foreign>, to appear to a charge brought against him by his own lictor,
                in the formula,&mdash;&ldquo;If he had made any profit by
                robbery.&rdquo;&mdash;He says that he will appoint judges out of his own
                retinue. Servilius demurs, and entreats that he may not be proceeded against by a
                capital prosecution before unjust judges, and where there is no prosecutor.
                  <milestone n="142" unit="section"/> While he is urging this with a loud voice, six
                of the most vigorous lictors surround him, men in full practice in beating and
                scourging men; they beat him most furiously with rods; then the lictor who was
                nearest to him, the man whom I have already often mentioned, Sextus, turning his
                stick round, began to beat the wretched man violently on the eyes. Therefore, when
                blood had filled his mouth and eyes, he fell down, and they, nevertheless, continued
                to beat him on the sides while lying on the ground, till he said at last he would
                give security. He, having been treated in this manner, was taken away from the place
                as dead, and, in a short time afterwards, he died. But that devoted servant of
                Venus, that man so rich in wit and politeness, erected a silver Cupid out of his
                property in the temple of Venus. And in this way he misused the fortunes of men to
                fulfil the nightly vows made by him for the accomplishment of his desires.

              <p>For why should I speak separately of all the other punishments inflicted on Roman
                citizens, rather than generally, and in the lump? That prison which was built at
                  <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, by that most cruel tyrant
                Dionysius, which is called the stone-quarries, was, under his government, the home
                of Roman citizens. As any one of them offended his eyes or his mind, he was
                instantly thrown into the stone-quarries. I see that this appears a scandalous thing
                to you, O judges; and I had observed that, at the former pleading, when the
                witnesses stated these things; for you thought that the privileges of freedom ought
                to be maintained, not only here, where there are tribunes of the people, where there
                are other magistrates, where there is a forum with many courts of justice, where
                there is the authority of the senate, where there is the opinion of the Roman people
                to hold a man in check, where the Roman people itself is present in great numbers;
                but, in whatever country or nation the privileges of Roman citizens are violated,
                you, O judges, decide that that violation concerns the common cause of freedom, and
                of your dignity. <milestone n="144" unit="section"/> Did you, O Verres, dare to
                confine such a number of Roman citizens in a prison built for foreigners, for wicked
                men, for pirates, and for enemies? Did no thoughts of this tribunal, or of the
                public assembly, or of this numerous multitude which I see around me, and which is
                now regarding you with a most hostile and inimical disposition, occur to your mind?
                Did not the dignity of the Roman people, though absent, did not the appearance of
                such a concourse as this ever present itself to your eyes or to your thoughts? Did
                you never think that you should have to return home to the sight of these men, that
                you should have to come into the forum of the Roman people, that you should have to
                submit yourself to the power of the laws and courts of justice? <milestone n="56"

              <p>But what, O Verres, was that passion of yours for practicing cruelty? what was your
                reason for undertaking so many wicked actions? It was nothing, O judges, except a
                new and unprecedented system of plundering. For like those men whose histories we
                have learnt from the poets, who are said to have occupied some bays on the
                sea-coast, or some promontories, or some precipitous rocks, in order to be able to
                murder those who had been driven to such places in their vessels, this man also
                looked down as an enemy over every sea, from every part of <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>. Every ship that came from <placeName

                  <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName>, was immediately seized
                by informers and guards that he could rely upon; their crews were all thrown into
                the stone-quarries; their freights and merchandise carried up into the praetor's
                house. After a long interval there was seen to range through <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, not another Dionysius, not another Phalaris,
                (for their island has at one time or another produced many inhuman tyrants,) but a
                new sort of monster, endowed with all the ancient savage barbarity which is said to
                have formerly existed in those same districts; <milestone n="146" unit="section"/>
                for I do not think that either Scylla or Charybdis was such an enemy to sailors, as
                that man has been in the same waters. And in one respect he is far more to be
                dreaded than they, because he is girdled with more numerous and more powerful hounds
                than they were. He is a second <persName><surname>Cyclops</surname></persName>, far
                more savage than the first; for Verres had possession of the whole island;
                Polyphemus is said to have occupied only <placeName key="tgn,7003867"

                outrageous cruelty? The same which is now going to be stated in his defence. He used
                to say whenever any one came to <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> a
                little better off than usual, that they were soldiers of Sertorius, and that they

                  anchored="yes"><placeName key="tgn,7007641">Dianium</placeName> was a town in

                  Sertorius.</note> They brought him presents to gain his protection from danger;
                some brought him Tyrian purple, others brought frankincense, perfumes, and linen
                robes; others gave jewels and pearls; some offered great bribes and Asiatic slaves,
                so that it was seen by their very goods from what place they came. They were not
                aware that those very things which they thought that they were employing as aids to
                ensure their safety, were the causes of their danger. For he would say that they had
                acquired those things by partnership with pirates, he would order the men themselves
                to be led away to the stone-quarries, he would see that their ships and their
                freights were diligently taken care of. <milestone n="57" unit="chapter"/><milestone

              <p>When by these practices his prison had become full of merchants, then those scenes
                took place which you have heard related by Lucius Suetius, a Roman knight, and a
                most virtuous man, and by others. The necks of Roman citizens were broken in a most
                infamous manner in the prison; so that very expression and form of entreaty,
                &ldquo;I am a Roman citizen,&rdquo; which has often brought to many, in the
                most distant countries, succour and assistance, even among the barbarians, only
                brought to these men a more bitter death and a more immediate execution. What is
                this, O Verres? What reply are you thinking of making to this? That I am telling
                lies? that I am inventing things? that I am exaggerating this accusation? Will you
                dare to say any one of these things to those men who are defending you? Give me, I
                pray you, the documents of the Syracusans taken from his own bosom, which, methinks,
                were drawn up according to his will; give me the register of the prison, which is
                most carefully made up, stating in what day each individual was committed to prison,
                when he died, how he was executed. [The documents of the Syracusans are read.]
                  <milestone n="148" unit="section"/> You see that Roman citizens were thrown in
                crowds into the stone quarries; you see a multitude of your fellow-citizens heaped
                together in a most unworthy place. Look now for all the traces of their departure
                from that place, which are to be seen. There are none. Are they all dead of disease?
                If he were able to urge this in his defence, still such a defence would find credit
                with no one. But there is a word written in those documents, which that ignorant and
                profligate man never noticed, and would not have understood if he had. <foreign
                  lang="greek">*)ekdikaiw/qhsan</foreign>, it says that is, according to the
                Sicilian language, they were punished and put to death. <milestone n="58"

              <p>If any king, if any city among foreign nations, in any nation had done anything of
                this sort to a Roman citizen, should we not avenge that act by a public resolution?
                should we not prosecute our revenge by war? Could we leave such injury and insult
                offered the Roman name unavenged and unpunished? How many wars, and what serious
                ones do you think that our ancestors undertook, because Roman citizens were said to
                have been ill-treated, or Roman vessels detained, or Roman merchants plundered? But
                I am not complaining that men have been detained; I think one might endure their
                having been plundered; I am impeaching Verres because after their ships, their
                slaves, and their merchandise had been taken from them, the merchants themselves
                were thrown into prison&mdash;because Roman citizens were imprisoned and
                executed. <milestone n="150" unit="section"/> If I were saying this among Scythians,
                not before such a multitude of Roman citizens, not before the most select senators
                of the city, not in the forum of the Roman people,&mdash;if I were relating such
                numerous and bitter punishments inflicted on Roman citizens, I should move the pity
                of even those barbarous men. For so great is the dignity of this empire, so great is
                the honour in which the Roman name is held among all nations, that the exercise of
                such cruelty towards our citizens seems to be permitted to no one. Can I think that
                there is any safety or any refuge for you, when I see you hemmed in by the severity
                of the judges, and entangled as it were in the meshes of a net by the concourse of
                the Roman people here present? <milestone n="151" unit="section"/> If, indeed,
                (though I have no idea that that is possible,) you were to escape from these toils,
                and effect your escape by any way or any method, you will then fall into that still
                greater net, in which you must be caught and destroyed by me from the elevation in
                which I stand. For even if I were to grant to him all that he urges in his defence,
                yet that very defence must turn out not less injurious to him than my true
                accusation. </p>
              <p>For what does he urge in his defence? He says that he arrested men flying from
                  <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, and put them to death. Who gave
                you leave to do so? By what right did you do so? Who else did the same thing? How
                was it lawful for you to do so? <milestone n="152" unit="section"/> We see the forum
                and the porticoes full of those men, and we are contented to see them there. For the
                end of civil dissensions, and of the (shall I say) insanity, or destiny, or calamity
                in which they take their rise, is not so grievous as to make it unlawful for us to
                preserve the rest of our citizens in safety. That Verres there, that ancient

                he did not preserve safe and unhurt with the greatest kindness? was there one
                suppliant citizen to whom that invincible right hand was not stretched out as a
                pledge of his faith, and as a sure token of safety? Was it then so? Was death and
                torture appointed by you, who had never done one important service to the republic,
                for those who found a harbour of refuge in that man against whom they had borne

                had rather, I say, that you were thought a foe and an enemy to that class of men
                than to merchants and seafaring men. For the accusation I bring against you
                impeaches you of excessive avarice: the defence that you make for yourself accuses
                you of a sort of frenzy, of savage ferocity, of unheard-of cruelty, and of almost a
                new proscription. <milestone n="154" unit="section"/> But I may not avail myself of
                such an advantage as that, O judges; I may not; for all <placeName

                prison, that some were privately murdered in prison, some publicly executed. See now
                how impartially I will behave to you. When I produce Publius Granius as a witness to
                state that his freedmen were publicly executed by you, to demand back his ship and
                his merchandise from you, refute him if you can; I will abandon my own witness and

                punishment. <milestone n="155" unit="section"/> I will call back the Roman knight,
                Lucius Flavius, if you wish; since at the previous pleading, being influenced, as
                your advocates are in the habit of saying, by some unusual prudence, but, (as all
                men are aware,) being overpowered by your own conscience, and by the authority of my
                witnesses, you did not put a question to any single witness. Let Flavius be asked,
                if you like, who Lucius Herennius was, the man who, he says, was a money-changer at

                  >Syracuse</placeName>, who not only knew him, but defended him with their tears
                and with entreaties to you, was still publicly executed by you in the sight of all
                the Syracusans. I am very willing that this witness of mine should also be refuted,
                and that it should be demonstrated end proved by you that that Herennius had been

                man, made you a little more careful and more fearful? who lately stated in his
                evidence that it was not some stranger, no one knows who, nor any foreigner, but a
                Roman citizen who was well known to the whole body of inhabitants, who had been born
                at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, who had been publicly
                executed by you. <milestone n="157" unit="section"/> After this loud statement of
                theirs,&mdash;after this had become known by the common conversation and common
                complaints of all men, he began to be, I will not say more merciful in his
                punishments, but mere careful. He established the rule of bringing out Roman
                citizens for punishment with their heads muffled up, whom, however, he put to death
                in the sight of all men, because the citizens (as we have said before) were
                calculating the number of pirates with too much accuracy. Was this the condition
                that was established for the Roman people while you were praetor? were these the
                hopes under which they were to transact their business? was this the danger in which
                their lives and condition as freemen were placed? are there not risks enough at the
                hands of fortune to be encountered of necessity by merchants, unless they are
                threatened also with these terrors by our magistrates, and in our provinces? Was

                his wickedness. Accordingly, Gavius is at once brought before the Mamertine

                stone-quarries, and who, when he was actually embarking on board ship, and uttering
                violent threats against Verres, had been brought back by them, and reserved in order

                His eyes glared; cruelty was visible in his whole countenance. All men waited to see
                what does he was going to take,&mdash;what he was going to do; when all of a
                sudden he orders the man to be seized, and to be stripped and bound in the middle of
                the forum, and the rods to be got ready. The miserable man cried out that he was a
                Roman citizen, a citizen, also, of the municipal town of <placeName
                  key="perseus,Cosa">Cosa</placeName>,&mdash;that he had served with Lucius

                  >Messana</placeName> a Roman citizen, O judges, was beaten with rods; while in the

                not only did not succeed in averting by his entreaties the violence of the rods, but
                as he kept on repeating his entreaties and the assertion of his citizenship, a

                allies,&mdash;a Roman citizen should be bound in the forum, and beaten with rods
                by a man who only had the fasces and the axes through the kindness of the Roman
                people? What shall I say? When fire, and red-hot plates and other instruments of
                torture were employed? It the bitter entreaties and the miserable cries of that man
                had no power to restrain you, were you not moved even by the weeping and loud groans
                of the Roman citizens who were present at that time? Did you dare to drag any one to

                this point so strongly at the former pleading; I was unwilling to do so. For you saw
                how the feelings of the multitude were excited against him with indignation, and
                hatred, and fear of their common danger. I, at that time, fixed a limit to my
                oration, and checked the eagerness of Caius Numitorius a Roman knight, a man of the
                highest character, one of my witnesses. And I rejoiced that Glabrio had acted (and
                he had acted most wisely) as he did in dismissing that witness immediately, in the
                middle of the discussion. In fact he was afraid that the Roman people might seem to
                have inflicted that punishment on Verres by tumultuary violence, which he was
                anxious he should only suffer according to the laws and by your judicial sentence.

                relations,, who shall teach you, though it is too late, and who shall also teach the
                judges, (for it is not too late for them to know them,) that that Publius Gavius
                whom you crucified was a Roman citizen, and a citizen of the municipality of

              <p>When I have made all these points, which I undertake to prove, abundantly plain to
                your most intimate friends, then I will also turn my attention to that which is
                granted me by you. I will say that I am content with that. For what&mdash;what,
                I say&mdash;did you yourself lately say, when in an agitated state you escaped
                from the outcry and violence of the Roman people? Why, that he had only cried out
                that he was a Roman citizen because he was seeking some respite, but that he was a
                spy. My witnesses are unimpeachable. For what else does Caius Numitorius say? what
                else do Marcus and Publius Cottius say, most noble men of the district of <placeName
                  key="perseus,Tauromenium">Tauromenium</placeName>? what else does Marcus Lucceius

                  >Rhegium</placeName>? what else do all the others ray? For as yet witnesses have
                only been produced by me of this class, not men who say that they were acquainted
                with Gavius, but men who say that they saw him at the time that he was being dragged
                to the cross, while crying out that he was a Roman citizen. And you, O Verres, say
                the same thing. You confess that he did cry out that he was a Roman citizen; but
                that the name of citizenship did not avail with you even as much as to cause the
                least hesitation in your mind, or even any brief respite from a most cruel and
                ignominious punishment. <milestone n="166" unit="section"/> This is the point I
                press, this is what I dwell upon, O judges; with this single fact I am content. I
                give up, I am indifferent to all the rest. By his own confession he must be
                entangled and destroyed. You did not know who he was; you suspected that he was a
                spy. I do not ask you what were your grounds for that suspicion, I impeach you by
                your own words. He said that he was a Roman citizen. If you, O Verres, being taken
                among the Persians or in the remotest parts of <placeName key="tgn,7000198"
                  >India</placeName>, were being led to execution, what else would you cry out but
                that you were a Roman citizen? And if that name of your city, honoured and renowned
                as it is among all men, would have availed you, a stranger among strangers, among
                barbarians, among men placed in the most remote and distant corners of the earth,
                ought not he, whoever he was, whom you were hurrying to the cross, who was a
                stranger to you, to have been able, when he said that he was a Roman citizen, to
                obtain from you, the praetor, if not an escape, at least a respite from death by his
                mention of and claims to citizenship? <milestone n="65" unit="chapter"/><milestone

                this confidence in the mere fact of their citizenship, they think that they shall be
                safe, not only among our own magistrates, who are restrained by fear of the laws and
                of public opinion, nor among our fellow citizens only, who are limited with them by

                citizen, though no one knows that it is not true; and at one blow, by admitting that
                defence; you cut off from the Roman citizens all the provinces, all the kingdoms,
                all free cities, and indeed the whole world, which has hitherto been open most
                especially to our countrymen. But what shall be said if he named Lucius Pretius, a

                  >Sicily</placeName> as a trader, as a man who would vouch for him? Was it a very

                remit some part of the extreme punishment. Did he not know him? Then, if you thought
                fit, you might establish this law for all people, that whoever was not known to you,
                and could not produce a rich man to vouch for him, even though he were a Roman

                rather an enemy to the name and class of citizens, and to all their rights. You were
                not, I say, an enemy to the individual, but to the common cause of liberty. For what
                was your object in ordering the Mamertines, when, according to their regular custom
                and usage, they had erected the cross behind the city in the Pompeian road, to place
                it where it looked towards the strait; and in adding, what you can by no means deny,
                what you said openly in the hearing of every one, that you chose that place in order
                that the man who said that he was a Roman citizen, might be able from his cross to
                behold <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> and to look towards his own
                home? And accordingly, O judges, that cross, for the first time since the foundation
                of <placeName key="tgn,7003897">Messana</placeName>, was erected in that place. A

                separated by a very narrow strait, and that <placeName key="tgn,1000080"

                action cannot by any possibility be adequately expressed by any name bad enough for
                it. Yet with all this that man was not content. &ldquo;Let him behold his

                whom,&mdash;it was not one Roman citizen,&mdash;it was the common cause of
                freedom and citizenship that you exposed to that torture and nailed on that cross.
                But now consider the audacity of the man. Do not you think that he was indignant
                that be could not erect that cross for Roman citizens in the forum, in the comitium,
                in the very rostra? For the place in his province which was the most like those
                places in celebrity, and the nearest to them in point of distance, he did select. He
                chose that monument of his wickedness and audacity to be in the sight of <placeName

                might be, would be moved by such excessive, by such scandalous atrocity of conduct.
                But now, when I am speaking before senators of the Roman people, the authors of the
                laws, of the courts of justice, and of all right, I ought not to fear that that man
                will not be judged to be the only Roman citizen deserving of that cross of his, and
                that all others will not be judged most undeserving of such a danger. <milestone
                  n="172" unit="section"/> A little while ago, O judges, we did not restrain our
                tears at the miserable and most unworthy death of the naval captains; and it was
                right for us to be moved at the misery of our innocent allies; what now ought we to
                do when the lives of our relations are concerned? For the blood of all Roman
                citizens ought to be accounted kindred blood; since the consideration of the common
                safety, and truth requires it. All the Roman citizens in this place, both those who
                are present, and those who are absent in distant lands, require your severity,
                implore the aid of your good faith, look anxiously for your assistance. They think
                that all their privileges, all their advantages, all their defences, in short their
                whole liberty, depends on your sentence. <milestone n="173" unit="section"/> From
                me, although they have already had aid enough, still, if the affair should turn out
                ill, they will perhaps have more than the venture to ask for. For even though any
                violence should snatch that man from your severity, which I do not fear, a judges,
                nor do I think it by any means possible; still, if my expectations should in this
                deceive me, the Sicilians will complain that their cause is lost, and they will be
                as indignant as I shall myself; yet the Roman people, in a short time, since it has
                given me the power of pleading before them, shall through my exertions recover its
                rights by its own votes before the beginning of February. And if you have any
                anxiety, O judges, for my honour and for my renown, it is not unfavourable for my
                interests, that that man, having been saved from me at this trial, should be
                reserved for that decision of the Roman people. The cause is a splendid one, one
                easily to be proved by me, very acceptable and agreeable to the Roman people.
                Lastly, if I see where to have wished to rise at the expense of that one man, which
                I have not wished,&mdash;if he should be acquitted, (a thing which cannot happen
                without the wickedness of many men,) I shall be enabled to rise at the expense of
                many. <milestone n="68" unit="chapter"/></p>
              <p>But in truth, for your sake, O judges, and for the sake of the republic, I should
                grieve that such a crime was committed by this select bench of judges. I should
                grieve that those judges, whom I have myself approved of and joined in selecting,
                should walk about in this city branded with such disgrace by that man being
                acquitted, as to seem smeared not with wax, <note anchored="yes">This refers to the
                  tablets on which the judges signified their decision, which, as has been said
                  before, were covered with wax.</note> but with mud. <milestone n="174"
                  unit="section"/> Wherefore, from this place I warn you also, O Hortensius, if
                there is any room for giving a warning, to take care again and again, and to
                consider what you are doing, and whither you are proceeding; what man it is whom you
                are defending, and by what means you are doing so. Nor in this manner do I seek at
                all to limit you, so as to prevent your contending against me with all your genius,
                and all your ability in speaking. As to other things, if you think that you can
                secretly manage, out of court, some of the things which belong to this judicial
                trial; if you think that you can effect anything by artifice, by cunning, by
                influence, by your own popularity, by that man's wealth; then I am strongly of
                opinion you had better abandon that idea. And I warn you rather to put down, I warn
                you not to suffer to proceed any further the attempts which have already been
                commenced by that man, but which have been thoroughly detected by, and are
                thoroughly known to me. It will be at a great risk to yourself that any error is
                committed in this trial; at a greater risk than you think. <milestone n="175"
                  unit="section"/> For as for your thinking yourself now relieved from all fear for
                your reputation, and at the summit of all honour as consul elect, believe me, it is
                no less laborious a task to preserve those honours and kindnesses, conferred on you
                by the Roman people, than to acquire them. This city has borne as long as it could,
                as long as there was no help for it, that kingly sort of sway of yours which you
                have exercised in the courts of justice, and in every part of the republic. It has
                borne it, I say. But on the day when the tribunes of the people were restored to the
                Roman people, all those privileges (if you are not yourself already aware of it)
                were taken away from you. At this very time the eyes of all men are directed on each
                individual among us, to see with what good faith I prosecute him, with what
                scrupulous justice these men judge him, in what manner you defend him. <milestone
                  n="176" unit="section"/> And in the case of all of us, if any one of us turns
                aside ever so little from the right path, there will follow, not that silent opinion
                of men which you were formerly accustomed to despise, but a severe and fearless
                judgment of the Roman people. You have, O Quintus, no relationship, no connection
                with that man. In the case of this man you can have none of those excuses with which
                you formerly used to defend your excessive zeal in any trial. You are bound to take
                care above all things, that the things which that fellow used to say in the
                province, when he said that he did all that he was doing out of his confidence in
                you, shall not be thought to be true. <milestone n="69" unit="chapter"/><milestone

              <p>I feel sure now that I have discharged my duty to the satisfaction of all those who
                are most unfavourable to me. For I convicted him, in the few hours which the first
                pleading occupied, in the opinion of every man. The remainder of the trial is not
                now about my good faith, which has been amply proved, nor about that fellow's way of
                life, which has bean fully condemned; but it is the judges, and if I am to tell the
                truth, it is yourself, who will now be passed sentence on. But when will that
                sentence be passed? For that is a point that must be much looked to, since in all
                things, and especially in state affairs, the consideration of time and circumstance
                is of the greatest importance. Why, at that time when the Roman people shall demand
                another class of men, another order of citizens to act as judges. Sentence will be
                pronounced in deciding on that law about new judges and fresh tribunals which has
                been proposed in reality not by the man whose name you see on the back of it, but by
                this defendant. Verres, I say, has contrived to have this law drawn up and proposed
                from the hope and opinion which he entertains of you. <milestone n="178"
                  unit="section"/> Therefore, when this cause was first commenced, that law had not
                been proposed; when Verres, alarmed at your impartiality, had given many indications
                that he was not likely to make any reply at all, still no mention was made of that
                law; when he seemed to pick up a little courage and to fortify himself with some
                little hope, immediately this law was proposed. And as your dignity is exceedingly
                inconsistent with this law, so his false hopes and preeminent impudence are strongly
                in favour of it. In this case, if anything blameworthy be done by any of you, either
                the Roman people itself will judge that man whom it has already pronounced unworthy
                of any trial at all; or else those men will judge, who, because of the unpopularity
                of the existing tribunals, will be appointed as new judges by a new law made
                respecting the old judges. <milestone n="70" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="179"

              <p>For myself, even though I were not to say it myself, who is there who is not aware
                how far it is necessary for me to proceed? Will it be possible for me to be silent,
                O Hortensius? Will it be possible for me to dissemble, when the republic has
                received so severe a wound, that, though I pleaded the cause, our provinces will
                appear to have been pillaged, our allies oppressed, the immortal gods plundered,
                Roman citizens tortured and murdered with impunity? Will it be possible for me
                either to lay this burden on the shoulders of this tribunal, or any longer to endure
                it in silence? Must not the matter be agitated? must it not be brought publicly
                forward? Must not the good faith of the Roman people be implored? Must not all who
                have implicated themselves in such wickedness as to allow their good faith to be
                tampered with, or to give a corrupt decision, be summoned before the court, and made
                to encounter a public trial? <milestone n="180" unit="section"/> Perhaps some one
                will ask, Are you then going to take upon yourself such a labour, and such violent
                enmity from so many quarters? Not, of a truth, from any desire of mine, or of my own
                free will. But I have not the same liberty allowed me that they have who are born of
                noble family; on whom even when they are asleep all the honours of the Roman people
                are showered. I must live in this city on far other terms and other conditions. For
                the case of Marcus Cato, a most wise and active man, occurs to me; who, as he
                thought that it was better to be recommended to the Roman people by virtue than by
                high birth, and as he wished that the foundation of his race and name should be hid
                and extended by himself, voluntarily encountered the enmity of most influential men,
                and lived in the discharge of the greatest labours to an extreme old age with great
                credit. <milestone n="181" unit="section"/> After that, did not Quintus Pompeius, a
                man born in a low and obscure rank of life, gain the very highest honours by
                encountering the enmity of many, and great personal danger, and by undertaking great
                labour? And lately we have seen Caius Fimbria, Caius Marcius, and Caius Caelius,
                striving with no slight toil, and in spite of no insignificant opposition, to arrive
                at those honours which you nobles arrive at while devoted to amusement or absorbed
                in indifference. This is the system, this is the path for our adoption. These are
                the men whose conduct and principles we follow. <milestone n="71" unit="chapter"
                /></p>
              <p>We see how unpopular with, and how hateful to some men of noble birth, is the
                virtue and industry of new men; that, if we only turn our eyes away for a moment,
                snares are laid for us; that, if we give the least room for suspicion or for
                accusation, an attack is immediately made on us; that we must be always vigilant,
                always labouring. Are there any enmities?&mdash;let them be encountered; any
                toils?&mdash;Let them be undertaken. <milestone n="182" unit="section"/> In
                truth, silent and secret enmities are more to be dreaded than war openly declared
                and waged against us. There's scarcely one man of noble birth who looks favourably
                on our industry; there are no services of ours by which we can secure their
                good-will; they differ from us in disposition and inclination, as if they were of a
                different race and a different nature. What danger then is there to us in their
                enmity, when their dispositions are already averse and inimical to us before we have
                at all provoked their enmity? <milestone n="183" unit="section"/> Wherefore, O
                judges, I earnestly wish that I may appear for the last time in the character of an
                accuser, in the case of this criminal, when I shall have given satisfaction to the
                Roman people, and discharged the duty due to the Sicilians my client, and which I
                have voluntarily undertaken. But it is my deliberate resolution, if the event should
                deceive the expectation which I cherish of you, to prosecute not only those who are
                particularly implicated in the guilt of corrupting the tribunal, but those also who
                have in any way been accomplices in it. Moreover, if there be any persons, who in
                the case of the criminal have any inclination to show themselves powerful, or
                audacious, or ingenious in corrupting the tribunal, let them hold themselves ready,
                seeing that they will have to fight a battle with us, while the Roman people will be
                the judges of the contest. And if they know that, in the case of this criminal, whom
                the Sicilian nation has given me for my enemy, I have been sufficiently energetic,
                sufficiently persevering, and sufficiently vigilant, they may conceive that I shall
                be a much more formidable and active enemy to those men whose enmity I have
                encountered of my own accord, for the sake of the Roman people. <milestone n="72"

                implore them, O judges, so to influence you, that the thoughts which were mine when
                I undertook this cause, the good faith which has been mine in pleading it, may be
                yours also in deciding it. <milestone n="189" unit="section"/> Lastly, that, if all
                the actions of Caius Verres are unexampled and unheard of instances of wickedness,
                of audacity, of perfidy, of lust, of avarice, and of cruelty, an end worthy of such
                a life and such actions may, by your sentence, overtake him; and that the republic,
                and my own duty to it, may be content with my undertaking this one prosecution, and
                that I may be allowed for the future to defend the good, instead of being compelled
                to prosecute the infamous.</p>
