<head>Suetonius' Life</head>
<div2 type="chapter" n="1">
<p>C. SUETONIUS TRANQUILLUS was the son of a Roman knight who commanded a legion, on the side of Otho, at the battle which decided the fate of the empire in favour of Vitellius.
From incidental notices in the following History, we learn that he was born towards the close of the reign of Vespasian, who died in the year 79
of the Christian era.
He lived till the time of Hadrian, under whose administration he filled the office of secretary; until, with several others, he was dismissed for presuming on familiarities with the empress <placeName key="tgn,7006766">Sabina</placeName>, of which we have no further account than that they were unbecoming his position in the imperial court.
How long he survived this disgrace, which appears to have befallen him in the year <date value="121">121</date>, we are not informed; but we find that the leisure afforded him by his retirement, was employed in the composition of numerous works, of which the most important was " The Lives of the Twelve Caesars."
The plan adopted by Suetonius in his Lives of the Twelve Caesars, led him to be more diffuse on their personal conduct and habits than on public events.
He writes Memoirs rather than History.</p>
<p>When we stop to gaze in a museum or gallery on the antique busts of the Caesars, we perhaps endeavour to trace in their sculptured physiognomy the characteristics of those princes, who, for good or evil.
were in their times masters of the destinies of a large portion of the human race.
The pages of Suetonius will amply gratify this natural curiosity.
In them we find a series of individual portraits sketched to the life, with perfect truth and rigorous impartiality.
La Harpe remarks of Suetonius, "He is scrupulously exact, and strictly methodical.
He omits nothing which concerns the person whose life he is writing; he relates everything, but paints nothing.
His work is, in some sense, a collection of anecdotes, but it is very curious to read and consult."
<note anchored="yes">Lyc&eacute;e,  part I liv III c. 1.
</note>
This edition of Suetonius' Caesars, is appropriately embellished by the celebrated series of portraits copied from authentic Busts of the Emperors by Visconti and now re-engraved for the illustration of this work.
The perfection of marble or statue portraiture was attained in <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> soon after the conquest of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, <date value="-200"><date value="-200">B.C. 200</date></date>, when not only the choicest works of Grecian art were transferred to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, but the most accomplished sculptors and painters also.
Portraiture in Marble became a passion and a fashion, and we learn from the contemporary literature of the period, how faithful these portraits were.
It flourished till the "decline" began under Commodus. When successive revolutions and conquests laid <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> in ruins, the majority of those statues were buried in the fall; many thrown into the <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName>, and nearly all forgotten in the dark ages which fell like a pall over the vanquished city: and it was not till Art in <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> had a new birth (after sleeping a thousand years) that those marble and bronze portraits were begun to be resurrected, and gradually, down to the present day, restored to the museums of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> and other Capitals of <placeName key="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName>.
Combining as it does amusement and information, Suetonius's "Lives of the Caesars" was held in such estimation, that, so soon after the invention of printing as the year <date value="1500">A. D. 1500</date>, no fewer than eighteen editions had been published, and nearly one hundred have since been added to the number.
Critics of the highest rank have devoted themselves to the task of correcting and commenting on the text, and the work has been translated into every European language.
Of the English translations, that of Dr. Alexander Thomson, published in <date value="1796">1796</date>, has been made the basis of the present.
By the suppression of about two dozen lines in the entire work, which have been indicated by * * * * we have produced a work unobjectionable for general reading; the suppressed passages refer to grossly unnatural crimes which probably never were committed - but the relation of which was likely prompted by the political party rancour of the period.
In order to more fully "paint the picture of the times," we have had written and interspersed in chronological order, the lives of all the distinguished associates of the Twelve Caesars, male and female, which we trust will be a great improvement on any previous edition.</p>

<p>JULIUS CAESAR, the divine,
<note anchored="yes">
<foreign lang="la">Julius Caesar Divus</foreign>. Romulus, the founder of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, had the honour of an apotheosis conferred on him by the senate, under the title of Quirinus, to obviate the people's suspicion of his having been taken off by a conspiracy of the patrician order. Political circumstances again concurred with popular superstition to revive this posthumous adulation in favour of Julius Caesar, the founder of the empire, who also fell by the hands of conspirators. It is remarkable in the history of a nation so jealous of public liberty, that, in both instances, they bestowed the highest mark of human homage upon men who owed their fate to the introduction of arbitrary power.
</note>
lost his father
<note anchored="yes">Pliny informs us that Caius Julius, the father of Julius Caesar, a man of praetorian rank, died suddenly at <placeName key="perseus,Pisa">Pisa</placeName>.
</note>
when he was in the sixteenth year of his age;
<note anchored="yes">A. U. C. (in the year from the foundation of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>) 670; A. C. (before Christ) about 92.
</note>
and the year following, being nominated to the office of high-priest of <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName>,
<note anchored="yes">
<foreign lang="la">Flamen Dialis</foreign>. This was an office of great dignity, but subjected the holder to many restrictions. He was not allowed to ride on horseback, nor to absent himself from the city for a single night. His wife was also under particular restraints, and could not be divorced. If she died, the flamen resigned his office, because there were certain sacred rites which he could not perform without her assistance. Besides other marks of distinction, he wore a purple robe called laena, and a conical mitre called apex.
</note>
he repudiated Cossutia, who was very wealthy, although her family belonged only to the equestrian order, and to whom he had been contracted when he was a mere boy.
He then married Cornelia, the daughter of Cinna, who was four times consul; and had by her, shortly afterwards, a daughter named Julia.
Resisting all the efforts of the dictator Sylla to induce him to divorce Cornelia, he suffered the penalty of being stripped of his sacerdotal office, his wife's dowry, and his own patrimonial estates; and, being identified with the adverse faction,
<note anchored="yes">Two powerful parties were contending at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> for the supremacy; Sylla being at the head of the faction of the nobles, while Marius espoused the cause of the people. Sylla suspected Julius Caesar of belonging to the Marian party, because Marius had married his aunt Julia.
</note>
was compelled to withdraw from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.
After changing his place of concealment nearly every night,
<note anchored="yes">He wandered about for some time in the <placeName key="tgn,7021127">Sabine</placeName> territory.
</note>
although he was suffering from a quartan ague, and having effected his release by bribing the officers who had tracked his footsteps, he at length obtained a pardon through the intercession of the vestal virgins, and of Mamercus AEmilius and Aurelius Cotta, his near relatives.
We are assured that when Sylla, having withstood for a while the entreaties of his own best friends, persons of distinguished rank, at last yielded to their importunity, he exclaimed-either by a divine impulse, or from a shrewd conjecture: "Your suit is granted, and you may take him among you; but know," he added, " that this man, for whose safety you are so extremely anxious, will, some day or other, be the ruin of the party of the nobles, in defence of which you are leagued with me; for in this one Caesar, you will find many a Marius."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="2">
<p>His first campaign was served in <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, on the staff
of the praetor, M. Thermus; and being dispatched into <placeName key="tgn,7016608">Bithynia</placeName>,
<note anchored="yes"><placeName key="tgn,7016608">Bithynia</placeName>, in <placeName key="tgn,7002294">Asia Minor</placeName>, was bounded on the south by <placeName key="tgn,7002613">Phrygia</placeName>; on the west by the Bosphorus and Propontis; and on the north by the Euxine sea. Its boundaries towards the east are not clearly ascertained, Strabo, Pliny, and Ptolemy differing from each other on the subject.
</note>
to bring thence a fleet, he loitered so long at the court of Nicomedes, as to give occasion to reports of lewd proceedings between him  and  that prince; which received additional credit from his hasty return to <placeName key="tgn,7016608">Bithynia</placeName>, under the pretext of recovering a debt due to a freedman, his client.
The rest of his service was more favourable to his reputation; and when <placeName key="tgn,7002672">Mitylene</placeName>
<note anchored="yes"><placeName key="tgn,7002672">Mitylene</placeName> was a city in the island of <placeName key="tgn,7002672">Lesbos</placeName>, famous for the study of philosophy and eloquence. According to Pliny, it remained a free city and in power one thousand five hundred years. It suffered much in the Peloponnesian war from the Athenians, and in the Mithridatic from the Romans, by whom it was taken and destroyed. But it soon rose again, having recovered its ancient liberty by the favour of Pompey; and was afterwards much embellished by Trajan, who added to it the splendour of his own name. This was the country of Pittacus, one of the seven wise men of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, as well as of Alcaeus and Sappho. The natives showed a particular taste for poetry, and had, as Plutarch informs us, stated times for the celebration of poetical contests.
</note>
was taken by storm, he was presented by Thermus with the civic crown.
<note anchored="yes">The civic crown was made of oak-leaves, and given to him who had saved the life of a citizen. The person thus decorated wore it at public spectacles, and sat next the senators. When he entered, the audience rose up, as a mark of respect.
</note></p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="3">
<p>He served also in <placeName key="tgn,7002470">Cilicia</placeName>,
<note anchored="yes">A very extensive country of Hither Asia; lying between <placeName key="tgn,7002611">Pamphylia</placeName> to the west, Mount Taurus and Amanus to the north, <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName> to the east, and the Mediterranean to the south. It was anciently famous for saffron; and hair-cloth, called by the Romans <foreign lang="la">cilicium</foreign>, was the manufacture of this country.
</note>
under Servilius Isauricus, but only for a short time; as upon receiving intelligence
of Sylla's death, he returned with all speed to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, in expectation of what might follow from a fresh agitation set on foot by Marcus Lepidus.
Distrusting, however, the abilities of this leader, and finding the times less favourable for the execution of this project than he had at first imagined, he abandoned all thoughts of joining Lepidus, although he received the most tempting offers.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="4">
<p>Soon after this civil discord was composed, he preferred a charge of extortion against Cornelius Dolabella, a man of consular dignity, who had obtained the honour of a triumph.
On the acquittal of the accused, he resolved to retire to <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName>,
<note anchored="yes">A city and an island, near the coast of <placeName key="tgn,7002358">Caria</placeName>, famous for the huge statue of the Sun, called the Colossus. The Rhodians were celebrated not only for skill in naval affairs, but for learning, philosophy, and eloquence. During the latter periods of the Roman republic, and under some of the emperors, numbers resorted there to prosecute their studies; and it also became a place of retreat to discontented Romans.
</note>
with the view not only of avoiding the public odium which he had incurred, but of prosecuting his studies with leisure and tranquillity, under Apollonius, the son of Molon, at that time the most celebrated master of rhetoric.
While on his voyage thither, in the winter season, he was taken by pirates near the island of Pharmacusa,
<note anchored="yes">Pharmacusa, an island lying off the coast of <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, near <placeName key="perseus,Miletus">Miletus</placeName>. It is now called Parmosa.
</note>
and detained by them, burning with indignation, for nearly forty days; his only attendants being a physician and two chamberlains.
For he had instantly dispatched his other servants and the friends who accompanied him, to raise money for his ransom.
<note anchored="yes">The ransom, too large for Caesar's private means, was raised by the voluntary contributions of the cities in the Asiatic province, who were equally liberal from their public funds in the case of other Romans who fell into the hands of pirates at that period.
</note>
Fifty talents having been paid down, he was landed on the coast, when,
having collected some ships,
<note anchored="yes">From <placeName key="perseus,Miletus">Miletus</placeName>, as we are informed by Plutarch.
</note>
he lost no time in putting to sea in pursuit of the pirates, and having captured them, inflicted upon them the punishment with which he had often threatened them in jest.
At that time Mithridates was ravaging the neighbouring districts, and on Caesar's arrival at <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName>, that he might not appear to lie idle while danger threatened the allies of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, he passed over into <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, and having collected some auxiliary forces, and driven the king's governor out of the province, retained in their allegiance the cities which were wavering and ready to revolt.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="5">
<p>Having been elected military tribune, the first honour he received from the suffrages of the people after his return to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, he zealously assisted those who took measures for restoring the tribunitian authority, which had been greatly diminished during the usurpation of Sylla.
He likewise, by an act, which Plotius at his suggestion propounded to the people, obtained the recall of Lucius Cinna, his wife's brother, and others with him, who having been the adherents of Lepidus in the civil disturbances, had after that consul's death fled to Sertorius;
<note anchored="yes">Who commanded in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>.
</note>
which law he supported by a speech.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="6">
<p>During his quaestorship he pronounced funeral orations from the rostra, according to custom, in praise of his aunt Julia, and his wife Cornelia.
In the panegyric on his aunt, he gives the following account of her own and his father's genealogy, on both sides: "My aunt Julia derived her descent, by the mother, from a race of kings, and by her father, from the Immortal Gods.
For the Marcii Reges,
<note anchored="yes">Rex, it will be easily understood, was not a title of dignity in a Roman family, but the surname of the Marcii.
</note>
her mother's family, deduce their pedigree from Ancus Marcius, and the Julii, her father's, from Venus; of which stock we are a branch.
We therefore unite in our descent the sacred majesty of kings, the chiefest among men, and the divine majesty of Gods, to whom  kings themselves are subject."
To supply the place of Cornelia, he married Pompeia, the daughter of Quintus Pompeius, and grand-daughter of Lucius Sylla; but he afterwards divorced her, upon suspicion of her having been debauched by Publius Clodius.
For so current was the report, that Clodius had found access to her disguised as a woman, during the celebration of a religious solemnity,<note anchored="yes">The rites of the Bona Dea, called also Fauna, which were performed in the night, and by women only.</note>
that the senate instituted an inquiry respecting the profanation of the sacred rites.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="7">
<p>Farther-Spain
<note anchored="yes">Hispania Baetica; the Hither province being called Hispania Tarraconensis.
</note>
fell to his lot as quaestor; when there, as he was going the circuit of the province, by commission from the praetor, for the administration of justice, and had reached <placeName key="tgn,7007512">Gades</placeName>, seeing a statue of Alexander the Great in the temple of Hercules, he sighed deeply, as if weary of his sluggish life, for having performed no memorable actions at an ages at which Alexander had already conquered the world.<note anchored="yes">Alexander the Great was only thirty-three years at the time of his death.
</note>
He, therefore, immediately sued for his discharge, with the view of embracing the first opportunity, which might present itself in The City, of entering upon a more exalted career.
In the stillness of the night following, he dreamt that he lay with his own mother; but his confusion was relieved, and his hopes were raised to the highest pitch, by the interpreters of his dream, who expounded it as an omen that he should
possess universal empire; for that the mother who in his sleep he had found submissive to his embraces, was no other than the earth, the common parent of all mankind.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="8">
<p>Quitting therefore the province before the expiration of the usual term, he betook himself to the Latin colonies, which were then eagerly agitating the design of obtaining the freedom  of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>; and he would have stirred them up to some bold attempt, had not the consuls, to prevent any commotion, detained for some time the legions which had been raised for service in <placeName key="tgn,7002470">Cilicia</placeName>.
But this did not deter him from making, soon afterwards, a still greater effort within the precincts of the city itself.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="9">
<p>For, only a few days before he entered upon the edileship, he incurred a suspicion of having engaged in a conspiracy with Marcus Crassus, a man of consular rank; to whom were joined Publius Sylla and Lucius Autronius, who, after they had been chosen consuls, were convicted of bribery.
The plan of the conspirators was to fall upon the senate at the opening of the new year, and murder as many of them as should be thought necessary; upon which, Crassus was to assume the office of dictator, and appoint Caesar his master of the horse.<note anchored="yes">The proper office of the master of the horse was to command the knights, and execute the orders of the dictator. He was usually nominated from amongst persons of consular and pratorian dignity; and
had the use of a horse, which the dictator had not, without the order
of the people.
</note> When the commonwealth had been thus ordered according to their pleasure, the consulship was to have been restored to Sylla and Autronius.
Mention is made of this plot by Tanusius
Geminus<note anchored="yes"><placeName key="tgn,2652379">Seneca</placeName> compares the annals of Tanusius to the life of a fool, which,
though it may be long, is worthless; while that of a wise man, like a
good book, is valuable, however short.-Epist. 94.
</note> in his history, by Marcus Bibulus in his edicts,
<note anchored="yes">Bibulus was Caesar's colleague, both as edile and consul. Cicero calls his edicts "Archilochian," that is, as full of spite as the verses of Archilochus.-<bibl n="Cic. Att. 7.24">Ad. Attc. b. 7. ep. 24.</bibl>
</note>
and by Curio, the father, in his orations.
<note anchored="yes">A. U. C. 689. Cicero holds both the Curios, father and son, very cheap.-Brut. c. 60. <placeName key="tgn,7011407">Regnum</placeName>, the kingly power, which the Roman people considered an insupportable tyranny. An honourable banishment.
</note>
Cicero likewise seems to hint at this in a letter to <placeName key="tgn,7015932">Axius</placeName>, where he says, that Caesar had in his consulship secured to himself that arbitrary power
<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="la">Regnum</foreign>, the kingly power, which the Roman people considered an insupportable tyranny.</note>
to which he had aspired when he was edile.
Tanusius adds, that Crassus, from remorse or fear, did not appear upon the day appointed for the massacre of the senate; for which reason Caesar omitted to give the signal, which, according to the plan concerted between them, he was to have made.
The agreement, Curio says, was that he should shake off the toga from his shoulder.
We have the authority of the same Curio, and of M. Actorius Naso, for his having been likewise concerned in another conspiracy with young Cneius Piso; to whom, upon a suspicion of some mischief being meditated in the city, the province of <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName> was decreed out of the regular course.<note anchored="yes">An honourable banishment.</note> It is said to have been agreed between them, that Piso should head a revolt in the provinces, whilst the other should attempt to stir up an insurrection at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, using as their instruments the Lambrani, and the tribes beyond the Po. But the execution of this design was frustrated in both quarters by the death of Piso.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="10">
<p>In his edileship, he not only embellished the Comitium,<note anchored="yes">The assemblies of the people were at first held in the open Forum. Afterwards, a covered building, called the Comitium, was erected for that purpose. There are no remains of it, but Lumisden thinks that it
probably stood on the south side of the Forum, on the site of the present
church of The Consolation.-Antiq. of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, p. 357.
</note>
 and the rest of the Forum, with the adjoining
halls,
<note anchored="yes">Basilicas, from <foreign lang="greek">basileu/s</foreign>; a king. They were, indeed, the palaces
of the sovereign people; stately and spacious buildings, with halls, which served the purpose of exchanges, council chambers, and courts of justice.
Some of the Basilicas were afterwards converted into Christian churches.
"The form was oblong; the middle was an open space to walk in, called Testudo, and which we now call the nave.
On each side of this were rows of pillars, which formed what we should call the sideaisles, and which the ancients called Porticus.
The end of the Testudo was curved, like the apse of some of our churches, and was called Tribunal, from causes being heard there.
Hence the term  Tribune is applied to that part of the Roman churches which is behind the high altar."-Burton's Antiq.
of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, p. 204.
</note>
but adorned the Capitol also, with temporary piazzas, constructed for the purpose of displaying some part of the superabundant collections he had made for the amusement of the people.
<note anchored="yes">Such as statues and pictures, the works of Greek artists.
</note>
He entertained them with the hunting of wild beasts, and with games, both alone and in conjunction with his colleague.
On this account, he obtained the whole credit of the expense to which they had jointly contributed; insomuch that his colleague, Marcus Bibulus, could not forbear remarking, that he was served in the manner of Pollux.
For as the temple
<note anchored="yes">It appears to have stood at the foot of the Capitoline hill. Piranesi
thinks that the two beautiful columns of white marble, which are commonly described as belonging to the portico of the temple of Jupiter Stator, are the remains of the temple of Castor and Pollux.
</note>
erected in the Forum  to the two brothers, went by the name of Castor alone, so his and Caesar's joint munificence was imputed to the latter only.
To the other public spectacles exhibited to the people, Caesar added a fight of gladiators, but with fewer pairs of combatants than he had intended.
For he had collected from all parts so great a company of them, that his enemies became alarmed;  and
a decree was made, restricting the number of gladiators which any one was allowed to retain at <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="11">
<p>Having thus conciliated popular favour, he endeavoured, through his interest with some of the tribunes, to get <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> assigned to him as a province, by an act of the people.
The pretext alleged for the creation of this extraordinary government, was, that the Alexandrians had violently expelled their king,<note anchored="yes">Ptolemy Auletes, the son of <placeName key="tgn,2038217">Cleopatra</placeName>.</note> whom the senate had complimented with the title of an ally and friend of the Roman people.
This was generally resented; but, notwithstanding, there was so much opposition from the faction of the nobles, that he could not carry his point.
In order, therefore, to diminish their influence by every means in his power, he restored the trophies erected in honor of Caius Marius, on account of his victories over Jugurtha, the Cimbri, and the Teutoni, which had been demolished by Sylla; and when sitting in judgment upon murderers, he treated those as assassins, who, in the late proscription, had received money from the treasury, for bringing in the heads of Roman citizens, although they were expressly excepted in the <placeName key="tgn,2257061">Cornelian</placeName> laws.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="12">
<p>He likewise suborned some one to prefer an impeachment for treason against Caius Rabirius, by whose especial assistance the senate had, a few years before, put down Lucius Saturninus, the seditious tribune; and being drawn by lot a judge on the trial, he condemned him with so much animosity, that upon his appealing to the people, no circumstance availed him so much as the extraordinary bitterness of his judge.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="13">
<p>Having renounced all hope of obtaining <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> for his province, he stood candidate for the office of chief pontiff, to secure which, he had recourse to the most profuse bribery.
Calculating, on this occasion, the enormous amount of the debts he had contracted, he is reported to have said to his mother, when she kissed him at his going out in the morning to the assembly of the people, "I will never return home unless I am elected pontiff."
In effect, he left so far behind him two most powerful competitors, who were much his superiors both in age and rank, that he had more votes in their own tribes, than they both had in all the tribes together.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="14">
<p>After he was chosen praetor, the conspiracy of Catiline was discovered; and while every other member of the senate voted for inflicting capital punishment on the accomplices in that crime,<note anchored="yes">Lentulus, Cethegus, and others</note> he alone proposed that the delinquents should be distributed for safe custody among the towns of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, their property being confiscated.
He even struck such terror into those who were advocates of severity, by representing to them what universal odium would be attached to their memories by the Roman people, that Decius Silanus, consul-elect, did not hesitate to qualify his proposal, it not being very honourable to change it, by a lenient interpretation: as if it had been understood in a harsher sense than he intended, and Caesar would certainly have carried his point, having brought over to his side a great number of the senators, among whom was Cicero, the consul's brother, had not a speech by Marcus Cato infused new vigour into the resolutions of the senate.
He persisted, however, in obstructing the measure, until a body of the Roman knights, who stood under arms as a guard, threatened him with instant death, if he continued his determined opposition.
They even thrust at him with their drawn swords, so that those who sat next him moved away; and a few friends, with
no small difficulty, protected him, by throwing their arms round him, and covering him with their togas. At last, deterred by this violence, he not only gave way, but absented himself from the senate-house during the remainder of that year.</p></div2>

<p>Upon the first day of his praetorship, he summoned  Quintus Catulus to render an  account to the people respecting the repairs to the Capitol;<note anchored="yes">The temple of Jupiter Capitolinus was commenced and completed

</note> But being unable to withstand the strong opposition made by the aristocratical party, whom he perceived quitting, in great numbers, their attendance upon the new consuls,<note anchored="yes">It being the calends of January, the first day of the year, on which

<div2 type="chapter" n="16">
<p>He afterwards approved himself a most resolute supporter of Caecilius Metellus, tribune of the people, who, in spite of all opposition from his colleagues, had proposed some laws of a violent tendency,<note anchored="yes">Among others, one for recalling Pompey from <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, under the pretext that the commonwealth was in danger. Cato was one of the colleagues who saw through the design and opposed the decree.
</note> until they were both dismissed from office by a vote of the senate. He ventured, notwithstanding, to retain his post and
continue in the administration of justice; but finding that preparations were made to obstruct him by force of arms, he dismissed the lictors, threw off his gown, and betook himself privately to his own house, with the resolution of being quiet, in a time so unfavourable to his interests.
He likewise pacified the mob, which two days afterwards flocked about him, and in a riotous manner made a voluntary tender of their assistance in the vindication of his honour.
This happening contrary to expectation, the senate, who met in haste, on account of the tumult, gave him their thanks by some of the leading members of the house, and sending for him, after high commendation of his conduct, cancelled their former vote, and restored him to his office.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="17">
<p>But he soon got into fresh trouble, being named amongst the accomplices of Catiline, both before Novius Niger the quaestor, by Lucius Vettius the informer, and in the senate by Quintus Curius; to whom a reward had been voted, for having first discovered the designs of the conspirators.
Curius affirmed that he had received his information from  Catiline.
Vettius even engaged to produce in evidence against him his own hand-writing, given to Catiline.
Caesar, feeling that this treatment was not to be borne, appealed to Cicero himself, whether he had not voluntarily made a discovery to him of some particulars of the conspiracy; and so baulked Curius of his expected reward.
He, therefore, obliged Vettius to give pledges for his behaviour, seized his goods, and after heavily fining him, and seeing him almost torn in pieces before the rostra, threw him into prison; to which he likewise sent Novius the quaestor, for having presumed to take an information against a magistrate of superior authority.</p></div2>

<p>At the expiration of his praetorship he obtained

</note>
and pacified his creditors, who were for detaining him, by finding sureties for his debts.
<note anchored="yes">Plutarch informs us, that Caesar, before he came into office, owed his creditors 1,300 talents, somewhat more than .565,ooo sterling. But his debts increased so much after this period, if we may believe Appian, that upon his departure for Spain, at the expiration of his praetorship, he is reported to have said, <quote lang="la">Bis millies et quingenties centena millia sibi adesse aportere, ut nihil haberet</quote>: i. e. That he was 2,000,000 and nearly 20,000 sesterces worse than penniless. Crassus became his security for 830 talents, about &pound;871,500.
</note>
Contrary, however, to both law and custom, he took his departure  before  the  usual equipage  and  outfit were prepared.
It is uncertain whether this precipitancy arose from the apprehension of an impeachment, with which he was threatened on the expiration of his former office, or from his anxiety to lose no time in relieving the allies, who implored him to come to their aid.
He had no sooner established tranquillity in the province, than, without waiting for the arrival of his successor, he returned to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, with equal haste, to sue for a triumph,

and the consulship.
The day of election, however, being already fixed by proclamation, he could not legally be admitted a candidate, unless he entered the city as a private person.<note anchored="yes">Caesar was placed in this dilemma, that if he aspired to a triumph,
he must remain outside the walls until it took place, while as a candidate for the consulship, he must be resident in the city.
</note> On this emergency he solicited a suspension of the laws in his favour; but such an indulgence being strongly opposed, he found himself under the necessity of abandoning all thoughts of a triumph, lest he should be disappointed of the consulship.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="19">
<p>Of the two other competitors for the consulship,
Lucius Luceius and Marcus Bibulus, he joined with the former, upon condition that Luceius, being a man of less interest, but greater affluence, should promise money to the electors, in their joint names.
Upon which the party of the nobles, dreading how far he might carry matters in that high office, with a colleague disposed to concur in and second his measures, advised Bibulus to promise the voters as much as the other; and most of them contributed towards the expense, Cato himself admitting that bribery, under such circumstances, was for the public good.<note anchored="yes">Even the severe censor was biassed by political expediency to sanction a system, under which what little remained of public virtue, and the love of liberty at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, were fast decaying.
The strict laws against bribery at elections were disregarded, and it was practised openly, and accepted without a blush.
Sallust says that everything was venal, and that <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> itself might be bought, if one was rich enough to purchase it. <bibl n="Sal. Jug. 8.20.3">Jugurth.
viii. 20, 3</bibl>.</note>
He was accordingly elected consul jointly with Bibulus.
Actuated still by the same motives, the prevailing party took care to assign provinces of small importance to the new consuls, such as the care of the woods and roads.
Caesar, incensed at this indignity, endeavoured by the most assiduous and flattering attentions to gain to his side Cneius Pompey, at that time dissatisfied with the senate for the backwardness they showed to confirm his acts, after his victories over Mithridates.
He likewise brought about a reconciliation between Pompey and Marcus Crassus, who had been at variance from the time of their joint consulship.
in which office they were continually clashing; and he entered into an agreement with both, that nothing should be transacted in the government, which was displeasing to any of the three.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="20">
<p>Having entered upon his office,<note anchored="yes">A. U. C. 695.</note> he introduced a new regulation, that the daily acts both of the senate and
people should be committed to writing, and published.<note anchored="yes">The proceedings of the senate were reported in short notes taken by one of their own order, "strangers" not being admitted at their sittings.
These notes included speeches as well as acts. These and the proceedings of the assemblies of the people, were daily published in journals [diurna], which contained also accounts of the trials at law, with miscellaneous intelligence of births and deaths, marriages and divorces.
The practice of publishing the proceedings of the senate, introduced by Julius Caesar, was discontinued by Augustus.
</note> He also revived an old custom, that an officer<note anchored="yes">Within the city, the lictors walked before only one of the consuls, and that commonly for a month alternately.
A public officer, called Accensus, preceded the other consul, and the lictors followed.  This custom had long been disused, but was now restored by Caesar.</note> should precede him, and his lictors follow him, on the alternate months when the fasces were not carried before him.
Upon preferring a bill to the people for the division of some public lands, he was opposed by his colleague, whom he violently drove out of the forum.
Next day the insulted consul made a complaint in the senate of this treatment; but such was the consternation, that no one having the courage to bring the matter forward or move a censure, which had been often done under outrages of less importance, he was so much dispirited, that until the expiration of his office he never stirred from home, and did nothing but issue edicts to obstruct his colleague's proceedings.
From that time, therefore, Caesar had the sole management of public affairs; insomuch that some wags, when they signed any instrument as witnesses, did not add " in the consulship of Caesar and Bibulus," but, "of Julius and Caesar;" putting the same person down twice, under his name and surname.
The following verses likewise were currently repeated on this occasion:
<quote lang="la"><l>Non Bibulo quidquam nuper, sed Caesare factum est;</l>
<l>Nam Bibulo fieri consule nil memini.</l></quote>
<quote lang="en"><l>Nothing was done in Bibulus's year:</l>
<l>No; Caesar only then was consul here.</l></quote>

The land of Stellas, consecrated by our ancestors to the gods, with some other lands in <placeName key="tgn,7003005">Campania</placeName> left subject to tribute, for the support of the expenses of the government, he divided, but not by lot, among upwards of twenty thousand freemen, who had each of them three or more children.
He eased the publicans, upon their petition, of a third part of the sum which they had engaged to pay into the public treasury; and openly admonished them not to bid so extravagantly upon the next occasion.
He made various profuse grants to meet the wishes of others, no one opposing him; or if any such attempt was made, it was soon suppressed.
Marcus Cato, who interrupted him in his proceedings, he ordered to be dragged out of the senate-house by a lictor, and carried to prison.
Lucius Lucullus, likewise, for opposing him with some warmth.
he so terrified with the apprehension of being criminated, that to deprecate the consul's resentment, he fell on his knees.
And upon Cicero's lamenting in some trial the miserable condition of the times, he the very same day, by nine o'clock, transferred his enemy, Publius Clodius, from a patrician to a plebeian family; a change which he had long solicited in vain.<note anchored="yes">In order that he might be a candidate for the tribuneship of the people; it was done late in the evening, at an unusual hour for public business.</note> At last, effectually to intimidate all those of the opposite party, he by great rewards prevailed upon Vettius to declare, that he had been solicited by certain persons to assassinate Pompey; and when he was brought before the rostra to name those who had been concerted between them, after naming one or two to no purpose, not without great suspicion of subornation, Caesar, despairing of success in this rash
stratagem, is supposed to have taken off his informer by poison.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="21">
<p>About the same time he married Calpurnia, the daughter of Lucius Piso, who was to succeed him in the consulship, and gave his own daughter Julia to Cneius Pompey; rejecting  Servilius Caepio, to whom  she had been contracted, and by whose means chiefly he had but a little before baffled Bibulus.
After this new alliance, he began, upon any debates in the senate, to ask Pompey's opinion first, whereas he used before to give that distinction  to  Marcus Crassus; and  it was the usual practice for the consul to observe throughout the year the method of consulting the senate which he had adopted on the calends (the first) of January.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="22">
<p>Being, therefore, now supported by the interest of his father-in-law and son-in-law, of all the provinces he made choice of <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, as most likely to furnish him with matter and occasion for triumphs.
At first indeed he received only Cisalpine-<placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>,<note anchored="yes">Gaul was divided into two provinces, Transalpina, or Gallta Uterior, and Cisalpina, or Citerior.
The Citerior, having nearly the same limits as <placeName key="tgn,7003237">Lombardy</placeName> in after times, was properly a part of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, occupied by colonists from <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, and, having the Rubicon, the ancient boundary of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, on the south.
It was also called Gallia Togata, from the use of the Roman toga; the inhabitants being, after the social war, admitted to the right of citizens.
The Gallia Transalpina, or Ulterior, was called Comata, from the people wearing their hair long, while the Romans wore it short; and the southern part, afterwards called <placeName key="tgn,7012209">Narbonensis</placeName>, came to have the epithet Braccata, from the use of the braccae, which were no part of the Roman dress.
Some writers suppose the braccae to have been breeches, but Aldus, in a short disquisition on the subject, affirms that they were a kind of upper dress.
And this opinion seems to be countenanced by the name braccan being applied by the modern Celtic nations, the descendants of the Gallic Celts, to signify their upper garment, or plaid.</note>
with the addition of <placeName key="tgn,7016683">Illyricum</placeName>, by a decree proposed by Vatinius to the people; but soon afterwards obtained from the senate Gallia-Comata
also, the senators being apprehensive, that if they should refuse it to him, that province, also, would be granted him by the people.
Elated now with his success, he could not refrain from boasting, a few days afterwards, in a full senate-house, that he had, in spite of his enemies, and to their great mortification, obtained all he desired, and that for the future he would make them, to their shame, submissive to his pleasure.
One of the senators observing, sarcastically: "That will not be very easy for a woman<note anchored="yes">.Alluding, probably, to certain scandals of a gross character which were rife against Caesar.  See before, c. ii. (p. 2).</note> to do," he jocosely replied, "Semiramis formerly reigned in Assyria, and the Amazons possessed great part of <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="23">
<p>When the term of his consulship had expired, upon a motion being made in the senate by Caius Memmius and Lucius Domitius, the praetors, respecting the transactions of the year past, he offered to refer himself to the house; but they declining the business, after three days spent in vain altercation, he set out for his province.
Immediately, however, his quaestor was charged with several misdemeanors, for the purpose of implicating Caesar himself.
Indeed, an accusation was soon after preferred against him by Lucius Antistius, tribune of the people; but by making an appeal to the tribune's colleagues, he succeeded in having the prosecution suspended during this absence in the service of the state.
To secure himself, therefore, for the time to come, he was particularly careful to secure the good-will of the magistrates at the annual elections, assisting none of the candidates with his interest, nor suffering any persons to be advanced to any office, who would not positively undertake to defend him in his absence: for which purpose he made no scruple to require of some of them an oath, and even a written obligation.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="24">
<p>But when Lucius Domitius became a candidate for the consulship, and openly threatened that, upon his being elected consul, he would effect that which he could not accomplish when he was praetor, and divest him of the command of the armies, he sent for Crassus and Pompey to <placeName key="tgn,7006076">Lucca</placeName>, a city in his province, and pressed them, for the purpose of disappointing Domitius, to sue again for the consulship, and to continue him in his command for five years longer: with both which requisitions they complied.
Presumptuous now with his success, he added, at his own private charge, more legions to those which he had received from  the republic; among the former of which was one levied in Transalpine Gaul, and called by a Gallic name, Alauda,<note anchored="yes">So called from the feathers on their helmets, resembling the crest of a lark; Alauda, Fr. Alouette.</note>
which he trained and armed in the Roman fashion, and afterwards conferred on it the freedom of the city.
From this period he declined no occasion of war, however unjust and dangerous; attacking, without any provocation, as well the allies of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> as the barbarous nations which were its enemies: insomuch, that the senate passed a decree for sending commissioners to examine into the condition of <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>; and some members even proposed that he should be delivered up to the enemy.
But so great had been the success of his enterprises, that he had the honour of obtaining more days  of supplication,
<note anchored="yes">Days appointed by the senate for public thanksgiving in the temples in the name of a victorious general, who had in the decrees the title of emperor, by which they were saluted by the legions.
</note>
and those more frequently, than had ever before been decreed to any commander.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="25">
<p>During nine years in which he held the government of the province, his achievements were as follows:
he reduced all <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, bounded by the Pyrenean forest, the <placeName key="tgn,2066659">Alps</placeName>, mount Gebenna, and the two rivers, the <placeName key="tgn,7012611">Rhine</placeName> and the <placeName key="tgn,7023890">Rhone</placeName>, and being about three thousand two hundred miles in compass, into the form of a province, excepting only the nations in alliance with the republic, and such as had merited his favour; imposing upon this new acquisition an annual tribute of forty millions of sesterces.  He
was the first of the Romans who, crossing the <placeName key="tgn,7012611">Rhine</placeName> by a
bridge, attacked the Germanic tribes inhabiting the country beyond that river, whom he defeated in several engagements. He also invaded the Britons,
a people formerly unknown, and having vanquished them, exacted
from them contributions and hostages. Amidst such a
series of successes, he experienced thrice only any signal disaster; once in <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName>, when his fleet was nearly
wrecked in a storm; in <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, at <placeName key="tgn,6002232">Gergovia</placeName>, where one of
his legions was put to the rout; and in the territory of
the Germans, his lieutenants Titurius and Aurunculeius
were cut off by an ambuscade.
</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="26">
<p>During this period<note anchored="yes">A. U. C. 702</note> he lost his mother,<note anchored="yes">Aurelia</note> whose
death was followed by that of his daughter,<note anchored="yes">Julia, the wife of Pompey, who died in childbirth</note> and, not long
afterwards, of his granddaughter. Meanwhile, the republic
being in consternation at the murder of Publius Clodius,
and the senate passing a vote that only one consul,
namely, Cneius Pompeius, should be chosen for the ensuing year, he prevailed with the tribunes of the people,
who intended joining him in nomination with Pompey, to
propose to the people a bill, enabling him, though absent,
to become a candidate for his second consulship, when
the term of his command should be near expiring, that
he might not be obliged on that account to quit his province too soon, and before the conclusion of the war.
Having attained this object, carrying his views still higher, and animated with the hopes of success, he omitted no opportunity of gaining universal favour, by acts of liberality and kindness to individuals, both in public and private.
With money raised from the spoils of the war, he began to construct a new forum, the ground-plot of which cost him  above a hundred millions of sesterces.<note anchored="yes">Conquest had so multiplied business at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, that the Roman forum became too little for transacting it, and could not be enlarged without clearing away the buildings with which it was surrounded.
Hence the enormous sum which its site is said to have cost, amounting, it is calculated, to &pound;807,291 sterling.
It stood near the old forum, behind the temple of Romulus and Remus, but not a vestige of it remains.</note>
He promised the people a public entertainment of gladiators, and a feast in memory of his daughter, such as no one before him had ever given.
The more to raise their expectations on this occasion, although he had agreed with victuallers of all denominations for his feast, he made yet farther preparations in private houses.
He issued an order, that the most celebrated gladiators, if at any time during the combat they incurred the displeasure of the public, should be immediately carried off by force, and reserved for some future occasion.
Young gladiators he trained up, not in the school, and by the masters, of defence, but in the houses of Roman knights, and even senators, skilled in the use of arms, earnestly requesting them, as appears from his letters, to undertake the discipline of those novitiates, and to give them the word during their exercises.
He doubled the pay of the legions in perpetuity; allowing them likewise corn, when it was in plenty, without any restriction; and sometimes distributing to every soldier in his army a slave, and a portion of land.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="27">
<p>To maintain his alliance, and good understanding with Pompey, he offered him in marriage his sister's grand-daughter Octavia, who had been married to Caius Marcellus; and requested for himself his daughter, lately contracted to Faustus Sylla.
Every person about him, and a great part likewise of the senate, he secured by loans of money at low interest, or none at all; and to all others who came to wait upon him, either by invitation or of their own accord, he made liberal presents; not neglecting even the freedmen and slaves, who were favourites with their masters and patrons.
He offered also singular and ready aid to all who were under prosecution, or in debt, and to prodigal youths; excluding from his bounty those only who were so deeply plunged in guilt, poverty, or luxury, that it was impossible effectually to relieve them.
These, he openly declared, could derive no benefit from any other means than a civil war.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="28">
<p>He endeavoured with equal assiduity to engage in his interest princes and provinces in every part of the world: presenting some with thousands of captives, and sending to others the assistance of troops, at whatever time and place they desired, without any authority from either the senate or people of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.
He likewise embellished with magnificent public buildings the most powerful cities not only of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, and <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, but of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>; until all people being now astonished, and speculating on the obvious tendency of these proceedings, Claudius Marcellus, the consul, declaring first by proclamation, that he intended to propose a measure of the utmost importance to the state, made a motion in the senate that some person should be appointed to succeed Caesar in his province, before the term of his command was expired; because the war being brought to a conclusion, peace was restored, and the victorious army ought to be disbanded.
He further moved, that Caesar being absent, his claims to be a candidate at the next election of consuls, should not be admitted, as Pompey himself had afterwards abrogated that privilege by a decree of the people.
The fact was, that Pompey, in his law relating to the choice of chief magistrates, had forgot to except Caesar, in the article in which he declared all such as were not present incapable of being candidates for any office; but soon afterwards, when the law was inscribed on brass, and deposited in the treasury, he corrected his mistake.
Marcellus, not content with depriving Caesar of his provinces, and the privilege intended him by Pompey, likewise moved the senate, that the freedom of the city should be taken from those colonists whom, by the Vatinian law, he had settled at New Como;<note anchored="yes"><placeName key="perseus,Comum">Comum</placeName> was a town of the Orobii, of ancient standing, and formerly powerful.
Julius Csesar added to it five thousand new colonists; whence it was generally called Novocomum.
But in time it recovered its ancient name, <placeName key="perseus,Comum">Comum</placeName>; Pliny the younger, who was a native of this place, calling it by no other name.
</note> because it had been conferred upon them with ambitious views, and by a stretch of the laws.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="29">
<p>Roused by these proceedings, and thinking, as he was often heard to say, that it would be a more difficult enterprise to reduce him, now that he was the chief man in the state, from the first rank of citizens to the second, than from the second to the lowest of all, Caesar made a vigorous opposition to the measure, partly by means of the tribunes, who interposed in his behalf, and partly through Servius Sulpicius, the other consul.
The following year likewise, when Caius Marcellus, who succeeded his cousin Marcus in the consulship, pursued the same course, Caesar, by means of an immense bribe, engaged in his defence AEmilius Paulus, the other consul,
and Caius Curio, the most violent of the tribunes.
But finding the opposition obstinately bent against him, and that the consuls-elect were also of that party, he wrote a letter to the senate, requesting that they would not deprive him of the privilege kindly granted him by the people; or else that the other generals should resign the command of their armies as well as himself; fully persuaded, as it is thought, that he could more easily collect his veteran soldiers, whenever he pleased, than Pompey could his new-raised troops.
At the same time, he made his adversaries an offer to disband eight of his legions and give up Transalpine-Gaul, on condition that he might retain two legions, with the Cisalpine province, or but one legion with <placeName key="tgn,7016683">Illyricum</placeName>, until he should be elected consul.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="30">
<p>But as the senate declined to interpose in the business, and his enemies declared that they would enter into no compromise where the safety of the republic was at stake, he advanced into Hither-Gaul,<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 705.</note>
and, having gone to the circuit for the administration of justice, made a halt at <placeName key="perseus,Ravenna">Ravenna</placeName>, resolved to have recourse to arms if the senate should proceed to extremity against the tribunes of the people who had espoused his cause.
This was indeed his pretext for the civil war; but it is supposed that there were other motives for his conduct.
Cneius Pompey used frequently to say, that he sought to throw every thing into confusion, because he was unable, with all his private wealth, to complete the works he had begun, and answer, at his return, the vast expectations which he had excited in the people.
Others pretend that he was apprehensive of being called to account for what he had done in his protests of the tribunes; Marcus Cato having sometimes declared, and that, too, with an oath, that he would prefer
an impeachment against him, as soon as he disbanded his ·army.
A report likewise prevailed, that if he returned as a private person, he would, like <placeName key="tgn,1127168">Milo</placeName>, have to plead his cause before the judges, surrounded by armed men.
This conjecture is rendered highly probable by Asinius Pollio, who informs us that Caesar, upon viewing the vanquished and slaughtered enemy in the field of Pharsalia, expressed himself in these very words: " This was their intention: I, Caius Caesar, after all the great achievements I had performed, must have been condemned, had I not summoned the army to my aid !" Some think, that having contracted from long habit an extraordinary love of power, and having weighed his own and his enemies' strength, he embraced that occasion of usurping the supreme power; which indeed he had coveted from the time of his youth.
This seems to have been the opinion entertained by Cicero, who tells us, in the third book of his Offices, that Caesar used to have frequently in his mouth two verses of Euripides, which he thus translates:

<quote lang="la"><l>Nam si violandum est jus, regnandi gratia</l>
<l>Violandum est: aiis rebus pietatem colas.</l></quote>

<p>When intelligence, therefore, was received, that the interposition of the tribunes in his favour had been utterly rejected, and that they themselves had fled from the city, he immediately sent forward some cohorts, but privately, to prevent any suspicion of his design; and, to
keep up appearances, attended at a public spectacle, examined the model of a fencing-school which he proposed to build, and, as usual, sat down to table with a numerous party of his friends.
But after sun-set, mules being put to his carriage from a neighbouring mill, he set forward on his journey with all possible privacy, and a small retinue.
The lights going out, he lost his way, and wandered a long time, until at length, by the help of a guide, whom he found towards day-break, he proceeded on foot through some narrow paths, and again reached the road.
Coming up with his troops on the banks of the Rubicon, which was the boundary of his province,
<note anchored="yes">Now the Pisatello; near <placeName key="tgn,7004929">Rimini</placeName>. There was a very ancient law of the republic, forbidding any general, returning from the wars, to cross the Rubicon with his troops under arms.
</note>
he halted for a while, and, revolving in his mind the importance of the step he was on the point of taking, he turned to those about him, and said: "We may still retreat: but if we pass this little bridge, nothing is left for us but to fight it out in arms."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="32">
<p>While he was thus hesitating, the following incident occurred.
A person remarkable for his noble mien and graceful aspect, appeared close at hand, sitting and playing upon a pipe.
When, not only the shepherds, but a number of soldiers also flocked from their posts to listen to him, and some trumpeters among them, he snatched a trumpet from one of them, ran to the river with it, and sounding the advance with a piercing blast, crossed to the other side.
Upon this, Caesar exclaimed, " Let us go where the omens of the Gods and the iniquity of our enemies call us. The die is now cast."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="33">
<p>Accordingly, having marched his army over the river, he shewed them the tribunes of the people, who, upon their being driven from the city, had come to
meet him; and, in the presence of that assembly, called upon the troops to pledge him their fidelity, with tears in his eyes, and his garment rent from his bosom.
It has been supposed, that upon this occasion he promised to every soldier a knight's estate; but that opinion is founded on a mistake.
For when, in his harangue to them, he frequently held out a finger of his left hand,
<note anchored="yes">The ring was worn on the finger next to the little finger of the left hand.
</note>
and declared, that to recompense those who should support him in the defence of his honor, he would willingly part even with his ring; the soldiers at a distance, who could more easily see than hear him while he spoke, formed their conception of what he said, by the eye, not by the ear; and accordingly gave out, that he had promised to each of them the privilege of wearing the gold ring, and an estate of four hundred thousand sesterces.
<note anchored="yes">Suetonius here accounts for the mistake of the soldiers with great probability. The class to which they imagined they were to be promoted, was that of the equites, or knights, who wore a gold ring, and were possessed of property to the amount stated in the text. Great as was the liberality of Caesar to his legions, the performance of this imaginary promise was beyond all reasonable expectation.

<p>Of his subsequent proceedings I shall give a cursory detail, in the order in which they occurred.
<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 70
</note>
He took possession of Picenum, <placeName key="tgn,7003125">Umbria</placeName>, and Etruria; and having obliged Lucius Domitius, who had been tumultuously nominated his successor, and held Corsinium with a garrison, to surrender, and dismissed him, he marched along the coast of the Upper Sea, to <placeName key="perseus,Brundusium">Brundusium</placeName>, to which place the consuls and Pompey were fled with the intention of crossing the sea as soon as possible.
After vain attempts, by all the obstacles he could oppose, to prevent their leaving the harbour, he turned his steps towards
<placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, where he appealed to the senate on the present state of public affairs; and then set out for <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, in which province Pompey had a numerous army, under the command of three lieutenants, Marcus Petreius, Lucius Afranius, and Marcus Varro; declaring amongst his friends, before he set forward, "That he was going against an
army without a general, and should return thence against
ra general without an army." Though his progress was
retarded both by the siege of <placeName key="tgn,7008781">Marseilles</placeName>, which shut her
agates against him, and a very great scarcity of corn, yet
in a short time he bore down all before him.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="35">
<p>Thence he returned to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and crossing
the sea to <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, blocked up Pompey during almost
four months, within a line of ramparts of prodigious extent; and at last defeated him in the battle of Pharsalia.
Pursuing him in his flight to <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName>, where he was
tinformed of his murder, he presently found himself also
engaged, under all the disadvantages of time and place,
in a very dangerous war, with king Ptolemy, who, he saw,
had treacherous designs upon his life. It was winter, and
he, within the walls of a well-provided and subtle enemy,
was destitute of every thing, and wholly unprepared for
such a conflict. He succeeded, however, in his enterprise, and put the kingdom of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> into the hands of
Cleopatra and her younger brother; being afraid to make
it a province, lest, under an aspiring prefect, it might
become the centre of revolt. From <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName> he went
into <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>, and thence to <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName>, induced by intelligence
which he had received respecting Pharnaces. This prince,
who was son of the great Mithridates, had seized the opportunity which the distraction of the times offered for
making war upon his neighbours, and his insolence and
fierceness had grown with his success. Caesar, however,
within five days after entering his country, and four hours
after coming in sight of him, overthrew him in one decisive battle.
Upon which, he frequently remarked to those about him the good fortune of Pompey, who had obtained his military reputation, chiefly, by victory over so feeble an enemy.
He afterwards defeated Scipio and Juba, who were rallying the remains of the party in <placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>, and Pompey's sons in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="36">
<p>During the whole course of the civil war, he never once suffered any defeat, except in the case of his lieutenants; of whom Caius Curio fell in <placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>, Caius Antonius was made prisoner in <placeName key="tgn,7016683">Illyricum</placeName>, Publius Dolabella lost a fleet in the same <placeName key="tgn,7016683">Illyricum</placeName>, and Cneius Domitius Calvinus, an army in <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName>.
In every encounter with the enemy where he himself commanded, he came off with complete success; nor was the issue ever doubtful, except on two occasions: once at <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Dyrrachium</placeName>, when, being obliged to give ground, and Pompey not pursuing his advantage, he said that "Pompey knew not how to conquer;" the other instance occurred in his last battle in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, when, despairing of the event, he even had thoughts of killing himself.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="37">
<p>For the victories obtained in the several wars, he triumphed five different times; after the defeat of Scipio four times in one month, each triumph succeeding the former by an interval of a few days; and once again after the conquest of Pompey's sons.
His first and most glorious triumph was for the victories he gained in <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>; the next for that of <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName>, the third for the reduction of <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName>, the fourth for his African victory, and the last for that in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>; and they all differed from each other in their varied pomp and pageantry.
On the day of the Gallic triumph, as he was proceeding along the street called Velabrum, after narrowly escaping a fall from his chariot by the breaking of an axle-tree, he as
cended the Capitol by torch-light, forty elephants<note anchored="yes">Elephants were first introduced at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> by Pompey the Great, in his African triumph.</note> carrying torches on his right and left.
Amongst the pageantry of the Pontic triumph, a tablet with this inscription was carried before him: I CAME, I SAW, I CONQUERED;<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="la">Veni, vidi, vici</foreign></note> not signifying, as other mottos on the like occasion, what was done, so much as the dispatch with which it was done.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="38">
<p>To every foot soldier in his veteran legions, besides the two thousand sesterces paid him in the beginning of the civil war, he gave twenty thousand more, in the shape of prize-money.
He likewise allotted them lands, but not in contiguity, that the former owners might not be entirely dispossessed.
To the people of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, besides ten modii of corn, and as many pounds of oil, he gave three hundred sesterces a man, which he had formerly promised them, and a hundred more to each for the delay in fulfilling his engagement.
He likewise remitted a year's rent due to the treasury, for such houses in <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> as did not pay above two thousand sesterces a year; and through the rest of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, for all such as did not exceed in yearly rent five hundred sesterces.
To all this he added a public entertainment, and a distribution of meat, and, after his Spanish victory,<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 708</note> two public dinners.
For, considering the first he had given as too sparing, and unsuited to his profuse liberality, he, five days afterwards, added another, which was most plentiful.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="39">
<p>The spectacles he exhibited to the people were of various kinds; namely.
a combat of gladiators,<note anchored="yes">Gladiators were first publicly exhibited at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> by two brothers
called Brufi, at the funeral of their father, A.U.C. 490; and for some time
they were exhibited only on such occasions. But afterwards they were
also employed by the magistrates, to entertain the people, particularly
at the Saturnalia, and feasts of Minerva.
These cruel spectacles were prohibited by <placeName key="tgn,7001315">Constantine</placeName>, but not entirely suppressed until the time of Honorius.
</note>
and stage-plays in the several wards of the city, and in different languages; likewise Circensian games,
<note anchored="yes">The Circensian games were shews exhibited in the Circus Maximus, and consisted of various kinds: first, chariot and horse-races, of which the Romans were extravagantly fond. The charioteers were distributed into four parties, distinguished by the colour of their dress. The spectators, without regarding the speed of the horses, or the skill of the men, were attracted merely by one or the other of the colours, as caprice inclined them. In the time of Justinian, no less than thirty thousand men lost their lives at <placeName key="tgn,7002473">Constantinople</placeName>, in a tumult raised by a contention amongst the partizans of the several colours. Secondly, contests of agility and strength; of which there were five kinds, hence called Pentathlum. These were, running, leaping, boxing, wrestling, and throwing the discus or quoit. Thirdly, Ludus Trojae, a mock-fight, performed by young noblemen on horseback, revived by Julius Caesar, and frequently celebrated by the succeeding emperors.  We meet with a description of it in the fifth book of the <title>Aeneid</title>, beginning with the following lines:
<cit><quote lang="la"><l>Incedunt pueri, pariterque ante ora parentum</l>
<l>Frenatis lucent in equis: quos omnis euntes</l>
<l>Trinacriae mirata fremit Trojaeque juventus.</l></quote> <bibl n="Verg. A. 5.553">Aen. 5.553-555</bibl></cit>
Fourthly, <foreign lang="la">Venatio</foreign>, which was the fighting of wild beasts with one another, or with men called <foreign lang="la">Bestarii</foreign>, who were either forced to the combat by way of punishment, as the primitive Christians were, or fought voluntarily, either from a natural ferocity of disposition, or induced by hire. An incredible number of animals of various kinds were brought from all quarters, at a prodigious expense, for the entertainment of the people. Pompey, in his second consulship, exhibited at once five hundred lions, which were all dispatched in five days; also eighteen elephants.  Fifthly, the representation of a horse and foot battle, with that of an encampment or a siege. Sixthly, the representation of a sea-fight (Naumachia), which was at first made in the Circus Maximus, but afterwards elsewhere. The combatants were usually captives or condemned malefactors, who fought to death, unless saved by the clemency of the emperor. If any thing unlucky happened at the games, they were renewed, and often more than once.
</note>
wrestlers, and the representation of a sea-fight.
In the conflict of gladiators presented in the Forum, Furius Leptinus, a man of praetorian family, entered the lists as a combatant, as did also Quintus Calpenus, formerly a senator, and a pleader of causes.
The Pyrrhic dance was performed by some youths, who were sons to persons ol the first distinction in <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7016608">Bithynia</placeName>.
In the plays, Decimus Laberius, who had been a Roman knight, acted in his own piece; and being presented on the spot with five hundred thousand sesterces, and a gold ring, he went from the stage, through the orchestra, and resumed his place in the seats allotted for the equestrian order.
In the Circensian games, the circus being enlarged at each end, and a canal sunk round it, several of the young nobility drove chariots, drawn, some by four, and others by two horses, and likewise rode races on single horses.
The Trojan game was acted by two distinct companies of boys, one differing from the other in age and rank.
The hunting of wild beasts was presented for five days successively; and on the last day a battle was fought by five hundred foot, twenty elephants, and thirty horse on each side.
To afford room for this engagement, the goals were removed, and in their space two camps were pitched, directly opposite to each other.
Wrestlers likewise performed for three days successively, in a stadium provided for the purpose in the <placeName key="tgn,7006964">Campus Martius</placeName>.
A lake having, been dug in the little Codeta,
<note anchored="yes">A meadow beyond the <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName>, in which an excavation was made, supplied with water from the river.
</note>
ships of the Tyrian and Egyptian fleets, containing two, three, and four banks of oars, with a number of men on board, afforded an animated representation of a sea-fight.
To these various diversions there flocked such crowds of spectators from all parts, that most of the strangers
were obliged to lodge in tents erected in the streets, or along the roads near the city.
Several in the throng were squeezed to death, amongst whom  were two senators.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="40">
<p>Turning afterwards his attention to the regulation of the commonwealth, he corrected the calendar,
<note anchored="yes">Julius Caesar was assisted by Sosigenes, an Egyptian philosopher, in correcting the calendar. For this purpose he introduced an additional day every fourth year, making February to consist of twenty-nine days instead of twenty-eight, and, of course, the whole year to consist of three hundred and sixty-six days. The fourth year was denominated Bissextile, or leap year, because the sixth day before the calends, or first of March, was reckoned twice. The Julian year was introduced throughout the Roman empire, and continued in general use till the year <date value="1582">1582</date>. But the true correction was not six hours, but five hours, forty-nine minutes; hence the addition was too great by eleven minutes. This small fraction would amount in one hundred years to three-fourths of a day, and in a thousand years to more than seven days. It had, in fact, amounted, since the Julian correction, in <date value="1582">1582</date>, to more than seven days. Pope Gregory XIII., therefore, again reformed the calendar, first bringing forward the year ten days, by reckoning the 5th of October the 15th, and then prescribing the rule which has gradually been adopted throughout Christendom, except in <placeName key="tgn,7002435">Russia</placeName>, and the Greek church generally.
</note>
which had for some time become extremely confused, through the unwarrantable liberty which the pontiffs had taken in the article of intercalation.
To such a height had this abuse proceeded, that neither the festivals designed for the harvest fell in summer, nor those for the vintage in autumn.
He accommodated the year to the course of the sun, ordaining that in future it should consist of three hundred and sixty-five days without any intercalary month; and that every fourth year an intercalary day should be inserted.
That the year might thenceforth commence regularly with the calends, or first of January, he inserted two months between November and
December; so that the year in which this regulation was made consisted of fifteen months, including the month of intercalation.
which, according to the division of time then in use, happened that year.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="41">
<p>He filled up the vacancies in the senate, by advancing several plebeians to the rank of patricians, and also increased the number of praetors, aediles, quaestors, and inferior magistrates; restoring, at the same time, such as had been degraded by the censors, or convicted of bribery at elections.
The choice of magistrates he so divided with the people, that, excepting only the candidates for the consulship, they nominated one half of them, and he the other.
The method which he practised in those cases was, to recommend such persons as he had pitched upon, by bills dispersed through the several tribes to this effect:  "Caesar the dictator to such a tribe (naming it). I recommend to you (naming likewise the persons), that by the favour of your votes they may attain to the honours for which they sue."
He likewise admitted to offices the sons of those who had been proscribed.
The trial of causes he restricted to two orders of judges, the equestrian and senatorial; excluding the tribunes of the treasury who had before made a third class.
The revised census of the people he ordered to be taken neither in the usual manner or place, but street by street, by the principal inhabitants of the several quarters of the city; and he reduced the number of those who received corn at the public cost, from three hundred and twenty, to a hundred and fifty, thousand.
To prevent any tumults on account of the census, he ordered that the praetor should every year fill up by lot the vacancies occasioned by death, from those who were not enrolled for the receipt of corn.</p></div2>

<p>Eighty thousand citizens having been distributed into foreign colonies,<note anchored="yes">Principally <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>.</note> he enacted, in order to stop the drain on the population, that no freeman of the city above twenty, and under forty, years of age, who was not in the military service, should absent himself from <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> for more than three years at a time; that no senator's son should go abroad, unless in the retinue of some high officer; and as to those whose pursuit was tending flocks and herds, that no less than a third of the number of their shepherds free-born should be youths.
He likewise made all those who practised physic in <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and all teachers of the liberal arts, free of the city, in order to fix them in it, and induce others to settle there.
With respect to debts, he disappointed the expectation which was generally entertained, that they would be totally cancelled; and ordered that the debtors should satisfy their creditors, according to the valuation of their estates, at the rate at which they were purchased before the commencement of the civil war; deducting from the debt what had been paid for interest either in money or by bonds; by virtue of which provision about a fourth part of the debt was lost.
He dissolved all the guilds, except such as were of ancient foundation.
Crimes were punished with greater severity; and the rich being more easily induced to commit them because they were only liable to banishment, without the forfeiture of their property, he stripped murderers, as Cicero observes, of their whole estates, and other offenders of one half.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="43">
<p>He was extremely assiduous and strict in the administration of justice.
He expelled from the senate such members as were convicted of bribery; and he dissolved the marriage of a man of praetorian rank, who had married a lady two days after her divorce from a former husband, although there was no suspicion that they had been guilty of any illicit connection.
He imposed duties on the importation of foreign goods.
The use of litters for travelling, purple robes, and jewels, he permitted only to persons of a certain age and station, and on particular days.
He enforced a rigid execution of the sumptuary laws; placing officers about the markets, to seize upon all meats exposed to sale contrary to the rules, and bring them to him; sometimes sending his lictors and soldiers to carry away such victuals as had escaped the notice of the officers, even when they were upon the table.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="44">
<p>His thoughts were now fully employed from day to day on a variety of great projects for the embellishment and improvement of the city, as well as for guarding and extending the bounds of the empire.
In the first place, he meditated the construction of a temple to Mars, which should exceed in grandeur every thing of that kind in the world.
For this purpose, he intended to fill up the lake on which he had entertained the people with the spectacle of a sea-fight.
He also projected a most spacious theatre adjacent to the Tarpeian mount; and also proposed to reduce the civil law to a reasonable compass, and out of that immense and undigested mass of statutes to extract the best and most necessary parts into a few books; to make as large a collection as possible of works in the Greek and Latin languages, for the public use; the province of providing and putting them in proper order being assigned to Marcus Varro.
He intended likewise to drain the Pomptine marshes, to cut a channel for the discharge of the waters of the lake <placeName key="tgn,1110914">Fucinus</placeName>, to form a road from the Upper Sea through the ridge of the Appenine to the <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName>; to make a cut through the isthmus of <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>, to reduce the Dacians,
who had over-run <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>, within their proper limits, and then to make war upon the Parthians, through the <placeName key="tgn,7002470">Lesser Armenia</placeName>, but not to risk a general engagement with them, until he had made some trial of their prowess in war.
But in the midst of all his undertakings and projects, he was carried off by death; before I speak of which, it may not be improper to give an account of his person, dress, and manners, together with what relates to his pursuits, both civil and military.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="45">
<p>It is said that he was tall, of a fair complexion, round limbed, rather full faced, with eyes black and piercing; and that he enjoyed excellent health, except towards the close of his life, when he was subject to sudden fainting-fits, and disturbance in his sleep.
He was likewise twice seized with the falling sickness while engaged in active service.
He was so nice in the care of his person, that he not only kept the hair of his head closely cut and had his face smoothly shaved, but even caused the hair on other parts of the body to be plucked out by the roots, a practice for which some persons rallied him.
His baldness gave him much uneasiness, having often found himself on that account exposed to the jibes of his enemies.
He therefore used to bring forward the hair from the crown of his head; and of all the honours conferred upon him by the senate and people, there was none which he either accepted or used with greater pleasure, than the right of wearing constantly a laurel crown.
It is said that he was particular in his dress.
For he used the Latus Clavus<note anchored="yes">The Latus Clavus was a broad stripe of purple, on the front of the toga.  Its width distinguished it from that of the knights, who wore it narrow .</note>
with fringes about the wrists, and always had it girded about him, but rather loosely.

<p>He first inhabited a small house in the Suburra,<note anchored="yes">The Suburra lay between the Celian and <placeName key="tgn,4012794">Esquiline</placeName> hills.
It was one of the most frequented quarters of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.</note> but after his advancement to the pontificate, he occupied a palace belonging to the state in the Via Sacra.
Many writers say that he liked his residence to be elegant, and his entertainments sumptuous; and that he entirely took down a villa near the grove of <placeName key="perseus,Aricia">Aricia</placeName>, Which he had built from the foundation and finished at a vast expense, because it did not exactly suit his taste, although he had at that time but slender means, and was in debt; and that he carried about in his expeditions tesselated and marble slabs for the floor of his tent.</p></div2>

<p>We are also told, that in the provinces he constantly maintained two tables, one for the officers of the army, and the gentry of the country, and the other for Romans of the highest rank, and provincials of the highest distinction., He was so very exact in the management of his domestic affairs, both little and great, that he once threw a baker into prison, for serving him
with a finer sort of bread than his guests; and put to death a freed-man, who was a particular favourite, for debauching the lady of a Roman knight, although no complaint had been made to him of the affair.</p></div2>

<p>It is admitted by all that he was much addicted to women, as well as very expensive in his intrigues with them, and that he debauched many ladies of the highest quality; among whom were Posthumia, the wife of Servius Sulpicius; Lollia, the wife of Aulus Gabinius; Tertulla, the wife of Marcus Crassus; and Mucia, the wife of Cneius Pompey.
For it is certain that the Curios, both father and son, and many others, made it a reproach to Pompey, "That to gratify his ambition, he married the daughter of a man, upon whose account he had divorced his wife, after having had three children by her; and whom he used, with a deep sigh, to call AEgisthus."
<note anchored="yes">AEgisthus, who, like Caesar, was a pontiff, debauched Clytemnestra while Agamemnon was engaged in the Trojan war, as Caesar did Mucla, the wife of Pompey, while absent in the war against Mithridates.

But the mistress he most loved, was Servilia, the mother of Marcus Brutus.
for whom he purchased. in his first consulship after the commencement of their intrigue, a pearl which cost him six millions of sesterces; and in the civil war, besides other presents, assigned to her, for a trifling consideration, some valuable farms when they were exposed to public auction.
Many persons expressing their surprise at the lowness of the price, Cicero wittily remarked, "To let you know the real value of the purchase, between ourselves, Tertia was deducted:"  for Servilia was supposed to have prostituted her daughter Tertia to Caesar.
<note anchored="yes">A double entendre; Tertia signifying the third [of the value of the farm], as well as being the name of the girl, for whose favours the deduction was made.

<p>In the number of his mistresses were also some queens; such as Eunoe, a Moor, the wife of Bogudes, to whom and her husband he made, as Naso reports, many large presents.
But his greatest favourite was Cleopatra, with whom he often revelled all night until the dawn of day, and would have gone with her through <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> in dalliance, as far as <placeName key="tgn,7000489">Ethiopia</placeName>, in her luxurious yacht, had not the army refused to follow him.
He afterwards invited her to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, whence he sent her back loaded with honours and presents, and gave her permission to call by his name a son, who, according to the testimony of some Greek historians, resembled Caesar both in person and gait.
Mark Antony declared in the senate, that Caesar had acknowledged the child as his own; and that Caius Matias, Caius Oppius, and the rest of Caesar's friends knew it to be true.
On which occasion Oppius, as if it had been an imputation which he was called upon to refute, published a book to shew, "that the child which Cleopatra fathered upon Caesar, was not his."
Helvius Cinna, tribune to the people, admitted to several persons the fact, that he had a bill ready drawn, which Caesar had ordered him to get enacted in his absence, allowing him, with the hope of leaving issue,
to take any wife he chose, and as many of them as he pleased; and to leave no room for doubt of his infamous character for unnatural lewdness and adultery, Curio, the father, says, in one of his speeches, " He was every woman's man."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="53">
<p>It is acknowledged even by his enemies, that in regard to wine he was abstemious.
A remark is ascribed to Marcus Cato, "that Caesar was the only sober man amongst all those who were engaged in the design to subvert the government."
In the matter of diet, Caius Oppius informs us, "that he was so indifferent, that when a person in whose house he was entertained, had served him with stale, instead of fresh, oil,<note anchored="yes">Plutarch tells us that the oil was used in' a dish of asparagus.  Every traveller knows that in those climates oil takes the place of butter as an ingredient in cookery, and it needs no experience to fancy what it is when rancid.</note> and the rest of the company would not touch it, he alone ate very heartily of it, that he might not seem to tax the master of the house with rusticity or want of attention."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="54">
<p>But his abstinence did not extend to pecuniary advantages, either in his military commands, or civil offices; for we have the testimony of some writers, that he took money from the proconsul, who was his predecessor in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, and from the Roman allies in that quarter, for the discharge of his debts; and plundered at the point of the sword some towns of the Lusitanians, notwithstanding they attempted no resistance, and opened their gates to him upon his arrival before them.
In <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, he rifled the chapels and temples of the gods, which were filled with rich offerings, and demolished cities oftener for the sake of their spoil, than for any ill they had done.
By this means gold became so plentiful with him, that he exchanged it through <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> and the provinces of the empire for three thousand sesterces the pound.
In his first consulship he purloined from  the Capitol three thousand pounds
weight of gold, and substituted for it the same quantity of gilt brass.
He bartered likewise to foreign
nations and princes, for gold, the titles of allies and kings; and squeezed out of Ptolemy alone near six thousand talents, in the name of himself and Pompey.  He afterwards supported the expense of the civil wars, and of his triumphs and public spectacles, by the most flagrant rapine and sacrilege.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="55">
<p>In eloquence and warlike achievements, he equalled at least, if he did not surpass, the greatest of men. After his prosecution of Dolabella, he was indisputably reckoned one of the most distinguished advocates. Cicero, in recounting to Brutus the famous orators, declares, "that he does not see that Caesar was inferior to any one of them;" and says, "that he had an elegant, splendid, noble, and magnificent vein of eloquence." And in a letter to Cornelius Nepos, he writes of him in the following terms: "What!  Of all the orators, who, during the whole course of their lives, have done nothing else, which can you prefer to him ? Which of them is more pointed or terse in his periods, or employs more polished and elegant language ?" In his youth, he seems to have chosen Strabo Caesar for his model; from whose oration in behalf of the Sardinians he has transcribed some passages literally into his Divination. In his delivery he is said to have had a shrill voice, and his action was animated, but not ungraceful. He has left behind him some speeches, among which are ranked a few that are not genuine, such as that on behalf of Quintus Metellus. These Augustus supposes, with reason, to be rather the production of blundering short-hand writers, who were not able to keep pace with him in the delivery, than publications of his
own.
For I find in some copies that the title is not "For Metellus," but "What he wrote to Metellus:" whereas the speech is delivered in the name of Caesar, vindicating Metellus and himself from the aspersions cast upon them by their common defamers.
The speech addressed "To his soldiers in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>," Augustus considers likewise as spurious.
We meet with two under this title; one made, as is pretended, in the first battle, and the other in the last; at which time, Asinius Pollio says, he had not leisure to address the soldiers, on account of the suddenness of the enemy's attack.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="56">
<p>He has likewise left Commentaries of his own actions both in the war in <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, and in the civil war with Pompey; for the author of the Alexandrian, African, and Spanish wars is not known with any certainty.
Some think they are the productions of Oppius, and some of Hirtius; the latter of whom  composed the last book, which is imperfect, of the Gallic war.
Of Caesar's Commentaries, Cicero, in his Brutus, speaks thus: " He wrote his Commentaries in a manner deserving of great approbation: they are plain, precise, and elegant, without any affectation of rhetorical ornament.
In having thus prepared materials for others who might be inclined to write his history, he may perhaps have encouraged some silly creatures to enter upon such a work, who will needs be dressing up his actions in all the extravagance of bombast; but he has discouraged wise men from ever attempting the subject."
Hirtius delivers his opinion of these Commentaries in the following terms: "So great is the approbation with which they are universally perused, that, instead of rousing, he seems to have precluded, the efforts of any future historian.
Yet, with respect to this work, we have more reason to admire him than others; for they only know how well and correctly he has written,
but we know, likewise, how easily and quickly he did it."</p>
<p>Pollio Asinius thinks that they were not drawn up with much care, or with a due regard to truth; for he insinuates that Caesar was too hasty of belief in regard to what was performed by others under his orders; and that, he has not given a very faithful account of his own acts, either by design, or through defect of memory; expressing at the same time an opinion that Caesar intended a new and more correct edition.
He has left behind him likewise two books on Analogy, with the same number under the title of Anti-Cato, and a poem entitled The .Itinerary.
Of these books, he composed the first two in his passage over the <placeName key="tgn,2066659">Alps</placeName>, as he was returning to the army after making his circuit in Hither-Gaul; the second work about the time of the battle of <placeName key="tgn,2552514">Munda</placeName>; and the last during the four-and-twenty days he employed in his journey from  <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> to Farther-Spain.
There are extant some letters of his to the senate, written in a manner never practised by any before him; for they are distinguished into pages in the form of a memorandum book: whereas the consuls and commanders till then, used constantly in their letters to continue the line quite across the sheet, without any folding or distinction of pages.
There are extant likewise some letters from  him  to <placeName key="tgn,2031372">Cicero</placeName>, and others to his friends, concerning his domestic affairs; in which, if there was occasion for secrecy, he wrote in cyphers; that is, he used the alphabet in such a manner, that not a single word could be made out.
The way to decipher those epistles was to substitute the fourth for the first letter, as d for a, and so for the other letters respectively.
Some things likewise pass under his name, said to have been written by him when a boy, or a very young man; as the Encomium of <placeName key="tgn,2059070">Hercules</placeName>, a tragedy entitled (Edipus, and a collection of Apophthegms; all
which Augustus forbad to be published, in a short and plain letter to Pompeius Macer, who was employed by him in the arrangement of his libraries.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="57">
<p>He was perfect in the use of arms, an accomplished rider, and able to endure fatigue beyond all belief.
On a march he used to go at the head of his troops, sometimes on horseback, but oftener on foot, with his head bare in all kinds of weather.
He would travel post in a light carriage<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="la">Meritoria rheda</foreign>; a light four-wheeled carriage, apparently hired either for the journey or from town to town.

<p>In his expeditions, it is difficult to say whether his caution or his daring was most conspicuous.
He never marched his army by roads which were exposed to ambuscades, without having previously examined the nature of the ground by his scouts.

When intelligence was brought to him of the siege of his camp in <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, he made his way to his troops, through the enemy's stations, in a Gaulish dress.
He crossed the sea from <placeName key="tgn,7004094">Brundisium</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Dyrrachium</placeName>, in the winter, through the midst of the enemy's fleets; and the troops, under orders
to join him, being slow in their movements, notwithstand, ing repeated messages to hurry them, but to no purpose, he at last went privately, and alone, aboard a small vessel in the night time, with his head muffled up; nor did he make himself known, or suffer the master to put about, although the wind blew strong against them, until they were ready to sink.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="59">
<p>He was never deterred from any enterprise, nor retarded in the prosecution of it, by superstition.<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="la">Religione</foreign>; that is, the omens being unfavourable.</note> When a victim, which he was about to offer in sacrifice, made its escape, he did not therefore defer his expedition against Scipio and <placeName key="tgn,1094266">Juba</placeName>.
And happening to fall, upon stepping out of the ship, he gave a lucky turn to the omen, by exclaiming, "I hold thee fast, <placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>."
To chide the prophecies which were spread abroad, that the name of the Scipios was, by the decrees of fate, fortunate and invincible in that province, he retained in the camp a profligate wretch, of the family of the Cornelii, who, on account of his scandalous life, was surnamed Salutio.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="60">
<p>He not only fought pitched battles, but made sudden attacks when an opportunity offered; often at the end of a march, and sometimes during the most violent storms, when nobody could imagine he would stir.
Nor was he ever backward in fighting, until towards the end of his life.
He then was of opinion, that the oftener he had been crowned with success, the less he ought to expose himself to new hazards; and that nothing he could gain by a victory would compensate for what he might lose by a miscarriage.
He never defeated the enemy without driving them from their camp; and giving them no time.to rally their forces.
When the issue of a battle was doubtful, he sent away all the horses, and his
own first, that having no means of flight, they might be under the greater necessity of standing their ground.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="61">
<p>He rode a very remarkable horse, with feet almost like those of a man, the hoofs being divided in such a manner as to have some resemblance to toes.
This horse he had bred himself, and the soothsayers having interpreted these circumstances into an omen that its owner would be master of the world, he brought him up with particular care, and broke him in himself, as the horse would suffer no one else to mount him.
A statue of this horse was afterwards erected by Caesar's order before the temple of Venus Genitrix.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="62">
<p>He often rallied his troops, when they were giving way, by his personal efforts; stopping those who fled, keeping others in their ranks, and seizing them by their throat turned them towards the enemy; although numbers were so terrified, that an eagle-bearer,<note anchored="yes">The standard of the Roman legions was an eagle fixed on the head of a spear.
It was silver, small in size, with expanded wings, and clutching a golden thunderbolt in its claws.

<p>The following instances of his resolution are equally, and even more remarkable.
After the battle of Pharsalia, having sent his troops before him into <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, as he was passing the straits of the <placeName key="tgn,7002638">Hellespont</placeName> in a ferryboat, he met with Lucius Cassius, one of the opposite party, with ten ships of war; and so far from endeavouring to escape, he went alongside his ship, and calling upon him  to surrender, Cassius humbly gave him his submission.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="64">
<p>At <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName>, in the attack of a bridge, being forced by a sudden sally of the enemy into a boat, and
several others hurrying in with him, he leaped into the sea, and saved himself by swimming to the next ship,
which lay at the distance of two hundred paces; holding
up his left hand out of the water, for fear of wetting
some papers which he held in it; and pulling his general's cloak after him with his teeth, lest it should fall
into the hands of the enemy.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="65">
<p>He never valued a soldier for his moral conduct or his means, but for his courage only; and treated
his troops with a mixture of severity and indulgence;
for he did not always keep a strict hand over them, but
only when the enemy was near. Then indeed he was so
strict a disciplinarian, that he would give no notice of a
march or a battle until the moment of action, in order
that the troops might hold themselves in readiness for
any sudden movement; and he would frequently draw
them out of the camp without any necessity for it, especially in rainy weather, and upon holy-days. Sometimes,
giving them orders not to lose sight of him, he would
suddenly depart by day or by night, and lengthen the
marches in order to tire them out, as they followed him
at a distance.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="66">
<p>When at any time his troops were dispirited by
reports of the great force of the enemy, he rallied their
courage, not by denying the truth of what was said, or
by diminishing the facts, but, on the contrary, by exaggerating every particular. Accordingly, when his troops
were in great alarm at the expected arrival of king <placeName key="tgn,1094266">Juba</placeName>,
he called them together, and said, "I have to inform you
that in a very few days the king will be here, with ten
legions, thirty thousand horse, a hundred thousand light-armed foot, and three hundred elephants. Let none of
you, therefore, presume to make further enquiry, or indulge in conjectures, but take my word for what I tell
you, which I have from undoubted intelligence; otherwise I shall put them aboard an old crazy vessel,
and leave them exposed to the mercy of the winds, to be transported to some other country."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="67">
<p>He neither noticed all their trangressions, nor punished them according to strict rule.
But for deserters and mutineers he made the most diligent enquiry, and their punishment was most severe: other delinquencies he would connive at. Sometimes, after a great battle ending in victory, he would grant them a relaxation from all kinds of duty, and leave them to revel at pleasure; being used to boast, "that his soldiers fought nothing the worse for being well oiled."
In his speeches, he never addressed them by the title of "Soldiers," but by the kinder phrase of "Fellow-soldiers;" and kept them in such splendid order, that their arms were ornamented with silver and gold, not merely for parade, but to render the soldiers more resolute to save them in battle, and fearful of losing them.
He loved his troops to such a degree, that when he heard of the defeat of those under Titurius, he neither cut his hair nor shaved his beard, until he had revenged it upon the enemy; by which means he engaged their devoted affection, and raised their valour to the highest pitch.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="68">
<p>Upon his entering on the civil war, the centurions of every legion offered, each of them, to maintain a horseman at his own expense, and the whole army agreed to serve gratis, without either corn or pay; those amongst them who were rich, charging themselves with the maintenance of the poor.
No one of them, during the whole course of the war, deserted to the enemy; and many of those who were made prisoners, though they were offered their lives, upon condition of bearing arms against him, refused to accept the terms.
They endured want, and other
hardships, not only when they were besieged themselves, but when they besieged others, to such a degree, that Pompey, when blocked up in the neighbourhood of <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Dyrrachium</placeName>, upon seeing a sort of bread made of an herb, which they lived upon, said, "I have to do with wild beasts," and ordered it immediately to be taken away; because, if his troops should see it, their spirit might be broken by perceiving the endurance and determined resolution of the enemy.
With what bravery they fought, one instance affords sufficient proof; which is, that after an unsuccessful engagement at <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Dyrrachium</placeName>, they called for punishment; insomuch that their general found it more necessary to comfort than to punish them.
In other battles, in different quarters, they defeated with ease immense armies of the enemy, although they were much inferior to them in number.
In short, one cohort of the sixth legion held out a fort against four legions belonging to Pompey, during several hours; being almost every one of them wounded by the vast number of arrows discharged against them, and of which there were found within the ramparts a hundred and thirty thousand.
This is no way surprising, when we consider the conduct of some individuals amongst them; such as that of Cassius Scaeva, a centurion, or Caius Acilius, a common soldier, not to speak of others.
Scaeva, after having an eye struck out, being run through the thigh and the shoulder, and having his shield pierced in an hundred and twenty places, maintained obstinately the guard of the gate of a fort, with the command of which he was intrusted.
Acilius, in the sea-fight at <placeName key="tgn,7008781">Marseilles</placeName>, having seized a ship of the enemy's with his right hand, and that being cut off, in imitation of that memorable instance of resolution in Cynaegirus amongst the Greeks, boarded the enemy's ship, bearing down all before him with the boss of his shield.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="69">
<p>They never once mutinied during all the ten years of the Gallic war, but were sometimes refractory in the course of the civil war.
However, they always returned quickly to their duty, and that not through the indulgence, but in submission to the authority, of their general; for he never yielded to them when they were insubordinate, but constantly resisted their demands.
He disbanded the whole ninth legion with ignominy at <placeName key="perseus,Placentia">Placentia</placeName>, although Pompey was still in arms, and would not receive them again into his service, until they had not only made repeated and humble entreaties, but until the ringleaders in the mutiny were punished.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="70">
<p>When the soldiers of the tenth legion at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> demanded their discharge and rewards for their service, with violent threats and no small danger to the city, although the war was then raging in <placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>, he did not hesitate, contrary to the advice of his friends, to meet the legion, and disband it. But addressing them by the title of "Quirites," instead of "Soldiers," he by this single word so thoroughly brought them round and changed their determination, that they immediately cried out they were his " soldiers," and followed him to <placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>, although he had refused their service.
He nevertheless punished the most mutinous among them.
with the loss of a third of their share in the plunder, and the land destined for them.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="71">
<p>In the service of his clients, while yet a young man, he evinced great zeal and fidelity.
He defended the cause of a noble youth, Masintha, against king Hiempsal, so strenuously, that in a scuffle which took place upon the occasion, he seized by the beard the son of king <placeName key="tgn,1094266">Juba</placeName>; and upon Masintha's being declared tributary to Hiempsal, while the friends of the adverse party were violently carrying him off, he immediately rescued him
by force, kept him concealed in his house a long time, and when, at the expiration of his praetorship, he went to <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, he took him away in his litter, in the midst of his lictors bearing the fasces, and others who had come to attend and take leave of him.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="72">
<p>He always treated his friends with such kindness and good-nature, that when Caius Oppius, in travelling with him through a forest, was suddenly taken ill, he resigned to him the only place there was to shelter them at night, and lay upon the ground in the open air.
When he had placed himself at the head of affairs, he advanced some of his faithful adherents, though of mean extraction, to the highest offices; and when he was censured for this partiality, he openly said, "Had I been assisted by robbers and cut-throats in the defense of my honour, I should have made them the same recompense."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="73">
<p>The resentment he entertained against any one was never so implacable that he did not very willingly renounce it when opportunity offered.
Although Caius Memmius had published some extremely virulent speeches against him, and he had answered them with equal acrimony, yet he afterwards assisted him with his vote and interest, when he stood candidate for the consulship.
When C. Calvus, after publishing some scandalous epigrams upon him, endeavoured to effect a reconciliation by the intercession of friends, he wrote to him, of his own accord; the first letter.
And when Valerius Catullus, who had, as he himself observed, fixed such a stain upon his character in his verses upon Mamurra as never could be obliterated, he begged his pardon, invited him to supper the same day; and continued to take up his lodging with his father occasionally, as he had been accustomed to do.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="74">
<p>His temper was also naturally averse to severity in retaliation.
After he had captured the pirates, by whom he had been taken, having sworn that he would crucify them, he did so indeed; but he first ordered their throats to be cut.
<note anchored="yes">To save them from the torture of a lingering death.</note>
He could never bear the thought of doing any harm to Cornelius Phagitas, who had dogged him in the night when he was sick and a fugitive, with the design of carrying him to Sylla, and from whose hands he had escaped with some difficulty by giving him a bribe.
Philemon, his amanuensis, who had promised his enemies to poison him, he put to death without torture.
When he was summoned as a witness against Publicus Clodius, his wife Pompeia's gallant, who was prosecuted for profanation of religious ceremonies, he declared he knew nothing of the affair, although his mother Aurelia, and his sister Julia, gave the court an exact and full account of the circumstances.
And being asked why then he had divorced his wife? "Because," he said, "my family should not only be free from guilt, but even from the suspicion of it."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="75">
<p>Both in his administration and his conduct towards the vanquished party in the civil war, he showed a wonderful moderation and clemency.
For while Pompey declared that he would consider those as enemies who did not take arms in defence of the republic, he desired it to be understood, that he should regard those who remained neuter as his friends.
With regard to all those to whom he had, on Pompey's recommendation, given any command in the army, he left them at perfect liberty to go over to him, if they pleased.

for a surrender, which gave rise to a free communication between the two camps, and Afranius and Petreius, upon a sudden change of resolu*
tion, had put to the sword all Caesar's men who were found in the camp, he scorned to imitate the base treachery which they had practised against himself.
On the field of Pharsalia, he called out to the soldiers " to spare their fellow-citizens," and afterwards gave permission to every man in his army to save an enemy.
None of them, so far as appears, lost their lives but in battle, excepting only Afranius, Faustus, and young Lucius Caesar; and it is thought that even they were put to death without his consent.
Afranius and Faustus had borne arms against him, after obtaining their pardon; and Lucius Caesar had not only in the most cruel manner destroyed with fire and sword his freedmen and slaves, but cut to pieces the wild beasts which he had prepared for the entertainment of the people.
And finally, a little before his death, he permitted all whom he had not before pardoned, to return into <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, and to bear offices both civil and military.
He even replaced the statues of Sylla and Pompey, which had been thrown down by the populace.
And after this, whatever was devised or uttered, he chose rather to check than to punish it. Accordingly, having detected certain conspiracies and nocturnal assemblies, he went no farther than to intimate by a proclamation that he knew of them; and as to those who indulged themselves in the liberty of reflecting severely upon him, he only warned them in a public speech not to persist in their offence.
He bore with great moderation a virulent libel written against him by Aulus Caecinna, and the abusive lampoons of Pitholaiis, most highly reflecting on his reputation.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="76">
<p>His other words and actions, however, so far outweigh all his good qualities, that it is thought he abused his power, and was justly cut off.
For he not only obtained excessive honours, such as the consulship
every year, the dictatorship for life, and the censorship, but also the title of emperor,
<note anchored="yes">The title of emperor was not new in Roman history;  1. It was sometimes given by the acclamations of the soldiers to those who commanded them. 2. It was synonymous with conqueror, and the troops hailed him by that title after a victory.

and a lofty couch in the theatre.
He even suffered some honours to be decreed to him, which were unbefitting the most exalted of mankind: such as a gilded chair of state in the senate-house and on his tribunal, a consecrated chariot, and banners in the Circensian procession, temples, altars, statues among the gods, a bed of state in the temples, a priest, and a college of priests dedicated to himself, like those of Pan; and that one of the months should be called by his name.
There were, indeed, no honours which he did not either assume himself, or grant to others, at his will and pleasure.
In his third and fourth consulship, he used only the title of the office, being content with the power of dictator, which was conferred upon him with the consulship; and in both years he substituted other consuls in his room, during the three last months; so that in the intervals he held no assemblies of the people, for the election of magistrates, excepting only tribunes and ediles of the people; and appointed officers, under the name of praefects, instead of praetors, to administer the affairs of the city during his absence.
The office of consul having become vacant, by the sudden death of one of the consuls the day before the calends of January [the 1st Jan.], he conferred it on a person who requested it of him, for a few hours.
Assuming the same licence, and regardless of the customs of his country, he appointed magistrates to hold their offices for terms of years.
He granted the insignia of the consular dignity to ten persons of praetorian rank.
He admitted into the senate some men who had made free of the city, and even natives of Gaul, who were semi-barbarians.
He likewise appointed to the management of the mint, and the public revenue of the state, some servants of his own household; and entrusted the command of three legions, which he left at <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName>, to an old catamite of his, the son of his freed-man Rufinus.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="77">
<p>He was guilty of the same extravagance in the language he publicly used, as Titus Ampius informs us; according to whom he said, "The republic is nothing but a name, without substance or reality.
Sylla was an ignorant fellow to abdicate the dictatorship.
Men ought to consider what is becoming when they talk with me, and look upon what I say as a law."
To such a pitch of arrogance did he proceed, that when a soothsayer announced to him the unfavourable omen, that the entrails of a victim offered for sacrifice were without a heart, he said, "The entrails will be more favourable when I please; and it ought not to be regarded as a prodigy that a beast should be found wanting a heart."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="78">
<p>But what brought upon him the greatest odium, and was thought an unpardonable insult, was his receiving the whole body of the conscript fathers sitting, before the temple of Venus Genitrix, when they waited
upon him with a number of decrees, conferring on him the highest dignities.
Some say that, on his attempting to rise, he was held down by Cornelius Balbus; others, that he did not attempt to rise at all, but frowned on Caius Trebatius, who suggested to him that he should stand up to receive the senate.
This behaviour appeared the more intolerable in him, because, when one of the tribunes of the people, Pontius <placeName key="tgn,7004067">Aquila</placeName>, would not rise up to him, as he passed by the tribunes'
seat during his triumph, he was so much offended, that he cried out, "Well then, you tribune, Aquila, oust me from the government."
And for some days afterwards, he never promised a favour to any person, without this proviso, "if Pontus Aquila will give me leave."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="79">
<p>To this extraordinary mark of contempt for the senate, he added another affront still more outrageous.
For when, after the sacred rites of the Latin festival, he was returning home, amidst the immoderate and unusual acclamations of the people, a man in the crowd put a laurel crown, encircled with a white fillet,<note anchored="yes">The white fillet was one of the insignia of royalty. Plutarch, on this occasion, uses the expression, <foreign lang="greek">diadh/mati basilikw=|</foreign>, a royal diadem.
</note>
 on one of his statues; upon which, the tribunes of the people, Epidius Marullus, and Caesetius Flavus ordered the fillet to be removed from the crown, and the man to be taken to prison.
Caesar, being much concerned either that the idea of royalty had been suggested to so little purpose, or, as was said, that he was thus deprived of the merit of refusing it, reprimanded the tribunes very severely, and dismissed them from their office.
From that day forward, he was never able to wipe off the scandal of affecting the name of king, although he replied to the populace when they saluted him by that title, "I am Caesar, and no king."
And at the feast of the Lupercalia,<note anchored="yes">The Lupercalia was a festival, celebrated in a place called the Lupercal, in the month of February, in honour of Pan.
During the solemnity, the Luferci, or priests of that god, ran up and down the street naked, with only a girdle of goat's skin round their waist, and thongs of the same in their hands; with which they struck those they met, particularly married women, who were thence supposed to be rendered prolific.
</note> when the consul Antony placed a crown upon his head in the rostra several times, he as often put it away, and sent it to the Capitol for <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName>, the Best and the Greatest.
A report was very current, that he had a design of withdrawing to <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName> or <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilium</placeName>, whither he proposed to transfer the imperial power, to drain <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> by new levies, and to leave the government of the city to be administered by his friends.
To this report 'it was added, that in the next meeting of the senate, Lucius Cotta, one of the fifteen,
<note anchored="yes">Persons appointed to inspect and expound the Sibylline books.
</note>
would make a motion, that as there was in the Sibylline books a prophecy, that the Parthians would never be subdued but by a king, Caesar should have that title conferred upon him.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="80">
<p>For this reason the conspirators precipitated the execution of their design,<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 709.</note> that they might not be obliged to give their assent to the proposal.
Instead, therefore, of caballing any longer separately, in small parties, they now united their counsels; the people themselves being dissatisfied with the present state of affairs, both privately and publicly condemning the tyranny under which they lived, and calling on patriots to assert their cause against the usurper.
Upon the admission of foreigners into the senate, a hand-bill was posted up in these words: "A  good deed! let no one shew  a new
senator the way to the house."
These verses were likewise currently repeated:
<quote lang="en"><l>The Gauls he dragged in triumph through the town,</l>
<l>Caesar has brought into the senate-house, And changed their plaids<note anchored="yes">See before, c. xxii.</note>for the patrician gown.</l></quote>
<quote lang="la"><l>Gallos Caesar in triumphum ducit: iidem in curiam</l>
<l>Galli braccas deposuerunt, latum clavum sumpserunt.</l></quote>
When Quintus Maximus, who had been his deputy in the consulship for the last three months, entered the theatre, and the lictor, according to custom, bid the people take notice who was coming, they all cried out, "He is no consul."
After the removal of Cesetius and Marullus from their office, they were found to have a great many votes at the next election of consuls.
Some one wrote under the statue of Lucius Brutus  "Would you were now alive !" and under the statue of Caesar himself these lines:
<quote lang="en"><l>Because he drove from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> the royal race,</l>
<l>Brutus was first made consul in their place.</l>
<l>This man, because he put the consuls down,</l>
<l>Has been rewarded with a royal crown.</l></quote>
<quote lang="la"><l>Brutus, quia reges ejecit, consul primus factus est:</l>
<l>Hic, quia consules ejecit, rex postremo factus est.</l></quote>
About sixty persons were engaged in the conspiracy against him, of whom  Caius Cassius, and Marcus and Decimus Brutus were the chief.
It was at first debated amongst them, whether they should attack him in the <placeName key="tgn,7006964">Campus Martius</placeName> when he was taking the votes of the tribes, or some bf them should throw him off the bridge.
whilst others should be ready to stab him upon his fall; or else in the Via Sacra, or at the entrance of the theatre.
But after public notice had been given by proclamation for the senate to assemble upon the ides of March [15th March], in the senate-house built by Pompey, they approved both of the time and place, as most fitting for their purpose.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="81">
<p>Casar had warning given him of his fate by indubitable omens.
A few months before, when the colonists settled at <placeName key="perseus,Capua">Capua</placeName>, by virtue of the Julian law, were demolishing some old sepulchres, in building countryhouses, and were the more eager at the work, because they discovered certain vessels of antique workmanship, a tablet of brass was found in a tomb, in which Capys, the founder of <placeName key="perseus,Capua">Capua</placeName>, was said to have been buried, with an inscription in the Greek language to this effect: "Whenever the bones of Capys come to be discovered, a descendant of Iulus will be slain by the hands of his kinsmen, and his death revenged by fearful disasters throughout <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>."
Lest any person should regard this anecdote as a fabulous or silly invention, it was circulated upon the authority of Caius Balbus, an intimate friend of Caesar's. A few days likewise before his death, he was informed that the horses, which, upon his crossing the Rubicon, he had consecrated, and turned loose to graze without a keeper, abstained entirely from eating, and shed floods of tears.
The soothsayer Spurinna, observing certain ominous appearances in a sacrifice which he was offering, advised him to beware of some danger, which threatened to befall him before the ides of March were past.
The day before the ides, birds of various kinds from a neighbouring grove, pursuing a wren which flew into Pompey's senate-house,<note anchored="yes">This senate-house stood in that part of the <placeName key="tgn,7006964">Campus Martius</placeName> which is now the Campo di Fiore, and was attached by Pompey, "spoliis Orientis Onustus," to the magnificent theatre, which he built A.U.C. 698, in his second consulship. His statue, at the foot of which Caesar fell, as Plutarch tells us, was placed in it. We shall find that Augustus
caused it to be removed.</note>
 with a sprig of laurel
in its beak, tore it in pieces.
Also, in the night on which the day of his murder dawned, he dreamt at one time that he was soaring above the clouds, and, at another, that he had joined hands with <placeName key="tgn,2019952">Jupiter</placeName>.
His wife Calpurnia fancied in her sleep that the pediment of the house was falling down, and her husband stabbed on her bosom; immediately upon which the chamber doors flew open.
On account of these omens, as well as his infirm health, he was in some doubt whether he should not remain at home, and defer to some other opportunity the business which he intended to propose to the senate; but Decimus Brutus advising him not to disappoint the senators, who were numerously assembled, and waited his coming, he was prevailed upon to go, and accordingly set forward about the fifth hour.
In his way, some person having thrust into his hand a paper, warning him against the plot, he mixed it with some other documents which he held in his left hand, intending to read it at leisure.
Victim after victim was slain, without any favourable appearances in the entrails; but still, disregarding all omens, he entered the senate-house, laughing at Spurinna as a false prophet, because the ides of March were come
without any mischief having befallen him.
To which the soothsayer replied, "They are come, indeed, but not past."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="82">
<p>When he had taken his seat, the conspirators stood round him, under colour of paying their compliments; and immediately Tullius Cimber, who had engaged to commence the assault, advancing nearer than the rest, as if he had some favour to request, <placeName key="tgn,2073974">Casar</placeName> made signs that he should defer his petition to some other time.
Tullius immediately seized him by the toga, on both shoulders; at which <placeName key="tgn,2073974">Casar</placeName> crying out, "Violence  is meant!" one of the Cassii wounded him  a little below the throat.
Caesar seized him by the arm, and ran it through with his style;<note anchored="yes">The <foreign lang="la">stylus</foreign>, or <foreign lang="la">graphium</foreign>, was an iron pen, broad at one end, with a sharp point at the other, used for writing upon waxen tables, the leaves or bark of trees, plates of brass, or lead, etc. For writing upon paper or parchment, the Romans employed a reed, sharpened and split in the point like our pens, called <foreign lang="la">calamus</foreign>, <foreign lang="la">arundo</foreign>, or <foreign lang="la">canna</foreign>.  This they dipped in the black liquor emitted by the cuttle fish, which served for ink.</note>
and endeavouring to rush forward, was stopped by another wound.
Finding himself now attacked on all hands with naked poniards, he wrapped the toga<note anchored="yes">It was customary among the ancients, in great extremities to shroud the face. in order to conceal any symptoms of horror or alarm which the countenance might express. The skirt of the toga was drawn round the lower extremities, that there might be no exposure in falling, as the Romans, at this period, wore no covering for the thighs and legs.</note>
about his head, and at the same moment drew the skirt round his legs with his left hand, that he might fall more decently with the lower part of his body covered.He was stabbed with three and twenty wounds, uttering a groan only, but no cry, at the first wound; although some authors relate, that when Marcus <placeName key="tgn,2037959">Brutus</placeName> fell upon him, he exclaimed, "What! art thou, too, one of them!"  Thou, my son!"
<note anchored="yes">Caesar's dying apostrophe to <placeName key="tgn,2037959">Brutus</placeName> is represented in all the editions of Suetonius as uttered in Greek, but with some variations. The words, as here translated, are <foreign lang="greek">Kai\ su\ ei)= e)kei/nwn; Kai\ su\ te/knon</foreign>. The Salmasian manuscript omits the latter clause. Some commentators suppose that the words "my son," vere not merely expressive of the difference of age, or former familiarity between them, but an avowal that Brutus was the fruit of the connection between <placeName key="tgn,2008628">Julius</placeName> and Servilia, mentioned before [see p. 40]. But it appears very improbable that Caesar, who had never before acknowledged <placeName key="tgn,2037959">Brutus</placeName> to be his son, should make so unnecessary an avowal, at the moment of his death. Exclusively of this objection, the apostrophe seems too verbose, both for the suddenness and urgency of the occasion. But this is nor all. Can we suppose that Caesar, though a perfect master of Greek, would at such a time have expressed himself in that language, rather than in Latin, his familiar tongue, and in which he spoke with peculiar elegance? Upon the whole, the probability is, that the words uttered by <placeName key="tgn,2073974">Casar</placeName> were, <foreign lang="la">Et tu Brute!</foreign> which, while equally expressive of astonishment with the other version, and even of tenderness, are both more natural, and more emphatic.</note>
The whole assembly instantly
dispersing, he lay for some time after he expired, until three of his slaves laid the body on a litter, and carried it home, with one arm hanging down over the side.
Among so many wounds, there was none that was mortal, in the opinion of the surgeon Antistius, except the second, which he received in the breast.
The conspirators meant to drag his body into the <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName> as soon.as they had killed him; to confiscate his estate, and rescind all his enactments; but they were deterred by fear of Mark Antony, and Lepidus, Caesar's master of the horse, and abandoned their intentions.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="83">
<p>At the instance of Lucius Piso, his fatherin-law, his will was opened and read in Mark Antony's house.
He had made it on the ides (13th) of the preceding September, at his Lavica villa, and committed it to the custody of the chief of the Vestal Virgins.
Quintus Tubero informs us, that in all the wills he had signed, from the time of his first consulship to the breaking out of. the civil war, Cneius Pompey was appointed his heir, and that this had been publicly notified to the army.
But in his last will, he named three heirs, the grandsons of his sisters; namely, Caius Octavius for three fourths of his estate, and Lucius Pinarius and Quintus Pedius for the remaining fourth.
Other heirs [in remainder] were named at the close of the will, in which he also adopted Caius Octavius, who was to assume his name, into his family; and nominated most of those who were concerned in his death among the guardians of his son, if he
should have any; as well as Decimus Brutus amongst his heirs of the second order.
He bequeathed to the Roman people his gardens near the <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName>, and three hundred sesterces each man.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="84">
<p>Notice of his funeral having been solemnly proclaimed, a pile was erected in the <placeName key="tgn,7006964">Campus Martius</placeName>, near the tomb of his daughter Julia; and before the Rostra was placed a gilded tabernacle, on the model of the temple of Venus Genitrix;  within which was an ivory bed, covered with purple and cloth of gold.
At the head was a trophy, with the [blood-stained] robe in which he was slain.
It being considered that the whole day would not suffice for carrying the funeral oblations in solemn procession before the corpse, directions were given for every one, without regard to order, to carry them from the city into the <placeName key="tgn,7006964">Campus Martius</placeName>, by what way they pleased.
To raise pity and indignation for his murder, in the plays acted at the funeral, a passage was sung from Pacuvius's tragedy, entitled, <title>The Trial for Arms</title>:
<quote lang="en"><l>That ever I, unhappy man, should save</l>
<l>Wretches, who thus have brought me to the grave?</l></quote>

And some lines also from Attilius's tragedy of " Electra," to the same effect.
Instead of a funeral panegyric, the consul Antony ordered a herald to proclaim to the people the decree of the senate, in which they had bestowed upon him all honours, divine and human; with the oath by which they had engaged themselves for the defence of his person; and to these he added only a few words of his own.
The magistrates and others who had formerly filled the highest offices, carried the bier from the Rostra into the Forum.
While some proposed that the body
should be burnt in the sanctuary of the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, and others in Pompey's senate-house; on a sudden, two men, with swords by their sides, and spears in their hands, set fire to the bier with lighted torches.
The throng around immediately heaped upon it dry faggots, the tribunals and benches of the adjoining courts, and whatever else came to hand.
Then the musicians and players stripped off the dresses they wore on the present occasion, taken from the wardrobe of his triumph at spectacles, rent them, and threw them into the flames.
The legionaries, also, of his veteran bands, cast in their armour, which they had put on in honour of his funeral.
Most of the ladies did the same by their ornaments, with the <foreign lang="la">bullae</foreign>,<note anchored="yes">The <foreign lang="la">Bulla</foreign>, generally made of gold, was a hollow globe, which boys wore upon their breast, pendant from a string or ribbon put round the neck.

and mantles of their children.
In this public mourning there joined a multitude of foreigners, expressing their sorrow according to the fashion of their respective countries; but especially the Jews,

<div2 type="chapter" n="85">
<p>The populace ran from  the funeral, with torches in their hands, to the houses of Brutus and Cassius, and were repelled with difficulty.
Going in quest of Cornelius Cinna, who had in a speech, the day before, reflected severely upon Caesar, and mistaking for him Helvius Cinna, who happened to fall into their hands, they murdered the latter, and carried his head about the city on the point of a spear.
They afterwards erected in the Forum a column of Numidian marble, formed of one stone nearly twenty feet high, and inscribed upon it these words,
TO THE FATHER OF HIS COUNTRY.
At this column they continued for a long time to offer sacrifices, make vows, and decide controversies, in which they swore by Caesar.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="86">
<p>Some of Caesar's friends entertained a suspicion, that he neither desired nor cared to live any longer, on account of his declining health; and for that reason slighted all the omens of religion, and the warnings of his friends.
Others are of opinion, that thinking himself secure in the late decree of the senate, and their oaths, he dismissed his Spanish guards who attended him with drawn swords.
Others again suppose, that he chose rather to face at once the dangers which threatened him on all sides, than to be for ever on the watch against them.
Some tell us that he used to say, the commonwealth was more interested in the safety of his person than himself: for that he had for some time been satiated with power and glory; but that the commonwealth, if anything should befall him, would have no rest, and, involved in another civil war, would be in a worse state than before.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="87">
<p>This, however, was generally admitted, that his death was in many respects such as he would have chosen.
For, upon reading the account delivered by Xenophon, how Cyrus in his last illness gave instructions respecting his funeral, Caesar deprecated a lingering death, and wished that his own might be sudden and speedy.  And the day before he died, the conversation at supper, in the house of Marcus Lepidus, turning upon.

<head>Remarks on Julius Caesar</head>
<p>The termination of the civil war between Caesar and Pompey forms a new epoch in the Roman History, at which a Republic, which had subsisted with unrivalled glory during a period of about four hundred and sixty years, relapsed into a state of despotism, whence it never more could emerge.
So sudden a transition from prosperity to the ruin of public freedom, without the intervention of any foreign enemy, excites a reasonable conjecture, that the constitution in which it could take place, however vigorous in appearance, must have lost that soundness of political health which had enabled it to endure through so many ages.
A short view of its preceding state, and of that in which it was at the time of the revolution now mentioned, will best ascertain the foundation of such a conjecture.</p>
<p>Though the Romans, upon the expulsion of Tarquin, made an essential change in the political form of the state, they did not carry their detestation of regal authority so far as to abolish the religious institutions of Numa Pompilius, the second of their kings, according to which, the priesthood, with all the influence annexed to that order, was placed in the hands of the aristocracy.
By this wise policy a restraint was put upon the fickleness and violence of the people in matters of government, and a decided superiority given to the Senate both in the deliberative and executive parts of administration.
This advantage was afterwards indeed diminished by the creation of Tribunes of the people; a set of men whose ambition often embroiled the Republic in civil dissensions, and who at last abused their authority to such a degree, that they became instruments of aggrandizement to any leading men in the state who could purchase their friendship.
In general, however, the majority of the Tribunes being actuated by views which comprehended the interests of the multitude, rather than those of individuals, they did not so much endanger the liberty, as they interrupted the tranquillity, of the public; and when the occasional commotions subsided, there remained no permanent ground for the establishment of personal usurpation.</p>
<p>In every government, an object of the last importance to the peace and welfare of society is the morals of the people; and in proportion as a community is enlarged by propagation, or the accession of a multitude of new members, a more strict attention is requisite to guard against that dissolution of manners to which a crowded and extensive
capital has a natural tendency.
Of this the Romans became sensible in the growing state of the Republic.
In the year of the City 312, two magistrates were first created for taking an account of the number of the people, and the value of their estates; and soon after, they were invested with the authority not only of inspecting the morals of individuals, but of inflicting public censure for any licentiousness of conduct, or violation of decency.
Thus both the civil and religious institutions concurred to restrain the people within the bounds of good order and obedience to the laws; at the same time that the frugal life of the ancient Romans proved a strong security against those vices which operate most effectually towards sapping the foundations of a state.</p>
<p>But in the time of Julius Casar the barriers of public liberty were become too weak to restrain the audacious efforts of ambitious and desperate men.
The veneration for the constitution, usually a powerful check to treasonable designs, had been lately violated by the usurpations of Marius and Sylla.
The salutary terrors of religion no longer predominated over the consciences of men.
The shame of public censure was extinguished in general depravity.
An eminent historian, who lived at that time, informs us, that venality universally prevailed amongst the Romans; and a writer who flourished soon after, observes, that luxury and dissipation had encumbered almost all so much with debt, that they beheld with a degree of complacency the prospect of civil war and confusion.</p>
<p>The extreme degree of profligacy at which the Romans were now arrived is in nothing more evident, than that this age gave birth to the most horrible conspiracy which occurs in the annals of human kind, viz.
that of Catiline.
This was not the project of a few desperate and abandoned individuals, but of a number of men of the most illustrious rank in the state; and it appears beyond doubt, that Julius Caesar was accessory to the design, which was no less than to extirpate the Senate, divide amongst themselves both the public and private treasures, and set <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> on fire.
The causes which prompted to this tremendous project,'it is generally admitted, were luxury, prodigality, irreligion, a total corruption of manners, and above all, as the immediate cause, the pressing necessity in which the conspirators were involved by their extreme dissipation.</p>
<p>The enormous debt in which Caesar himself was early involved, countenances an opinion that his anxiety to procure the province of <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> proceeded chiefly from this cause.
But during nine years in which he held that province, he acquired such riches as must have rendered him,
without competition, the most opulent person in the state.
If nothing more, therefore, than a splendid establishment had been the object of his pursuit, he had attained to the summit of his wishes.
But when we find him persevering in a plan of aggrandizement beyond this period of his fortunes, we can ascribe his conduct to no other motive than that of outrageous ambition.
He projected the building of a new Forum at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, for the ground only of which he was to pay $4,ooo000,000; he raised legions in <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> at his own charges; he promised such entertamments to the people as had never been known at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> from the foundation of the city.
All these circumstances evince some latent design of procuring such a popularity as might give him an uncontrolled influence in the management of public affairs.
Pompey, we are told, was wont to to say, that Caesar not being able, with all his riches, to fulfil the promises which he had made, wished to throw everything into confusion.
There may have been some foundation for this remark: but the opinion of Cicero is more probable, that Caesar's mind was seduced with the temptations of chimerical glory.
It is observable that neither Cicero nor Pompey intimates any suspicion that Caesar was apprehensive of being impeached for his conduct, had he returned to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> in a private station.
Yet, that there was reason for such an apprehension, the positive declaration of L. Domitius leaves little room to doubt: especially when we consider the number of enemies that Caesar had in the Senate, and the coolness of his former friend Pompey ever after the death of Julia.
The proposed impeachment was founded upon a notorious charge of prosecuting measures destructive of the interests of the commonwealth, and tending ultimately to an object incompatible with public freedom.
Indeed, considering the extreme corruption which prevailed amongst the Romans at this time, it is more than probable that Caesar would have been acquitted of the charge, but at such an expense as must have stripped him of all his riches, and placed him again in a situation ready to attempt a disturbance of the public tranquillity.
For it is said, that he purchased the friendship of Curio, at the commencement of the civil war, with a bribe little short of half a million sterling.</p>
<p>Whatever Caesar's private motive may have been for taking arms against his country, he embarked in an enterprise of a nature the most dangerous: and had Pompey conducted himself in any degree suitable to the reputation which he had formerly acquired, the contest would in all probability have terminated in favour of public freedom.
But by dilatory measures in the beginning, by imprudently withdrawing his army from <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> into a distant province, and by not pursuing the
advantage he had gained by the vigorous repulse of Caesar's troops in their attack upon his camp, this commander lost every opportunity of extinguishing a war which was to determine the fate, and even the existence, of the Republic.
It was accordingly determined on the plains of Pharsalia, where Caesar obtained a victory which was not more decisive than unexpected.
He was now no longer amenable either to the tribunal of the Senate or the power of the laws, but triumphed at once over his enemies and the constitution of his country.</p>
<p>It is to the honour of Caesar, that when he had obtained the supreme power, he exercised it with a degree of moderation beyond what was generally expected by those who had fought on the side of the Republic.
Of his private life either before or after this period, little is transmitted in history.
Henceforth, however, he seems to have lived chiefly at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, near which he had a small villa, upon an eminence, commanding a beautiful prospect.
His time was almost entirely occupied with public affairs, in the management of which, though he employed many agents, he appears to have had none in the character of actual minister.
He was in general easy of access: but Cicero, in a letter to a friend, complains of having been treated with the indignity of waiting a considerable time amongst a crowd in an anti-chamber, before he could have an audience.
The elevation of Caesar placed him not above discharging reciprocally the social duties in the intercourse of life.
He returned the visits of those who waited upon him, and would sup at their houses.
At table, and in the use of wine, he was habitually temperate.
Upon the whole, he added nothing to his own happiness by all the dangers, the fatigues, and the perpetual anxiety which he had incurred in the pursuit of unlimited power.
His health was greatly impaired: his former cheerfulness of temper, though not his magnanimity, appears to have forsaken him; and we behold in his fate a memorable example of illustrious talents rendered, by inordinate ambition, destructive to himself, and irretrievably pernicious to his country.

<p>THAT the family of the Octavii was of the first distinction in <placeName key="perseus,Velitrae">Velitrae</placeName>,<note anchored="yes">A town in the ancient Volscian territory, now called Veletri. It

is rendered evident by many circumstances.
For in the most frequented part of the town, there was, not long since, a street named the Octavian; and an altar was to be seen, consecrated to one Octavius, who being chosen general in a war with some neighbouring people, the enemy making a sudden attack, while he was sacrificing to Mars, he immediately snatched the entrails of the victim from off the fire, and offered them half
raw upon the altar; after which, marching out to battle,
he returned victorious. This incident gave rise to a law,
by which it was enacted, that in all future times the entrails should be offered to Mars in the same manner; and
the rest of the victim be carried to the Octavii.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="2">
<p>This family, as well as several in <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, was admitted
into the senate by Tarquinius Priscus, and soon afterwards
placed by Servius Tullius among the patricians; but in
process of time it transferred itself to the plebeian order,
and, after the lapse of a long interval, was restored by
Julius Caesar to the rank of patricians. The first person
of the family raised by the suffrages of the people to the
magistracy, was Caius Rufus. He obtained the quaestorship, and had two sons, Cneius and Caius; from whom are
descended the two branches of the Octavian family, which have had very different fortunes.
For Cneius, and his descendants in uninterrupted succession, held all the highest offices of the state; whilst Caius and his posterity, whether from their circumstances or their choice, remained in the equestrian order until the father of Augustus.
The greatgrandfather of Augustus served as a military tribune in the second Punic war in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, under the command of /Emilius Pappus.
His grandfather contented himself with bearing the public offices of his own municipality, and grew old in the tranquil enjoyment of an ample patrimony. Such is the account given by different authors.
Augustus himself, however, tells us nothing more than that he was descended of an equestrian family, both ancient and rich, of which his father was the first who obtained the rank of senator.  Mark Antony upbraidingly tells him that his great-grandfather was a freedman of the territory of <placeName key="tgn,6005942">Thurium</placeName>,<note anchored="yes">Thorium was a territory in Magna Greaca, on the coast, near <placeName key="tgn,7004100">Tarentum</placeName>.</note> and a rope-maker, and his grandfather a usurer.
This is all the information I have any where met with, respecting the ancestors of Augustus, by the father's side.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="3">
<p>His father Caius Octavius was, from his earliest years, a person both of opulence and distinction: for which reason I am surprised at those who say that he was a money-dealer,

and was employed in scattering bribes, and canvassing for the candidates at elections, in the <placeName key="tgn,7006964">Campus Martius</placeName>.
For being bred up in all the affluence of a great estate, he attained with ease to honourable posts, and
discharged the duties of them  with much distinction.
After his praetorship,
he obtained by lot the province of <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>; in his way to which he cut off some banditti, the relics of the armies of Spartacus and Catiline, who had possessed themselves of the territory of <placeName key="tgn,6005942">Thurium</placeName>; having received from the senate an extraordinary commission for that purpose.
In his government of the province, he conducted himself with equal justice and resolution; for he defeated the Bessians and Thracians in a great battle, and treated the allies of the republic in such a manner, that there are extant letters from M. Tullius Cicero, in which he advises and exhorts his brother Quintus, who then held the proconsulship of <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> with no great reputation, to imitate the example of his neighbour Octavius, in gaining the affections of the allies of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="4">
<p>After quitting <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, before he could declare himself a candidate for the consulship, he died suddenly, leaving behind him a daughter, the elder Octavia, by Ancharia; and another daughter, Octavia the younger, as well as Augustus, by Atia, who was the daughter of Marcus Atius Balbus, and Julia, sister to Caius Julius Caesar.
Balbus was, by the father's side, of a family who were natives of <placeName key="perseus,Aricia">Aricia</placeName>,<note anchored="yes">Now Laricia, or <placeName key="tgn,1046275">Riccia</placeName>, a town of the <placeName key="tgn,1043765">Campagna</placeName> di <placeName key="tgn,7000874">Roma</placeName>. on the

By the mother's side he was nearly related to Pompey the Great; and after he had borne the office of praetor, was one of the twenty commissioners appointed by the Julian law to divide the land in <placeName key="tgn,7003005">Campania</placeName> among the people.
But Mark Antony, treating with contempt Augustus's descent even by the mother's side, says that his great grand-father was of African descent, and at one time kept a perfumer's shop, and at another, a bake-house, in <placeName key="perseus,Aricia">Aricia</placeName>.
And Cassius of <placeName key="tgn,7004942">Parma</placeName>, in a letter, taxes Augustus with being the son not only of a baker, but a usurer.
These are his words: "Thou art a lump of thy mother's meal, which a money-changer of Nerulum taking from the newest bake-house of <placeName key="perseus,Aricia">Aricia</placeName>, kneaded into some shape, with his hands all discoloured by the fingering of money."</p></div2>

For, as it is recorded in the proceedings of the senate, when Caius Laetorius, a young man of a patrician family, in pleading before the senators for a lighter sentence, upon his being convicted of adultery, alleged, besides his youth and quality, that he was the possessor, and as it were the guardian, of the ground which the Divine Augustus first touched upon his coming into the world; and entreated that he might find favour, for the sake of that deity, who was in a peculiar manner his; an act of the senate was passed, for the consecration of that part of his house in which Augustus was born.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="6">
<p>His nursery is shewn to this day, in a villa belonging to the family, in the suburbs of <placeName key="perseus,Velitrae">Velitrae</placeName>; being a very small place, and much like a pantry.
An opinion prevails in the neighbourhood, that he was also born there.
Into this place no person presumes to enter, unless upon necessity, and with great devotion, from a belief, for a long time prevalent, that such as rashly enter it are seized with great horror and consternation, which a short while since was confirmed by a remarkable incident.
For when a new inhabitant of the house had, either by mere chance, or to try the truth of the report, taken up his lodging in that apartment, in the course of the night, a few hours afterwards, he was thrown out by some sudden violence, he knew not how, and was found in a state of stupefaction, with the coverlid of his bed, before the door of the chamber.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="7">
<p>While he was yet an infant, the surname of Thurinus was given him, in memory of the birth-place of his family, or because, soon after he was born, his father Octavius had been successful against the fugitive slaves, in the country near <placeName key="tgn,6005942">Thurium</placeName>.
That he was surnamed Thurinus, I can affirm upon good foundation, for when a boy, I had a small bronze statue of him, with that name upon it in iron letters, nearly effaced by age, which I presented to the emperor,<note anchored="yes">Adrian, to whom Suetonius was secretary.</note> by whom it is now revered amongst the other tutelary deities in his chamber.
He is also often called Thurinus contemptuously, by Mark Antony in his letters; to which he makes only this reply: "I am surprised that my former name should be made a subject of reproach."
He afterwards assumed the name of Caius Caesar, and then of Augustus; the former in compliance with the will of his great-uncle, and the latter upon a motion of Munatius Plancus in the senate.
For when some proposed to confer upon him the name of Romulus, as being, in a manner, a second founder of the city, it was resolved that he should rather be called Augustus, a surname not only new, but of more dignity, because places devoted to religion, and those in which anything is consecrated by augury, are denominated august, either from the word <foreign lang="la">auctus</foreign>, signifying augmentation, or <foreign lang="la">ab avium gestu, gustuve</foreign>, from the flight and feeding of birds; as appears from this verse of Ennius:
<quote lang="en"><l>When glorious <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> by august augury was built.<note anchored="yes"><quote lang="la"><l>Augusto augurio postquam inclyta condita Roma est.</l></quote></note></l></quote></p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="8">
<p>He lost his father when he was only four years of age; and, in his twelfth year, pronounced a funeral oration in praise of his grand-mother Julia.
Four years afterwards, having assumed the robe of manhood, he was honoured with several military rewards by Caesar in his African triumph, although he took no part in the war, on account of his youth.
Upon his uncle's expedition to <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName> against the sons of Pompey, he was followed by his nephew, although he was scarcely recovered from a dangerous sickness; and after being shipwrecked at sea, and travelling with very few attendants through roads that were infested with the enemy, he at last came up with him.
This activity gave great satisfaction to his uncle, who soon conceived an increasing affection for him, on account of such indications of character.
After the subjugation of <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, while Caesar was meditating an expedition against the Dacians and Parthians, he was sent before him to <placeName key="perseus,Apollonia">Apollonia</placeName>, where he applied himself to his studies; until receiving intelligence that his uncle was murdered, and that he was appointed his heir, he hesitated for some time whether he should call to his aid the legions stationed in the neighbourhood; but he abandoned the design as rash and premature.
However, returning to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, he took possession of his inheritance, although his mother was apprehensive that such a measure might be attended with danger, and his step-father, Marcius Philippus, a man of consular-rank, very earnestly dissuaded him from it. From  this time, collecting together a strong military force, he first held the government in conjunction with Mark Antony and Marcus Lepidus, then with Antony only, for nearly twelve years, and at last in his own hands during a period of four and forty.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="9">
<p>Having thus given a very short summary of his life, I shall prosecute the several parts of it, not in order of time, but arranging his acts into distinct classes, for the sake of perspicuity.
He was engaged in five civil wars, namely, those of <placeName key="tgn,7009565">Modena</placeName>, <placeName key="perseus,Philippi">Philippi</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7000526">Perugia</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, and <placeName key="tgn,7010713">Actium</placeName>: the first and last of which were against Antony, and the second against Brutus and Cassius; the third against Lucius Antonius, the triumvir's brother, and the fourth against Sextus Pompeius, the son of Cneius Pompeius.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="10">
<p>The motive which gave rise to all these wars was the opinion he entertained that both his honour and interest were concerned in revenging the murder of his uncle, and maintaining the state of affairs he had established.
Immediately after his return from <placeName key="perseus,Apollonia">Apollonia</placeName>, he formed the design of taking forcible and unexpected measures against Brutus and Cassius; but they having foreseen the danger and made their escape, he resolved to proceed against them by an appeal to the laws in their absence, and impeach them for the murder.
In the mean time, those whose province it was to prepare the sports in honour of Caesar's last victory in the civil war, not daring to do it, he undertook it himself.
And that he might carry into effect his other designs with greater authority, he declared himself a candidate in the room of a tribune of the people who happened to die at that time, although he was of a patrician family, and had not yet been in the senate.
But the consul, Mark Antony, from whom he had expected the greatest assistance, opposing him in his suit, and even refusing to do him so much as common justice, unless gratified with a large bribe, he went over to the party of the nobles, to whom he perceived Sylla to be odious, chiefly for endeavouring to drive Decius Brutus, whom he besieged in the town of <placeName key="tgn,7009565">Modena</placeName>, out of the province, which had been given him by Caesar, and confirmed to him by the senate.
At the instigation of persons about him, he engaged some ruffians to murder his antagonist; but the plot being discovered, and dreading a similar attempt upon himself, he gained over Caesar's veteran soldiers, by distributing among them  all the money he could collect.
Being now commissioned by the senate to command the troops he had gathered, with the rank of praetor, and in conjunction with Hirtius and Pansa, who had accepted the consulship, to carry assistance to Decius Brutus, he put an end to the war by two battles in three months.
Antony writes, that in the former of these he ran away, and in two days afterwards made his appearance without his general's cloak and his horse.
In the last battle, however, it is certain that he performed the part not only of a general, but a soldier; for, in the heat of the battle, when the standard-bearer of his legion was severely wounded, he took the eagle upon his shoulders, and carried it a long time.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="11">
<p>In this war,<note anchored="yes">A. U. C. 711.</note> Hirtius being slain in battle, and Pansa dying a short time afterwards of a wound, a report
was circulated that they both were killed through his means, in order that, when Antony fled, the republic having lost its consuls, he might have the victorious armies entirely at his own command.
The death of Pansa was so fully believed to have been caused by undue means, that Glyco, his surgeon, was placed in custody, on a suspicion of having poisoned his wound.
And to this, Aquilius Niger adds, that he killed Hirtius, the other consul.
in the confusion of the battle, with his own hands.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="12">
<p>But upon intelligence that Antony, after his defeat, had been received by Marcus Lepidus, and that the rest of the generals and armies had all declared for the senate, he, without any hesitation, deserted from the party of the nobles; alleging as an excuse for his conduct, the actions and sayings of several amongst them; for some said, "he was a mere boy," and others threw out, "that he ought to be promoted to honours, and cut off," to avoid the making any suitable acknowledgment either to him or the veteran legions.
And the more to testify his regret for having before attached himself to the other faction, he fined the Nursini in a large sum of money, which they were unable to pay, and then expelled them from the town, for having inscribed upon a monument, erected at the public charge to their countrymen who were slain in the battle of <placeName key="tgn,7009565">Modena</placeName>, "That they fell in the cause of liberty."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="13">
<p>Having entered into a confederacy with Antony and Lepidus, he brought the war at <placeName key="perseus,Philippi">Philippi</placeName> to an end in two battles, although he was at that time weak, and suffering from sickness.
<note anchored="yes">A. U. C. 712.
</note>
In the first battle he was driven from his camp, and with some difficulty made his escape to the wing of the army commanded by Antony.
And now intoxicated with success, he sent the head of Brutus<note anchored="yes">After being defeated in the second engagement, Brutus retired to a
hill, and slew himself in the night.</note> to be
cast at the foot of Caesar's statue, and treated the most
illustrious of the prisoners not only with cruelty, but with
abusive language; insomuch that he is said to have answered one of them who humbly intreated that at least
he might not remain unburied, "That will be in the power of the birds." Two others, father and son, who begged
for their lives, he ordered to cast lots which of them
should live, or settle it between themselves by the sword;
and was a spectator of both their deaths: for the father
offering his life to save his son, and being accordingly executed, the son likewise killed himself upon the spot.
On this account, the rest of the prisoners, and amongst
them Marcus Favonius, Cato's rival, being led up in fetters, after they had saluted Antony, the general, with
much respect, reviled Octavius in the foulest language.
After this victory, dividing between them the offices of
the state, Mark Antony<note anchored="yes">The triumvir. There were three distinguished brothers of the
name of Antony; Mark, the consul; Caius, who was praetor; and
Lucius, a tribune of the people.</note> undertook to restore order in
the east, while Caesar conducted the veteran soldiers back
to <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, and settled them in colonies on lands belonging
to the municipalities.  But he had the misfortune to
please neither the soldiers nor the owners of the lands;
one party complaining of the injustice done them, in
being violently ejected from their possessions, and the
other, that they were not rewarded according to their
merit.<note anchored="yes">Virgil was one of the fugitives, having narrowly escaped being
killed by the centurion Ario; and being ejected from his farm. <bibl n="Verg. Ecl. 1">Eclog. 1.</bibl>
</note></p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="14">
<p>At this time he obliged Lucius Antony, who, presuming upon his own authority as consul, and his brother's power, was raising new commotions, to fly to <placeName key="tgn,7000526">Perugia</placeName>, and forced him, by famine, to surrender at last, although not without having been exposed to great hazards,
both before the war and during its continuance. For a
common soldier having got into the seats of the equestrian order in the theatre, at the public spectacles, Caesar
ordered him to be removed by an officer; and a rumour
being thence spread by his enemies, that he had put the
man to death by torture, the soldiers flocked together so
much enraged, that he narrowly escaped with his life.
The only thing that saved him, was the sudden appearance of the man, safe and sound, no violence having been
offered him.  And whilst he was sacrificing under the
walls of <placeName key="tgn,7000526">Perugia</placeName>, he nearly fell into the hands of a body
of gladiators, who sallied out of the town.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="15">
<p>After the taking of <placeName key="tgn,7000526">Perugia</placeName>,<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 714.</note> he sentenced a great

to all who implored pardon, or endeavoured to excuse
themselves, "You must die." Some authors write, that

opportunity, with Lucius Antony at their head; and that
having defeated them, and confiscated their estates, he
might be enabled to fulfil his promises to the veteran
soldiers.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="16">
<p>He soon commenced the Sicilian war, but it was
protracted by various delays during a long period;<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 712-718.</note> at
one time for the purpose of repairing his fleets, which he
lost twice by storm, even in the summer; at another,
while patching up a peace, to which he was forced by the
clamours of the people, in consequence of a famine occasioned by Pompey's cutting off the supply of corn by sea.
But at last, having built a new fleet, and obtained twenty
thousand manumitted slaves,<note anchored="yes">The Romans employed slaves in their wars only in cases of great
emergency, and with much reluctance. After the great slaughter at the
battle of <placeName key="perseus,Cannae">Cannae</placeName>, eight thousand were bought and armed by the republic. Augustus was the first who manumitted them, and employed them
as rowers in his gallies.</note> who were given him for
the oar, he formed the Julian harbour at <placeName key="perseus,Baiae">Baiae</placeName>, by letting
the sea into the Lucrine and Avernian lakes; and having
exercised his forces there during the whole winter, he
defeated Pompey betwixt <placeName key="tgn,7003904">Mylae</placeName> and Naulochus; although
just as the engagement commenced, he suddenly fell into
such a profound sleep, that his friends were obliged to
wake him to give the signal. This, I suppose, gave occasion for Antony's reproach: " You were not able to take
a clear view of the fleet, when drawn up in line of battle,
but lay stupidly upon your back, gazing at the sky; nor
did you get up and let your men see you, until Marcus
Agrippa had forced the enemies' ships to sheer off."
Others imputed to him both a saying and an action
which were indefensible; for, upon the loss of his fleets
by storm, he is reported to have said: "I will conquer
in spite of Neptune;" and at the next Circensian games,
he would not suffer the statue of that God to be carried
in procession as usual. Indeed he scarcely ever ran more
or greater risks in any of his wars than in this. Having
transported part of his army to <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, and being on his
return for the rest, he was unexpectedly attacked by Demochares and Apollophanes, Pompey's admirals, from
whom he escaped with great difficulty, and with one ship
only. Likewise, as he was travelling on foot through the
Locrian territory to <placeName key="tgn,7004296">Rhegium</placeName>, seeing two of Pompey's
vessels passing by that coast, and supposing them to be
his own, he went down to the shore, and was very nearly
taken prisoner. On this occasion, as he was making his
escape by some by-ways, a slave belonging to Aemilius
Paulus, who accompanied him, owing him a grudge for
the proscription of Paulus, the father of Aemilius, and
thinking he had now an opportunity of revenging it,
attempted to assassinate him. After the defeat of Pompey, one of his colleagues,<note anchored="yes">In the triumvirate, consisting of Augustus, Mark Antony, and Lepidus.</note> Marcus Lepidus, whom he
had summoned to his aid from <placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>, affecting great
superiority, because he was at the head of twenty legions,
and claiming for himself the principal management of
affairs in a threatening manner, he divested him of his
command, but, upon his humble submission, granted him
his life, but banished him for life to <placeName key="tgn,7009536">Circeii</placeName>.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="17">
<p>The alliance between him and Antony, which
had always been precarious, often interrupted, and ill
cemented by repeated reconciliations, he at last entirely
dissolved.<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 723</note> And to make it known to the world how
far Antony had degenerated from patriotic feelings, he
caused a will of his, which had been left at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and
in which he had nominated Cleopatra's children, amongst
others, as his heirs, to be opened and read in an assembly of the people. Yet upon his being declared an enemy, he sent to him all his relations and friends, among
whom were Caius Sosius and Titus Domitius, at that
time consuls. He likewise spoke favourably in public of
the people of <placeName key="tgn,7004847">Bologna</placeName>, for joining in the association with
the rest of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> to support his cause, because they had,
in former times, been under the protection of the family
of the Antonii. And not long afterwards he defeated
him in a naval engagement near <placeName key="tgn,7010713">Actium</placeName>, which was prolonged to so late an hour, that, after the victory, he was
obliged to sleep on board his ship. From <placeName key="tgn,7010713">Actium</placeName> he went
to the isle of <placeName key="tgn,7002673">Samos</placeName> to winter; but being alarmed with
the accounts of a mutiny amongst the soldiers he had
selected from the main body of his army sent to <placeName key="tgn,7004094">Brundisium</placeName> after the victory, who insisted on their being rewarded for their service and discharged, he returned to
<placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>. In his passage thither, he encountered two violent
storms, the first between the promontories of <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7002678">AEtolia</placeName>, and the other about the Ceraunian

species of poison; and the ignorance of those times gave credit to the
physical immunity which they arrogated. But Celsus, who flourished
about fifty years after the period we speak of, has exploded the vulgar
prejudice which prevailed in their favour. He justly observes, that the

Varro Muraena, and Fannius Caepio; then that of Marcus
Egnatius, afterwards that of Plautius Rufus, and of Lucius Paulus, his grand-daughter's husband; and besides
these, another of Lucius Audasius, an old feeble man, who

upon those occasions, to know the names of persons, they were commonly attended by a nomenclator, who whispered into their ears that
information, wherever it was wanted. Though this kind of officer was
generally an attendant on men, we meet with instances of their having
been likewise employed in the service of ladies; either with the view
of serving candidates to whom they were allied, or of gaining the affections of the people.</note> for he was in danger of his life
from the plots and conspiracies of some of the lowest of
the people against him. Audasius and Epicadus had
formed the design of carrying off to the armies his
daughter Julia, and his grandson Agrippa, from  the islands in which they were confined.    Telephus, wildly

always afforded them the means of getting back their
hostages whenever they wished it. Even those who engaged most frequently and with the greatest perfidy in
their rebellion, he never punished more severely than by
selling their captives, on the terms of their not serving in
any neighbouring country, nor being released from their
slavery before the expiration of thirty years.  By the
character which he thus acquired, for virtue and moderation, he induced even the Indians and Scythians, nations
before known to the Romans by report only, to solicit his
friendship, and that of the Roman people, by ambassadors.
The Parthians readily allowed his claim   to <placeName key="tgn,7006651">Armenia</placeName>; restoring, at his demand, the standards which they had

highest military honour which could be obtained in the Roman state.
Foremost in the procession went musicians of various kinds, singing and
playing triumphal songs. Next were led the oxen to be sacrificed, having their horns gilt, and their heads adorned with fillets and garlands.
Then in carriages were brought the spoils taken from the enemy, statues,
pictures, plate, armour, gold and silver, and brass; with golden crowns,
and other gifts, sent by the allied and tributary states. The captive
princes and generals followed in chains, with their children and attendants. After them came the lictors, having their fasces wreathed with
laurel, followed by a great company of musicians and dancers dressed
like Satyrs, and wearing crowns of gold; in the midst of whom was
one in a female dress, whose business it was, with his looks and gestures, to insult the vanquished. Next followed a long train of persons
carrying perfumes. Then came the victorious general, dressed in purple embroidered with gold, with a crown of laurel on his head, a branch
of laurel in his right hand, and in his left an ivory sceptre, with an
eagle on the top; having his face painted with vermilion, in the same
manner as the statue of <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName> on festival days, and a golden Bulla
hanging on his breast, and containing some amulet, or magical preservative against envy. He stood in a gilded chariot, adorned with
ivory, and drawn by four white horses, sometimes by elephants, attended
by his relations, and a great crowd of citizens, all in white. His children used to ride in the chariot with him; and that he might not be
too much elated, a slave, carrying a golden crown sparkling with gems,
stood behind him, and frequently whispered in his ear, 'Remember
that thou art a man!' After the general, followed the consuls and
senators on foot, at least according to the appointment of Augustus;
for they formerly used to go before him. His Legati and military
Tribunes commonly rode by his side. The victorious army, horse and
foot, came last, crowned with laurel, and decorated with the gifts which
they had received for their valour, singing their own and their general's
praises, but sometimes throwing out railleries against him; and often
exclaiming, 'Io Triumphe!' in which they were joined by all the citizens, as they passed along. The oxen having been sacrificed, the general gave a magnificent entertainment in the Capitol to his friends and
the chief men of the city, after which he was conducted home by the
people, with music and a great number of lamps and torches."-Thomson.

<p>In all his wars, he never received any signal or
ignominious defeat, except twice in <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, under his
lieutenants Lollius and Varus. The former indeed had in
it more of dishonour than disaster; but that of Varus
threatened the security of the empire itself; three legions,
with the commander, his lieutenants, and all the auxiliaries, being cut off. Upon receiving intelligence of this
disaster, he gave orders for keeping a strict watch over
the city, to prevent any public disturbance, and prolonged
the appointments of the prefects in the provinces, that the
allies might be kept in order by experience of persons to
whom they were used. He made a vow to celebrate the
great games in honour of <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName>, Optimus, Maximus, "if
he would be pleased to restore the state to more prosperous circumstances." This had formerly been resorted to
in the Cimbrian and Marsian wars. In short, we are informed that he was in such consternation at this event,
that he let the hair of his head and beard grow for several months, and sometimes knocked his head against the
door-post, crying out, "0, Quintilius Varus! give me back
my legions!" And ever after he observed the anniversary
of this calamity, as a day of sorrow and mourning.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="24">
<p>In military affairs he made many alterations,
introducing some practices entirely new, and reviving
others, which had become obsolete. He maintained the
strictest discipline among the troops; and would not allow
even his lieutenants the liberty to visit their wives, except
reluctantly, and in the winter season only.  A Roman
knight having cut off the thumbs of his two young sons,
to render them incapable of serving in the wars, he exposed both him and his estate to public sale. But upon
observing the farmers of the revenue very greedy for the
purchase, he assigned him to a freedman of his own, that
he might send him into the country, and suffer him to retain his freedom. The tenth legion becoming mutinous,
he disbanded it with ignominy; and did the same by some
others which petulantly demanded their discharge; withholding from them the rewards usually bestowed on those
who had served their stated time in the wars. The cohorts
which yielded their ground in time of action, he decimated, and fed with barley. Centurions, as well as common
sentinels, who deserted their posts when on guard, he
punished with death.  For other misdemeanors he inflicted upon them various kinds of disgrace; such as
obliging them to stand all day before the praetorium,
sometimes in their tunics only, and without their belts,
sometimes to carry poles ten feet long, or sods of turf.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="25">
<p>After the conclusion of the civil wars, he never,
in any of his military harangues, or proclamations, addressed them by the title of "Fellow-soldiers," but as
"Soldiers" only. Nor would he suffer them to be otherwise called by his sons or step-sons, when they were in
command; judging the former epithet to convey the idea
of a degree of condescension inconsistent with military
discipline, the maintenance of order, and his own majesty, and that of his house. Unless at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, in case of
incendiary fires, or under the apprehension of public disturbances during a scarcity of provisions, he never employed in his army slaves who had been made freedmen,
except upon two occasions; on one, for the security of the
colonies bordering upon <placeName key="tgn,7016683">Illyricum</placeName>, and on the other, to
guard the banks of the river <placeName key="tgn,7012611">Rhine</placeName>. Although he obliged
persons of fortune, both male and female, to give up their
slaves, and they received their manumission at once, yet
he kept them together under their own standard, unmixed with soldiers who were better born, and armed
likewise after different fashion. Military rewards, such as
trappings, collars, and other decorations of gold and silver, he distributed more readily than camp or mural
crowns, which were reckoned more honourable than the
former. These he bestowed sparingly, without partiality,
and frequently even on common soldiers. He presented
M. Agrippa, after the naval engagement in the Sicilian
war, with a sea-green banner. Those who shared in the
honours of a triumph, although they had attended him in
his expeditions, and taken part in his victories, he judged
it improper to distinguish by the usual rewards for service, because they had a right themselves to grant such
rewards to whom they pleased.  He thought nothing
more derogatory to the character of an accomplished
general than precipitancy and rashness; on which account
he had frequently in his mouth those proverbs:  <quote lang="greek">speu=de brade/ws</quote>, <gloss>hasten slowly</gloss>;  and
<quote lang="greek">a)sfalh\s ga\r e)st' a)mei/nwn, h( qra/sus strathla/ths</quote>, <gloss>The cautious captain's better than the bold.</gloss>.
And "That is done fast enough, which is done well
enough."</p>
<p>He was wont to say also, that "a battle or a war ought
never to be undertaken, unless the prospect of gain over
balanced the fear of loss. For," said he, "men who pursue small advantages with no small hazard, resemble
those who fish with a golden hook, the loss of which, if
the line should happen to break, could never be compensated by all the fish they might take."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="26">
<p>He was advanced to public offices before the
age at which he was legally qualified for them; and to
some, also, of a new kind, and for life. He seized the
consulship in the twentieth year of his age, quartering his
legions in a threatening manner near the city, and sending deputies to demand it for him in the name of the
army. When the senate demurred, a centurion, named
Cornelius, who was at the head of the chief deputation,
throwing back his cloak, and showing the hilt of his sword,
had the presumption to say in the senate-house, "This
will make him consul, if ye will not." His second consulship he filled nine years afterwards; his third, after the
interval of only one year, and held the same office every
year successively until the eleventh. From this period,
although the consulship was frequently offered him, he
always declined it, until, after a long interval, not less
than seventeen years, he voluntarily stood for the twelfth, and two years after that for a thirteenth; that he might successively introduce into the forum, on their entering public life, his two sons, Caius and Lucius, while he was invested with the highest office in the state.
In his five consulships from the sixth to the eleventh, he continued in office throughout the year; but in the rest, during only nine, six, four, or three months, and in his second no more than a few hours.
For having sat for a short time in the morning, upon the calends of January [1st January], in his curule chair.

From its construction, it might be occasionally folded together for the convenience of carriage, and set down where the magistrate chose to use it."--Thomson.

<p>During ten years he acted as one of the triumvirate for settling the commonwealth, in which office he for some time opposed his colleagues in their design of a proscription; but after it was begun, he prosecuted it with more determined rigour than either of them.
For whilst they were often prevailed upon, by the interest and intercession of friends, to show mercy, he alone strongly insisted that no one should be spared, and even proscribed Caius Toranius,

his guardian, who had been formerly the
colleague of his father Octavius in the edileship.
Junius Saturnius adds this farther account of him: that when, after the proscription was over, Marcus Lepidus made an apology in the senate for their past proceedings, and gave them hopes of a more mild administration for the future, because they had now sufficiently crushed their enemies; he, on the other hand, declared that the only limit he had fixed to the proscription was, that he should be free to act as he pleased.
Afterwards, however, repenting of his severity, he advanced T. Vinius Philopoemen to the equestrian rank, for having concealed his patron at the time he was proscribed.
In this same office he incurred great odium upon many accounts.
For as he was one day making an harangue, observing among the soldiers Pinarius, a Roman knight, admit some private citizens, and engaged in taking notes, he ordered him to be stabbed before his eyes, as a busy-body and a spy upon him.
He so terrified with his menaces Tedius Afer, the consul elect,
<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 731.

for having reflected upon some action of his, that he threw himself from a great height, and died on the spot.
And when Quintus Gallius, the praetor, came to compliment him with a double tablet under his cloak, suspecting that it was a sword he had concealed, and yet not venturing to make a search, lest it should be found to be something else, he caused him to be dragged from his tribunal by centurions and soldiers, and tortured like a slave: and although he made no confession, ordered him to be put to death, after he had, with his own hands, plucked out his eyes.
His own account of the matter, however, is, that Quintus Gallius sought a private conference with him, for the purpose of assassinating him; that he therefore put him in prison, but afterwards
released him, and banished him the city; when he perished either in a storm at sea, or by falling into the hands of robbers.</p>

</note> first, immediately after he had crushed Antony, remembering that he had often  charged him with being the obstacle to its restoration.
The second time was in consequence of a long illness, when he sent for the magistrates and the senate to his own house, and delivered them a particular account of the state of the empire.
But reflecting at the same time that it would be both hazardous to himself to return to the condition of a private person, and might be dangerous to the public to have the government placed again under the control of the people, he resolved to keep it in his own hands, whether with the better event or intention, is hard to say.
His good intentions he often affirmed in private discourse, and also published an edict, in which it was declared in the following terms:  "May it be permitted me to have the happiness of establishing the commonwealth on a safe and sound basis, and thus enjoy the reward of which I am ambitious, that of being celebrated for moulding it into the form  best adapted to present circumstances; so that, on my leaving the world, I may carry with me the hope that the foundations which I have laid for its future government, will stand firm and stable."</p></div2>

<note anchored="yes">The <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName> has been always remarkable for the frequency of its inundations and the ravages they occasioned, as remarked by Pliny, iii. 5.

as well as to fires, was so much improved under his administration, that he boasted, not without reason, that he "found it of brick, but left it of marble."
<note anchored="yes">The well-known saying of Augustus, recorded by Suetonius, that he found a city of bricks, but left it of marble, has another version given it by Dio, who applies it to his consolidation of the government, to the following effect:  "That Rome, which I found built of mud, I shall leave you firm as a rock."-Dio. lvi. p. 589.

He also rendered it secure for the time to come against such disasters, as far as could be effected by human foresight.
A  great number of public buildings were erected by him, the most considerable of which were a forum,
<note anchored="yes">The same motive which engaged Julius Caesar to build a new forum, induced Augustus to erect another. See his life c. x.  It stood behind the present churches of St. Adrian and St. Luke, and was almost parallel with the public forum, but there are no traces of it remaining. The temple of Mars Ultor, adjoining. has been mentioned before, p. 90.
</note>
containing the temple of Mars the Avenger, the temple of Apollo on the <placeName key="tgn,3000935">Palatine</placeName> hill, and the temple of Jupiter Tonans in the capitol.
The reason of his building a new forum was the vast increase in the population, and the number of causes to be tried in the courts, for which, the two already existing not affording sufficient space, it was thought necessary to have a third.
It was therefore opened for public use before the temple of Mars was completely finished; and a law was passed, that causes should be tried, and judges chosen by lot, in that place.
The temple of Mars was built in fulfilment of a vow made during the war of <placeName key="tgn,7010789">Philippi</placeName>, undertaken by him to avenge his father's murder.
He ordained that the senate should always assemble there when they met to deliberate respecting wars and triumphs; that thence should be despatched all those who were sent into the provinces in the command of armies; and that in it those who returned victorious from the wars, should lodge the trophies of their triumphs.
He erected the temple of Apollo<note anchored="yes">The temple of the Palatine Apollo stood, according to Bianchini, a little beyond the triumphal arch of Titus. It appears, from the reverse of a medal of Augustus, to have been a rotondo, with an open portico, something like the temple of <placeName key="tgn,1016295">Vesta</placeName>. The statues of the fifty daughters of Danae surrounded the portico; and opposite to them were their husbands on horseback. In this temple were preserved some of the finest works of the Greek artists, both in sculpture and painting. Here, in the presence of Augustus, Horace's Carmen Seculare was sung by twenty-seven noble youths, and as many virgins. And here, as our author informs us, Augustus, towards the end of his reign, often assembled the senate.

his litter was struck by lightning, which killed the slave

some public buildings in the name of others; for instance, his grandsons, his wife, and sister. Thus he
built the portico and basilica of <placeName key="tgn,2023439">Lucius</placeName> and Caius, and

the capitol. Augustus gave it the name of his nephew Marcelhis, though
he was then dead. Its ruins are still to be seen in the Piazza Montanara, where the Orsini family have a palace erected on the site.
</note>   He also often exhorted other persons of
rank to embellish the city by new buildings, or repairing
and improving  the old, according  to their means.  In
consequence of this recommendation, many were raised;
such as the temple of <placeName key="tgn,2086286">Hercules</placeName> and the Muses, by Marcius Philippus; a temple of <placeName key="tgn,2118015">Diana</placeName> by Lucius Cornificius; the Court of Freedom  by Asinius Pollio; a temple of <placeName key="tgn,2644983">Saturn</placeName> by Munatius Plancus; a theatre by Cornelius Balbus<note anchored="yes">The theatre of Balbus was the third of the three permanent theatres of <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>.

<p>He divided the city into regions and districts, ordaining that the annual magistrates should take by lot the charge of the former; and that the latter should be superintended by wardens chosen out of the people of each neighbourhood.

Temples decayed by time, or destroyed by fire, he either repaired or rebuilt; and enriched them, as well as many others, with splendid offerings.

This being done, he deposited them in two gilt coffers, under the pedestal of the statue of the Palatine Apollo. He restored the calendar, which had been corrected by Julius Caesar, but through negligence was again fallen into confusion,

He prohibited young boys from running in the Lupercalia; and in respect of the Secular games, issued an order, that no young persons of either sex should appear at any public diversions in the night-time, unless in the company of some elderly relation. He ordered the household gods to be decked twice a year with spring and summer flowers,
<note anchored="yes">Theophrastus mentions the spring and summer flowers most suited for these chaplets. Among the former, were hyacinths, roses, and white violets; among the latter, lychinis, amaryllis, iris, and some species of lilies.

<p>Next to the immortal gods, he paid the highest honours to the memory of those generals who had raised the Roman state from its low origin to the highest pitch of grandeur. He accordingly repaired or rebuilt the public edifices erected by them; preserving the former inscriptions, and placing statues of them all, with triumphal emblems, in both the porticos of his forum, issuing an edict on the occasion, in which he made the following declaration: "My design in so doing is, that the Roman people may require from me, and all succeeding princes, a conformity to those illustrious examples."  He likewise removed the statue of Pompey from the senate-house, in which Caius Caesar had been killed, and placed it under a marble arch, fronting the palace attached to Pompey's theatre.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="32">
<p>He corrected many ill practices, which, to the detriment of the public, had either survived the licentious habits of the late civil wars, or else originated in the long peace.  Bands of robbers shewed themselves openly, completely armed, under colour of self-defence; and in different parts of the country, travellers, freemen and slaves without distinction, were forcibly carried off, and kept to work in the houses of correction.<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="la">Ergastulis</foreign>. These were subterranean strong rooms, with narrow windows, like dungeons, in the country houses, where incorrigible
slaves were confined in fetters, in the intervals of the severe tasks in
grinding at the hand-mills, quarrying stones, drawing water, and other
hard agricultural labour in which they were employed.
</note> Several associations were formed under the specious name of a new
college, which banded together for the perpetration of all
kinds of villany. The banditti he quelled by establishing
posts of soldiers in suitable stations for the purpose; the
houses of correction were subjected to a strict superintendence; all associations, those only excepted which were
of ancient standing, and recognised by the laws, were dissolved. He burnt all the notes of those who had been a
long time in arrear with the treasury, as being the principal source of vexatious suits and prosecutions. Places in
the city claimed by the public, where the right was doubtful, he adjudged to the actual possessors. He struck out
of the list of criminals the names of those over whom
prosecutions had been long impending, where nothing
further was intended by the informers than to gratify
their own malice, by seeing their enemies humiliated; laying it down as a rule, that if any one chose to renew a
prosecution, he should incur the risk of the punishment
which he sought to inflict. And that crimes might not escape punishment, nor business be neglected by delay, he
ordered the courts to sit during the thirty days which were
spent in celebrating honorary games.  To the three
classes of judges then existing, he added a.fourth, consisting of persons of inferior order, who were called Ducenarii, and decided all litigations about trifling sums. He
chose judges from the age of thirty years and upwards;
that is five years younger than had been usual before.
And a great many declining the office, he was with much
difficulty prevailed upon to allow each class of judges a
twelve-month's vacation in turn: and the courts to be shut
during the months of November and December.<note anchored="yes">These months were not only "the Long Vacation" of the lawyers,
but during them there was a general cessation of business at <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>; the

December, in particular, was devoted to pleasure and relaxation.</note></p></div2>

<p>He was himself assiduous in his functions as
a judge, and would sometimes prolong his sittings even
into the night:<note anchored="yes">Causes are mentioned, the hearing of which was so protracted that
lights were required in the court; and sometimes they lasted, we are
told, as long as eleven or twelve days.
</note> if he were indisposed, his litter was placed
before the tribunal, or he administered justice reclining on
his couch at home; displaying always not only the greatest
attention, but extreme lenity. To save a culprit, who evidently appeared guilty of parricide, from the extreme
penalty of being sewn up in a sack, because none were
punished in that manner but such as confessed the fact,
he is said to have interrogated him thus: "Surely you did
not kill your father, did you?" And when, in a trial of a
cause about a forged will, all those who had signed it
were liable to the penalty of the <placeName key="tgn,2257061">Cornelian</placeName> law, he ordered that his colleagues on the tribunal should not only be
furnished with the two tablets by which they decided,
"guilty or not guilty," but with a third likewise, ignoring
the offence of those who should appear to have given
their signatures through any deception or mistake. All
appeals in causes between inhabitants of <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, he assigned every year to the praetor of the city; and where
provincials were concerned, to men of consular rank, to
one of whom the business of each province was referred.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="34">
<p>Some laws he abrogated, and he made some
new ones; such as the sumptuary law, that relating to
adultery and the violation of chastity, the law against bribery in elections, and likewise that for the encouragement of marriage.  Having been more severe in his reform of this law than the rest, he found the people utterly
averse to submit to it, unless the penalties were abolished
or mitigated, besides allowing an interval of three years
after a wife's death, and increasing the premiums on marriage. The equestrian order clamoured loudly, at a spectacle in the theatre, for its total repeal; whereupon he
sent for the children of Germanicus, and shewed them
partly sitting upon his own lap, and partly on their father's;
intimating by his looks and gestures, that they ought not
to think it a grievance to follow the example of that
young man.  But finding that the force of the law was
eluded, by marrying girls under the age of puberty, and
by frequent change of wives, he limited the time for consummation after espousals, and imposed restrictions on
divorce.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="35">
<p>By two separate scrutinies he reduced to their
former number and splendour the senate, which had been
swamped by a disorderly crowd; for they were now more
than a thousand, and some of them very mean persons,
who, after Caesar's death, had been chosen by dint of interest and bribery, so that they had the nickname of Orcini among the people.
<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="la">Orcini</foreign>. They were also called Charonites, the point of the sarcasm being, that they owed their elevation to a dead man, one who was
gone to Orcus, namely Julius Caesar, after whose death Mark Antony
introduced into the senate many persons of low rank who were designated for that honour in a document left by the deceased emperor.
</note>
The first of these scrutinies was
left to themselves, each senator naming another; but the
last was conducted by himself and Agrippa. On this occasion he is believed to have taken his seat as he presided,
with a coat of mail under his tunic, and a sword by his
side, and with ten of the stoutest men of senatorial rank,
who were his friends, standing round his chair. Cordus
Cremutius<note anchored="yes">Cordus Cremutius wrote a History of the Civil Wars, and the
Times of Augustus, as we are informed by Dio, 6, 52.</note> relates that no senator was suffered to approach him, except singly, and after having his bosom
searched [for secreted daggers]. Some he obliged to
have the grace of declining the office; these he allowed
to retain the privileges of wearing the distinguishing
dress, occupying the seats at the solemn spectacles, and
of feasting publicly, reserved to the senatorial order.<note anchored="yes">In front of the orchestra.</note>
That those who were chosen and approved of, might perform their functions under more solemn obligations, and
with less inconvenience, he ordered that every senator,
before he took his seat in the house, should pay his devotions, with an offering of
frankincense and wine, at the altar of that God in whose temple the senate then assembled,<note anchored="yes">The senate usually assembled in one of the temples, and there was
an altar consecrated to some god in the curia, where they otherwise met,
as that to Victory in the Julian Curia.</note> and that their stated meetings should be only twice
in the month, namely, on the calends and ides; and that
in the months of September and October,<note anchored="yes">To allow of their absence during the vintage, always an important
season in rural affairs in wine-growing countries. In the middle and
south of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, it begins in September, and, in the worst aspects, the
grapes are generally cleared before the end of October. In elevated
districts they hung on the trees, as we have witnessed, till the month of
November.</note> a certain number only, chosen by lot, such as the law required to give
validity to a decree, should be required to attend. For
himself, he resolved to choose every six months a new
council, with whom he might consult previously upon such
affairs as he judged proper at any time to lay before the
full senate. He also took the votes of the senators upon
any subject of importance, not according to custom, nor
in regular order, but as he pleased; that every one might
hold himself ready to give his opinion, rather than a mere
vote of assent.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="36">
<p>He also made several other alterations in the
management of public affairs, among which were these
following: that the acts of the senate should not be published;<note anchored="yes">Julius Caesar had introduced the contrary practice. See <placeName key="tgn,2008628">JULIUS</placeName>,
c. XX.</note> that the magistrates should not be sent into the
provinces immediately after the expiration of their office;
that the proconsuls should have a certain sum assigned
them out of the treasury for mules and tents, which used
before to be contracted for by the government with private persons; that the management of the treasury
should be transferred from the city-quaestors to the praetors, or those who had already served in the latter office;
and that the decemviri should call together the court of
One hundred, which had been formerly summoned by
those who had filled the office of quaestor.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="37">
<p>To augment the number of persons employed in the administration of the state, he devised several new offices: such as surveyors of the public buildings,
of the roads, the aqueducts, and the bed of the <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName>; for
the distribution of corn to the people; the prefecture of
the city; a triumvirate for the election of the senators; and
another for inspecting the several troops of the equestrian order, as often as it was necessary. He revived the
office of censor,<note anchored="yes">A. U. C. 312, two magistrates were created, under the name of Censors, whose office, at first, was to take an account of the number of the people, and the value of their estates.
Power was afterwards granted them to inspect the morals of the people; and from this period the office became of great importance.
After Sylla, the election of censors was intermitted for seventeen years.  Under the emperors, the office of censor was abolished; but the chief functions of it were exercised by the emperors themselves, and frequently both with caprice and severity.</note> which had been long disused, and increased the number of praetors.
He likewise required that whenever the consulship was conferred on him he should have two colleagues instead of one; but his proposal was rejected, all the senators declaring by acclamation that he abated his high majesty quite enough in not filling the office alone, and consenting to share it with another.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="38">
<p>He was unsparing in the reward of military merit, having granted to above thirty generals the honour of the greater triumph; besides which, he took care to have triumphal decorations voted by the senate for more than that number.
That the sons of senators might become early acquainted with the administration of affairs, he permitted them, at the age when they took the garb of manhood,
<note anchored="yes">Young men until they were seventeen years of age, and young women until they were married, wore a white robe bordered with purple, called <placeName key="tgn,2114627">Toga</placeName> Pratexta. The former, when they had completed this period, laid aside the dress of minority, and assumed the Toga Virilis, or manly habit. The ceremony of changing the Toga was performed with great solemnity before the images of the <placeName key="tgn,1018972">Lares</placeName>, to whom the Bulla was consecrated. On this occasion, they went either to the Capitol, or to some temple, to pay their devotions to the Gods.</note>
to assume also the distinction of the senatorian robe, with its broad border, and to be present at the debates in the senate-house.
When they entered the military service, he not only gave them the rank of military tribunes in the legions, but likewise the command of the auxiliary horse.
And that all might have an opportunity of acquiring military experience, he commonly joined two sons of senators in command of each troop of horse.
He frequently reviewed the troops of the equestrian order, reviving the ancient custom of a cavalcade,<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="la">Transvectio</foreign>: a procession of the equestrian order, which they made
with great splendour through the city, every year, on the fifteenth of
July. They rode on horseback from the temple of Honour, or of <placeName key="tgn,2090583">Mars</placeName>,
without the city, to the Capitol, with wreaths of olive on their heads,
dressed in robes of scarlet, and bearing in their hands the military ornaments which they had received from their general, as a reward of their
valour. The knights rode up to the censor, seated on his curule chair
in front of the Capitol, and dismounting, led their horses in review
before him. If any of the knights was corrupt in his morals, had diminished his fortune below the legal standard, or even had not taken
proper care of his horse, the censor ordered him to sell his horse, by
which he was considered as degraded from the equestrian order.</note> which had been long laid aside. But he did not suffer any one to be obliged by an accuser to dismount while he passed in review, as had formerly been the practice. As for such as were infirm with age, or any way deformed, he allowed them to send their horses before them, coming on foot to answer to their names, when the muster roll was called over soon afterwards. He permitted those who had attained the age of thirty-five years, and desired not to keep their horse any longer, to have the privilege of giving it up.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="39">
<p>With the assistance of ten  senators, he obliged each of the Roman knights to give an account of his life: in regard to those who fell under his displeasure, some were punished; others had a mark of infamy set against their names. The most part he only reprimanded, but not in the same terms. The mildest mode of reproof was by delivering them  tablets,<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="la">Pugillaria</foreign> were a kind of pocket-book, so called, because memorandums were written or impinged by the <foreign lang="la">styli</foreign>, on their waxed surface.

<div2 type="chapter" n="40">
<p>In the election of tribunes of the people, if there was not a sufficient number of senatorian candidates, he nominated others from the equestrian order; granting them the liberty, after the expiration of their office, to continue in whichsoever of the two orders they pleased.
As most of the knights had been much reduced in their estates by the civil wars, and therefore durst not sit to see the public games in the theatre in the seats allotted to their order, for fear of the penalty provided by the law in that case, he enacted, that none were liable to it, who had themselves, or whose parents had ever, possessed a knight's estate.
He took the census of the Roman people street by street: and that the people might not be too often taken from  their business to receive the distribution of corn, it was his intention to deliver tickets three times a year for four months respectively; but at their request, he continued the former regulation, that they should receive their share monthly.
He revived the former law of elections, endeavouring, by various penalties, to suppress the practice of bribery.
Upon the day of election, he distributed to the freedmen of the Fabian and Scaptian tribes, in which he himself was enrolled, a thousand sesterces each, that they might, look for nothing from any of the candidates.
Considering it of extreme importance to preserve the Roman people pure, and untainted with a mixture of foreign or servile blood, he not only bestowed the freedom of the city with a sparing hand, but laid some restriction upon the practice of manumitting slaves.
When Tiberius interceded with him for the freedom of <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> in behalf of a Greek client of his, he wrote to him for answer, "I
shall not grant it, unless he comes himself, and satisfies me that he has just grounds for the application."
And when <placeName key="tgn,2039991">Livia</placeName> begged the freedom of the city for a tributary <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, he refused it, but offered to release him from payment of taxes, saying, " I shall sooner suffer some loss in my exchequer, than that the citizenship of <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> be rendered too common."
Not content with interposing many obstacles to either the partial or complete emancipation of slaves, by quibbles respecting the number, condition and difference of those who were to be manumitted; he likewise enacted that none who had been put in chains or tortured, should ever obtain the freedom of the city in any degree.
He endeavoured also to restore the old habit and dress of the Romans; and upon seeing once, in an assembly of the people, a crowd in grey cloaks,<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="la">Pullatorum</foreign>; dusky, either from their dark colour, or their being soiled. The toga was white, and was the distinguishing costume of the sovereign people of <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, without which, they were not to appear in public; as members of a university are forbidden to do so, without the academical dress, or officers in garrisons out of their regimentals.
</note> he exclaimed with indignation, "See there,
<quote lang="la"><l>Romanos rerum dominos, gentemque togatem.<note anchored="yes"><bibl n="Verg. A. 1.186">Aen. 1.186</bibl></note></l></quote>

<div2 type="chapter" n="41">
<p>He displayed his munificence to all ranks of the people on various occasions.
Moreover, upon his bringing the treasure belonging to the kings of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> into the city, in his Alexandrian triumph, he made money so plentiful, that interest fell, and the price of land rose considerably. And afterwards, as often as large sums of money
came into his possession by means of confiscations, he
would lend it free of interest, for a fixed term, to such as
could give security for the double of what was borrowed.

hundred thousand sesterces, the former standard, he ordered, for the future, to be twelve hundred thousand;
and to those who had not so much, he made good the
deficiency. He often made donations to the people, but
generally of different sums; sometimes four hundred,
sometimes three hundred, or two hundred and fifty sesterces: upon which occasions, he extended his bounty
even to young boys, who before were not used to receive
anything, until they arrived at eleven years of age. In a
scarcity of corn, he would frequently let them have it at
a very low price, or none at all; and doubled the number
of the money tickets.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="42">
<p>But to show that he was a prince who regarded
more the good of his people than their applause, he reprimanded them very severely, upon their complaining
of the scarcity and dearness of wine. "My son-in-law,
Agrippa," he said, "has sufficiently provided for quenching your thirst, by the great plenty of water with which
he has supplied the town." Upon their demanding a gift
which he had promised them, he said, "I am a man of
my word."  But upon their importuning him for one
which he had not promised, he issued a proclamation
upbraiding them for their scandalous impudence; at the same time telling them, "I shall now give you nothing, whatever I may have intended to do." With the same strict firmness, when, upon a promise he had made of a donative, he found many slaves had been emancipated and enrolled amongst the citizens, he declared that no one should receive anything who was not included in the
promise, and he gave the rest less than he had promised them, in order that the amount he had set apart might hold out.  On one occasion, in a season of great scarcity, which it was difficult to remedy, he ordered out of the city the troops of slaves brought for sale, the gladiators belonging to the masters of defence, and all foreigners, excepting physicians and the teachers of the liberal sciences.
Part of the domestic slaves were likewise ordered to be dismissed.
When, at last, plenty was restored, he writes thus: "I was much inclined to abolish for ever the practice of allowing the people corn at the public expense, because they trust so much to it, that they are too lazy to till their lands; but I did not persevere in my design, as I felt sure that the practice would some time or other be revived by some one ambitious of popular favour."
However, he so managed the affair ever afterwards, that as much account was taken of husbandmen and traders, as of the idle populace.<note anchored="yes">It is hardly necessary to direct the careful reader's attention to views of political economy so worthy of an enlightened prince.

<div2 type="chapter" n="43">
<p>In the number, variety, and magnificence of his public spectacles, he surpassed all former example.
Four and-twenty times, he says, he treated the people with games upon his own account, and three-and-twenty times for such magistrates as were either absent, or not able to afford the expense.
The performances took place sometimes in the different streets of the city, and upon several stages, by players in all languages.
The same he did not only in the forum and amphitheatre, but in the circus likewise, and in the septa:
<note anchored="yes">
<foreign lang="la">Septa</foreign> were enclosures made with boards, commonly for the purpose of distributing the people into distinct classes, and erected occasionally, like our hustings.
</note>
and sometimes he exhibited
only the hunting of wild beasts.
He entertained the people with wrestlers in the <placeName key="tgn,7006964">Campus Martius</placeName>, where wooden seats were erected for the purpose; and also with a naval fight, for which he excavated the ground near the <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName>, where there is now the grove of the Caesars.
During these two entertainments he stationed guards in the city lest, by robbers taking advantage of the small number of people left at home, it might be exposed to depredations.
In the circus he exhibited chariot and foot races, and combats with wild beasts, in which the performers were often youths of the highest rank.
His favorite spectacle was the Trojan game, acted by a select number of boys, in parties differing in age and station; thinking that it was a practice both excellent in itself, and sanctioned by ancient usage, that the spirit of the young nobles should be displayed in such exercises.
Caius Nonius Asprenas, who was lamed by a fall in this diversion, he presented with a gold collar, and allowed him and his posterity to bear the surname of Torquati.
But soon afterwards he gave up the exhibition of this game, in consequence of a severe and bitter speech made in the senate by Asinius Pollio, the orator, in which he complained bitterly of the misfortune of /Eserninus, his grandson, who likewise broke his leg in the same diversion.</p>
<p>Sometimes he engaged Roman knights to act upon the stage, or to fight as gladiators; but only before the practice was prohibited by a decree of the senate, Thenceforth, the only exhibition he made of that kind, was that of a young man named Lucius, of a good family, who was not quite two feet in height, and weighed only seventeen pounds, but had a stentorian voice.
In one of his public spectacles, he brought the hostages of the Parthians, the first ever sent to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> from that nation, through the middle of the amphitheatre, and placed them in the second tier of seats above him.
He used likewise, at times when there were no public entertainments, if any thing was brought to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> which was uncommon, and might gratify curiosity, to expose it to public view, in any place whatever; as he did a rhinoceros in the Septa, a tiger upon a stage, and a snake fifty cubits long in the Comitium.
It happened in the Circensian games, which he performed in consequence of a vow, that he was taken ill, and obliged to attend the Thensae,
<note anchored="yes">The <foreign lang="la">Thensa</foreign> was a splendid carriage with four wheels, and four horses, adorned with ivory and silver, in which, at the Circensian games, the images of the gods were drawn in solemn procession from their shrines, to a place in the circus, called the <foreign lang="la">Pulvinar</foreign>, where couches were prepared for their reception. It received its name from thongs (<foreign lang="la">lora tensa</foreign>) stretched before it; and was attended in the procession by persons of the first rank, in their most magnificent apparel. The attendants took delight in putting their hands to the traces: and if a boy happened to let go the thong which he held, it was an indispensable rule that the procession should be renewed.
</note>
reclining on a litter.
Another time, in the games celebrated for the opening of the theatre of Marcellus, the joints of his curule chair happening to give way, he fell on his back.
And in the games exhibited by his grandsons, when the people were in such consternation, by an alarm raised that the theatre was falling, that all his efforts to re-assure them and keep them quiet, failed, he moved from his place, and seated himself in that part of the theatre which was thought to be exposed to most danger.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="44">
<p>He corrected the confusion and disorder with which the spectators took their seats at the public games, after an affront which was offered to a senator at <placeName key="perseus,Puteoli">Puteoli</placeName>, for whom, in a crowded theatre, no one would make room.
He therefore procured a decree of the senate, that in all public spectacles of any sort, and in any place whatever, the first tier of benches should be left empty for the accommodation of senators.
He would not even permit the ambassadors of free nations, nor of those which were allies of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, to sit in the orchestra; having found that some manumitted slaves had been sent under that character.
He separated the soldiery from the rest of the people, and assigned to married plebeians their particular rows of seats.
To the boys he assigned their own benches, and to their tutors the seats which were nearest it; ordering that none clothed in black should sit in the centre of the circle.<note anchored="yes">The <foreign lang="la">Cavea</foreign> was the name of the whole of that part of the theatre
where the spectators sat. The foremost rows were called <foreign lang="la">cavea prima</foreign>,
or <foreign lang="la">ima</foreign>; the last, <foreign lang="la">cavea ultima</foreign>, or <foreign lang="la">summa</foreign>; and the middle, <foreign lang="la">cavea media</foreign>.
</note>
Nor would he allow any women to witness the combats of the gladiators, except from the upper part of the theatre, although they formerly used to take their places promiscuously with the rest of the spectators.
To the vestal virgins he granted seats in the theatre, reserved for them only, opposite the praetor's bench.
He excluded however, the whole female sex from seeing the wrestlers: so that in the games which he exhibited upon his accession to the office of high-priest, he deferred producing a pair of combatants which the people called for, until the next morning; and intimated by proclamation, "his pleasure that no woman should appear in the theatre before five o'clock."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="45">
<p>He generally viewed the Circensian games himself from the upper rooms of the houses of his friends or freedmen; sometimes from the place appointed for the statues of the gods, and sitting in company with his wife and children.
He occasionally absented himself from the spectacles for several hours, and sometimes for whole days; but not without first making an apology, and appointing substitutes to preside in his stead.
When present, he never attended to anything else; either to avoid the reflections which he used to say were commonly made upon his father, Caesar, for perusing letters and memorials, and making rescripts during the spectacles; or from the real pleasure he took in attending those exhibitions; of which he made no secret, he often candidly owning it This he manifested frequently by presenting honorary crowns and handsome rewards to the best performers, in the games exhibited by others; and he never was present at any performance of the Greeks, without rewarding the most deserving, according to their merit.
He took particular pleasure in witnessing pugilistic contests, especially those of the Latins, not only between combatants who had been trained scientifically, whom he used often to match with the Greek champions; but even between mobs of the lower classes fighting in streets, and tilting at random, without any knowledge of the art  In short, he honoured with his patronage all sorts of people who contributed in any way to the success of the public entertainments.
He not only maintained, but enlarged, the privileges of the wrestlers.
He prohibited combats of gladiators where no quarter was given.
He deprived the magistrates of the power of correcting the stage-players, which by an ancient law was allowed them at all times, and in all places; restricting their jurisdiction entirely to the time of performance and misdemeanours in the theatres.
He would, however, admit of no abatement, and exacted with the utmost rigour the greatest exertions of the wrestlers and gladiators in their several encounters.
He went so far in restraining the licentiousness of stageplayers, that upon discovering that Stephanio, a performer of the highest class, had a married woman with her hair cropped, and dressed in boy's clothes, to wait upon him at table, he ordered him to be whipped through
all the three theatres, and then banished him.
Hylas, an actor of pantomimes, upon a complaint against him by the praetor, he commanded to be scourged in the court of his own house, which, however, was open to the public.
And Pylades he not only banished from the city, but from <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> also, for pointing with his finger at a spectator by whom he was hissed, and turning the eyes of the audience upon him.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="46">
<p>Having thus regulated the city and its concerns, he augmented the population of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> by planting in it no less than twenty-eight colonies,<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 726</note> and greatly improved it by public works, and a beneficial application of the revenues.
In rights and privileges, he rendered it in a measure equal to the city itself, by inventing a new kind of suffrage, which the principal officers and magistrates of the colonies might take at home, and forward under seal to the city, against the time of the elections.
To increase the number of persons of condition, and of children among the lower ranks, he granted the petitions of all those who requested the honour of doing military service on horseback as knights, provided their demands were seconded by the recommendation of the town in which they lived; and when he visited the several districts of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, he distributed a thousand sesterces a head to such of the lower class as presented him with sons or daughters.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="47">
<p>The more important provinces, which could not with ease or safety be entrusted to the government of annual magistrates, he reserved for his own administration: the rest he distributed by lot amongst the proconsuls; but sometimes he made exchanges, and frequently visited most of both kinds in person.
Some cities
in alliance with <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, but which by their great licentiousness were hastening to ruin, he deprived of their independence.
Others, which were much in debt, he relieved, and rebuilt such as had been destroyed by earthquakes.
To those that could produce any instance of their having deserved well of the Roman people, he presented the freedom of <placeName key="tgn,7003080">Latium</placeName>, or even that of the City.
There is not, I believe, a province, except <placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7003121">Sardinia</placeName>, which he did not visit.
After forcing Sextus Pompeius to take refuge in those provinces, he was indeed preparing to cross over from <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> to them, but was prevented by continual and violent storms, and afterwards there was no occasion or call for such a voyage.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="48">
<p>Kingdoms, of which he had made himself master by the right of conquest, a few only excepted, he either restored to their former possessors,
<note anchored="yes">As in the case of Herod, Joseph. Antiq. Jud. xv. 10.
</note>
or conferred upon aliens.
Between kings in alliance with <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, he encouraged most intimate union; being always ready to promote or favour any proposal of marriage or friendship amongst them; and, indeed, treated them all with the same consideration, as if they were members and parts of the empire.
To such of them as were minors or lunatics he appointed guardians, until they arrived at age, or recovered their senses; and the sons of many of them he brought up and educated with his own.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="49">
<p>With respect to the army, he distributed the legions and auxiliary troops throughout the several provinces.
He stationed a fleet at <placeName key="perseus,Misenum">Misenum</placeName>, and another at <placeName key="tgn,7004935">Ravenna</placeName>, for the protection of the Upper and Lower Seas.<note anchored="yes">The Adriatic and the <placeName key="tgn,2072785">Tuscan</placeName>.</note>  A certain number of the forces were selected, to occupy the posts in the city, and partly for his own
body-guard; but he dismissed the Spanish guard, which he retained about him till the fall of Antony; and also the Germans, whom he had amongst his guards, until the defeat of Varus.
Yet he never permitted a greater force than three cohorts in the city, and had no (praetorian) camps.<note anchored="yes">It was first established by Tiberius. See c. xxxvii.</note> The rest he quartered in the neighbourhood of the nearest towns, in winter and summer camps.
All the troops throughout the empire he reduced to one fixed model with regard to their pay and their pensions; determining these according to their rank in the army, the time they had served, and their private means; so that after their discharge, they might not be tempted by age or necessities to join the agitators for a revolution.
For the purpose of providing a fund always ready to meet their pay and pensions, he instituted a military exchequer, and appropriated new taxes to that object.
In order to obtain the earliest intelligence of what was passing in the provinces, he established posts, consisting at first of young men stationed at moderate distances along the military roads, and afterwards of regular couriers with fast vehicles; which appeared to him the most commodious, because the persons who were the bearers of dispatches, written on the spot, might then be questioned about the business, as occasion occurred.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="50">
<p>In sealing letters-patent, rescripts, or epistles, he at first used the figure of a sphinx, afterwards the head of Alexander the Great and at last his own, engraved by the hand of Dioscorides; which practice was retained by the succeeding emperors.
He was extremely precise in dating his letters, putting down exactly the time of the day or night at which they were dispatched.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="51">
<p>Of his clemency and moderation there are abundant and signal instances.
For, not to enumerate how many and what persons of the adverse party he pardoned, received into favour, and suffered to rise to the highest eminence in the state; he thought it sufficient to punish Junius Novatus and Cassius Patavinus, who were both plebeians, one of them with a fine, and the other with an easy banishment; although the former had published, in the name of young Agrippa, a very scurrilous letter against him, and the other declared openly, at an entertainment where there was a great deal of company, " that he neither wanted inclination nor courage to stab him."
In the trial of Emilius 'Elianus, of <placeName key="tgn,7002817">Cordova</placeName>, when, among other charges exhibited against him, it was particularly insisted upon, that he used to calumniate Caesar, he turned round to the accuser, and said, with an air and tone of passion, "I wish you could make that appear; I shall let ,Elianus know that I have a tongue too, and shall speak sharper of him than he ever did of me."  Nor did he, either then or afterwards, make any farther inquiry into the affair.
And when Tiberius, in a letter, complained of the affront with great earnestness, he returned him an answer in the following terms: "Do not, my dear Tiberius, give way to the ardour of youth in this affair; nor be so indignant that any person should speak ill of me. It is enough, for us, if we can prevent any one from really doing us mischief."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="52">
<p>Although he knew that it had been customary to decree temples in honour of the proconsuls, yet he would not permit them to be erected in any of the provinces, unless in the joint names of himself and <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.
Within the limits of the city, he positively refused any honour of that kind.
He melted down all the silver statues which had been erected to him, and converted the whole into tripods, which he consecrated to the Palatine Apollo.
And when the people importuned him to accept the dictatorship, he bent down on one knee, with his toga thrown over his shoulders, and his breast exposed to view, begging to be excused.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="53">
<p>He always abhorred the title of Lord,<note anchored="yes">Tertullian, in his Apology, c. 34, makes the same remark. The
word seems to have conveyed then, as it does in its theological sense
now, the idea of Divinity, for it is coupled with <foreign lang="la">Deus</foreign>, God:  <quote lang="la">nunquum
se dominum vel deum appellare voluerit.</quote>
</note> as ill-omened and offensive.
And when, in a play, performed at the theatre, at which he was present, these words were introduced, "O just and gracious lord," and the whole company, with joyful acclamations, testified their approbation of them, as applied to him, he instantly put a stop to their indecent flattery, by waving his hand, and frowning sternly, and next day publicly declared his displeasure, in a proclamation.
He never afterwards would suffer himself to be addressed in that manner, even by his own children or grand-children, either in jest or earnest, and forbad them the use of all such complimentary expressions to one another.
He rarely entered any city or town, or departed from it, except in the evening or the night, to avoid giving any person the trouble of complimenting him.
During his consulships, he commonly walked the streets on foot; but at other times, rode in a close carriage.
He admitted to court even plebeians, in common with people of the higher ranks: receiving the petitions of those who approached him with so much affability, that he once jocosely rebuked a man, by telling him, "You present your memorial with as much hesitation as if you were offering money to an elephant."
On senate days, he used to pay his respects to the Conscript Fathers only in the house, addressing them each by name as they sat, without any prompter; and on his departure,
he bade each of them farewell, while they retained their
seats. In the same manner, he maintained with many of
them a constant intercourse of mutual civilities, giving
them his company upon occasions of any particular festivity in their families; until he became advanced in
years, and was incommoded by the crowd at a wedding.
Being informed that Gallus Terrinius, a senator, with
whom he had only a slight acquaintance, had suddenly
lost his sight, and under that privation had resolved to
starve himself to death, he paid him a visit, and by his
consolatory admonitions diverted him from his purpose.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="54">
<p>On his speaking in the senate, he has been told
by one of the members, "I did not understand you," and
by another, "I would contradict you, could I do it with
safety." And sometimes, upon his being so much offended
at the heat with which the debates were conducted in the
senate, as to quit the house in anger, some of the mem-
bers have repeatedly exclaimed: "Surely, the senators
ought to have liberty of speech on matters of govern-
ment." Antistius Labeo, in the election of a new senate,
when each, as he was named, chose another, nominated
Marcus Lepidus, who had formerly been Augustus's ene-
my, and was then in banishment; and being asked by the
latter, "Is there no other person more deserving?" he
replied, "Every man has his own opinion."  Nor was
any one ever molested for his freedom of speech, although
it was carried to the extent of insolence.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="55">
<p>Even when some infamous libels against him were
dispersed in the senate-house, he was neither disturbed,
nor did he give himself much trouble to refute them. He
would not so much as order an inquiry to be made after
the authors; but only proposed, that, for the future, those
who published libels, or lampoons, in a borrowed name,
against any person, should be called to account.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="56">
<p>Being provoked by some petulant jests, which were designed to render him odious, he answered them by a proclamation; and yet he prevented the senate from passing an act, to restrain the liberties which were taken with others in people's wills.
Whenever he attended at the election of magistrates, he went round the tribes, with the candidates of his nomination, and begged the votes of the people in the usual manner.
He likewise gave his own vote in his tribe, as one of the people.
He suffered himself to be summoned as a witness upon trials, and not only to be questioned, but to be cross-examined, with the utmost patience.
In building his Forum, he restricted himself in the site, not presuming to compel the owners of the neighbouring houses to give up their property.
He never recommended his sons to the people, without adding these words.
"If they deserve it."  And upon the audience rising on their entering the theatre, while they were yet minors, and giving them  applause in a standing position, he made it a matter of serious complaint.</p>
<p>He was desirous that his friends should be great and powerful in the state, but have no exclusive privileges, or be exempt from the laws which governed others.
When Asprenas Nonius, an intimate friend of his, was tried upon a charge of administering poison at the instance of Cassius Severus, he consulted the senate for their opinion what was his duty under the circumstances; "For," said he, "I am afraid
lest, if I should stand by him in the cause, I may be supposed to screen a guilty man; and if I do not, to desert and prejudge a friend."
With the unanimous concurrence, therefore, of the senate, he took his seat amongst his advocates for several hours, but without giving him the benefit of speaking to character, as was usual.
He likewise appeared for his clients; as
on behalf of Scutarius, an old soldier of his, who brought an action for slander.
He never relieved any one from prosecution but in a single instance, in the case of a man who had given information of the conspiracy of Muraena; and that he did only by prevailing upon the accuser, in open court, to drop his prosecution.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="57">
<p>How much he was beloved for his worthy conduct in all these respects, it is easy to imagine.
I say nothing of the decrees of the senate in his honour, which may seem to have resulted from compulsion or deference.
The Roman knights voluntarily, and with one accord, always celebrated his birth for two days together; and all ranks of the people yearly, in performance of a vow they had made, threw a piece of money into the Curtian lake,
<note anchored="yes">An inclosure in the middle of the Forum, marking the spot where Curtius leapt into the lake, which had been long since filled up.
</note>
as an offering for his welfare.
They likewise, on the calends [first] of January, presented for his acceptance new-year's gifts in the capitol, though he was not present: with which donations he purchased some costly images of the Gods, which he erected in several streets of the city: as that of Apollo Sandaliarius, Jupiter Tragoedus,
<note anchored="yes">Sandalarium, Tragrxdum; names of streets, in which temples of
these gods stood; as we now say St. Peter, <placeName key="tgn,1050542">Cornhill</placeName>, etc.
</note>
and others.
When his house on the <placeName key="tgn,3000935">Palatine</placeName> hill was accidentally destroyed by fire, the veteran soldiers, the judges, the tribes, and even the people, individually, contributed, according to the ability of each, for rebuilding it; but he would accept only of some small portion out of the several sums collected, and refused to take from any one person more than a single denarius.
Upon his return home from any of the provinces, they attended him not only with joyful acclamations, but with songs.
It is also remarked, that as often as he entered the city, the infliction of punishment was suspended for the time.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="58">
<p>The whole body of the people, upon a sudden impulse, and with unanimous consent, offered him the title of FATHER OF HIS COUNTRY.
It was announced to him first at <placeName key="perseus,Antium">Antium</placeName>, by a deputation from the people, and upon his declining the honour, they repeated their offer on his return to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, in a full theatre, when they were crowned with laurel.
The senate soon afterwards adopted the proposal, not in the way of acclamation or decree, but by commissioning M. Messala, in an unanimous vote, to compliment him with it in the following terms: " With hearty wishes for the happiness and prosperity of yourself and family, Caesar Augustus, (for we think we thus most effectually pray for the lasting welfare of the state), the senate, in agreement with the Roman people, salute you by the title of FATHER OF YOUR COUNTRY."
To this compliment Augustus replied, with tears in his eyes, in these words (for I give them exactly as I have done those of Messala): "Having now arrived at the summit of my wishes, O Conscript Fathers, what else have I to beg of the Immortal Gods, but the continuance of this your affection for me to the last moments of my life?"</p>
<p>To the physician Antonius Musa, who had cured him of a dangerous illness, they erected a statue near that of aEsculapius, by a general subscription.
Some heads of families ordered in their wills, that their heirs should lead victims to the capitol, with a tablet carried before them, and pay their vows, " Because Augustus still survived."
Some Italian cities appointed the day upon which he first visited them, to be thenceforth the beginning of their year.
And most of the provinces, besides erecting temples and altars, instituted games, to be celebrated to his honour, in most towns, every five years.</p>
<p>The kings, his friends and allies, built cities in their respective kingdoms, to which they gave the name of <placeName key="tgn,7001266">Caesarea</placeName>: and all with one consent resolved to finish, at their common expense, the temple of Jupiter Olympius, at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, which had been begun long before, and consecrate it to his Genius.
They frequently also left their kingdoms, laid aside the badges of royalty, and assuming the toga, attended and paid their respects to him daily, in the manner of clients to their patrons: not only at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, but when he was travelling through the provinces.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="59">
<p>Having thus given an account of the manner in which he filled his public offices both civil and military, and his conduct in the government of the empire, both in peace and war; I shall now describe his private and domestic life, his habits at home and among his friends and dependents, and the fortune attending him in those scenes of retirement, from his youth to the day of his death.

He behaved towards them  both with the utmost kindness whilst living, and after their decease paid the highest honours to their memory.</p></div2>

<p>He was contracted when very young to the daughter of Publius Servilius Isauricus; but upon his reconciliation with Antony after their first rupture,

Soon afterwards he took to wife Scribonia, who had before been twice married to men of consular rank,<note anchored="yes">One of them was Scipio, the father of Cornelia, whose death is lamented by Propertius, iv. 12. The other is unknown.</note> and was a mother by one of them.
With her
he likewise parted,<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 715</note> being quite tired out, as he himself writes, with the perverseness of her temper; and immediately took Livia Drusilla, though then pregnant, from her husband Tiberius Nero; and she had never any rival in his love and esteem.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="61">
<p>By Scribonia he had a daughter named <placeName key="tgn,2118772">Julia</placeName>, but no children by <placeName key="tgn,2039991">Livia</placeName>, although extremely desirous of issue.

Agrippa dying also, he for a long time thought of several matches for <placeName key="tgn,2428630">Julia</placeName> in even the equestrian order, and at last resolved upon selecting <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName> for his step-son; and he obliged him to part with his wife at that time pregnant, and who had already brought him a child.
Mark Antony writes, "That he first contracted <placeName key="tgn,2428630">Julia</placeName> to his son, and afterwards to Cotiso, king of Getae,<note anchored="yes">He is mentioned by <placeName key="tgn,2028398">Horace</placeName>:

<div2 type="chapter" n="62">
<p>He had three grandsons by Agrippa and <placeName key="tgn,2428630">Julia</placeName>, namely, Caius, <placeName key="tgn,2023439">Lucius</placeName>, and Agrippa; and two granddaughters, <placeName key="tgn,2024572">Julia</placeName> and Agrippina.

their father, advanced them, while yet very young, to offices in the state, and when they were consuls-elect, sent them to visit the provinces and armies.
In bringing up his daughter and grand-daughters, he accustomed them to domestic employments, and even spinning, and obliged them to speak and act every thing openly before the family, that it might be put down in the diary.
He so strictly prohibited them from all converse with strangers, that he once wrote a letter to Lucius Vinicius, a handsome young man of a good family, in which he told him, "You have not behaved very modestly, in making a visit to my daughter at <placeName key="tgn,7004516">Baiae</placeName>."
He usually instructed his grandsons himself in reading, swimming, and other rudiments of knowledge; and he laboured nothing more than to perfect them in the imitation of his hand-writing.
He never supped but he had them sitting at the foot of his couch; nor ever travelled but with them  in a chariot before him, or riding beside him.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="63">
<p>But in the midst of all his joy and hopes in his numerous and well-regulated family, his fortune failed him.
The two Julias, his daughter and grand-daughter, abandoned themselves to such courses of lewdness and debauchery, that he banished them both.
Caius and <placeName key="tgn,2023439">Lucius</placeName> he lost within the space of eighteen months; the former dying in <placeName key="tgn,7001294">Lycia</placeName>, and the latter at <placeName key="tgn,7008781">Marseilles</placeName>.
His third grandson Agrippa, with his step-son Tiberius, he adopted in the forum, by a law passed for the purpose by the sections;

</note>
but he soon afterwards discarded Agrippa for his coarse and unruly temper, and confined him at <placeName key="tgn,7004648">Surrentum</placeName>.
He bore the death of his relations with more
patience than he did their disgrace; for he was not overwhelmed by the loss of Caius and Lucius; but in the case of his daughter, he stated the facts to the senate in a message read to them by the quaestor, not having the heart to be present himself; indeed, he was so much ashamed of her infamous conduct, that for some time he avoided all company, and had thoughts of putting her to death.
It is certain that when one Phoebe, a freed-woman and confidant of hers, hanged herself about the same time, he said, "I had rather be the father of Phoebe than of Julia."
In her banishment he would not allow her the use of wine, nor any luxury in dress; nor would he suffer her to be waited  upon by any male servant, either freeman or slave, without his permission, and having received an exact account of his age, stature, complexion, and what marks or scars he had about him.
At the end of five years he removed her from the island [where she was confined] to the continent,
<note anchored="yes">She was removed to <placeName key="tgn,7005020">Reggio</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,7007850">Calabria</placeName>.</note>
and treated her with less
severity, but could never be prevailed upon to recall her.
When the Roman people interposed on her behalf several times with much importunity, all the reply he gave
was: "I wish you had all such daughters and wives as
she is." He likewise forbad a child, of which his granddaughter Julia was delivered after sentence had passed
against her, to be either owned as a relation, or brought
up. Agrippa, who was equally intractable, and whose
folly increased every day, he transported to an island,<note anchored="yes">Agrippa was first banished to the little desolate island of <placeName key="perseus,Planasia">Planasia</placeName>, now Pianosa.

the same time an act of the senate for his confinement

<p>He was cautious in forming friendships, but clung to them with great constancy; not only rewarding the virtues and merits of his friends according to their deserts, but bearing likewise with their faults and vices, provided that they were of a venial kind, For amongst all his friends, we scarcely find any who fell into disgrace with him, except Salvidienus Rufus, whom he raised to the consulship, and Cornelius Gallus, whom he made prefect in <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>; both of them men of the lowest extraction. One of these, being engaged in plotting a rebellion, he delivered over to the senate, for condemnation; and the other, on account of his ungrateful and malicious temper, he forbad his house, and his living in any of the provinces. When, however, Gallus, being denounced by his accusers, and sentenced by the senate, was driven to the desperate extremity of laying violent hands upon himself, he commended, indeed, the attachment to his person of those who manifested so much indignation, but he shed tears, and lamented his unhappy condition, "That I alone," said he, " cannot be allowed to resent the misconduct of my friends in such a way only as I would wish." The rest of his friends of all orders flourished during their whole lives, both in power and wealth, in the highest ranks of their several orders, notwithstanding some occassional lapses. For, to say nothing of others, he sometimes complained that Agrippa was hasty, and Maecenas a tattler; the former having thrown up all his employments and retired to <placeName key="tgn,7002672">Mitylene</placeName>, on suspicion of some slight coolness, and from jealousy that Marcellus received greater marks of favour; and the latter having confidentially imparted to his wife Terentia the discovery of Murena's conspiracy.</p>
<p>He likewise expected from his friends, at their deaths as well as during their lives, some proofs of their reciprocal attachment.
For though he was far from coveting their property, and indeed would never accept of any legacy left him by a stranger, yet he pondered in a melancholy mood over their last words; not being able to conceal his chagrin, if in their wills they made but a slight, or no very honourable mention of him, nor his joy, on the other hand, if they expressed a grateful sense of his favours, and a hearty affection for him.
And whatever legacies or shares of their property were left for him by such as were parents, he used to restore to their children, either immediately, or if they were under age, upon the day of their assuming the manly dress, or of their marriage; with interest.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="65">
<p>As a patron and master, his behaviour in general was mild and conciliating; but when occasion required it, he could be severe.
He advanced many of his freedmen to posts of honour and great importance, as Licinus, Enceladus, and others; and when his slave, Cosmus, had reflected bitterly upon him, he resented the injury no further than by putting him in fetters.
When his steward, Diomedes, left him to the mercy of a wild boar, which suddenly attacked them while they were talking together, he considered it rather a cowardice than a breach of duty; and turned an occurrence of no small hazard into a jest, because there was no knavery in his steward's. conduct.
He put to death Proculus, one of his most favourite freedmen, for maintaining a criminal commerce with other men's wives.
He broke the legs of his secretary, Thallus, for taking a bribe of five hundred denarii to discover the contents of one of his letters.
And the tutor and other attendants of his son Caius, having taken advantage of his sickness and death, to give loose to their insolence and rapacity in the province he governed, he caused heavy weights to be tied about their necks, and had them thrown into a river.</p></div2>

<p>In his early youth various aspersions of an infamous character were heaped upon him.
Sextus Pompey reproached him with being an effeminate fellow; and
M. Antony, with earning his adoption from  his uncle by improper means.
Lucius Antony, likewise Mark's brother, charges him with the same.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="67">
<p>That he was guilty of various acts of adultery, is not denied even by his friends; but they allege in excuse for it, that he engaged in those intrigues not from lewdness, but from policy, in order to discover more easily the designs of his enemies, through their wives.
Mark Antony, besides the precipitate marriage of Livia, charges him with taking the wife of a man of consular rank from table, in the presence of her husband, into a bed-chamber, and bringing her again to the entertainment, with her ears very red, and her hair in great disorder: that he had divorced Scribonia, for resenting too freely the excessive influence which one of his mistresses had gained over him: that his friends were employed to pimp for him, and accordingly obliged both matrons and ripe virgins to strip, for a complete examination of their persons, in the same manner as if Thoranius, the dealer in slaves, had them under sale.
And before they came to an open rupture, he writes to him in a familiar manner, thus: "Why are you changed towards me?  Because I lie with a queen?
She is my wife.
Is this a new thing with me, or have I not done so for these nine years? And do you take freedoms with <placeName key="tgn,2078997">Drusilla</placeName> only?

<l>Mercurius, Jovus, Neptunus, Vulcanus, Apollo.</l></quote>
</note>
and at which the guests were dressed in the habit of gods and goddesses, while he personated Apollo himself, afforded subject of much conversation, and was imputed to him not only by Antony in his letters, who likewise names all the parties concerned, but in the following well-known anonymous verses:
<quote lang="la"><l>Cum primum istorum conduxit mensa choragum,</l>
<l>Sexque deos vidit <placeName key="tgn,7010916">Mallia</placeName>, sexque deas</l>

What rendered this supper more obnoxious to public censure, was, that it happened at a time when there was
a great scarcity, and almost a famine, in the city.
The day after, there was a cry current among the people, "that the gods had eaten up all the corn; and that Caesar was indeed Apollo, but Apollo the Tormentor;" under which title that god was worshipped in some quarter of the city.

He was likewise charged with being excessively fond of fine furniture, and Corinthian vessels, as well as with being addicted to gaming.

because it was believed, that he had put some persons upon the list of the proscribed, only to obtain the Corinthian vessels in their possession.

<div2 type="chapter" n="69">
<p>With respect to the charge or imputation of loathsome impurity before-mentioned, he very easily refuted it by the chastity of his life, at the very time when it was made, as well as ever afterwards.
His conduct likewise gave the lie to that of luxurious extravagance in his furniture, when, upon the taking of <placeName key="tgn,7002256">Alexandria</placeName>, he reserved for himself nothing of the royal treasures but a porcelain cup, and soon afterwards melted down all the vessels of gold, even such as were intended for common use. But his amorous propensities never left him, and, as he grew older, as is reported, he was in the habit of debauching young girls, who were procured for him, from all quarters, even by his own wife. To the observations on his gaming, he paid not the smallest regard; but played in public, but purely for his diversion, even when he was advanced in years; and not only in the month of December,
<note anchored="yes">See c. xxxii. and note.</note>
but at other times, and upon all days, whether festivals or not. This evidently appears from a letter under his own hand, in which he says, "I supped, my dear Tiberius, with the same company. We had, besides, Vinicius, and Silvius the father. We gamed at supper like old fellows, both yesterday and to-day. And as any one threw  upon the <foreign lang="la">tali</foreign><note anchored="yes">The Romans, at their feasts, during the intervals of drinking, often

The former had six sides, like the modern dice; the latter, four oblong
sides, for the two ends were not regarded. In playing, they used three
tessera and four tal, which were all put into a box wider below than
above, and being shaken, were thrown out upon the gaming-board or
table.</note>
 aces or sixes, he put down for every talus a denarius; all which was gained by him who threw a Venus."<note anchored="yes">The highest cast was so called.</note>
  In another letter, he says: "We had, my dear Tiberius, a pleasant time of it during the festival of Minerva: for we played every day, and kept the gaming-board warm.  Your brother uttered many exclamations at a desperate run of ill-fortune; but recovering by degrees, and unexpectedly, he in the end
lost not much.
I lost twenty thousand sesterces for my part; but then I was profusely generous in my play, as I commonly am; for had I insisted upon the stakes which I declined, or kept what I gave away, I should have won about fifty thousand.
But this I like better: for it will raise my character for generosity to the skies."
In a letter to his daughter, he writes thus . "I have sent you two hundred and fifty denarii, which I gave to every one of my guests; in case they were inclined at supper to divert themselves with the Tali, or at the game of Even-or-Odd."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="70">
<p>In other matters, it appears that he was moderate in his habits, and free from  suspicion of any kind of vice.
He lived at first near the Roman Forum, above the Ring-maker's Stairs, in a house which had once been occupied by Calvus the orator.
He afterwards moved to the <placeName key="tgn,2565724">Palatine Hill</placeName>, where he resided in a small house<note anchored="yes">Enlarged by <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName> and succeeding emperors.

He continued to use the same bed-chamber, both winter and summer, during forty years:<note anchored="yes">It was usual among the Romans to have separate sets of apartments for summer and winter use, according to their exposure to the sun.</note> for though he was sensible that the city did not agree with his health in the winter, he nevertheless resided constantly in it during that season.
If at any time he wished to be perfectly retired, and secure from interruption, he shut himself up in an apartment at the top of his house, which he called his <placeName key="tgn,7014561">Syracuse</placeName> or

He had a particular aversion to large and sumptuous palaces; and some which had been raised at a vast expense by his grand-daughter, <placeName key="tgn,2118772">Julia</placeName>, he leveled to the ground.
Those of his own, which  were  far from  being  spacious, he adorned, not so much with statues and pictures, as with walks and groves, and things which were curious either for their antiquity or rarity; such as, at <placeName key="tgn,7006855">Capri</placeName>, the huge limbs of sea-monsters and wild beasts, which some affect to call the bones of giants; and also the arms of ancient heroes.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="71">
<p>His frugality in the furniture of his house appears even at this day, from some beds and tables still remaining, most of which are scarcely elegant enough for a private family.
It is reported that he never lay upon a bed, but such as was low, and meanly furnished.
He seldom wore any garment but what was made by the hands of his wife, sister, daughter, and grand-daughters.
His togas
<note anchored="yes">The <placeName key="tgn,2114627">Toga</placeName> was a loose woollen robe, which covered the whole body, close at the bottom, but open at the top down to the girdle, and without sleeves. The right arm was thus at liberty, and the left supported a flap of the toga, which was drawn up, and thrown back over the left shoulder; forming what is called the Sinus, a fold or cavity upon the breast, in which things might be carried, and with which the face or head might be occasionally covered. When a person did any work, he tucked up his toga, and girt it round him. The toga of the rich and noble was finer and larger than that of others; and a new toga was called Pexa. None but Roman citizens were permitted to wear the toga; and banished persons were prohibited the use of it. The colour of the toga was white. The clavus was a purple border, by which the senators, and other orders, with the magistrates, were distinguished; the breadth of the stripe corresponding with their rank.

were neither scanty nor full; and the clavus was neither remarkably broad or narrow.
His shoes were a little higher than common, to make him appear taller than he was.
He had always clothes and shoes, fit to appear in public, ready in his bed-chamber for any sudden occasion.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="72">
<p>At his table which was always plentiful and elegant, he constantly entertained company; but was very scrupulous in the choice of them, both as to rank and character.
Valerius Messala informs us, that he never admitted any freedmen to his table, except Menas, when rewarded with the privilege of citizenship, for betraying Pompey's fleet.
He writes, himself, that he invited to his table a person in whose villa he lodged, and who had formerly been employed by him as a spy.
He often came
late to table, and withdrew early; so that the company began supper before his arrival, and continued at table after his departure.
His entertainments consisted of three entries, or at most of only six.
But if his fare was moderate, his courtesy was extreme.
For those who were silent, or talked in whispers, he encouraged to join in the general conversation; and introduced buffoons and stage players, or even low performers from the circus, and very often itinerant humourists, to enliven the company.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="73">
<p>Festivals and holidays he usually celebrated very expensively, but sometimes only with merriment.
In the Saturnalia, or at any other time when the fancy took him, he distributed to his company clothes, gold and silver; sometimes coins of all sorts, even of the ancient kings of <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> and of foreign nations; sometimes nothing but towels, sponges, rakes, and tweezers, and other things of that kind, with tickets on them, which were enigmatical, and had a double meaning.<note anchored="yes">In which the whole humour of the thing consisted either in the uses to which these articles were applied, or in their names having in Latin a double signification; matters which cannot be explained with any decency.</note>
He used likewise to sell by lot among his guests articles of very unequal value, and pictures with their fronts reversed; and so, by the unknown quality of the lot, disappoint or gratify the expectation of the purchasers.
This sort of traffic went round the whole company, every one being obliged to buy something, and to run the chance of loss or gain with the rest.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="74">
<p>He ate sparingly (for I must not omit even this), and commonly used a plain diet.
He was particularly fond of coarse bread, small fishes, new cheese made of cow's milk,<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="la">Casum bubulum manupressum</foreign>; probably soft cheese, not reduced to solid consistence in the cheese-press.
</note>
and green figs of the sort which bear fruit twice a year.<note anchored="yes">A species of fig tree, known in some places as Adam's fig.  We have gathered them, in those climates, of the latter crop, as late as the month of November.</note>
He did not wait for supper, but took food at any time, and in any place, when he had an appetite.
The following passages relative to this subject, I have transcribed from his letters.
" I ate a little bread and some small dates, in my carriage."
Again. " In returning home from the palace in my litter, I ate an ounce of bread, and a few raisins."
Again.. "No Jew, my dear <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>, ever keeps such strict fast upon the Sabbath,<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="la">Sabbatis jejunium</foreign>. Augustus might have been better informed of the Jewish rites, from his familiarity with <placeName key="tgn,2023148">Herod</placeName> and otlers; for it is certain that their sabbath was not a day of fasting. <placeName key="tgn,2105285">Justin</placeName>, however, fell into the same error: he says, that <placeName key="tgn,2525806">Moses</placeName> appointed the sabbath-day to be kept for ever by the Jews as a fast, in memory of their fasting for seven days in the deserts of <placeName key="tgn,1012700">Arabia</placeName>, xxxvi. 2. 14. But we find that there was a weekly fast among the Jews, which is perhaps what is here meant; the <foreign lang="la">Sabbatis Jejunium</foreign> being equivalent to the
<foreign lang="greek">nhsteu/w di/s tou= sabba/tou</foreign>, 'I fast twice in the week' of the Pharisee, in <bibl n="Luke 18.12">St. Luke xviii. 12.</bibl>
</note>
as I have to-day; for while in the bath, and after the first hour of the night, I only ate two biscuits, before I began to be rubbed with  oil."
From  this great indifference about his diet, he sometimes supped by himself, before his company began, or after they had finished, and would not touch a morsel at table with his guests.</p></div2>

<p>He was by nature extremely sparing in the use of wine.
Cornelius Nepos says, that he used to drink only three times at supper in the camp of <placeName key="tgn,7009565">Modena</placeName>; and when he indulged himself the most, he never exceeded a pint; or if he did his stomach rejected it. Of all wines, he gave the preference to the Rhaetian,

</note>
but scarcely ever drank any in the day-time.
Instead of drinking, he used to take a piece of bread dipped in cold water, or a slice of cucumber, or some leaves of lettuce, or a green, sharp, juicy apple.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="76">
<p>After a slight repast at noon, he used to seek repose,<note anchored="yes">A custom in all warm countries; the siesta of the Italians in later times.</note> dressed as he was, and with his shoes on, his feet covered, and his hand held before his eyes.
After supper he commonly withdrew to his study, a small closet, where he sat late, until he had put down in his diary all or most of the remaining transactions of the day, which he had not before registered.
He would then go to bed, but never slept above seven hours at most, and that not without interruption; for he would wake three or four times during that time.
If he could not again fall asleep, as sometimes happened, he called for some one to read or tell stories to him, until he became drowsy, and then his sleep was usually protracted till after day-break.
He never liked to lie awake in the dark, without somebody to sit by him.
Very early rising was apt to disagree with him.
On which account, if he was obliged to rise betimes, for any civil or religious functions, in order to guard as much as possible against the inconvenience resulting from it, he used to lodge in some apartment near the spot, belonging to any of his attendants.
If at any time a fit of drowsiness seized him in passing along the streets, his litter was set down while he snatched a few moments' sleep.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="77">
<p>In person he was handsome and graceful through every period of his life.
But he was negligent in his dress; and so careless about dressing his hair, that he usually had it done in great haste, by several barbers at a time.
His beard he sometimes clipped, and sometimes shaved; and either read or wrote during the operation.
His countenance, either when discoursing or silent, was so calm and serene, that a <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> of the first rank declared amongst his friends, that he was so softened by it, as to be restrained from throwing him down a precipice, in his passage over the <placeName key="tgn,2066659">Alps</placeName>, when he had been admitted to approach him, under pretence of conferring with him.
His eyes were bright and piercing; and he was willing it should be thought that there was something of a divine vigour in them.
He was likewise not a little pleased to see people, upon his looking stedfastly at them, lower their countenances, as if the sun shone in their eyes.
But in his old age, he saw very imperfectly with his left eye.
His teeth were thin set, small and scaly, his hair a little curled, and inclining to a yellow colour.
His eye-brows met; his ears were small, and he had an aquiline nose.
His complexion was betwixt brown and fair; his stature but low; though Julius Marathus, his freedman, says he was five feet and nine inches in height.
This, however, was so much concealed by the just proportion of his limbs, that it was only perceivable upon comparison with some taller person standing by him.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="78">
<p>He is said to have been born with many spots upon his breast and belly, answering to the figure, order, and number of the stars in the constellation of the Bear.
He had besides several callosities resembling scars, occasioned by an itching in his body, and the constant and violent use of the strigil<note anchored="yes">The strigil was used in the baths for scraping the body when in a state of perspiration.
It was sometimes made of gold or silver, and not unlike in form the instrument used by grooms about horses when profusely sweating or splashed with mud.
</note> in being rubbed.
He had a weakness in his left hip, thigh, and leg, insomuch that he often halted on that side; but he received much benefit from  the use of sand and reeds.
He likewise
sometimes found the fore-finger of his right hand so weak, that when it was benumbed and contracted with cold, to use it in writing, he was obliged to have recourse to a circular piece of horn.
He had occasionally a complaint in the bladder; but upon voiding some stones in his urine, he was relieved from that pain.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="79">
<p>During the whole course of his life, he suffered, at times, dangerous fits of sickness, especially after the conquest of <placeName key="tgn,7002760">Cantabria</placeName>; when his liver being injured by a defluxion upon it, he was reduced to such a condition, that he was obliged to undergo a desperate and doubtful method of cure: for warm applications having no effect, Antonius Musa<note anchored="yes">His physician, mentioned c. lviii.</note>
directed the use of those which were cold.
He was likewise subject to fits of sickness at stated times every year; for about his birth-day<note anchored="yes">September 21st, a sickly season at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.</note>
 he was commonly a little indisposed.
In the beginning of spring, he was attacked with an inflation of the midriff; and when the wind was southerly, with a cold in his head.
By all these complaints, his constitution was so shattered, that he could not easily bear either heat or cold.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="80">
<p>In the winter, he was protected against the inclemency of the weather by a thick toga, four tunics, a shirt, a flannel stomacher, and swathings upon his legs and thighs.
<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="la">Feminalibus et ibiaibus</foreign>: Neither the ancient Romans or the Greeks wore breeches, trews, or trowsers, which they despised as barbarian articles of dress. The coverings here mentioned were swathings for the legs and thighs, used mostly in cases of sickness or infirmity, and when otherwise worn, reckoned effeminate. But soon after the Romans became acquainted with the German and Celtic nations, the habit of covering the lower extremities, barbarous as it had been held, was geerally adopted.</note>
In summer, he lay with the doors of his bedchamber open, and frequently in a piazza, refreshed by a
bubbling fountain, and a person standing by to fan him. He could not bear even the winter's sun; and at home, never walked in the open air without a broad-brimmed hat on his head. He usually travelled in a litter, and by night; and so slow, that he was two days in going to <placeName key="perseus,Praeneste">Praeneste</placeName> or <placeName key="perseus,Tibur">Tibur</placeName>. And if he could go to any place by sea, he preferred that mode of travelling. He carefully nourished his health against his many infirmities, avoiding chiefly the free use of the bath; but he was often rubbed with oil, and sweated in a stove; after which he was washed with tepid water, warmed either by a fire, or by being exposed to the heat of the sun.

<div2 type="chapter" n="81">
<p>As soon as the civil wars were ended, he gave up riding and other military exercises in the <placeName key="tgn,7006964">Campus Martius</placeName>, and took to playing at ball, or foot-ball; but soon afterwards used no other exercise than that of going abroad in his litter, or walking. Towards the end of his walk, he would run leaping, wrapped up in a short cloak or cape. For amusement, he would sometimes angle, or play with dice, pebbles, or nuts, with little boys, collected from various countries, and particularly Moors and Syrians, for their beauty or amusing talk. But dwarfs, and such as were in any way deformed, he held in abhorrence, as lusus natura (nature's abortions), and of evil omen.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="82">
<p>From  early youth he devoted himself with great diligence and application to the study of eloquence, and the other liberal arts.
In the war of <placeName key="tgn,7009565">Modena</placeName>, notwithstanding the weighty affairs in which he was engaged, he is said to have read, written, and declaimed every day.
He never addressed the senate, the people, or the army, but in a premeditated speech, though he did not want the talent of speaking extempore on the spur of the occasion.
And lest his memory should fail him, as well as to prevent the loss of time in getting up his speeches, it was his general practice to recite them.
In his intercourse with individuals, and even with his wife Livia, upon subjects of importance he wrote on his tablets all he wished to express, lest, if he spoke extempore, he should say more or less than was proper.
He delivered himself in a sweet and peculiar tone, in which he was diligently instructed by a master of elocution.
But when he had a cold, he sometimes employed a herald to deliver his speeches to the people.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="83">
<p>He composed many tracts in prose on various subjects, some of which he read occasionally in the circle of his friends, as to an auditory.
Among these was his "Rescript to Brutus respecting <placeName key="tgn,2068381">Cato</placeName>."
Most of the pages he read himself, although he was advanced in years, but becoming fatigued, he gave the rest to Tiberius to finish.
He likewise read over to his friends his "Exhortations to Philosophy," and the "History of his own Life," which he continued in thirteen books, as far as the Cantabrian war, but no farther.
He likewise made some attempts at poetry.
There is extant one book written by him in hexameter verse, of which both the subject and title is "<placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>."
There is also a book of Epigrams, no larger than the last, which he composed almost entirely while he was in the bath.
These are all his poetical compositions: for though he begun a tragedy with great zest, becoming dissatisfied with the style, he obliterated the whole; and his friends saying to him, "What is your Ajax  doing?" he answered, "My Ajax met with a sponge."<note anchored="yes">
<foreign lang="la">In spongam incubuisse</foreign>, literally has fallen upon a sponge, as Ajax is said to have perished by falling on his own sword.

<div2 type="chapter" n="84">
<p>He cultivated a style which was neat and chaste, avoiding frivolous or harsh language, as well as obsolete words, which he calls disgusting.
His chief object was to deliver his thoughts with all possible perspicuity.
To attain this end, and that he might nowhere perplex, or retard the reader or hearer, he made no scruple to add prepositions to his verbs, or to repeat the same conjunction several times; which, when omitted, occasion some little obscurity, but give a grace to the style.
Those who used affected language, or adopted obsolete words, he despised, as equally faulty, though in different ways.
He sometimes indulged himself in jesting, particularly with his friend Maecenas, whom he rallied upon all occasions for his fine phrases,<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">murobrexei=s</foreign>. Suetonius often preserves expressive Greek phrases
which Augustus was in the habit of using. This compound word means,
literally, myrrh-scented, perfumed.
</note>
and bantered by imitating his way of talking.
Nor did he spare Tiberius, who was fond of obsolete and far-fetched expressions.
He charges Mark Antony with insanity, writing rather to make men stare, than to be understood; and by way of sarcasm upon his depraved and fickle taste in the choice of words, he writes to him  thus: "And are you yet in doubt, whether Cimber Annius or Veranius Flaccus be more proper for your imitation ? Whether you will adopt words which Sallustius Crispus has borrowed from the
Origines' of Cato?  Or do you think that the verbose
empty bombast of Asiatic orators is fit to be transfused into our language ?" And in a letter where he commends the talent of his grand-daughter, Agrippina, he says, "But you must be particularly careful, both in writing and speaking, to avoid affectation."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="85">
<p>In ordinary conversation, he made use of several peculiar expressions, as appears from letters in his own hand-writing; in which, now and then, when he means to intimate that some persons would never pay their debts, he says, "They will pay at the Greek Calends."
And when he advised patience in the present posture of affairs, he would say, "Let us be content with our Cato."
To describe anything in haste, he said, "It was sooner done than asparagus is cooked."
He constantly puts <foreign lang="la">baceolus</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">stultus</foreign>, <foreign lang="la">pullejaceus</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">pullus</foreign>, <foreign lang="la">vacerrosus</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">cerritus</foreign>, <foreign lang="la">vapide se habere</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">male</foreign>, and <foreign lang="la">betizare</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">languere</foreign>, which is commonly called <foreign lang="la">lachanizare.</foreign>
Likewise <foreign lang="la">simus</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">sumus</foreign>, <foreign lang="la">domos</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">domus</foreign> in the genitive singular.
<note anchored="yes">These are variations of language of small importance, which cam only be understood in the original language.
</note>
With respect to the last two peculiarities, lest any person should imagine that they were only slips of his pen, and not customary with him, he never varies.
I have likewise remarked this singularity in his hand-writing: he never divides his words, so as to carry the letters which cannot be inserted at the end of a line to the next, but puts them below the other, enclosed by a bracket.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="86">
<p>He did not adhere strictly to orthography as laid down by the grammarians, but seems to have been of the opinion of those who think, that we ought to write as we speak; for as to his changing and omitting not only letters but whole syllables, it is a vulgar mistake.
Nor
should I have taken notice of it, but that it appears strange to me, that any person should have told us, that he sent a successor to a consular lieutenant of a province, as an ignorant, illiterate fellow, upon his observing that he had written <foreign lang="la">ixi</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">ipsi.</foreign>
When he had occasion to write in cypher, he put <term>b</term> for <term>a</term>, <term>c</term> for <term>b</term>, and so forth; and instead of <term>z</term>, <term>aa</term>.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="87">
<p>He was no less fond of the Greek literature, in which he made considerable proficiency; having had Apollodorus of <placeName key="tgn,7016140">Pergamus</placeName>, for his master in rhetoric; whom.
though much advanced in years, he took with him from The City, when he was himself very young, to <placeName key="perseus,Apollonia">Apollonia</placeName>.</p>
<p>Afterwards, being instructed in philology by Sephaerus, he received into his family Areus the philosopher, and his sons Dionysius and Nicanor; but he never could speak the Greek tongue readily, nor ever ventured to compose in it. For if there was occasion for him to deliver his sentiments in that language, he always expressed what he had to say in Latin, and gave it another to translate.
He was evidently not unacquainted with the poetry of the Greeks, and had a great taste for the ancient comedy, which he often brought upon-the stage, in his public spectacles.
In reading the Greek and Latin authors, he paid particular attention to precepts and examples which might be useful in public or private life.
Those he used to extract verbatim, and gave to his domestics, or send to the commanders of the armies, the governors of, the provinces, or the magistrates of the city, when any of them seemed to stand in need of admonition.
He likewise read whole books to the senate, and frequently made them known to the people by his edicts; such as the orations of Quintus Metellus "for the Encouragement of Marriage," and those of Rutilius
"On the Style of Building;"
<note anchored="yes">It may create a smile to hear that, to prevent danger to the public, Augustus decreed that no new buildings erected in a public thoroughfare should exceed in height seventy feet. Trajan reduced it to sixty.</note>
to show the people that he was not the first who had promoted those objects, but that the ancients likewise had thought them worthy their attention.
He patronized the men of genius of that age in every possible way.
He would hear them read their works with a great deal of patience and good nature; and not only poetry<note anchored="yes">Virgil is said to have recited before him the whole of the second, fourth, and sixth books of the <title>Aeneid</title>; and Octavia, being present, when the poet came to the passage referring to her son, commencing, <quote lang="la">"Tu Marcellus eris,"</quote> was so much affected that she was carried out fainting.</note>
and history, but orations and dialogues.
He was displeased, however, that anything should be written upon himself, except in a grave manner, and by men of the most eminent abilities: and he enjoined the praetors not to suffer his name to be made too common in the contests amongst orators and poets in the theatres.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="88">
<p>We have the following account of him respecting his belief in omens and such like.
He had so great a dread of thunder and lightning that he always carried about him a seal's skin, by way of preservation.

<p>He neither slighted his own dreams nor those of other people relating to himself.
At the battle of <placeName key="tgn,7010789">Philippi</placeName>, although he had resolved not to stir out of his tent, on account of his being indisposed, yet, being warned
by a dream of one of his friends, he changed his mind; and well it was that he did so, for in the enemy's attack, his couch was pierced and cut to pieces, on the supposition of his being in it. He had many frivolous and frightful dreams during the spring; but in the other parts of the year, they were less frequent and more significative.
Upon his frequently visiting a temple near the Capitol, which he had dedicated to Jupiter Tonans, he dreamt that Jupiter Capitolinus complained that his worshippers were taken from him, and that upon this he replied, he had only given him The Thunderer for his porter.
<note anchored="yes">Perhaps the point of the reply lay in the temple of Jupiter Tonans being placed at the approach to the Capitol from the Forum? See c. xxix.

<p>Some signs and omens he regarded as infallible.
If in the morning his shoe was put on wrong, the left instead of the right, that boded some disaster.

He was much affected likewise with any thing out of the common course of nature.

<p>Since we are upon this subject, it may not be improper to give an account of the omens, before and at his birth, as well as afterwards, which gave hopes of his future greatness, and the good fortune that constantly attended him.
A part of the wall of <placeName key="tgn,7009108">Velletri</placeName> having in former times been struck with thunder, the response of the soothsayers was, that a native of that town would some time or other arrive at supreme power; relying on which prediction, the Velletrians both then, and several times afterwards, made war upon the Roman people, to their own ruin.
At last it appeared by the event, that the omen had portended the elevation of Augustus.</p>
<p>Julius Marathus informs us, that a few months before his birth, there happened at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> a prodigy, by which was signified that Nature was in travail with a king for the Roman people; and that the senate, in alarm, came to the resolution that no child born that year should be brought up; but that those amongst them, whose wives were pregnant, to secure to themselves a chance of that dignity, took care that the decree of the senate should not be registered in the treasury.</p>

 that Atia, upon attending at midnight a religious
solemnity in honour of Apollo, when the rest of the matrons retired home, fell asleep on her couch in the temple, and that a serpent immediately crept to her, and soon after withdrew.
She awaking upon it, purified herself, as usual after the embraces of her husband; and instantly there appeared upon her body a mark in the form of a serpent, which she never after could efface, and which obliged her, during the subsequent part of her life, to decline the use of the public baths.
Augustus, it was added, was born in the tenth month after, and for that reason was thought to be the son of Apollo.
The same Atia, before her delivery, dreamed that her bowels stretched to the stars, and expanded through the whole circuit of heaven and earth.
His father Octavius, likewise, dreamt that a sun-beam issued from his wife's womb.</p>
<p>Upon the day he was born, the senate being engaged in a debate on Catiline's conspiracy, and Octavius, in consequence of his wife's being in childbirth, coming late into the house, it is a well-known fact, that Publius Nigidius, upon hearing the occasion of his coming so late, and the hour of his wife's delivery, declared that the world had got a master.
Afterwards, when Octavius, upon marching with his army through the deserts of <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>, consulted the oracle in the grove of father Bacchus, with barbarous rites, concerning his son, he received from the priests an answer to the same purpose; because, when they loured wine upon the altar, there burst out so prodigious a flame, that it ascended above the roof of the temple, and reached up to the heavens; a circumstance which had never happened to any one but Alexander the Great, upon his sacrificing at the same altars.
And the next night he dreamt that he saw his son under more than human appearance, with thunder and a sceptre, and the other insignia of <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName>, Optimus, Maximus, having on his head a radiant crown, mounted upon a chariot decked with laurel, and drawn by six pair of milk-white horses.</p>
<p>Whilst he was yet an infant, as Caius Drusus relates, being laid in his cradle by his nurse, and in a low place, the next day he was not to be found, and after he had been sought for a long time, he was at last'discovered upon a lofty tower, lying with his face towards the rising sun.<note anchored="yes"><placeName key="tgn,7009108">Velletri</placeName> stands on very high ground, commanding extensive views of the Pontine marshes and the sea.</note> When he first began to speak, he ordered the frogs that happened to make a troublesome noise, upon an estate belonging to the family near the town, to be silent; and there goes a report that frogs never croaked there since that time.

the least acquaintance, and looking at him with admiration, he said he was extremely like the boy he had seen in his dream.
Some give a different account of Catulus's first dream, namely, that <placeName key="tgn,2019952">Jupiter</placeName>, upon several noble lads requesting of him that they might have a guardian, had pointed to one amongst them, to whom they were to prefer their requests; and putting his fingers to the boy's mouth to kiss, he afterwards applied them to his own.</p>
<p>Marcus Cicero, as he was attending Caius Caesar to the Capitol, happened to be telling some of his friends a dream which he had the preceding night, in which he saw a comely youth, let down from heaven by a golden chain, who stood at the door of the Capitol, and had a whip put into his hands by Jupiter. And immediately upon sight of Augustus, who had been sent for by his uncle Caesar to the sacrifice, and was as yet perfectly unknown to most of the company, he affirmed that it was the very boy he had seen in his dream. When he assumed the manly toga, his senatorian tunic becoming loose in the seam on each side, fell at his feet. Some would have this to forbode, that the order, of which that was the badge of distinction, would some time or other be subject to him.</p>

<p>In his retirement at <placeName key="tgn,7016987">Apollonia</placeName>, he went with his friend Agrippa to visit Theogenes, the astrologer, in his gallery on the roof.
Agrippa, who first consulted the fates, having great and almost incredible fortunes predicted of him, Augustus did not choose to make known his nativity, and persisted for some time in the refusal, from a mixture of shame and fear, lest his fortunes should be predicted as inferior to those of Agrippa.
Being persuaded, however, after much importunity, to declare it, Theogenes started up from his seat, and paid him adoration.
Not long afterwards, Augustus was so confident of the greatness of his destiny, that he published his horoscope, and struck a silver coin, bearing upon it the sign of Capricorn, under the influence of which he was born.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="93">
<p>After the death of Caesar, upon his return from <placeName key="tgn,7016987">Apollonia</placeName>, as he was entering the city, on a sudden, in a clear and bright sky, a circle resembling the rainbow surrounded the body of the sun; and, immediately afterwards, the tomb of <placeName key="tgn,2118772">Julia</placeName>, Caesar's daughter, was struck by lightning.
In his first consulship, whilst he was observing the auguries, twelve vultures presented themselves, as they had done to Romulus.
And when he offered sacrifice, the livers of all the victims were folded inward in the lower part; a circumstance which was regarded by those present, who had skill in things of that nature, as an indubitable prognostic of great and wonderful fortune.</p></div2>

<p>He certainly had a presentiment of the issue of all his wars.
When the troops of the Triumviri were collected about Bolognia, an eagle, which sat upon his tent, and was attacked by two crows, beat them both, and struck them to the ground, in the view of the whole army; who thence inferred that discord would arise between the three colleagues, which would be attended with the like event: and it accordingly happened.
At <placeName key="tgn,7010789">Philippi</placeName>, he was assured of success by a Thessalian, upon the authority, as
he pretended, of the Divine Casar himself; who had appeared to him while he was travelling in a bye-road.
At <placeName key="tgn,7000526">Perugia</placeName>, the sacrifice not presenting any favourable intimations, but the contrary, he ordered fresh victims; the enemy, however, carrying off the sacred things in a sudden sally, it was agreed amongst the augurs, that all the dangers and misfortunes which had threatened the sacrificer, would fall upon the heads of those who had got possession of the entrails.
And, accordingly, so it happened. The day before the sea-fight near <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, as he was walking upon the shore, a fish leaped out of the sea, and laid itself at his feet.
At <placeName key="tgn,7010713">Actium</placeName>, while he was going down to his fleet to engage the enemy, he was met by an ass with a fellow driving it. The name of the man was Eutychus, and that of the animal, Nichon.

<p>His death, of which I shall now speak, and his subsequent deification, were intimated by divers manifest prodigies.
As he was finishing the census amidst a great crowd of people in the <placeName key="tgn,7006964">Campus Martius</placeName>, an eagle hovered round him several times, and then directed its course to a neighbouring temple, where it settled upon the name of Agrippa, and at the first letter.
Upon observing this, he ordered his colleague Tiberius to put up the vows, which it is usual to make on such occasions, for the succeeding Lustrum.
For he declared he would not meddle with what it was probable he should never accomplish, though the tables were ready drawn for it. About the same time, the first letter of his name, in an inscription upon one of his statues, was struck out by lightning; which was interpreted as a presage that he would live only a hundred days longer, the letter C denoting that number; and that he would be placed amongst the Gods, as Aesar, which is the remaining part of the word Caesar, signifies, in the Tuscan language, a God.

In a word, he indulged himself in all the ways of amusement he could contrive. He called an island near <placeName key="tgn,7006855">Capri</placeName>, <foreign lang="greek">*)aprago/polis</foreign>, "The City of the Do-littles," from the indolent life which several of his party led there.

Then turning to Thrasyllus, a companion of Tiberius, who reclined on the other side of the table, he asked him, who knew nothing about the matter, what poet he thought was the author of that verse; and on his hesitating to reply, he added another:

During the intervals, the body lay in some basilica, or great temple, of each town.
At Bovillae it was met by the Equestrian Order, who carried it to the city, and deposited it in the vestibule of his own house.
The senate proceeded with so much zeal in the arrangement of his funeral, and paying honour to his memory,
that amongst several other proposals, some were for having the funeral procession made through the triumphal gate, preceded by the image of Victory which is in the senate-house, and the children of highest rank of both sexes singing the funeral dirge. Others proposed, that on the day of the funeral, they should lay aside their gold rings, and wear rings of iron; and others, that his bones should be collected by the priests of the principal colleges. One likewise proposed to transfer the name of August to September, because he was born in the latter, but died in the former. Another moved, that the whole period of time, from his birth to his death, should be called the Augustan age, and be inserted in the calendar under that title. But at last it was judged proper to be moderate in the honours paid to his memory.  Two funeral orations were pronounced in his praise, one before the temple of <placeName key="tgn,2008628">Julius</placeName>, by <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>; and the other before the rostra, under the old shops, by Drusus, Tiberius's son.

For the rest he ordered different times of payment.
In some of his bequests he went as far as twenty thousand sesterces, for the payment of which he allowed a twelvemonth; alleging for this procrastination the scantiness of his estate; and declaring that not more than a hundred

<head>Remarks on Augustus</head>
<p>OCTAVIUS Caesar, afterwards Augustus, had now attained to the same
position in the state which had formerly been occupied by <placeName key="tgn,2008628">Julius</placeName> Caesar;
and though he entered upon it by violence, he continued to enjoy it
through life with almost uninterrupted tranquillity. By the long duration of the late civil war, with its concomitant train of public calami-
ties, the minds of men were become less averse to the prospect of an
absolute government; at the same time that the new emperor, naturally
prudent and politic, had learned from the fate of Julius the art of preserving supreme power, without arrogating to himself any invidious
mark of distinction. He affected to decline public honours, disclaimed
every idea of personal superiority, and in all his behaviour displayed
a degree of moderation which prognosticated the most happy effects,
in restoring peace and prosperity to the harassed empire. The tenor
of his future conduct was suitable to this auspicious commencement.
While he endeavoured to conciliate the affections of the people by lending money to those who stood in need of it, at low interest, or without
any at all, and by the exhibition of public shows, of which the Romans
were remarkably fond; he was attentive to the preservation of a becoming dignity in the government, and to the correction of morals.
The senate, which, in the time of Sylla, had increased to upwards of
four hundred, and, during the civil war, to a thousand, members, by
the admission of improper persons, he reduced to six hundred; and
being invested with the ancient office of censor, which had for some
time been disused, he exercised an arbitrary but legal authority over the
conduct of every rank in the state; by which he could degrade senators and knights, and inflict upon all citizens an ignominious sentence
for any immoral or indecent behaviour. But nothing contributed more
to render the new form of government acceptable to the people, than
the frequent distribution of corn, and sometimes largesses, amongst the
commonalty: for an occasional scarcity of provisions had always been
the chief cause of discontents and tumults in the capital. To the interests of the army he likewise paid particular attention. It was by the
assistance of the legions that he had risen to power; and they were the
men who, in the last resort, if such an emergency should ever occur,
could alone enable him to preserve it.</p>
<p>History relates, that after the overthrow of Antony, Augustus held a
consultation with Agrippa and Maecenas about restoring the republican
form of government; when Agrippa gave his opinion in favour of that
measure, and Maecenas opposed it. The object of this consultation, in
respect to its future consequences on society, is perhaps the most important ever agitated in any cabinet, and required, for the mature discussion of it, the whole collective wisdom of the ablest men in the empire.
But this was a resource which could scarcely be adopted, either with security to the public quiet, or with unbiassed judgment in the determination of the question.
The bare agitation of such a point would have excited immediate and strong anxiety for its final result; while the friends of a republican government, who were still far more numerous than those of the other party, would have strained every nerve to procure a determination in their own favour; and the pretorian guards, the surest protection of Augustus, finding their situation rendered precarious by such an unexpected occurrence, would have readily listened to the secret propositions and intrigues of the republi cans for securing their acquiescence to the decision on the popular side.
If, when the subject came into debate, Augustus should be sincere in the declaration to abide by the resolution of the council, it is beyond all doubt, that the restoration of a republican governmeni would have been voted by a great majority of the assembly.
If, on the contrary, he should not be sincere, which is the more probable supposition, and should incur the suspicion of practising secretly with members for a decision according to his wish, he would have rendered himself obnoxious to the public odium, and given rise to discontents which might have endangered his future security.</p>
<p>But to submit this important question to the free and unbiassed docision of a numerous assembly, it is probable, neither suited the inclination of Augustus, nor perhaps, in his opinion, consisted with his personal safety.
With a view to the attainment of unconstitutional power, he had formerly deserted the cause of the republic when its affairs were in a prosperous situation; and now, when his end was accomplished, there could be little ground to expect, that he should voluntarily relinquish the prize for which he had spilt the best blood of <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, and contended for so many years.
Ever since the final defeat of Antony in the battle of <placeName key="tgn,7010713">Actium</placeName>, he had governed the Roman state with uncontrolled authority; and though there is in the nature of unlimited power an intoxicating quality, injurious both to public and private virtue, yet all history contradicts the supposition of its being endued with any which is unpalatable to the general taste of mankind.</p>
<p>There were two chief motives by which Augustus would naturally be influenced in a deliberation on this important subject; namely, the love of power, and the personal danger which he might incur from relinquishing it. Either of these motives might have been a sufficient in
ducement for retaining his authority; but when they both concurred, as they seem to have done upon this occasion, their united force was irresistible.
The argument, so far as relates to the love of power, rests upon a ground, concerning the solidity of which, little doubt can be entertained: but it may be proper to inquire, in a few words, into the foundation of that personal danger which he dreaded to incur, on returning to the station of a private citizen.</p>
<p>Augustus, as has been already observed, had formerly sided with the party which had attempted to restore public liberty after the death of Julius Caesar: but he afterwards abandoned the popular cause, and joined in the ambitious plans of Antony and Lepidus to usurp amongst themselves the entire dominion of the state.
By this change of conduct, he turned his arms against the supporters of a form of government which he had virtually recognized as the legal constitution of <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>; and it involved a direct implication of treason against the sacred representatives of that government, the consuls, formally and duly elected.
Upon such a charge he might be amenable to the capital laws of his country.
This, however, was a danger which might be fully obviated, by procuring from the senate and people an act of oblivion, previously to his abdication of the supreme power; and this was a preliminary which doubtless they would have admitted and ratified with unanimous approbation.
It therefore appears that he could be exposed to no inevitable danger on this account: but there was another quarter where his person was vulnerable, and where even the laws might not be sufficient to protect him against the efforts of private resentment.
The bloody proscription of the Triumvirate no act of amnesty could ever erase from the minds of those who had been deprived by it of their nearest and dearest relations; and amidst the numerous connections of the illustrious men sacrificed on that horrible occasion, there might arise some desperate avenger, whose indelible resentment nothing less would satisfy than the blood of the surviving delinquent.
Though Augustus, therefore, might not, like his great predecessor, be stabbed in the senate-house, he nmight perish by the sword or the poniard in a less conspicuous situation.
After all, there seems to have been little danger from this quarter likewise; for Sylla, who in the preceding age had been guilty of equal enormities, was permitted, on relinquishing the place of perpetual dictator, to end his days in quiet retirement; and the undisturbed security which Augustus ever afterwards enjoyed, affords sufficient proof, that all apprehension of danger to his person was merely chimerical.</p>
<p>We have hitherto considered this grand consultation as it might be
influenced by the passions or prejudices of the emperor: we shall now take a short view of the subject in the light in which it is connected with considerations of a political nature, and with public utility.
The arguments handed down by history respecting this consultation are few, and imperfectly delivered; but they may be extended upon the general principles maintained on each side of the question.</p>
<p>For the restoration of the republican government, it might be contended, that from the expulsion of the kings to the dictatorship of Julius Caesar, through a period of upwards of four hundred and sixty years, the Roman state, with the exception only of a short interval, had flourished and increased with a degree of prosperity unexampled in the annals of human kind: that the republican form of government was not only best adapted to the improvement of national grandeur, but to the security of general freedom, the great object of all political association: that public virtue, by which alone nations could subsist in vigour, was cherished and protected by no mode of administration so much as by that which connected, in the strongest bonds of union, the private interest of individuals with those of the community: that the habits and prejudices of the Roman people were unalterably attached to the form of government established by so long a prescription, and they would never submit, for any length of time, to the rule of one person, without making every possible effort to recover their liberty: that though despotism, under a mild and wise prince, might in some respects be regarded as preferable to a constitution which was occasionally exposed to the inconvenience of faction and popular tumults, yet it was a dangerous experiment to abandon the government of the nation to the contingency of such a variety of characters as usually occurs in the succession of princes; and, upon the whole, that the interests of the people were more safely entrusted in the hands of annual magistrates elected by themselves, than in those of any individual whose power was permanent, and subject to no legal control.</p>
<p>In favour of despotic government it might be urged, that though <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> had subsisted long and gloriously under a republican form of government, yet she had often experienced such violent shocks from popular tumults or the factions of the great, as had threatened her with imminent destruction: that a republican government was only accommodated to a people amongst whom the division of property gave to no class of citizens such a degree of preeminence as might prove dangerous to public freedom: that there was required in that form of political constitution, a simplicity of life and strictness of manners which are never observed to accompany a high degree of public prosperity: that in respect of all these considerations, such a form of government was utterly incompatible with the present circumstances of the Romans: that by the conquest of so many foreign nations, by the lucrative governments of provinces, the spoils of the enemy in war, and the rapine too often practised in time of peace, so great had been the aggrandizement of particular families in the preceding age, that though the form of the ancient constitution should still remain inviolate, the people would no longer live under a free republic, but an aristocratical usurpation, which was always productive of tyranny: that nothing could preserve the commonwealth from becoming a prey to some daring confederacy, but the firm and vigorous administration of one person, invested with the whole executive power of the state, unlimited and uncontrolled: in fine, that as <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> had been nursed to maturity by the government of six princes successively, so it was only by a similar form of political constitution that she could now be saved from aristocratical tyranny on one hand, or, on the other, from absolute anarchy.</p>
<p>On whichever side of the question the force of argument may be thought to preponderate, there is reason to believe that Augustus was guided in his resolution more by inclination and prejudice than by reason.
It is related, however, that hesitating between the opposite opinions of his two counsellors, he had recourse to that of Virgil, who joined with Maecenas in advising him to retain the imperial power, as being the form of government most suitable to the circumstances of the times.

They removed thence to <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> soon after the building of the city, with a great body of their dependants, under Titus Tatius, who reigned jointly with <placeName key="tgn,2072021">Romulus</placeName> in the kingdom; or, perhaps, what is related upon better authority, under Atta Claudius, the head of the family, who was admitted by the senate into the patrician order six years after the expulsion of the Tarquins.
They likewise received from  the state, lands beyond the Anio for their followers, and a burying place for themselves near the capitol.
<note anchored="yes">Intramural interments were prohibited at <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> by the laws of the Twelve Tables, notwithstanding the practice of reducing to ashes the bodies of the dead. It was only by special privilege that individuals who had deserved well of the state, and certain distinguished families were permitted to have tombs within the city.
</note>
After this period, in process of time, the family had the honour of twenty-eight consulships, five dictatorships, seven censorships, seven  triumphs, and  two ovations.
Their descendants were distinguished by various <foreign lang="la">praenomina</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">cognomina</foreign>,
<note anchored="yes"><p>Among the Romans, all the descendants from one common stock were called Geniles, being of the same race or kindred, however remote. The Gens, as they termed this general relation or clanship, was subdivided into families. in Famias velStirpes; and those of the same family were called Agnat. Relations by the father's side were also
called Agnai, to distinguish them from  Cognat, relations only on the mother's side.
An Agnatus might also be called Cognatus, but not the contrary.</p>
<p>To mark the different genies and familiae, and to distinguish the individuals of the same family, the Romans had commonly three names, the Praenomen, Nomren, and Cognomen.
The prasnomen was put first, and marked the individual.
It was usually written with one letter; as A. for Aulus; C. Caius; D. Decimus; sometimes with two letters; as Ap. for Appius; Cn. Cneius; and sometimes with three; as Mam.
for Mamercus.</p>
<p>The Nomen was put after the Pranomen, and marked the gens.
It commonly ended in ius; as <placeName key="tgn,2008628">Julius</placeName>, Tullius, <placeName key="tgn,2074227">Cornelius</placeName>.
The Cognomen was put last, and marked the familia; as Cicero, <placeName key="tgn,2073974">Casar</placeName>, etc.</p>
<p>Some gentes appear to have had no surname, as the <placeName key="tgn,2492449">Marian</placeName>; and gens and familia seem sometimes to be put one for the other; as the Fabia gens, or FabiafamiKa.</p>
<p>Sometimes there was a fourth name, properly called the Agnommn, but sometimes likewise Cognomen, which was added on account of some illustrious action or remarkable event.
Thus <placeName key="tgn,2648579">Scipio</placeName> was named Publius Cornelius Scipio Aficanus, from the conquest of <placeName key="tgn,7016143">Carthage</placeName>.
In the same manner, his brother was called Lucius Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus.
Thus also Quintus Fabius Maximus received the Agnomen of Cunctator, from his checking the victorious career of <placeName key="tgn,2069580">Hannibal</placeName> by avoiding a battle.</p></note>
but rejected by common consent the praenomen of <placeName key="tgn,2023439">Lucius</placeName>, when, of the two races who bore it, one individual had been  convicted  of robbery, and  another of murder.
Amongst other cognomina, they assumed that of <placeName key="tgn,2538429">Nero</placeName>, which in the <placeName key="tgn,7021127">Sabine</placeName> language signifies strong and valiant.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="2">
<p>It appears from record, that many of the Claudii have performed signal services to the state, as well as committed acts of delinquency.
To mention the most remarkable only, Appius Caecus dissuaded the senate from agreeing to an alliance with Pyrrhus, as prejudicial to the republic.<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 474</note>
Claudius Candex first passed the straits of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> with a fleet, and drove the Carthaginians out of

On the other hand, Claudius Appius Regillanus, one of the Decemvirs, made a violent attempt to have a free virgin, of whom he was enamoured, adjudged a slave; which caused the people to secede a second time from the senate.<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 304</note>

and endeavoured, by means of his dependants, to make himself master of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>.
Claudius Pulcher, when, off the coast of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>,<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 505</note> the pullets used for taking augury would not eat, in contempt of the omen threw them overboard, as if they should drink at least, if they would not eat; and then engaging the enemy, was routed.
After his defeat, when he was ordered by the senate to name a dictator, making a sort of jest of the public disaster, he named Glycias, his apparitor.</p>
<p>The women of this family, likewise, exhibited characters equally opposite to each other.
For both the Claudias belonged to it; she, who, when the ship freighted with things sacred to the Idaean Mother of the Gods,<note anchored="yes">Cybele; first worshipped in <placeName key="tgn,7002613">Phrygia</placeName>, about <placeName key="tgn,1105013">Mount Ida</placeName>, from whence a sacred stone, the symbol of her divinity, probably an aerolite, was transported to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, in consequence of the panic occasioned by Hannibal's invasion, A.U.C. 508.

stuck fast in the shallows of the <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName>, got it off, by praying to the Goddess with a loud voice, "Follow  me, if I am chaste;" and she also, who, contrary to the usual practice in the case of women, was brought to trial by the
people for treason; because, when her litter was stopped by a great crowd in the streets, she openly exclaimed, "I wish my brother Pulcher was alive now, to lose another fleet, that <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> might be less thronged."
Besides, it is well known, that all the Claudii, except Publius Claudius, who, to effect the banishment of Cicero, procured himself to be adopted by a plebeian,<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 695</note>
and one younger than himself, were always of the patrician party, as well as great sticklers for the honour and power of that order; and so violent and obstinate in their opposition to the plebeians, that not one of them, even in the case of a trial for life by the people, would ever condescend to put on mourning, according to custom, or make any supplication to them for favour; and some of them in their contests, have even proceeded to lay hands on the tribunes of the people.
A Vestal Virgin likewise of the family, when her brother was resolved to have the honour of a triumph contrary to the will of the people, mounted the chariot with him, and attended him into the capitol, that it might not be lawful for any of the tribunes to interfere and forbid it.<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 611</note></p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="3">
<p>From this family Tiberius Caesar is descended; indeed both by the father and mother's side; by the former from Tiberius Nero, and by the latter from Appius Pulcher, who were both sons of Appius Caecus.
He likewise belonged to the family of the Livii, by the adoption of his mother's grandfather into it; which family although plebeian, made a distinguished figure, having had the honour of eight consulships, two censorships, three triumphs, one dictatorship, and the office of master of the horse; and was famous for eminent men, particularly, Salinator and the Drusi.
Salinator, in his censorship,<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 550</note> branded all the tribes, for their inconstancy in having made him consul a second time, as well as censor, although they had condemned him to a heavy fine after his first consulship.
Drusus procured for himself and his posterity a new  surname, by killing in single combat Drausus, the enemy's chief.
He is likewise said to have recovered, when pro-praetor in the province of <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, the gold which was formerly given to the <placeName key="tgn,1035697">Senones</placeName>, at the siege of the capitol, and had not, as is reported, been forced from  them  by Camillus.
His great-great-grandson, who, for his extraordinary services against the Gracchi, was styled the "Patron of the Senate," left a son, who, while plotting in a sedition of the same description, was treacherously murdered by the opposite party.<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 663</note></p></div2>

<p>But the father of Tiberius Caesar, being quaestor to Caius Caesar, and commander of his fleet in the war of <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName>, contributed greatly to its success.
He was therefore made one of the high-priests in the room of Publius Scipio;<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 707</note>
and was sent to settle some colonies in <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, and amongst the rest, those of <placeName key="tgn,7008368">Narbonne</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7008775">Arles</placeName>.

</note>
After the assassination of Caesar, however, when the rest of the senators, for fear of public disturbances, were for having the affair buried in oblivion, he proposed a resolution for rewarding those who had killed the tyrant.
Having filled the office of praetor,<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 710</note> and at the end of the year a disturbance breaking out amongst the triumviri, he kept the badges of his office beyond the legal time; and following Lucius Antonius the consul, brother of the triumvir, to <placeName key="perseus,Perusia">Perusia</placeName>,<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 713</note> though the rest submitted,
yet he himself continued firm to the party, and escaped first to <placeName key="perseus,Praeneste">Praeneste</placeName>, and then to <placeName key="tgn,7004474">Naples</placeName>; whence, having in vain invited the slaves to liberty, he fled over to <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>.
But resenting his not being immediately admitted into the presence of Sextus Pompey, and being also prohibited the use of the fasces, he went over into Achaia to Mark Antony; with whom, upon a reconciliation soon after brought about amongst the several contending parties, he returned to <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>; and, at the request of Augustus, gave up to him his wife Livia Drusilla, although she was then big with child, and had before borne him a son.
He died not long after; leaving behind him two sons, Tiberius and Drusus Nero.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="5">
<p>Some have imagined that Tiberius was born at <placeName key="tgn,7006712">Fundi</placeName>, but there is only this trifling foundation for the conjecture, that his mother's grandmother was of <placeName key="tgn,7006712">Fundi</placeName>, and that the image of Good Fortune was, by a decree of the senate, erected in a public place in that town.
But according to the greatest number of writers, and those too of the best authority, he was born at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, in the <placeName key="tgn,3000935">Palatine</placeName> quarter, upon the sixteenth of the calends of December [16th Nov.], when Marcus AEmilius Lepidus was second time consul, with Lucius Munatius Plancus,<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 712. Before Christ about 39.</note> after the battle of <placeName key="perseus,Philippi">Philippi</placeName>; for so it is registered in the calendar, and the public acts.
According to some, however, he was born in the preceding year, in the consulship of Hirtius and Pansa; and others say, in the year following, during the consulship of Servilius Isauricus and Antony.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="6">
<p>His infancy and childhood were spent in the midst of danger and trouble; for he accompanied his parents everywhere in their flight, and twice at <placeName key="tgn,7004474">Naples</placeName> nearly
betrayed them by his crying, when they were privately hastening to a ship, as the enemy rushed into the town; once, when he was snatched from his nurse's breast, and again, from his mother's bosom, by some of the company, who on the sudden emergency wished to relieve the women of their burden.
Being carried through <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7002733">Achaia</placeName>, and entrusted for some time to the care of the Lacedaemonians, who were under the protection of the Claudian family, upon his departure thence when travelling by night, he ran the hazard of his life, by a fire which, suddenly bursting out of a wood on all sides, surrounded the whole party so closely, that part of Livia's dress and hair was burnt.
The presents which were made him by Pompeia, sister to Sextus Pompey, in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, namely, a cloak, with a clasp, and bullae of gold, are still in existence, and shewn at <placeName key="perseus,Baiae">Baiae</placeName> to this day.
After his return to the city, being adopted by Marcus Gallius, a senator, in his will, he took possession of the estate; but soon afterwards declined the use of his name, because Gallius had been of the party opposed to Augustus.
When only nine years of age, he pronounced a funeral oration in praise of his father upon the rostra; and afterwards, when he had nearly attained the age of manhood, he attended the chariot of Augustus, in his triumph for the victory at <placeName key="tgn,7010713">Actium</placeName>, riding on the left-hand horse, whilst Marcellus, Octavia's son, rode that on the right.
He likewise presided at the games celebrated on account of that victory; and in the Trojan games intermixed with the Circensian, he commanded a troop of the biggest boys.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="7">
<p>After assuming the manly habit, he spent his youth, and the rest of his life until he succeeded to the government, in the following manner: he gave the people an entertainment of gladiators, in memory of his father, and
another for his grandfather Drusus, at different times and in different places: the first in the forum, the second in the amphitheatre; some gladiators who had been honourably discharged, being induced to engage again, by a reward of a hundred thousand sesterces.
He likewise exhibited public sports, at which he was not present himself.
All these he performed with great magnificence, at the expense of his mother and father-in-law.
He married Agrippina, the daughter of Marcus Agrippa, and granddaughter of Caecilius Atticus, a Roman knight, the same person to whom Cicero has addressed so many epistles.
After having by her his son Drusus, he was obliged to part with her,<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 744</note> though she retained his affection, and was again pregnant, to make way for marrying Augustus's daughter Julia.
But this he did with extreme reluctance; for, besides having the warmest attachment to Agrippina, he was disgusted with the conduct of Julia, who had made indecent advances to him during the lifetime of her former husband; and that she was a woman of loose character, was the general opinion.
At divorcing Agrippina he felt the deepest regret; and upon meeting her afterwards, he looked after her with eyes so passionately expressive of affection, that care was taken she should never again come in his sight.
At first, however, he lived quietly and happily with Julia; but a rupture soon ensued, which became so violent, that after the loss of their son, the pledge of their union, who was born at <placeName key="tgn,7005553">Aquileia</placeName> and died in infancy,<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 735</note> he never would sleep with her more.
He lost his brother Drusus in <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, and brought his body to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, travelling all the way on foot before it.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="8">
<p>When he first applied himself to civil affairs, he defended the several causes of king Archelaus, the Trallians, and the Thessalians, before Augustus, who sat as judge at the trials.
He addressed the senate on behalf of the Laodiceans, the Thyatireans, and Chians, who had suffered greatly by an earthquake, and implored relief from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.
He prosecuted Fannius Caepio, who had been engaged in a conspiracy with Varro Mursena against Augustus, and procured sentence of condemnation against him.
Amidst all this, he had besides to superintend two departments of the administration, that of supplying the city with corn, which was then very scarce, and that of clearing the houses of correction<note anchored="yes">See before, in the reign of Augustus, c. xxxii.</note> throughout <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, the masters of which had fallen under the odious suspicion of seizing and keeping confined, not only travellers, but those whom the fear of being obliged to serve in the army had driven to seek refuge in such places.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="9">
<p>He made his first campaign, as a military tribune, in the Cantabrian war.<note anchored="yes">A. U. C. 728.</note>
Afterwards he led an army into the East,<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 734</note> where he restored the kingdom of <placeName key="tgn,7006651">Armenia</placeName> to Tigranes; and seated on a tribunal, put a crown upon his head.
He likewise recovered from the Parthians the standards which they had taken from Crassus.
He next governed, for nearly a year, the province of Gallia Comata, which was then in great disorder, on account of the incursions of the barbarians, and the feuds of the chiefs.
He afterwards commanded in the several wars against the Rhaetians, Vindelicians, Pannonians, and Germans.
In the Rhaetian and Vindelician wars, he subdued the nations in the <placeName key="tgn,2066659">Alps</placeName>; and in the Pannonian wars the Bruci, and the Dalmatians.
In the German war, he transplanted into <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> forty thousand of the enemy who had submitted, and assigned them lands near the banks of the <placeName key="tgn,7012611">Rhine</placeName>.
For these actions, he entered the city with an ovation, but riding in a chariot, and is said by some to have been the first that ever was honoured with this distinction.
He filled early the principal offices of state; and passed through the quaestorship,<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 737</note> praetorship,<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 741</note>
and consulates<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 747</note> almost successively.
After some interval, he was chosen consul a second time, and held the tribunitian authority during five years.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="10">
<p>Surrounded by all this prosperity, in the prime of life and in excellent health, he suddenly formed the resolution of withdrawing to a greater distance from <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>.<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 748</note> It is uncertain whether this was the result of disgust for his wife, whom he neither durst accuse nor divorce, and the connection with whom  became every day more intolerable; or to prevent that indifference towards him, which his constant residence in the city might produce; or in the hope of supporting and improving by absence his authority in the state, if the public should have occasion for his service.
Some are of opinion, that as Augustus's sons were now grown up to years of maturity, he voluntarily relinquished the possession he had long enjoyed of the second place in the government, as Agrippa had done before him; who, when M. Marcellus was advanced to public offices, retired to <placeName key="tgn,7002672">Mitylene</placeName>, that he might not seem to stand in the way of his promotion, or in any respect lessen him by his presence.
The same reason likewise Tiberius gave afterwards for his retirement; but his pretext at this time was, that he was satiated with honours, and desirous of being relieved from the fatigue of business; requesting therefore that he might have leave to withdraw.
And neither the earnest entreaties of his mother, nor the complaint of his father-in-law made even in the senate, that he was deserted by him, could prevail
upon him to alter his resolution.
Upon their persisting in the design of detaining him, he refused to take any sustenance for four days together.
At last, having obtained permission, leaving his wife and son at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, he proceeded to <placeName key="perseus,Ostia">Ostia</placeName>,<note anchored="yes"><placeName key="perseus,Ostia">Ostia</placeName>, at the mouth of the <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName>, about thirteen miles from the city, was founded by Ancus Martins.
Being the port of a city like <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, it could not fail to become opulent; and it was a place of much resort, ornamented with fine edifices, and the environs " never failing of pasture in the summer time, and in the winter covered with roses and other flowers."
The port having been filled up with the depositions of the <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName>, it became deserted, and is now abandoned to misery and malaria.
The bishopric of <placeName key="perseus,Ostia">Ostia</placeName> being the oldest in the Roman church, its bishop has always retained some peculiar privileges.
</note> without exchanging a word with those who attended him, and having enbraced but very few persons at parting.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="11">
<p>From <placeName key="perseus,Ostia">Ostia</placeName>, journeying along the coast of <placeName key="tgn,7003005">Campania</placeName>, he halted awhile on receiving intelligence of Augustus's being taken ill, but this giving rise to a rumour that he stayed with a view to something extraordinary, he sailed with the wind almost full against him, and arrived at <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName>, having been struck with the pleasantness and healthiness of the island at the time of his landing there in his return from  <placeName key="tgn,7006651">Armenia</placeName>.
Here contenting himself with a small house, and a villa not much larger, near the town, he led entirely a private life, taking his walks sometimes about the Gymnasia,
<note anchored="yes">The Gymnasia were places of exercise, and received their name from the Greek word signifying naked, because the contending parties wore nothing but drawers.
</note>
without any lictor or other attendant, and returning the civilities of the Greeks with almost as much complaisance as if he had been upon a level with them.
One morning, in settling the course of his daily excursion, he happened to say, that he should visit all the sick people in the town.
This being not
rightly understood by those about him, the sick were brought into a public portico, and ranged in order, according to their several distempers.
Being extremely embarrassed by this unexpected occurrence, he was for some time irresolute how he should act; but at last he determined to go round them all, and make an apology for the mistake, even to the meanest amongst them, and such as were entirely unknown to him.
One instance only is mentioned, in which he appeared to exercise his tribunitian authority.
Being a constant attendant upon the schools and lecture-rooms of the professors of the liberal arts, on occasion of a quarrel amongst the wrangling sophists, in which he interposed to reconcile them, some person took the liberty to abuse him as an intruder, and partial in the affair.
Upon this, withdrawing privately home, he suddenly returned attended by his officers, and summoning his accuser before his tribunal, by a public crier, ordered him to be taken to prison.
Afterwards he received tidings that his wife Julia had been condemned for her lewdness and adultery, and that a bill of divorce had been sent to her in his name, by the authority of Augustus.
Though he secretly rejoiced at this intelligence, he thought it incumbent upon him, in point of decency, to interpose in her behalf by frequent letters to Augustus, and to allow her to retain the presents which he had made her, notwithstanding the little regard she merited from him.
When the period of his tribunitian authority expired,<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 752</note> declaring at last that he had no other object in his retirement than to avoid all suspicion of rivalship with Caius and Lucius, he petitioned that, since he was now secure in that respect, as they were come to the age of manhood, and would easily maintain themselves in possession of the second place in the state, he
might be permitted to visit his friends, whom he was very desirous of seeing.
But his request was denied; and he was advised to lay aside all concern for his friends, whom he had been so eager to quit.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="12">
<p>He therefore continued at <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName> much against his will, obtaining, with difficulty, thrqugh his mother, the title of Augustus's lieutenant, to cover his disgrace.
He thenceforth lived, however, not only as a private person, but as one suspected and under apprehension, retiring into the interior of the country, and avoiding the visits of those who sailed that way, which were very frequent; for no one passed to take command of an army, or the government of a province, without touching at <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName>.
But there were fresh reasons for increased anxiety.
For crossing over to <placeName key="tgn,7002673">Samos</placeName>, on a visit to his step-son Caius, who had been appointed governor of the East, ihe found him prepossessed against him, by the insinuations of Marcus Lollius, his companion and director.
He likewise fell under suspicion of sending by some centurions who had been promoted by himself, upon their return to the camp after a furlough, mysterious messages to several persons there, intended, apparently, to tamper with them for a revolt.
This jealousy respecting his designs being intimated to him by Augustus, he begged repeatedly that some person of any of the three Orders might be placed as a spy upon him in every thing he either said or did.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="13">
<p>He laid aside likewise his usual exercises of riding and arms; and quitting the Roman habit, made use of the Pallium and Crepida.<note anchored="yes">The cloak and slippers, as distinguished from the Roman toga and shoes.</note>
In this condition he continued almost two years, becoming daily an object of increasing contempt and odium; insomuch that the people of <placeName key="tgn,7008371">Nismes</placeName> pulled down all the images and statues of him
in their town; and upon mention being made of him at table, one of the company said to Caius, "I will sail over to <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName> immediately, if you desire me, and bring you the head of the exile;" for that was the appellation now given him.
Thus alarmed not only by apprehensions, but real danger, he renewed his solicitations for leave to return; and, seconded by the most urgent supplications of his mother, he at last obtained his request; to which an accident somewhat contributed.
Augustus had resolved to determine nothing in the affair, but with the consent of his eldest son.
The latter was at that time out of humour with Marcus Lollius, and -therefore easily disposed to be favourable to his father-in-law.
Caius thus acquiescing, he was recalled, but upon condition that he should take no concern whatever in the administration of affairs.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="14">
<p>He returned to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> after an absence of nearly eight years,<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 755</note> with great and confident hopes of his future elevation, which he had entertained from his, youth, in consequence of various prodigies and predictions.
For Livia, when pregnant with him, being anxious to discover, by different modes of divination, whether her offspring would be a son, amongst others, took an egg from a hen that was sitting, and kept it warm with her own hands, and those of her maids, by turns, until a fine cock-chicken, with a large comb, was hatched.
Scribonius, the astrologer, predicted great things of him when he was a mere child.
" He will come in time," said the prophet, "to be even a king, but without the usual badge of royal dignity;" the rule of the Caesars being as yet unknown.
When he was making his first expedition, and leading his army through <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> into <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>, the altars which had been formerly consecrated at <placeName key="perseus,Philippi">Philippi</placeName> by the victorious

Soon after, as he was marching to <placeName key="tgn,7016683">Illyricum</placeName>, he stopped to consult the oracle of Geryon, near <placeName key="tgn,7003085">Padua</placeName>; and having drawn a lot by which he was desired to throw golden tali into the fountain of Aponus,<note anchored="yes">This fountain, in the Euganian hills, near <placeName key="tgn,7003085">Padua</placeName>, famous for its mineral waters, is celebrated by Claudian in one of his elegies.</note>
for an answer to his inquiries, he did so, and the highest numbers came up. And those very tali are still to be seen at the bottom of the fountain.
A few days before his leaving <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName>, an eagle, a bird never before seen in that island, perched on the top of his house.
And the day before he received the intelligence of the permission granted him to return, as he was changing his dress, his tunic appeared to be all on fire.
He then likewise had a remarkable proof of the skill of Thrasyllus, the astrologer, whom, for his proficiency in philosophical researches, he had taken into his family.
For, upon sight of the ship which brought the intelligence, he said good news was coming: whereas every thing going wrong before, and quite contrary to his predictions, Tiberius had intended that very moment, when they were walking together, to throw him into the sea, as an impostor, and one to whom he had too hastily entrusted his secrets.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="15">
<p>Upon his return to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, having introduced his son Drusus into the forum, he immediately removed from Pompey's house, in the Carinae, to the gardens of Maecenas, on the <placeName key="tgn,4012794">Esquiline</placeName>,<note anchored="yes">The street called Carinae, at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, has been mentioned before; AUGUSTUS, c. v.; and also Maecenas's house on the <placeName key="tgn,4012794">Esquiline</placeName>, ib. c. lxx. The gardens were formed on ground without the walls, and before used as a cemetery for malefactors, and the lower classes. Horace says

 and resigned himself entirely to
his ease, performing only the common offices of civility in private life, without any preferment in the government.
But Caius and Lucius being both carried off in the space of three years, he was adopted by Augustus, along with their brother Agrippa; being obliged in the first place to adopt Germanicus, his brother's son.
After his adoption, he never more acted as master of a family, nor exercised, in the smallest degree, the rights which he had lost by it. For he neither disposed of anything in the way of gift, nor manumitted a slave; nor so much as received any estate left him by will, nor any legacy, without reckoning it as a part of his peculium or property held under his father.
From that day forward, nothing was omitted that might contribute to the advancement of his grandeur, and much more, when, upon Agrippa being discarded and banished, it was evident that the hope of succession rested upon him alone.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="16">
<p>The tribunitian authority was again conferred upon him for five years,<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 575</note> and a commission given him to settle the affairs of <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>.
The ambassadors of the Parthians, after having had an audience of Augustus, were ordered to apply to him likewise in his province.
But on receiving intelligence of an insurrection in <placeName key="tgn,7016683">Illyricum</placeName>,<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 760</note> he went over to superintend the management of that new war, which proved the most serious of all the foreign wars since the Carthaginian.
This he conducted during three years, with fifteen legions and an equal number of auxiliary forces, under great difficulties, and an extreme scarcity of corn.
And though he was several times recalled, he nevertheless persisted; fearing lest an enemy so powerful, and so near, should fall upon the army in their retreat.
This resolution was attended with good success; for he at last reduced to complete subjection all <placeName key="tgn,7016683">Illyricum</placeName>, lying between <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> and the kingdom of Noricum, <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, the river <placeName key="tgn,7012913">Danube</placeName>, and the Adriatic gulf.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="17">
<p>The glory he acquired by these successes received an increase from the conjuncture in which they happened.
For almost about that very time<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 762</note> Quintilius Varus was cut off with three legions in <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>; and it was generally believed that the victorious Germans would have joined the Pannonians, had not the war of <placeName key="tgn,7016683">Illyricum</placeName> been previously concluded.
A triumph, therefore, besides many other great honours, was decreed him.
Some proposed that the surname of "Pannonicus," others that of "Invincible," and others, of "Pius," should be conferred on him; but Augustus interposed, engaging for him that he would be satisfied with that to which he would succeed at his death.
He postponed his triumph, because the state was at that time under great affliction for the disaster of Varus and his army.
Nevertheless, he entered the city in a triumphal robe, crowned with laurel, and mounting a tribunal in the Septa, sat with Augustus between the two consuls, whilst the senate gave their attendance standing; whence, after he had saluted the people, he was attended by them in procession to the several temples.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="18">
<p>Next year he went again to <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, where finding that the defeat of Varus was occasioned by the rashness and negligence of the commander, he thought proper to be guided in everything by the advice of a council of war; whereas, at other times, he used to follow the dictates of his own judgment, and considered himself alone as sufficiently qualified for the direction of affairs.
He likewise used more cautions than usual. Having to
pass the <placeName key="tgn,7012611">Rhine</placeName>, he restricted the whole convoy within
certain limits, and stationing himself on the bank of the
river, would not suffer the waggons to cross the river,
until he had searched them at the water-side, to see that
they carried nothing but what was allowed or necessary.
Beyond the <placeName key="tgn,7012611">Rhine</placeName>, such was his way of living, that he
took his meals sitting on the bare ground,<note anchored="yes">Reviving the simple habits of the times of the republic;  <quote lang="la">"nec fortuitum cernere cespitem,"</quote> as Horace describes it.--Ode 15.
</note> and often
passed the night without a tent; and his regular orders
for the day, as well as those upon sudden emergencies,
he gave in writing, with this injunction, that in case of
any doubt as to the meaning of them, they should apply
to him for satisfaction, even at any hour of the night.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="19">
<p>He maintained the strictest discipline amongst
the troops; reviving many old customs relative to punishing and degrading offenders; setting a mark of disgrace even upon the commander of a legion, for sending
a few soldiers with one of his freedmen across the river
for the purpose of hunting. Though it was his desire to
leave as little as possible in the power of fortune or accident, yet he always engaged the enemy with more confidence when, in his night-watches, the lamp failed and
went out of itself; trusting, as he said, in an omen which
had never failed him and his ancestors in all their commands. But, in the midst of victory, he was very near
being assassinated by some Bructerian, who mixing with
those about him, and being discovered by his trepidation,
was put to the torture, and confessed his intended crime.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="20">
<p>After two years he returned from <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> to
the city, and celebrated the triumph which he had deferred, attended by his lieutenants, for whom he had
procured the honour of triumphal ornaments.<note anchored="yes">A. U. C. 765.</note> Before
he turned to ascend the capitol, he alighted from his
chariot, and knelt before his father, who sat by, to superintend the solemnity. Bato, the Pannonian chief, he sent
to <placeName key="perseus,Ravenna">Ravenna</placeName>, loaded with rich presents, in gratitude for
his having suffered him and his army to retire from a
position in which he had so enclosed them, that they were
entirely at his mercy. He afterwards gave the people a
dinner at a thousand tables, besides thirty sesterces to
each man. He likewise dedicated the temple of Concord,<note anchored="yes">The portico of the temple of Concord is still standing on the side
of the forum nearest the capitol. It consists of six Ionic columns, each
of one piece, and of a light-coloured granite, with bases and capitals

and Pollux has been mentioned before: JUL. c. X.</note> and that of Castor and Pollux, which had been
erected out of the spoils of the war, in his own and his
brother's name.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="21">
<p>A law having been not long after carried by the
consuls<note anchored="yes">A. U. C. 766.</note> for his being appointed a colleague with Augustus in the administration of the provinces, and in taking
the census, when that was finished he went into <placeName key="tgn,7016683">Illyricum</placeName>.<note anchored="yes">A. U. C. 767.</note> But being hastily recalled during his journey, he
found Augustus alive indeed, but past all hopes of recovery, and was with him in private a whole day. I know,
it is generally believed, that upon <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>'s quitting the
room, after their private conference, those who were in
waiting overheard Augustus say, "Ah! unhappy Roman
people, to be ground by the jaws of such a slow devourer!" Nor am I ignorant of its being reported by
some, that Augustus so openly and undisguisedly condemned the sourness of his temper, that sometimes, upon
his coming in, he would break off any jocular conversation in which he was engaged; and that he was only prevailed upon by the importunity of his wife to adopt him;
or actuated by the ambitious view of recommending his
own memory from a comparison with such a successor.
Yet I must hold to this opinion, that a prince so extremely
circumspect and prudent as he was, did nothing rashly,
especially in an affair of so great importance; but that,
upon weighing the vices and virtues of <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName> with
each other, he judged the latter to preponderate; and
this the rather since he swore publicly, in an assembly of
the people, that "he adopted him for the public good."
Besides, in several of his letters, he extols him as a consummate general, and the only security of the Roman
people. Of such declarations I subjoin the following instances:  "Farewell, my dear <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>, and may success
attend you, whilst you are warring   for  me  and     the
Muses.<note anchored="yes">Augustus interlards this epistle, and that subsequently quoted, with
Greek sentences and phrases, of which this is one. It is so obscure,
that commentators suppose that it is a mis-reading, but are
not agreed on its drift.</note> Farewell, my most dear, and (as I hope to
prosper) most gallant man, and accomplished general."
Again. "The disposition of your summer quarters?  In
truth, my dear Tiberius, I do not think, that amidst so
many difficulties, and with an army so little disposed for
action, any one could have behaved more prudently than
you have done. All those likewise who were with you,
acknowledge that this verse is applicable to you:"

<div2 type="chapter" n="22">
<p>He did not make the death of Augustus public,
until he had taken off young Agrippa. He was slain
by a tribune who commanded his guard, upon reading a
written order for that purpose: respecting which order,
it was then a doubt, whether Augustus left it in his last
moments, to prevent any occasion of public disturbance
after his decease, or <placeName key="tgn,2039991">Livia</placeName> issued it, in the name of Augustus; and whether with the knowledge of <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName> or
not. When the tribune came to inform him that he had
executed his command, he replied, "I commanded you no
such thing, and you must answer for it to the senate;"
avoiding, as it seems, the odium of the act for that time.
And the affair was soon buried in silence.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="23">
<p>Having summoned the senate to meet by virtue
of his tribunitian authority, and begun a mournful speech,
he drew a deep sigh, as if unable to support himself under his affliction; and wishing that not his voice only, but
his very breath of life, might fail him, gave his speech to
his son Drusus to read. Augustus's will was then brought
in, and read by a freedman; none of the witnesses to it
being admitted, but such as were of the senatorian order,
the rest owning their hand-writing without doors. The
will began thus: " Since my ill-fortune has deprived me
of my two sons, Caius and <placeName key="tgn,2023439">Lucius</placeName>, let <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName> Caesar be
heir to two-thirds of my estate." These words countenanced the suspicion of those who were of opinion, that
Tiberius was appointed successor more out of necessity
than choice, since Augustus could not refrain from prefacing his will in that manner.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="24">
<p>Though he made no scruple to assume and
exercise immediately the imperial authority, by giving orders that he should be attended by the guards, who were
the security and badge of the supreme power; yet he
affected, by a most impudent piece of acting, to refuse it
for a long time; one while sharply reprehending his
friends who entreated him to accept it, as little knowing
what a monster the government was; another while keeping in suspense the senate, when they implored him and
threw themselves at his feet, by ambiguous answers, and
a crafty kind of dissimulation; insomuch that some were
out of patience, and one cried out, during the confusion,
"Either let him accept it, or decline it at once;" and a
second told him to his face, "Others are slow to perform
what they promise, but you are slow to promise what you
actually perform." At last, as if forced to it, and complaining of the miserable and burdensome service imposed upon him, he accepted the government; not, however, without giving hopes of his resigning it some time
or other. The exact words he used were these: "Until
the time shall come, when ye may think it reasonable to
give some rest to my old age."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="25">
<p>The cause of his long demur was fear of the
dangers which threatened him on all hands; insomuch
that he said, "I have got a wolf by the ears." For a
slave of Agrippa's, <placeName key="tgn,2103319">Clemens</placeName> by name, had drawn together
a considerable force to revenge his master's death; Lucius Scribonius Libo, a senator of the first distinction, was
secretly fomenting a rebellion; and the troops both in
<placeName key="tgn,7016683">Illyricum</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> were mutinous.  Both armies
insisted upon high demands, particularly that their pay
should be made equal to that of the pretorian guards.
The army in <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> absolutely refused to acknowledge
a prince who was not their own choice; and urged, with
all possible importunity, Germanicus,<note anchored="yes"><placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName> had adopted Germanicus. See before, c. xv. See also
CALIGULA, c. i.</note> who commanded
them, to take the government on himself, though he obstinately refused it. It was Tiberius's apprehension from
this quarter, which made him request the senate to assign
him some part only in the administration, such as they
should judge proper, since no man could be sufficient for
the whole, without one or more to assist him. He pretended likewise to be in a bad state of health, that Germanicus might the more patiently wait in hopes of speedily succeeding him, or at least of being admitted to be a
colleague of the government. When the mutinies in
the armies were suppressed, he got Clemens into his
hands by stratagem. That he might not begin his
reign by an act of severity, he did not call Libo to an
account before the senate until his second year, being
content, in the mean time, with taking proper precautions for his own security. For upon Libo's attending a
sacrifice amongst the high-priests, instead of the usual
knife, he ordered one of lead to be given him; and when he desired a private conference with him, he would not grant his request, but on condition that his son Drusus should be present; and as they walked together, he held him fast by the right hand, under the pretence of leaning upon him, until the conversation was over.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="26">
<p>When he was delivered from his apprehensions, his behaviour at first was unassuming, and he did not carry himself much above the level of a private person; and of the many and great honours offered him, he accepted but few, and such as were very moderate.
His birth-day, which happened to fall at the time of the Plebeian Circensian games, he with difficulty suffered to be honoured with the addition of only a single chariot, drawn by two horses.
He forbad temples, flamens, or priests to be appointed for him, as likewise the erection of any statues or effigies for him, without his permission; and this he granted only on condition that they should not be placed amongst the images of the gods, but only amongst the ornaments of houses.
He also interposed to prevent the senate from swearing to maintain his acts; and the month of September from being called Tiberius, and October being named after <placeName key="tgn,2039991">Livia</placeName>.
The praenomen likewise of EMPEROR, with the cognomen of FATHER OF HIS COUNTRY, and a civic crown in the vestibule of his house, he would not accept.
He never used the name of AUGUSTUS, although he inherited it, in any of his letters, excepting those addressed to kings and princes.
Nor had he more than three consulships; one for a few days, another for three months, and the third, during his absence from the city, until the ides [fifteenth] of May.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="27">
<p>He had such an aversion to flattery, that he would never suffer any senator to approach his litter, as he passed the streets in it, either to pay him a civility, or
upon business.
And when a man of consular rank, in begging his pardon for some offence he had given him, attempted to fall at his feet, he started from him in such haste, that he stumbled and fell.
If any compliment was paid him, either in conversation or a set speech, he would not scruple to interrupt and reprimand the party, and alter what he had said.
Being once called "lord,"<note anchored="yes">In this he imitated Augustus.
See c. liii. of his life.
</note> by some person, he desired that he might no more be affronted in that manner.
When another, to excite veneration, called his occupations "sacred," and a third had expressed himself thus: " By your authority I have waited upon the senate," he obliged them to change their phrases; in one of them adopting persuasion, instead of "authority," and in the other, laborious, instead of "sacred."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="28">
<p>He remained unmoved at all the aspersions, scandalous reports, and lampoons, which were spread against him or his relations; declaring, "In a free state, both the tongue and the mind ought to be free."
Upon the senate's desiring that some notice might be taken of those offences, and the persons charged with them, he replied, "We have not so much time upon our hands, that we ought to involve ourselves in more business.
If you once make an opening<note anchored="yes"><quote lang="la">Si hanc fenestram aperuitis</quote>, if you open that window, equivalent to our phrase "if you open the door."</note> for such proceedings, you will soon have nothing else to do. All private quarrels will be brought before you under that pretence."
There is also on record another sentence used by him in the senate, which is far from assuming: "If he speaks otherwise of me, I shall take care to behave in such a manner, as to be able to give a good account both of my words and actions; and if he persists, I shall hate him in my turn."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="29">
<p>These things were so much the more remarkable in him, because, in the respect he paid to individuals, or the whole body of the senate, he went beyond all bounds.
Upon his differing with Quintus Haterius in the senate-house, "Pardon me, sir," he said, "I beseech you, if I shall, as a senator, speak my mind very freely in opposition to you."
Afterwards, addressing the senate in general, he said: "Conscript Fathers, I have often said it both now and at other times, that a good and useful prince, whom you have invested with so great and absolute power, ought to be a slave to the senate, to the whole body of the people, and often to individuals likewise: nor am I sorry that I have said it. I have always found you good, kind, and indulgent masters, and still find you so."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="30">
<p>He likewise introduced a certain show of liberty, by preserving to the senate and magistrates their former majesty and power.
All affairs, whether of great or small importance, public or private, were laid before the senate.
Taxes and monopolies, the erecting or repairing edifices, levying and disbanding soldiers, the disposal of the legions and auxiliary forces in the provinces, the appointment of generals for the management of extraordinary wars, and the answers to letters from foreign princes, were all submitted to the senate.
He compelled the commander of a troop of horse, who was accused of robbery attended with violence, to plead his cause before the senate.
He never entered the senate-house but unattended; and being once brought thither in a litter, because he was indisposed, he dismissed his attendants at the door.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="31">
<p>When some decrees were made contrary to his opinion, he did not even make any complaint.
And though he thought that no magistrates after their nomination should be allowed to absent themselves from the city, but reside in it constantly, to receive their honours in person, a praetor-elect obtained liberty to depart under the honorary title of a legate at large.
Again, when he proposed to the senate, that the Trebians might have leave granted them to divert some money which had been left them by will for the purpose of building a new theatre, to that of making a road, he could not prevail to have the will of the testator set aside.
And when, upon a division of the house, he went over to the minority, nobody followed him.
All other things of a public nature were likewise transacted by the magistrates, and in the usual forms; the authority of the consuls remaining so great, that some ambassadors from <placeName key="tgn,2434870">Africa</placeName> applied to them, and complained, that they could not have their business dispatched by Caesar, to whom they had been sent.
And no wonder; since it was observed that he used to rise up as the consuls approached, and give them the way.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="32">
<p>He reprimanded some persons of consular rank in command of armies, for not writing to the senate an account of their proceedings, anc for consulting him about the distribution of military rewards; as if they themselves had not a right to bestow them as they judged proper.
He commended a praetor, who, on entering office, revived an old custom of celebrating the memory of his ancestors, in a speech to the people. He attended the corpses of some persons of distinction to the funeral pile. He displayed the same moderation with regard to persons and things of inferior consideration. The magistrates of <placeName key="tgn,2616125">Rhodes</placeName>, having dispatched to him a letter on public business, which was not subscribed, he sent for them, and without giving them so much as one harsh word, desired them to subscribe it, and so dismissed them. Diogenes, the grammarian, who used to hold public disquisitions at <placeName key="tgn,2616125">Rhodes</placeName> every sabbath-day, once refused him admittance upon his coming to hear him out of course, and sent him a message by a servant, postponing his admission to the nexth seventh-day. Diogenes afterwards coming to <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, and waiting at his door to be allowed to pay his respects to him, he sent him word to come again at the end of seven years. To some governors, who advised him to load the provinces with taxes, he answered, "It is the part of a good shepherd to shear, not flay, his sheep."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="33">
<p>He assumed the sovereignty<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="la">Princeps, principatus</foreign>, are the terms gencrally used by Suetonius to
describe the supreme authority vested in the Caesars, as before at the
beginning of chapter xxiv., distinguished from any terms which conveyed an idea of kingly power, the forms of the republic, as we have
lately seen, still subsisting.
</note> by slow degrees, and exercised it for a long time with great variety of conduct, though generally with a due regard to the public good. At first he only interposed to prevent ill management.  Accordingly, he rescinded some decrees of the senate; and when the magistrates sat for the administration of justice, he frequently offered his service as assessor, either taking his place promiscuously amongst them, or seating himself in a corner of the tribunal. If a rumour prevailed, that any person under prosecution was likely to be acquitted by his interest, he would suddenly make his appearance, and from  the floor of the court, or the praetor's bench, remind the judges of the laws, and of their oaths, and the nature of the charge brought before them.  He likewise took upon himself the correction of public morals, where they tended to decay, either through neglect, or evil custom.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="34">
<p>He reduced the expense of the plays and public spectacles, by diminishing the allowances to actors, and curtailing the number of gladiators. He made grievous complaints to the senate, that the price of Corinthian vessels was become enormous, and that three mullets
had been sold for thirty thousand sesterces: upon which he proposed that a new sumptuary law should be enacted; that the butchers and other dealers in viands should be subject to an assize, fixed by the senate yearly; and the aediles commissioned to restrain eating-houses and taverns, so far as not even to permit the sale of any kind of pastry.
And to encourage frugality in the public by his own example, he would often, at his solemn feasts, have at his tables victuals which had been served up the day before, and were partly eaten, and half a boar, affirming, It has all the same good bits that the whole had."
He published an edict against the practice of people's kissing each other when they met; and would not allow new year's gifts
<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="la">Strenas</foreign>; the French <foreign lang="fr">&eacute;trennes</foreign>.</note>
to be presented after the calends [the first] of January was passed. He had been in the habit of returning these offerings four-fold, and making them with his own hand; but being annoyed by the continual interruption to which he was exposed during the whole month, by those who had not the opportunity of attending him on the festival, he returned none after that day.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="35">
<p>Married women guilty of adultery, though not prosecuted publicly, he authorised the nearest relations to punish by agreement among themselves, according to ancient custom.
He discharged a Roman knight from the obligation of an oath he had taken, never to turn away his wife; and allowed him to divorce her, upon her being caught in criminal intercourse with her son-in-law.
Women of ill-fame, divesting themselves of the rights and dignity of matrons, had now begun a practice of professing themselves prostitutes, to avoid the punishment of the laws; and the most profligate young men of the senatorian and equestrian orders, to secure themselves agairist a decree of the senate, which prohibited their
performing on the stage, or in the amphitheatre, voluntarily subjected themselves to an infamous sentence, by which they were degraded.

He stripped a senator of the broad stripes on his robe, upon information of his having removed to his gardens before the calends [the first] of July, in order that he might afterwards hire a house cheaper in the city.

He abolished everywhere the privileges of all places of refuge. The Cyzicenians having committed an outrage upon some Romans, he deprived them of the liberty they had obtained from their good services in the Mithridatic war. Disturbances from foreign enemies he quelled by his lieutenants, without ever going against them in person; nor would he even employ his lieutenants, but with much reluctance, and when it was absolutely necessary. Princes who were ill-affected towards him, he kept in subjection, more by menaces and remonstrances, than by force of arms.  Some whom he induced to come to him  by fair words and promises, he never would permit to return home; as Maraboduus the German, Thrascypolis the Thracian, and Archelaus the Cappadocian, whose kingdom he even reduced into the form of a province.</p></div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="41">
<p>Returning to the island, he so far abandoned all care of the government, that he never filled up the decuriae of the knights, never changed any military tribunes or prefects, or governors of provinces, and kept <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName> for several years without any consular lieutenants.

While a young soldier in the camp, he was so remarkable for his excessive inclination to wine, that, for Tiberius, they called him Biberius; for Claudius, Cal-, dius; and for Nero, <placeName key="tgn,7018333">Mero</placeName>. And after he succeeded to the empire, and was invested with the office of reforming the morality of the people, he spent a whole night and two days together in feasting and drinking with Pomponius Flaccus and Lucius Piso; to one of whom he immediately gave the province of <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>, and to the other the prefecture of the city; declaring them, in his letterspatent, to be ' very pleasant companions, and friends fit for all occasions." He made an appointment to sup with Sestius Gallus, a lewd and prodigal old fellow, who had been disgraced by Augustus, and reprimanded by himself but a few days before in the senate-house; upon condition that he should not recede in the least from his usual method of entertainment, and that they should be attended at table by naked girls. He preferred a very obscure candidate for the quaestorship, before the most noble competitors, only for taking off, in pledging him at
table, an amphora of wine at a draught.<note anchored="yes">That any man could drink an amphora of wine at a draught, is beyond all credibility; for the amphora was nearly equal to nine gallons, English measure.

Once, indeed, he treated them liberally, at the instigation of his step-father, when, dividing them into three classes, according to their rank, he gave the first six, the second four, and the third two, hundred thousand sesterces, which last class he called not friends, but Greeks.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="47">
<p>During the whole time of his government, he never erected any noble edifice; for the only things he did undertake, namely, building the temple of Augustus, and restoring Pompey's Theatre, he left at last, after many years, unfinished.
Nor did he ever entertain the people with public spectacles; and he was seldom present at those which were given by others, lest any thing of that kind should be requested of him; especially after he was obliged to give freedom to the comedian Actius.
Having relieved the poverty of a few senators, to avoid further demands, he declared that he should for the future assist none, but those who gave the senate full satisfaction as to the cause of their necessity.
Upon this, most of the needy senators, from modesty and shame, declined troubling him.
Amongst these was Hortalus, grandson to the celebrated orator Quintus Hortensius, who [marrying], by the persuasion of Augustus, had brought up four children upon a very small estate.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="48">
<p>He displayed only two instances of public munificence.
One was an offer to lend gratis, for three years, a hundred millions of sesterces to those who wanted to borrow; and the other, when, some large houses being burnt down upon Mount Coelius, he indemnified the owners.
To the former of these he was compelled by the clamours of the people, in a great scarcity of money, when he had ratified a decree of the senate obliging all money-lenders to advance two-thirds of their capital on land, and the debtors to pay off at once the same proportion of their debts, and it was found insufficient to remedy the grievance.
The other he did to alleviate in some degree the pressure of the times.
But his benefaction to the sufferers by fire, he estimated at so high a rate, that he ordered the Coelian Hill to be called, in future, the Augustan.
To the soldiery, after doubling
the legacy left them by Augustus, he never gave any thing, except a thousand denarii a man to the pretorian guards, for not joining the party of Sejanus; and some presents to the legions in <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>, because they alone had not paid reverence to the effigies of Sejanus among their standards.
He seldom gave discharges to the veteran soldiers, calculating on their deaths from advanced age, and on what would be saved by thus getting rid of them, in the way of rewards or pensions.
Nor did he ever relieve the provinces by any act of generosity, excepting <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, where some cities had been destroyed by an earthquake.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="49">
<p>In the course of a very short time, he turned his mind to sheer robbery.
It is certain that Cneius Lentulus, the augur, a man of vast estate, was so terrified and worried by his threats and importunities, that he was obliged to make him his heir; and that Lepida, a lady of a very noble family, was condemned by him, in order to gratify Quirinus, a man of consular rank, extremely rich, and childless, who had divorced her twenty years before, and now charged her with an old design to poison him.
Several persons, likewise, of the first distinction in <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>, and <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, had their estates confiscated upon such despicably trifling and shameless pretences, that against some of them no other charge was preferred, than that they held large sums of ready money as part of their property.
Old immunities, the rights of mining, and of levying tolls, were taken from several cities and private persons.
And Vonones, king of the Parthians, who had been driven out of his dominions by his own subjects, and fled to <placeName key="tgn,7002351">Antioch</placeName> with a vast treasure, claiming the protection of the Roman people, his allies, was treacherously robbed of all his money, and afterwards murdered.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="50">
<p>He first manifested hatred towards his own relations in the case of his brother Drusus, betraying him by the production of a letter to himself, in which Drusus proposed that Augustus should be forced to restore the public liberty.
In course of time, he shewed the same disposition with regard to the rest of his family.
So far was he from performing any office of kindness or humanity to his wife, when she was banished, and, by her father's order, confined to one town, that he forbad her to stir out of the house, or converse with any men.
He even wronged her of the dowry given her by her father, and her yearly allowance, by a quibble of law, because Augustus had made no provision for them on her behalf in his will.
Being harassed by his mother, Livia, who claimed an equal share in the government with him, he frequently avoided seeing her, and all long and private conferences with her, lest it should be thought that he was governed by her counsels, which, notwithstanding, he sometimes sought, and was in the habit of adopting.
He was much offended at the senate, when they proposed to add to his other titles that of the Son of Livia, as well as Augustus.
He, therefore, would not suffer her to be called " the Mother of her country," nor to receive any extraordinary public distinction.
Nay, he frequently admonished her " not to meddle with weighty affairs, and such as did not suit her sex;" especially when he found her present at a fire which broke out near the Temple of Vesta,<note anchored="yes">The Temple of Vesta, like that dedicated to the same goddess at <placeName key="tgn,2093740">Tivoli</placeName>, is round.
There was probably one on the same site, and in the same circular form, erected by Numa Pompilius; the present edifice is far too elegant for that age, but there is no record of its erection, but it is known to have been repaired by Vespasian or Domitian after being injured by <placeName key="tgn,2538428">Nero</placeName>'s fire.

This beautiful temple is still in good preservation.

<p>He afterwards proceeded to an open rupture with her, and, as is said, upon this occasion.
She having frequently urged him to place among the judges a person who had been made free of the, city, he refused her request, unless she would allow it to be inscribed on the roll, "That the appointment had been extorted from him by his mother."
Enraged at this, <placeName key="tgn,2039991">Livia</placeName> brought forth from her chapel some letters from Augustus to her, complaining of the sourness and insolence of <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>'s temper, and these she read.
So much was he offended at these letters having been kept so long, and now produced with so much bitterness against him, that some considered this incident as one of the causes of his going into seclusion, if not the principal reason for so doing.
In the whole years he lived during his retirement, he saw her but once, and that for a few hours only.
When she fell sick shortly afterwards, he was quite unconcerned about visiting her in her illness; and when she died, after promising to attend her funeral, he deferred his coming for several days, so that the corpse was in a state of decay and putrefaction before die interment; and he then forbad divine honours being paid to her, pretending that he acted according to her own directions.
He likewise annulled her will, and in a short time ruined all her friends and acquaintance; not even sparing those to whom, on her death-bed, she had recommended the care of her funeral, but condemning one of them, a man of equestrian rank, to the tread-mill.<note anchored="yes">Antlia; a machine for drawing up water in a series of connected buckets, which was worked by the feet, nisupedum.</note></p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="52">
<p>He entertained no paternal affection either for his own son Drusus, or his adopted son Germanicus.
Offended at the vices of the former, who was of a loose disposition and led a dissolute life, he was not much affected at his death; but, almost immediately after the funeral, resumed his attention to business, and prevented the courts from being longer closed.
The ambassadors from the people of <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilium</placeName> coming rather late to offer their condolence, he said to them by way of banter, as if the affair had already faded from his memory, "And I heartily condole with you on the loss of your renowned countryman <placeName key="tgn,2069653">Hector</placeName>."
He so much affected to depreciate Germanicus, that he spoke of his achievements as utterly insignificant, and railed at his most glorious victories as ruinous to the state; complaining of him also to the senate for going to <placeName key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName> without his knowledge, upon occasion of a great and sudden famine at <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>.
It was believed that he took care to have him dispatched by Cneius Piso, his lieutenant in <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>.
This person was afterwards tried for the murder, and would, as was supposed, have produced his orders, had they not been contained in a private and confidential dispatch.
The follo-ring words therefore were posted up in many placez, and frequently shouted in the night: "Give us back our Germanicus."
This suspicion was afterwards confirmed by the barbarous treatment of his wife and children.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="53">
<p>His daughter-in-law Agrippina, after the death of
her husband, complaining upon some occasion with more than ordinary freedom, he took her by the hand, and addressed her in a Greek verse to this effect: "My dear child, do you think yourself injured, because you are not empress?"  Nor did he ever vouchsafe to speak to her again.
Upon her refusing once at supper to taste some fruit which he presented to her, he declined inviting her to his table, pretending that she in effect charged him with a design to poison her; whereas the whole was a contrivance of his own.
He was to offer the fruit, and she to be privately cautioned against eating what would infallibly cause her death.
At last, having her accused of intending to flee for refuge to the statue of Augustus, or to the army, he banished her to the island of Pandataria.
<note anchored="yes">The elder Agrippina was banished to this island by Augustus. See. c. lxiii. of his life.

Upon her reviling him for it, he caused a centurion to beat out one of her eyes; and when she resolved to starve herself to death, he ordered her mouth to be forced open, and meat to be crammed down her throat.
But she persisting in her resolution, and dying soon afterwards, he persecuted her memory with the basest aspersions, and persuaded the senate to put her birth-day amongst the number of unlucky days in the calendar.
He likewise took credit for not having caused her to be strangled and her body cast upon the Gemonian Steps, and suffered a decree of the senate to pass, thanking him for his clemency, and an offering of gold to be made to Jupiter Capitolinus on the occasion.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="54">
<p>He had by Germanicus three grandsons, <placeName key="tgn,2538429">Nero</placeName>, Drusus, and Caius; and by his son Drusus one, named Tiberius.
Of these, after the loss of his sons, he commended Nero and Drusus, the two eldest sons of Germanicus, to the senate; and at their being solemnly in
troduced into the forum, distributed money among the people.
But when he found that on entering upon the new year they were included in the public vows for his own welfare, he told the senate, " that such honours ought not to be conferred but upon those who had been proved, and were of more advanced years."
By thus betraying his private feelings towards them,' he exposed them to all sorts of accusations; and after practising many artifices to provoke them to rail at and abuse him, that he might be furnished with a pretence to destroy them, he charged them with it in a letter to the senate: and at the same time accusing them, in the bitterest terms, of the most scandalous vices.
Upon their being declared enemies by the senate, he starved them to death; Nero in the island of <placeName key="tgn,7006720">Ponza</placeName>, and Drusus in the vaults of the Palatium.
It is thought by some that Nero was driven to a voluntary death by the executioner's shewing him some halters and hooks, as if he had been sent to him by order of the senate.
Drusus, it is said, was so rabid with hunger, that he attempted to eat the chaff with which his mattress was stuffed.

<p>Besides his old friends and intimate acquaintance, he required the assistance of twenty of the most eminent persons in the city, as counsellors in the administration of public affairs.

his master in rhetoric, first discovered, and expressed by a very opposite simile, calling him sometimes, when he chid him, "Mud mixed with blood."
But his disposition shewed itself still more clearly on his attaining the imperial power, and even in the beginning of his administration, when he was endeavouring to gain the popular favour, by affecting moderation.
Upon a funeral passing by, a wag called out to the dead man, "Tell Augustus, that the legacies he bequeathed to the people are not yet paid."
The man being brought before him, he ordered that he should receive what was due to him, and then be led to execution, that he might deliver the message to his father himself.
Not long afterwards, when one Pompey, a Roman knight, persisted in his opposition to something he proposed in the senate, he threatened to put him  in prison, and told him, "Of a Pompey I shall make a Pompeian of you;" by a bitter kind of pun playing upon the man's name, and the ill-fortune of his party.</p></div2>

<p>About the same time, when the praetor consulted him, whether it was his pleasure that the tribunals should take cognizance of accusations of treason, he replied, "The laws ought to be put in execution;" and he did put them in execution most severely.
Some person had taken off the head of Augustus from  one of his statues, and replaced it by another.<note anchored="yes">It mattered not that the head substituted was Tiberius's own.
</note> The matter was brought before the senate, and because the case was not clear, the witnesses were put to the torture.
The party accused being found guilty, and condemned, this kind of proceeding was carried so far, that it became capital for a man to beat his slave, or change his clothes, near the statue of Augustus; to carry his head stamped upon the coin, or cut in the stone of a ring, into a necessary house, or the stews; or to reflect upon anything that had been either said or done by him.
In fine, a person was condemned to death, for suffering some honours to be decreed to him in the colony where he lived, upon the same day on which they had formerly been decreed to Augustus.</p></div2>

At first he would have it understood, that these satirical verses were drawn forth by the resentment of those who were impatient under the discipline of reformation, rather than that they spoke,their real sentiments; and he would frequently say, "Let them hate me, so long as they do but approve my conduct."<note anchored="yes"><quote lang="la">Oderint dum probent</quote>: Caligula used a similar expression;  <quote lang="la">Oderint dum metuant.</quote></note>

<p>A few days after his arrival at <placeName key="tgn,7006855">Capri</placeName>, a fisherman coming up to him unexpectedly, when he was desirous of privacy, and presenting him with a large mullet, he ordered the man's face to be scrubbed with the fish; being terrified with the thought of his having been able to creep upon him from the back of the island, over such rugged and steep rocks.
The man, while undergoing the punishment, expressing his joy that he had not likewise offered him a large crab which he had also taken, he ordered his face to be farther lacerated with its claws.
He put to death one of the pretorian guards, for having stolen a peacock out of his orchard.
In one of his journeys, his litter being obstructed by some bushes, he ordered the officer whose duty it was to ride on and examine the road, a centurion of the first cohorts, to be laid on his face upon the ground, and scourged almost to death.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="61">
<p>Soon afterwards, he abandoned himself to every species of cruelty, never wanting occasions of one kind or another, to serve as a pretext.
He first fell upon the friends and acquaintances of his mother, then those of his grandsons, and his daughter-in-law, and lastly those of Sejanus; after whose death he became cruel in the extreme.
From this it appeared, that he had not been so much instigated by Sejanus, as supplied with occasions of gratifying his savage temper, when he wanted them.
Though in a short memoir which he composed of his own life, he had the effrontery to write, "I have punished Sejanus, because I found him bent upon the destruction of the children of my son Germanicus," one of these he put to death, when he began to suspect Sejanus; and another, after he was taken off.
It would be tedious to relate all the numerous instances of his cruelty: suffice it to give a few examples, in their different kinds.
Not a day passed without the punishment of some person or
other, not excepting holidays, or those appropriated to the worship of the gods.
Some were tried even on NewYear's-Day.
Of many who were condemned, their wives and children shared the same fate; and for those who Were sentenced to death, the relations were forbid to put on mourning.
Considerable rewards were voted for the prosecutors, and sometimes for the witnesses also.
The information of any person, without exception, was taken; and all offences were capital, even speaking a few words, though without any ill intention.
A poet was charged with abusing Agamemnon; and a historian,<note anchored="yes">A. U. C. 778.  Tacit. Annal. iv. The historian's name was A. Cremutius Cordo.

The two authors were immediately called to account, and their writings suppressed; though they had been well received some years before, and read in the hearing of Augustus.
Some, who were thrown into prison, were not only denied the solace of study, but debarred from all company and conversation.
Many persons, when summoned to trial, stabbed themselves at home, to avoid the distress and ignominy of a public condemnation, which they were certain would ensue.
Others took poison in the senate-house.
The wounds were bound up, and all who had not expired, were carried, half-dead, and panting for life, to prison.
Those who were put to death, were thrown down the Gemonian stairs, and then dragged into the <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName>.
In one day, twenty were treated  in this manner; and amongst them  women and boys.
Because, according to an ancient custom, it was not lawful to strangle virgins, the young girls were first deflowered by the executioner, and afterwards strangled.
Those who were desirous to die, were forced to live.
For he thought death so slight a punishment, that upon hearing that Carnulius, one of the accused, who was under prosecution, had killed himself," he exclaimed, "Carnulius has escaped me."  In calling over his prisoners, when one of them requested the favour of a speedy death, he replied, " You are not yet restored to favour."
A man of consular rank writes in his annals, that at table, where he himself was present with a large company, he was suddenly asked aloud by a dwarf who stood by amongst the buffoons, why Paconius, who was under prosecution for treason, lived so long.
Tiberius immediately reprimanded him for his pertness; but wrote to the senate a few days after, to proceed without delay to the punishment of Paconius.</p></div2>

<p>Exasperated by information he received respect

Sejanus, he spared no one from torture and death. He
was so entirely occupied with the examination of this
affair, for whole days together, that, upon being informed

and whom  he had by a friendly letter invited to <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>,
was arrived, he ordered him immediately to be put to the
torture, as a party concerned in the enquiry. Upon finding his mistake, he commanded him to be put to death,
that he might not publish the injury done him. The place
of execution is still shown at <placeName key="tgn,7006855">Capri</placeName>, where he ordered
those who were condemned to die, after long and exquisite tortures, to be thrown, before his eyes, from a precipice into the sea.

Had not death prevented him, and Thrasyllus, designedly, as some say, prevailed with him to defer some of his cruelties, in hopes of longer life, it is believed that he would have destroyed many more; and not have spared even the rest of his grand-children: for he was jealous of Caius, and hated Tiberius as having been conceived in adultery.
This conjecture is indeed highly probable; for he used often to say, "Happy Priam, who survived all his children!"<note anchored="yes">Priam is said to have had no less than fifty sons and daughters; some of the latter, however, survived him, as Hecuba, <placeName key="tgn,7013701">Helena</placeName>, Polyxena, and others.

<p>Amidst these enormities, in how much fear and apprehension, as well as odium and detestation, he lived, is evident from many indications.
He forbade the soothsayers to be consulted in private, and without some witnesses being present.

More than one person of consular rank, appointed governors of provinces, he never ventured to dismiss to their respective destinations, but kept them until several years after, when he nominated their successors, while they still remained present with him.
In the meantime they bore the title of their office; and he frequently gave them
orders, which they took care to have executed by their deputies and assistants.</p></div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="65">
<p>After Sejanus had plotted against him, though he saw that his birth-day was solemnly kept by the public, and divine honours paid to golden images of him in every quarter, yet it was with difficulty at last, and more by artifice than his imperial power, that he accomplished his death.
In the first place, to remove him from about his person, under the pretext of doing him honour, he made him his colleague in his fifth consulship; which, although then absent from the city, he took upon him for that purpose, long after his preceding consulship.
Then, having flattered him with the hope of an alliance by marriage with one of his own kindred, and the prospect of the tribunitian authority, he suddenly, while Sejanus little expected it, charged him with treason, in an abject and pitiful address to the senate; in which, among other things, he begged them "to send one of the consuls, to conduct himself, a poor solitary old man, with a guard of soldiers, into their presence."
Still distrustful, however, and apprehensive of an insurrection, he ordered his grandson, Drusus, whom he still kept in confinement at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, to be set at liberty, and if occasion required, to head the troops.
He had likewise ships in readiness to transport him to any of the legions to which he might consider it expedient to make his escape.
Meanwhile, he was upon the watch, from the summit of a lofty cliff, for the signals which he had ordered to be made if any
thing occurred, lest the messengers should be tardy.
Even when he had quite foiled the conspiracy of Sejanus, he was still haunted as much as ever with fears and apprehensions, insomuch that he never once stirred out of the Villa Jovis for nine months after.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="66">
<p>To the extreme anxiety of mind which he now experienced, he had the mortification to find superadded the most poignant reproaches from all quarters.
Those who were condemned to die, heaped upon him the most opprobrious language in his presence, or by hand-bills scattered in the senators' seats in the theatre.
These produced different effects: sometimes he wished, out of shame, to have all smothered and concealed; at other times he would disregard what was said, and publish it himself.
To this accumulation of scandal and open sarcasm, there is to be subjoined a letter from Artabanus, king of the Parthians, in which he upbraids him with his parricides, murders, cowardice, and lewdness, and advises him to satisfy the furious rage of his own people, which he had so justly excited, by putting an end to his life without delay.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="67">
<p>At last, being quite weary with himself, he acknowledged his extreme misery, in a letter to the senate, which begun thus: "What to write to you, Conscript Fathers, or how to write, or what not to write at this time, may all the gods and goddesses pour upon my head a more terrible vengeance than that under which I feel myself daily sinking, if I can tell."
Some are of opinion that he had a foreknowledge of those things, from his skill in the science of divination, and perceived long before what misery and infamy would at last come upon him; and that for this reason, at the beginning of his reign, he had absolutely refused the title of the " Father of his Country," and the proposal of the senate to
swear to his acts; lest he should afterwards, to his greater shame, be found unequal to such extraordinary honours.
This, indeed, may be justly inferred from the speeches which he made upon both those occasions; as when he says, " I shall ever be the same, and shall never change my conduct, so long as I retain my senses; but to avoid giving a bad precedent to posterity, the senate ought to beware of binding themselves to the acts of any person whatever, who might by some accident or other be induced to alter them."
And again: " If ye should at any time entertain a jealousy of my conduct, and my entire affection for you, which heaven prevent by putting a period to my days, rather than I should live to see such an alteration in your opinion of me, the title of Father will add no honour to me, but be a reproach to you, for your rashness in conferring it upon me, or inconsistency in altering your opinion of me."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="68">
<p>In person he was large and robust; of a stature somewhat above the common size; broad in the shoulders and chest, and proportionable in the rest of his frame.
He used his left hand more readily and with more force than his right; and his joints were so strong, that he could bore a fresh, sound apple through with his finger, and wound the head of a boy, or even a young man, with a fillip.
He was of a fair complexion, and wore his hair so long behind, that it covered his neck, which was observed to be a mark of distinction affected by the family.
He had a handsome face, but it was often full of pimples.
His eyes, which were large, had a wonderful faculty of seeing in the night-time, and in the dark, for a short time only, and immediately after awaking from sleep; but they soon grew dim again.
He walked with his neck stiff and upright; generally with a frowning countenance, being for the most part silent: when he
spoke to those about him, it was very slowly, and usually accompanied with a slight gesticulation of his fingers.
All which, being repulsive habits and signs of arrogance, were remarked by Augustus, who often endeavoured to excuse them  to the senate and people, declaring that "they were natural defects, which proceeded from  no viciousness of mind."
He enjoyed a good state of health, without interruption, almost during the whole period of his rule; though, from the thirtieth year of his age, he treated himself according to his own discretion, without any medical assistance.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="69">
<p>In regard to the gods, and matters of religion, he discovered much indifference; being greatly addicted to astrology, and fully persuaded that all things were governed by fate.
Yet he was extremely afraid of lightning, and when the sky was in a disturbed state, always wore a laurel crown on his head; because it is supposed that the leaf of that tree is never touched by the lightning.</p></div2>

<p>He applied himself with great diligence to the liberal arts, both Greek and Latin.
In his Latin style, he affected to imitate the Messala Corvinus,<note anchored="yes">He is mentioned before in the Life of AUGUSTUS, c. lviii, and also by Horace, Cicero, and Tacitus.
</note>
a venerable man, to whom he had paid much respect in his own early years.
But he rendered his style obscure by excessive affectation and abstruseness, so that he was thought to speak better extempore, than in a premeditated discourse.
He composed likewise a lyric ode, under the title of " A Lamentation upon the Death of Lucius Caesar; " and also some Greek poems, in imitation of Euphorion, Rhianus, and Parthenius.<note anchored="yes">Obscure Greek poets, whose writings were either full of fabulous stories, or of an amatory kind.
</note>
 These poets he greatly admired, and placed
their works and statues in the public libraries, amongst the eminent authors of antiquity.
On this account, most of the learned men of the time vied with each other in publishing observations upon them, which they addressed to him.
His principal study, however, was the history of the fabulous ages, inquiring even into its trifling details in a ridiculous manner; for he used to try the grammarians, a class of men which, as I have already observed, he much affected, with such questions as these: "Who was Hecuba's mother? What name did Achilles assume among the virgins? What was it that the Sirens used to sing?" And the first day that he entered the senate-house, after the death of Augustus, as if he intended to pay respect at once to his father's memory and to the gods, he made an offering of frankincense and wine, but without any music, in imitation of Minos, upon the death of his son.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="71">
<p>Though he was ready and conversant with the Greek tongue, yet he did not use it everywhere; but chiefly he avoided it in the senate-house, insomuch that having occasion to employ the word monopolium  (monopoly), he first begged pardon for being obliged to adopt a foreign word.
And when, in a decree of the senate, the word <foreign lang="greek">e)/mblhma</foreign> (emblem) was read, he proposed to have it changed, and that a Latin word should be substituted in its room; or, if no proper one could be found, to express the thing by circumlocution.

<p>During the whole time of his seclusion at
<placeName key="tgn,7006855">Capri</placeName>, twice only he made an effort to visit <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.

as far as the seventh mile-stone from the city, but he immediately returned, without entering it, having only taken a view of the walls at a distance.
For what reason he did not disembark in his first excursion, is uncertain; but in the last, he was deterred from entering the city by a prodigy.
He was in the habit of diverting himself with a snake, and upon going to feed it with his own hand, according to custom, he found it devoured by ants: from which he was advised to beware of the fury of the mob.

And to obviate any suspicion of his being in a bad state of health, he was not only present at the sports in the camp, but encountered, with javelins, a wild boar, which was let loose in the arena.
Being immediately seized with a pain in the side, and catching cold upon his overheating himself in the exercise, he relapsed into a worse condition than he was before.

For Charicles, a physician, having obtained leave of absence, on his rising from table, took his hand to kiss it; upon which Tiberius, supposing he did it to feel his pulse, desired him to stay and resume his place, and continued the entertainment longer than usual.
Nor did he omit his usual custom of taking his station in the centre of the apartment, a lictor standing by him, while he took leave of each of the party by name.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="73">
<p>Meanwhile, finding, upon looking over the acts of the senate, "that some person under prosecution had been discharged, without being brought to a hearing," for he had only written cursorily that they had been denounced by an informer; he complained in a great rage that he was treated with contempt, and resolved at all hazards to return to <placeName key="tgn,7006855">Capri</placeName>; not daring to attempt any thing until he found himself in a place of security.
But being detained by storms, and the increasing violence of his disorder, he died shortly afterwards, at a villa formerly belonging to Lucullus, in the seventy-eighth year of his age,

when, on his recovering from a swoon, he called for his ring, which had been taken from him in the fit.
<placeName key="tgn,1002882">Seneca</placeName> writes, "That finding himself dying, he took his signet ring off his finger, and held it a while, as if he would deliver it to somebody; but put it again upon his finger, and lay for some time, with his left hand clenched, and without stirring; when suddenly summoning his attendants, and no one answering the call, he rose; but his strength failing him, he fell down at a short distance from his bed."</p></div2>

<p>Upon his last birth-day, he had brought a full-sized statue of the Timenian Apollo from <placeName key="tgn,7014561">Syracuse</placeName>, a work of exquisite art, intending to place it in the library of the new temple;<note anchored="yes">In the temple of the Palatine Apollo.

A few days before he died, the Pharos at <placeName key="tgn,7006855">Capri</placeName> was thrown down by an  earthquake.
And at <placeName key="tgn,7010130">Misenum</placeName>, some embers and live coals, which were brought in to warm his apartment, went out, and after being quite cold, burst out into a flame again towards evening, and continued burning very brightly for several hours.</p></div2>

<p>The people were so much elated at his death, that when they first heard the news, they ran up and down the city, some, crying out "Away with Tiberius to the <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName>;" others exclaiming, "May the earth, the common mother of mankind, and the infernal gods, allow him no abode in death, but amongst the wicked."
Others threatened his body with the hook and the Gemonian
stairs, their indignation at his former cruelty being increased by a recent atrocity.
It had been provided by an act of the senate, that the execution of condemned criminals should always be deferred until the tenth day after the sentence.
Now this fell on the very day when the news of Tiberius's death arrived, and in consequence of which the unhappy men implored a reprieve, for mercy's sake; but.
as Caius had not yet arrived, and there was no one else to whom application could be made on their behalf, their guards, apprehensive of violating the law, strangled them, and threw them down the Gemonian stairs.
This roused the people to a still greater abhorrence of the tyrant's memory, since his cruelty continued in use even after he was dead.

<head>Remarks on <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName></head>
<p>At the death of Augustus, there had elapsed so long a period from the overthrow of the republic by Julius Caesar, that few were now living who had been born under the ancient constitution of the Romans; and the mild and prosperous administration of Augustus, during forty-four years, had by this time reconciled the minds of the people to a despotic government.
<placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>, the adopted son of the former sovereign, was of mature age; and though he had hitherto lived, for the most part, abstracted from any concern with public affairs, yet, having been brought up in the family of Augustus, he was acquainted with his method of government, which, there was reason to expect, he would render the model of his own.
<placeName key="tgn,2039991">Livia</placeName>, too, his mother, and the relict of the late emperor, was still living, a woman venerable by years, who had long been familiar with the councils of Augustus, and from her high rank, as well as uncommon affability, possessed an extensive influence amongst all classes of the people.</p>
<p>Such were the circumstances in favour of <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>'s succession at the demise of Augustus; but there were others of a tendency disadvantageous to his views.
His temper was haughty and reserved: Augustus had often apologised for the ungraciousness of his manners.
He was disobedient to his mother; and though he had not openly discovered any propensity to vice, he enjoyed none of those qualities which usually conciliate popularity.
To these considerations it is to be added, that Postumus Agrippa, the grandson of Augustus by <placeName key="tgn,2428630">Julia</placeName>, was living; and if consanguinity was to be the rule of succession, his right was indisputably preferable to that of an adopted son.
Augustus had sent this youth into exile a few years before; but, towards the close of his life, had expressed a design of recalling him, with the view, as was supposed, of appointing him his successor.
The father of young Agrippa had been greatly beloved by the Romans; and the fate of his mother, <placeName key="tgn,2428630">Julia</placeName>, though she was notorious for her profligacy, had ever been regarded by them with peculiar sympathy and tenderness.
Many, therefore, attached to the son the partiality entertained for his parents; which was increased not only by a strong suspicion, but a general surmise, that his elder brothers, Caius and <placeName key="tgn,2023439">Lucius</placeName>, had been violently taken off, to make way for the succession of <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>.
That an obstruction was apprehended to <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>'s succession from this quarter, is put beyond all doubt, when we find that the death of Augustus was industriously kept secret, until young Agrippa should be removed; who, it is generally agreed, was dispatched by an order from <placeName key="tgn,2039991">Livia</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName> conjointly, or at least from the former.
Though, by this act, there reilained no rival to <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>, yet the consciousness of his own want of
pretensions to the Roman throne, seems to have still rendered him distrustful of the succession; and that he should have quietly obtained it, without the voice of the people, the real inclination of the senate, or the support of the army, can be imputed only to the influence of his mother, and his own dissimulation.
Ardently solicitous to attain the object, yet affecting a total indifference; artfully prompting the senate to give him the charge of the government, at the time that he intimated an invincible reluctance to accept it; his absolutely declining it in perpetuity, but fixing no time for an abdication; his deceitful insinuation of bodily infirmities, with hints likewise of approaching old age, that he might allay in the senate all apprehensions of any great duration of nis power, and repress in his adopted son, Germanicus, the emotions of ambition to displace him; form altogether a scene of the most insidious policy, inconsistency, and dissimulation.</p>
<p>In this period died, in the eighty-sixth year of her age, Livia Drusilla, mother of the emperor, and the relict of Augustus, whom she survived fifteen years.
She was the daughter of I Drusus Calidianus and married <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName> Claudius Nero, by whom she had two sons, Tiberius and Drusus.
The conduct of this lady seems to justify the remark of Caligula, that " she was an <placeName key="tgn,2446724">Ulysses</placeName> in a woman's dress."
Octavius first saw her as she fled from the danger which threatened her husband, who had espoused the cause of Antony; and though she was then pregnant, he resolved to marry her; whether with her own inclination or not, is left by Tacitus undetermined.
To pave the way for this union, he divorced his wife Scribonia, and with the approbation of the Augurs, which he could have no difficulty in obtaining, celebrated his nuptials with <placeName key="tgn,2039991">Livia</placeName>.
There ensued from this marriage no issue, though much desired by both parties; but <placeName key="tgn,2039991">Livia</placeName> retained, without interruption, an unbounded ascendancy over the emperor, whose confidence she abused, while the uxorious husband little suspected that he was cherishing in his bosom a viper who was to prove the destruction of his house.
She appears to have entertained a predominant ambition of giving an heir to the Roman empire; and since it could not be done by any fruit of her marriage with Augustus, she resolved on accomplishing that end in the person of <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>, the eldest son by her former husband.
The plan which she devised for this purpose, was to exterminate all the male offspring of Augustus by his daughter Julia, who was married to Agrippa; a stratagem which, when executed,.would procure for <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>, through the means of adoption, the eventual succession to the empire.
The cool yet sanguinary policy, and the patient perseverance of resolution, with which she prosecuted her design, have seldom been equalled.
While the sons of <placeName key="tgn,2428630">Julia</placeName> were yet young, and while there was still a possibility that she herself might have issue by Augustus, she suspended her project, in the hope, perhaps, that accident or disease might operate in its favour; but when the natural term of her constitution had put a period to her hopes of progeny, and when the grandsons of the emperor were risen to the years of manhood, and had been adopted by him, she began to carry into execution what she long had meditated.
The first object devoted to destruction was C. Caesar Agrippa, the eldest of Augustus's grandsons.
This promising youth was sent to <placeName key="tgn,1023711">Armenia</placeName>, upon an expedition against the Persians; and Lollius, who had been his governor, either accompanied him thither from <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, or met him in the East, where he had obtained some appointment.
From the hand of this traitor, perhaps under the pretext of exercising the authority of a preceptor, but in reality instigated by <placeName key="tgn,2039991">Livia</placeName>, the young prince received a fatal blow, of which he died some time after.</p>
<p>The manner of Caius's death seems to have been carefully kept from the knowledge of Augustus, who promoted Lollius to the consulship, and made him governor of a province; but, by his rapacity in this station, he afterwards incurred the emperor's displeasure.
The true character of this person had escaped the keen discernment of <placeName key="tgn,2399199">Horace</placeName>, as well as the sagacity of the emperor; for in two epistles addressed to Lollius, he mentions him as great and accomplished in the superlative degree; <foreign lang="la">maxime Lolli, liberrime Lolli</foreign>; so imposing had been the manners and address of this deceitfnl courtier.</p>
<p><placeName key="tgn,2023439">Lucius</placeName>, the second son of <placeName key="tgn,2024572">Julia</placeName>, was banished into <placeName key="tgn,7003005">Campania</placeName>, for using, as it is said, seditious language against his grandfather.
In the seventh year of his exile, Augustus proposed to recall him; but <placeName key="tgn,2039991">Livia</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>, dreading the consequences of his being restored to the emperor's favour, put in practice the expedient of having him immediately assassinated.
Postumus Agrippa, the third son, incurred the displeasure of his grandfather in the same way as <placeName key="tgn,2023439">Lucius</placeName>, and was confined at <placeName key="tgn,7004648">Surrentum</placeName>, where he remained a prisoner until he was put to death by the order either of <placeName key="tgn,2039991">Livia</placeName> alone, or in conjunction with <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>, as was before observed.</p>
<p>Such was the catastrophe, through the means of <placeName key="tgn,2039991">Livia</placeName>, of all the grandsons of Augustus; and reason justifies the inference, that she who scrupled not to lay violent hands upon those young men, had formerly practised every artifice that could operate towards rendering them obnoxious to the emperor.
We may even ascribe to her dark intrigues the dissolute conduct of <placeName key="tgn,2024572">Julia</placeName>: for the woman who could secretly act as procuress to her own husband, would feel little restraint upon her
mind against corrupting his daughter, when such an effect might contribute to answer the purpose which she had in view.
But in the ingratitude of <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>, however undutiful and reprehensible in a son towards a parent, she at last experienced a just retribution for the crimes in which she had trained him to procure the succession to the empire.
To the disgrace of her sex, she introduced amongst the Romans the horrible practice of domestic murder, little known before the times when the thirst or intoxication of unlimited power had vitiated the social affections; and she transmitted to succeeding ages a pernicious example, by which immoderate ambition might be gratified, at the expense of every moral obligation, as well as of humanity.</p>
<p>One of the first victims in the sanguinary reign of the present emperor, was Germanicus, the son of Drusus, <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>'s own brother, and who had been adopted by his uncle himself.
Under any sovereign, of a temper different from that of <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>, this amiable and meritorious prince would have been held in the highest esteem.
At the death of his grandfather Augustus, he was employed in a war in <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, where he greatly distinguished himself by his military achievements; and as soon as intelligence of that event arrived, the soldiers, by whom he was extremely beloved, unanimously saluted him emperor.
Refusing, however, to accept this mark of their partiality, he persevered in allegiance to the government of his uncle, and prosecuted the war with success.
Upon the conclusion of this expedition, he was sent, with the title of emperor in the East, to repress the seditions of the Armenians, in which he was equally successful.
But the fame which he acquired, served only to render him an object of jealousy to <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>, by whose order he was secretly poisoned at <placeName key="tgn,2275537">Daphne</placeName>, near <placeName key="tgn,2073463">Antioch</placeName>, in the thirtyfourth year of his age.
The news of Germanicus's death was received at <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> with universal lamentation; and all ranks of the people entertained an opinion, that, had he survived <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>, he would have restored the freedom of the republic.
The love and grditude of the Romans decreed many honours to his memory.
It was ordered, that his name should be sung in a solemn procession of the Salii; that crowns of oak, in allusion to his victories, should be placed upon curule chairs in the hall pertaining to the priests of Augustus; and that an effigy of him in ivory should be drawn upon a chariot, preceding the ceremonies of the Circensian games.
Triumphal arches were erected, one at <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, another on the banks of the <placeName key="tgn,7012611">Rhine</placeName>, and a third upon Mount Amanus in <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>, with inscriptions of his achievements, and
that he died for his services to the republic.<note anchored="yes">Tacit. Annal. lib. ii.</note></p>
<p>His obsequies were celebrated, not with the display of images and funeral pomp, but with the recital of his praises and the virtues which rendered him illustrious.
From a resemblance in his personal accomplishments, his age, the manner of his death, and the vicinity of <placeName key="tgn,7010768">Daphne</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName>, many compared his fate to that of Alexander the Great.
He was celebrated for humanity and benevolence, as well as military talents, and amidst the toils of war, found leisure to cultivate the arts of literary genius.
He composed two comedies in Greek, some epigrams, and a translation of Aratus into Latin verse.
He married Agrippina, the daughter of M. Agrippa, by whom he had nine children.
This lady, who had accompanied her husband into the east, carried his ashes to <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, and accused his murderer, Piso; who, unable to bear up against the public odium incurred by that transaction, laid violent hands upon himself.
Agrippina was now nearly in the same predicament with regard to Tiberius, that Ovid had formerly been in respect of Augustus.
He was sensible, that when she accused Piso, she was not ignorant of the person by whom the perpetrator of the murder had been instigated; and her presence, therefore, seeming continually to reproach him with his guilt, he resolved to rid himself of a person become so obnoxious to his sight, and banished her to the island of Pandataria, where she died some time afterwards with famine.</p>
<p>But it was not sufficient to gratify this sanguinary tyrant, that he had, without any cause, cut off both Germanicus and his wife Agrippina: the distinguished merits and popularity of that prince were yet to be revenged upon his children; and accordingly he set himself to invent a pretext for their destruction.
After endeavouring in vain, by various artifices, to provoke the resentment of <placeName key="tgn,2538429">Nero</placeName> and Drusus against him, he had recourse to false accusation, and not only charged them with seditious designs, to which their tender years were ill adapted, but with vices of a nature the most scandalous.
By a sentence of the senate, which manifested the extreme servility of that assembly, he procured them both to be declared open enemies to their country.
<placeName key="tgn,2538429">Nero</placeName> he banished to the island'of Pontia, where, like his unfortunate mother, he miserably perished by famine; and Drusus was doomed to the same fate, in the lower part of the Palatium, after suffering for nine days the violence of hunger, and having, as is related, devoured part of his bed.
The remaining son, Caius, on account of his vicious disposition, he resolved to appoint his successor on the throne, that, after his own death, a comparison might be made in favour of his own memory, when the Romans should be governed by a sovereign yet more vicious and more tyrannical, if possible, than himself.</p>
<p>Sejanus, the minister in the present reign, imitated with success, for some time, the hypocrisy of his master; and, had his ambitious temper, impatient of attaining its object, allowed him to wear the mask for a longer period, he might have gained the imperial diadem; in the pursuit of which he was overtaken by that fate which he merited still more by his cruelties than his perfidy to Tiberms.
This man was a native of Volsinium in <placeName key="tgn,7009760">Tuscany</placeName>, and the son of a Roman knight.
He had first insinuated himself into the favour of Caius Caesar, the grandson of Augustus, after whose death he courted the friendship of Tiberius, and obtained m a short time his entire confidence, which he improved to the best advantage.
The object which he next pursued, was to gain the attachment of the senate, and the officers of the army; besides whom, with a new kind of policy, he endeavoured to secure in his interest every lady of distinguished connections, by giving secretly to each of them a promise of marriage, as soon as he should arrive at the sovereignty.
The chief obstacles in his way were the sons and grandsons of Tiberius; and these he soon sacrificed to his ambition, under various pretences.
Drusus, the eldest of this progeny, having in a fit of passion struck the favourite, was destined by him to destruction.
For this purpose, he had the presumption to seduce Livia, the wife of Drusus, to whom she had borne several children; and she consented to marry her adulterer upon the death of her husband, who was soon after poisoned, through the means of an eunuch named Lygdus, by order of her and Sejanus.
Drusus was the son of Tiberius by Vipsania, one of Agrippa's daughters.
He displayed great intrepidity during the war m the provinces of <placeName key="tgn,7016683">Illyricum</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,4008442">Pannonia</placeName>, but appears to have been dissolute in his morals.
<placeName key="tgn,2399199">Horace</placeName> is said to have written the Ode in praise of Drusus at the desire of Augustus; and while the poet celebrates the military courage of the prince, he insinuates indirectly a salutary admonition to the cultivation of the civil virtues:
<cit><quote lang="la"><l>Doctrina sed vim promovet insitam,</l>
<l>Rectique cultus pectora roborant:</l>
<l>Utcumque defecere mores,</l>
<l>Dedecorant bene nata culpae.</l></quote>  <bibl n="Hor. Carm. 4.4">Ode iv. 4.</bibl></cit>
<cit><quote lang="en"><l>Yet sage instructions to refine the soul</l>
<l>And raise the genius, wondrous aid impart,</l>
<l>Conveying inward, as they purely roll,</l>
<l>Strength to the mind and vigour to the heart:</l>
<l>When mortals fail, the stains of vice disgrace</l>
<l>The fairest honours of the noblest race.</l></quote>  <bibl>Francis.</bibl></cit></p>
<p>Upon the death of Drusus, Sejanus openly avowed a desire of marrying the widowed princess; but Tiberius opposing this measure, and at the same time recommending Germanicus to the senate as his successor in the empire, the mind of Sejanus was more than ever inflamed by the united, and now furious, passions of love and ambition.
He therefore urged his demand with increased importunity; but the emperor still refusing his consent, and things being not yet ripe for an immediate revolt, Sejanus thought nothing so favourable for the prosecution of his designs as the absence of Tiberius from the capital.
With this view, under the pretence of relieving his master from the cares of government, he persuaded him to retire to a distance from <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>.
The emperor, indolent and luxurious, approved of the proposal, and retired into <placeName key="tgn,7003005">Campania</placeName>, leaving to his ambitious minister the whole direction of the empire.
Had Sejanus now been governed by common prudence and moderation, he might have attained to the accomplishment of all his wishes; but a natural impetuosity of temper, and the intoxication of power, precipitated him into measures which soon effected his destruction.
As if entirely emancipated from the control of a master, he publicly declared himself sovereign of the Roman empire, and that Tiberius, who had by this time retired to <placeName key="tgn,7006855">Capri</placeName>, was only the dependent prince of that tributary island.
He even went so far in degrading the emperor, as to have him introduced in a ridiculous light upon the stage.
Advice of Sejanus's proceedings was soon carried to the emperor at <placeName key="tgn,7006855">Capri</placeName>; his indignation was immediately excited; and with a confidence founded upon an authority exercised for several years, he sent orders for accusing Sejanus before the senate.
This mandate no sooner arrived, than the audacious minister was deserted by his adherents; he was in a short time after seized without resistance, and strangled in prison the same day.</p>
<p>Human nature recoils with horror at the cruelties of this execrable tyrant, who, having first imbrued his hands in the blood of his own relations, proceeded to exercise them upon the public with indiscriminate fury.
Neither age nor sex afforded any exemption from his insatiable thirst for blood.
Innocent children were condemned to death, and butchered in the presence of their parents; virgins, without any imputed guilt, were sacrificed to a similar destiny; but there being an ancient custom of not strangling females in that situation, they were first deflowered by the executioner, and afterwards strangled, as if an atrocious addition to cruelty could sanction the exercise of it. Fathers were constrained by violence to witness the death of their own children; and even the tears of a mother, at the execution of her child, were punished as a capital offence.
Some extraordinary calamities, occasioned by accident, added to the horrors of the reign.
A great number of houses on Mount Ccelius were destroyed by fire; and by the fall of a temporary building at Fidenae, erected for the purpose of exhibiting public shows, about twenty thousand persons were either greatly hurt, or crushed to death in the ruins.</p>
<p>By another fire which afterwards broke out, a part of the Circus was destroyed, with the numerous buildings on Mgunt Aventine.
The only act of munificence displayed by Tiberius during his reign, was upon the occasion of those fires, when, to qualify the severity of his government, he indemnified the most considerable sufferers for the loss they had sustained.</p>
<p>Through the whole of his life, Tiberius seems to have conducted himself with a uniform repugnance to nature.
Affable on a few occasions, but in general averse to society, he indulged, from his earliest years, a moroseness of disposition, which counterfeited the appearance of austere virtue; and in the decline of life, wRien it is common to reform from juvenile indiscretions, he launched forth into excesses, of a kind the most.unnatural and most detestable.
Considering the vicious passions which had ever brooded in his heart, it may seem surprising that he restrained himself within the bounds of decency during so many years after his accession; but though utterly destitute of reverence or affection for his mother, he still felt, during her life, a filial awe upon his mind: and after her death, ie was actuated by a slavish fear of Sejanus, until at last political necessity absolved him likewise from this restraint.
These checks being both removed, he rioted without any control, either from sentiment or authority.</p>
<p><placeName key="tgn,2119609">Pliny</placeName> relates, that the art of making glass malleable was actually discovered under the reign of <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>, and that the shop and tools of the artist were destroyed, lest, by the establishment of this invention, gold and silver should lose their value.
Dion adds, that the author of the discovery was put to death.</p>
<p>The gloom which darkened the Roman capital during this melancholy period, shed a baleful influence on the progress of science throughout the empire, and literature languished during the present reign, in the same proportion as it:had flourished in the preceding.
It is doubtful' whether such a change might not have happened in some degree, even had the government of Tiberius been equally mild with that of his predecessor.
The prodigious fame of the writers of the Augustan age, by repressing emulation, tended to a general diminution of the efforts of genius for some time; while the banishment of <placeName key="tgn,2016081">Ovid</placeName>, it is probable,
and the capital punishment of a subsequent poet, for censuring the character of Agamemnon, operated towards the farther discouragement of poetical exertions.
There now existed no circumstance to counterbalance these disadvantages.
Genius no longer found a patron either in the emperor or his minister; and the gates of the palace were shut against all who cultivated the elegant pursuits of the Muses.
Panders, catamites, assassins, wretches stained with every crime, were the constant attendants, as the only fit companions, of the tyrant who now occupied the throne.
We are informed, however, that even this emperor had a taste for the liberal arts, and that he composed a lyric poem upon the death of Lucius Caesar, with some Greek poems in imitation of Euphorion, Rhianus, and Parthenius.
But none of these has been transmitted to posterity: and if we should form an opinion of them upon the principle of Catullus, that to be a good poet one ought to be a good man, there is little reason to regret that they have perished.

In which affair it is difficult to say, whether his regard to filial duty, or the firmness of his resolution, was most conspicuous.
Soon afterwards he defeated the enemy, and obtained the honours of a triumph.
Being then made consul for the second time,<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 767</note>
before he could enter upon his office he was obliged to set out suddenly for the east, where, after he had conquered the king of <placeName key="tgn,7006651">Armenia</placeName>, and reduced <placeName key="tgn,6003016">Cappadocia</placeName> into the form of a province, he died at <placeName key="tgn,7002351">Antioch</placeName>, of a lingering distemper, in the thirty-fourth year of his age,<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 771</note> not without the suspicion of being

<div2 type="chapter" n="2">
<p>It was a prevailing opinion that he was taken off by the contrivance of Tiberius and through the means of Cneius Piso.
This person, who was about the same time prefect of <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>, and made no secret of his position being such, that he must either offend the
fathe ror the son, loaded Germanicus, even during his sickness, with the most unbounded and scurrilous abuse, both by word and deed; for which, upon his return to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, he narrowly escaped being torn to pieces by the people, and was condemned to death by the senate.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="3">
<p>It is generally agreed, that Germanicus possessed all the noblest endowments of body and mind in a higher degree than had ever before fallen to the lot of any man; a handsome person, extraordinary courage, great proficiency in eloquence and other branches of learning, both Greek and  Roman; besides a singular humanity, and a behaviour so engaging, as to captivate the affections of all about him.  The slenderness of his legs did not correspond with the symmetry and beauty of his person in other respects; but this defect was at length corrected by his habit of riding after meals.
In battle, he often engaged and slew an enemy in single combat.
He pleaded causes, even after he had the honour of a triumph.
Among other fruits of his studies, he left behind him some Greek comedies.
Both at home and abroad he always conducted himself in a manner the most unassuming.
On entering any free and confederate town, he never would be attended by any of his lictors.
Whenever he heard, in his travels, of the tombs of illustrious men, he made offerings over them to the infernal deities.
He gave a common grave, under a mound of earth, to the scattered relics of the legionaries slain under Varus, and was the first to put his hand to the work of collecting and bringing them to the place of burial.
He was so extremely mild and gentle to his enemies, whoever they were, or on what account soever they bore him enmity, that, although Piso rescinded his decrees, and for a long time severely harassed his dependents, he never showed the smallest resentment, until he found himself attacked by magical charms and imprecations; and even then the only steps he took was to renounce all friendship with him, according to ancient custom, and to exhort his servants to avenge his death, if any thing untoward should befal him.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="4">
<p>He reaped the fruit of his noble qualities in abundance, being so much esteemed and beloved by his friends, that Augustus (to say nothing of his other relations) being a long time in doubt, whether he should not appoint him his successor, at last ordered Tiberius to adopt him.
He was so extremely popular, that many authors tell us, the crowds of those who went to meet him upon his coming to any place, or to attend him at his departure, were so prodigious, that he was sometimes in danger of his life; and that upon his return from <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, after he had quelled the mutiny in the army there, all the cohorts of the pretorian guards marched out to meet him, notwithstanding the order that only two should go; and that all the people of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, both men and women, of every age, sex, and rank, flocked as far as the twentieth mile-stone to attend his entrance.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="5">
<p>At the time of his death, however, and afterwards, they displayed still greater and stronger proofs of their extraordinary attachment to him.
The day on which he died, stones were thrown at the temples, the altars of the

It is even said that barbarous nations, both those engaged in intestine wars, and those in hostilities against us, all agreed to a cessation of arms, as if they had been mourning for some very near and common friend; that some petty kings shaved their beards and their wives

<p>At <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, upon the first news of his sickness, the city was thrown into great consternation and grief, waiting impatiently for farther intelligence; when suddenly, in the evening, a report, without any certain author, was spread, that he was recovered; upon which the people flocked with torches and victims to the Capitol, and were in such haste to pay the vows they had made for his recovery, that they almost broke open the doors.
Tiberius was roused from  out of his sleep with the noise of the people congratulating one another, and singing about the streets,
<quote lang="la"><l>Salva Roma, salva patria, salvus est Germanicus,</l></quote>
<quote lang="en"><l><placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> is safe, our country safe, for our Germanicus is safe.</l></quote>
But when certain intelligence of his death arrived, the mourning of the people could neither be assuaged by
consolation, nor restrained by edicts, and it continued during the holidays in the month of December.
The atrocities of the subsequent times contributed much to the glory of Germanicus, and the endearment of his memory; all people supposing, and with reason, that the fear and awe of him had laid a restraint upon the cruelty of Tiberius, which broke out soon afterwards.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="7">
<p>Germanicus married Agrippina, the daughter of Marcus Agrippa and <placeName key="tgn,2118772">Julia</placeName>, by whom he had nine children, two of whom died in their infancy, and another a few years after; a sprightly boy, whose effigy, in the character of a Cupid, <placeName key="tgn,2039991">Livia</placeName> set up in the temple of <placeName key="tgn,2094077">Venus</placeName> in the Capitol.
Augustus also placed 'another statue of him in his bed-chamber, and used to kiss it as often as he entered the apartment.
The rest survived their father; three daughters, Agrippina, <placeName key="tgn,2078997">Drusilla</placeName>, and -Livilla, who were born in three successive years; and as many sons, <placeName key="tgn,2538429">Nero</placeName>, Drusus, and Caius Caesar.

Cneius Lentulus Gaetulicus<note anchored="yes">It does not appear that Gaetulicus wrote any historical work, but

country between the <placeName key="tgn,7012611">Rhine</placeName> and the <placeName key="tgn,7006865">Meuse</placeName>, and gave their name to
<placeName key="tgn,7004447">Treves</placeName> (<placeName key="tgn,7004447">Treviri</placeName>), its chief town. Coblentz had its ancient name of
Confluentes, from its standing at the junction of the two rivers  The exact site of the village in which Caligula was born is not known.
Cliverius conjectures that it may be Cafelle.</note> and he alleges, as a proof of it, that altars are there shown with this inscription: "For Agrippina's child-birth."
Some verses which were published in his reign, intimate that he was born in the winter quarters of the legions,
<quote lang="la"><l>In castris natus, patriis nutritius in armis,</l>
<l>Jam designati principis omen erat.</l></quote>
<quote lang="en"><l>Born in the camp, and trained in every toil</l>
<l>Which taught his sire the haughtiest foes to foil;</l>
<l>Destin'd he seem'd by fate to raise his name,</l>
<l>And rule the empire with Augustan fame.</l></quote>
I find in the public registers that he was born at <placeName key="perseus,Antium">Antium</placeName>.
Pliny charges Gaetulicus as guilty of an arrant forgery, merely to soothe the vanity of a conceited young prince, by giving him the lustre of being born in a city sacred to Hercules; and says that he advanced this false assertion with the more assurance, because, the year before the birth of Caius, Germanicus had a son of the same name born at <placeName key="perseus,Tibur">Tibur</placeName>; concerning whose amiable childhood and premature death I have already spoken.<note anchored="yes">Chap. vii.</note> Dates clearly prove that Pliny is mistaken; for the writers of Augustus's history all agree, that Germanicus, at the expiration of his consulship, was sent into <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, after the birth of Caius.
Nor will the inscription upon the altar serve to establish Pliny's opinion; because Agrippina was delivered of two daughters in that country, and any child-birth, without regard to sex, is called puerperium, as the ancients used to call girs puerat, and boys puelli.
There is also extant a letter written by Augustus, a few months before his death, to his granddaughter Agrippina, about the same Caius (for there was then no other child of hers living under that name).  He writes as follows: "I gave
orders yesterday for Talarius and Asellius to set out on their journey towards you, if the gods permit, with your child Caius, upon the fifteenth of the calends of June [I8th May]. I also send with him a physician of mine, and I wrote to Germanicus that he may retain him if he pleases.
Farewell, my dear Agrippina, and take what care you can to come safe and well to your Germanicus."
I imagine it is sufficiently evident that Caius could not be born at a place to which he was carried from The City when almost two years 'old.
The same considerations must likewise invalidate the evidence of the verses, and the rather, because the author is unknown.
The only authority, therefore, upon which we can depend in this matter, is that of the acts, and the public register; especially as he always preferred <placeName key="perseus,Antium">Antium</placeName> to every other place of retirement, and entertained for it all that fondness which is commonly attached to one's native soil.
It is said, too, that, upon his growing weary of the city, he designed to have transferred thither the seat of empire.</p></div2>

<p>It was to the jokes of the soldiers in the camp that he owed the name of Caligula,<note anchored="yes">The name was derived from Caliga, a kind of boot, studded with nails, used by the common soldiers in the Roman army.</note> he having been brought up among them in the dress of a common soldier.
How much his education amongst them  recommended him to their favour and affection, was sufficiently apparent in the mutiny upon the death of Augustus, when the mere sight of him appeased their fury, though it had risen to a great height.
For they persisted in it, until they observed that he was sent away to a neighbouring city,
<note anchored="yes">According to Tacitus, who gives an interesting account of these occurrences, <placeName key="tgn,7004447">Treves</placeName> was the place of refuge to which the young Caius was conveyed.-Annal. i.

Then, at last, they began to relent, and, stopping the chariot in which he was conveyed, earnestly deprecated the odium to which such a proceeding would expose them.</p></div2>

<p>He likewise attended his father in his expedition to <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>.
After his return, he lived first with his mother, and, when she was banished, with his great-granrmother, Livia Augusta, in praise of whom, after her decease, though then only a boy, he pronounced a funeral oration in the Rostra.
He was then transferred to the family of his grandmother Antonia, and afterwards, in the twentieth year of
his age, being called by Tiberius to <placeName key="tgn,7006855">Capri</placeName>, he in one and the same day assumed the manly habit, and shaved his beard, but without receiving any of the honours which had been paid to his brothers on a similar oeeasien.
While he remained in that island, many insidious artifices
were practised, to extort from  him  complaints against Tiberius, but by his circumspection he avoided falling into the snare.
<note anchored="yes">In c. liv. of TIBERIUS, we have seen that his brothers Drusus and <placeName key="tgn,2538429">Nero</placeName> fell a sacrifice to these artifices.

He affected to take no more notice of the ill-treatment of his relations, than if nothing had befallen them.  With regard to his own sufferings, he seemed utterly insensible of them, and behaved with such obsequiousness to his grandfather<note anchored="yes">Tiberius, who was the adopted father of Germanicus.</note> and all about him, that it was justly said of him, "There never was a better servant, nor a worse master."</p></div2>

He delighted in witnessing the
inflictions of punishments, and frequented tavernsand bawdy-houses in the night-time, disguised in a periwig -and a long coat; and was passionately addicted to the theatrical arts of singing and dancing.
All these levities Tiberius readily connived at, in hopes that they might perhaps correct the roughness of his temper, which the sagacious old man so well understood, that he often said, "That Caius was destined to be the ruin of himself and all mankind; and that he was rearing a hydra<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="la">Natriceus</foreign>, a water-snake, so called from <foreign lang="la">nato</foreign>, to swim.

<p>Not long afterwards, he married Junia Claudilla, the daughter of Marcus Silanus,
a man of the highest rank.
Being then chosen augur in the room of his brother Drusus, before he could be inaugurated he was advanced to the pontificate, with no small commendation of his dutiful behaviour, and great capacity.
The situation of the court likewise was at this time favourable to his fortunes, as it was now left destitute of support, Sejanus being suspected, and soon afterwards taken off; and he was by degrees flattered with the hope of succeeding Tiberius in the empire.
In order more effectually to secure this object, upon Junia's dying in child-bed, he engaged in a criminal commerce with Ennia Naevia, the wife of <placeName key="tgn,2032740">Marco</placeName>, at that time prefect
of the pretorian cohorts; promising to marry her if he became emperor, to which he bound himself, not only by an oath, but by a written obligation under his hand.
Having by her means insinuated himself into <placeName key="tgn,2032740">Marco</placeName>'s favour, some are of opinion that he attempted to poison <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>, and ordered his ring to be taken from him, before tihe breath was out of his body; and that, because he seemed to hold it fast, he caused a pillow to be thrown upon him,<note anchored="yes">See the Life of <placeName key="tgn,2720789">TIBERIUS</placeName>, c. lxxiii.
</note>
 squeezing him by the throat, at the same time, with his own hand.
One of his freedmen crying out at this horrid barbarity, he was immediately crucified.
These circumstances are far from being improbable, as some authors relate that, afterwards, though he did not acknowledge his having a hand in the death of <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>, yet he frankly declared that he had formerly entertained
such a design; and as a proof of his affection for his relations, he would frequently boast, "That, to revenge the death of his mother and brothers, he had entered the
chamber of <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>, when he was asleep,
with a poniard, but being seized with a fit of compassion, threw
it away, and retired; and that
<placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>, though aware of his intention, durst not make any inquiries, or attempt revenge."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="13">
<p>Having thus secured the imperial power, he fulfilled by his elevation the wish of the Roman people, I may venture to say, of all mankind; for he long  been the object of expectation and desire to the

 then a minor, co-heir with him, the whole government and administration of affairs was placed in his hands; so much to the joy and satisfaction of the public, that, in less than three months after, above
a hundred and sixty thousand victims are said to have been offered in sacrifice.

And when he fell ill, the people hung about the Palatium all night long; some vowed, in public handbills, to risk their lives in the combats of the amphitheatre, and others to lay them down, for his recovery.
To this extraordinary love entertained for him by his countrymen, was added an uncommon regard by foreign nations.
Even Artabanus, king of the Parthians, who had always manifested hatred and contempt for Tiberius, solicited his friendship; came to hold a conference with his consular lieutenant, and passing the <placeName key="tgn,1123842">Euphrates</placeName>, paid the highest honours to the eagles, the Roman standards, and the images of the Caesars.<note anchored="yes">The eagle was the standard of the legion, each cohort of which had its own ensign, with different devices; and there were also little images of the emperors, to which divine honours were paid.

<p>Caligula himself inflamed this devotion, by practising all the arts of popularity.
After he had delivered, with floods of tears, a speech in praise of Tiberius, and buried him with the utmost pomp, he immediately hastened over to Pandataria and the Pontian islands,<note anchored="yes">See Tiberius, cc. liii. liv.</note>
to bring thence the ashes of his mother and brother; and, to testify the great regard he had for their memory, he performed the voyage in a very tempestuous season.

<note anchored="yes">The <foreign lang="la">Carpentum</foreign> was a carriage, commonly with two wheels, and an arched covering, but sometimes without a covering; used chiefly by mations, and named, according to <placeName key="tgn,2071526">Ovid</placeName>, from Carmenta, the mother of <placeName key="tgn,2319904">Evander</placeName>. Women were prohibited the use of it in the second Punic war, by the Oppian law, which, however, was soon after repealed.

on the day he took upon him the manly habit, and conferred upon him the title of "Prince of the Youths."
As for his sisters, he ordered these words to be added to the oaths of allegiance to himself: "Nor will I hold myself or my own children more dear than I do Caius and his sisters:"<note anchored="yes">Ib. cc. vii. and xxiv.</note> and commanded.all resolutions proposed by the consuls in the senate to be prefaced thus: " May what we are going to do, prove fortunate and happy to Caius Caesar and his sisters."
With the like popularity he restored all those
who had been condemned and banished and granted an act of indemnity against all impeachments and past offenses.
To relieve the informers and witnesses against his mother and brothers from all apprehension, he brought the records of their trials into the forum, and there burnt them, calling loudly on the gods to witness that he had not read or handled them.
A memorial which was offered him relative to his own security, he would not receive, declaring, "that he had done nothing to make any one his enemy:" and said, at the same time, "he had no ears for informers."</p></div2>

He granted the magistrates a full and free jurisdiction, without any appeal to himself.
He made a very strict and exact review of the Roman knights, but conducted it with moderation; publicly depriving of his horse every knight who lay under the stigma of any thing base and dishonourable; but passing over the names of those knights who were only guilty of venial faults, in calling over the list of the order.
To lighten the labours of the judges, he added a fifth class to the former four.
He attempted likewise to restore to the people their ancient right of voting in the choice of magistrates.
<note anchored="yes">Julius Caesar had shared it with them (c. xli.). Augustus had only
kept up the form (c. xl.). <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName> deprived the Roman people of the last remains of the freedom of suffrage.</note>
He paid very honourably, and without any dispute, the legacies left by <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName> in his will, though it had been set aside; as likewise those left by the will of Livia Augusta, which <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName> had annulled.
He remitted the hundredth penny, due to the government in all auctions throughout <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>.
He made up to many their losses sustained by fire; and.
when he restored their kingdoms. to any princes, he likewise allowed them all the arrears of the taxes.-and revenues which had accrued in the interval; as in the case of Antiochus of Comagene, where the confiscation would have amounted to a hundred millions of sesterces.
T6, prove to the world that he was ready to encourage good  examples of every kind, he gave to a freed-woman eighty thousand sesterces, for not discovering a crime committed by her patron, though she had been put to exquisite torture for that purpose.
For all these acts of beneficence, amongst other honours, a golden shield was decreed to him, which the colleges of priests were to carry annually, upon a fixed day, into the Capitol, with the senate attending, and the youth of the nobility, of both sexes, celebrating the praise of his virtues in songs.
It was likewise ordained, that the day on which he succeeded to the empire should be called Palilia, in token of the city's being at that time, as it were, new founded.
<note anchored="yes">The city of <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> was founded on the twenty-first day of April, which was called Palilia, from Pales, the goddess of shepherds, and ever afterwards kept as a festival.

until the seventh of the same ides [7th January]. Of these, the two last he held successively.
The third he assumed by his sole authority at <placeName key="tgn,7008772">Lyons</placeName>; not, as some are of opinion, from arrogance or neglect of rules; but because, at that distance, it was impossible for him to know that his colleague had died a little before the beginning of the new year.
He twice distributed to the people a bounty of three hundred sesterces a man, and as often gave a splendid feast to the senate and the equestrian order, with their wives and children.
In the latter, he presented to the men forensic garments, and to the women and children purple scarfs.
To make a perpetual addition to the public joy for ever, he added to the Saturnalia<note anchored="yes">The Saturnaia, held in honour of <placeName key="tgn,2644983">Saturn</placeName>, was, amongst the Romans, the most celebrated festival of the whole year, and held in the month of December.

He did not always preside in person on those occasions, but sometimes gave a commission to magistrates or friends to supply his place.
He frequently entertained the people with stage-plays of various kinds, and in several parts of the city, and sometimes by night, when he caused the whole city to be lighted.
He likewise gave various things to be scrambled for among the people, and distributed to every man a basket of bread
with other victuals.
Upon this occasion, he sent his own share to a Roman knight, who was seated opposite to him, and was enjoying himself by eating heartily.
To a senator, who was doing the same, he sent an appointment of praetor-extraordinary.
He likewise exhibited a great number of Circensian games from morning until night; intermixed with the hunting of wild beasts from <placeName key="tgn,2086787">Africa</placeName>, or the Trojan exhibition.
Some of these games were celebrated with peculiar circumstances; the Circus being overspread with vermilion and chrysolite; and none drove in the chariot races who were not of the senatorian order.
For some of these he suddenly gave the signal, when, upon his viewing from the Gelotiana<note anchored="yes">Supposed to be a house, so called, adjoining the Circus, in which some of the emperor's attendants resided.</note> the preparations in the Circus, he was asked to do so by a few persons in the neighbouring galleries.</p></div2>

that the reason assigned by some courtiers who were in habits of the greatest intimacy with him, was this; when Tiberius was in some anxiety about the nomination of a successor, and rather inclined to pitch upon his grandson,

The course of one of these rivulets was forty miles, and it was carried on arches, immediately after quitting its source, for a distance of three miles. The other, the Anio Novus, also began on arches, which continued for upwards of twelve miles. After this, both were conveyed under ground; but at the distance of six miles from the city, they were united, and carried upon arches all the rest of the way.

S. Lorenzo, where these is a quadrangular projection in the city walls
marking the site. The remains of the Amphitheatrum Castrense stand
between the Porta Maggiore and S. Giovanni, formerly without the ancient walls, but now included in the line. It is all of brick, even the
Corinthian pillars, and seems to have been but a rude structure, suited
to the purpose for which it was built, the amusement of the soldiers, and
gymnastic exercises. For this purpose they were used to construct temporary amphitheatres near the stations in the distant provinces, which
were not built of stone or brick, but hollow circular spots dug in the
ground, round which the spectators sat on the declivity, on ranges of seats cut in the sod.
Many vestiges of this kind have been traced in <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName>.

<div2 type="chapter" n="22">
<p>Thus far we have spoken of him as a prince. What remains to be said of him, bespeaks him rather a monster than a man.
He assumed a variety of titles, such as "Dutiful," "The Pious," "Child of the Camp, the Father of the Armies," and "The Greatest and Best Caesar."
Upon hearing some kings, who came to the city to pay him court, conversing together at supper, about their illustrious descent, he exclaimed,
<quote lang="greek">ei)=s koi/ranos e)/tw, ei)=s basileu/s</quote>
<gloss>Let there be but one prince, one king.</gloss>
He was strongly inclined to assume the diadem, and change the form of government, from imperial to regal; but being told that he far exceeded the grandeur of kings and princes, he began to arrogate to himself a divine majesty.
He ordered all the images of the gods, which were famous either for their beauty, or the veneration paid them, among which was that of Jupiter Olympius, to be brought from <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, that he might take the heads off, and put on his own.
Having continued part of the
Palatium as far as the Forum, and the temple of Castor and Pollux being converted into a kind of vestibule to his house, he often stationed himself between the twin brothers, and so presented himself to be worshipped by all votaries; some of whom  saluted him  by the name of yupiter Latialis.
He also instituted a temple and priests, with choicest victims, in honour of his own divinity.
In his temple stood a statue of gold, the exact image of himself, which was daily dressed in garments corresponding with those he wore himself.
The most opulent persons in the city offered themselves as candidates for the honour of being his priests, and purchased it successively at an immense price.
The victims were flamingos, peacocks, bustards, guinea-fowls, turkey and pheasant hens, each sacrificed on their respective days.
On nights when the moon was full, he was in the constant habit of inviting her to his embraces and his bed.
In the day-time he talked in private to Jupiter Capitolinus; one while whispering to him, and another turning his ear to him; sometimes he spoke aloud, and in railing language.
For he was overheard to threaten the god thus:  <quote lang="greek">h)/ e)m' a)nai/er', h)/ e)gw/ se</quote>

until being at last prevailed upon by the entreaties of the
god, as he said, to take up his abode with him, he built a
bridge over the temple of the Deified Augustus, by which
he joined the Palatium to the Capitol. Afterwards, that
he might be still nearer, he laid the foundations of a new
palace in the very court of the Capitol.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="23">
<p>He was unwilling to be thought or called the grandson of Agrippa, because of the obscurity of his birth; and he was offended if any one, either in prose or verse, ranked him amongst the Caesars.
He said that his mother was the fruit of an incestuous commerce, maintained by Augustus with his daughter Julia.
And not content with this vile reflection upon the memory of Augustus, he forbad his victories at <placeName key="tgn,7010713">Actium</placeName>, and on the coast of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, to be celebrated, as usual; affirming that they had been most pernicious and fatal to the Roman people.
He called his grandmother Livia Augusta " Ulysses in a woman's dress," and had the indecency to reflect upon her in a letter to the senate, as of mean birth, and descended, by the mother's side, from a grandfather who was only one of the municipal magistrates of <placeName key="tgn,7006712">Fondi</placeName>; whereas it is certain, from the public records, that Aufidius Lurco held high offices at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.
His grandmother Antonia desiring a private conference with him, he refused to grant it, unless Macro, the prefect of the pretorian guards, were present.
Indignities of this kind, and ill usage, were the cause of her death; but some think he also gave her poison.
- Nor did he pay the smallest respect to hier memory after her death, but witnessed the burning from his private apartment.
His brother Tiberius, who had'no expectation of any violence, was suddenly dispatched by a military tribune sent by his order for that purpose.
He forced <placeName key="tgn,1046911">Silanus</placeName>, his father-in-law, to kill himself, by cutting his throat with a razor.
The pretext he alleged for these murders was, that the latter had not followed him upon his putting to sea in stormy weather, but stayed behind with the view of seizing the city, if he should perish.
The other, he said, smelt of an antidote, which he had taken to prevent his being poisoned by him; whereas <placeName key="tgn,1046911">Silanus</placeName> was only afraid of being seasick, and the disagreeableness of the voyage; and Tibenius had merely taken a medicine for an habitual cough, which was continually growing worse.
As for his successor Claudius, he only saved him as a laughing-stock.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="24">
<p>He lived in the habit of incest with all his sisters; and at table, when much company was present, he placed each of them in turns below him, whilst his wife reclined above him.
It is believed, that he deflowered one of them, Drusilla, before he had assumed the robe of manhood; and was even caught in her embraces by his grandmother Antonia, with whom they were educated together.
When she was afterwards married to Cassius Longinus, a man of consular rank, he took her from him, and kept her constantly as if she were his lawful wife.
In a fit of sickness, he by his will appointed her heiress both of his estate and the empire.
After her death, he ordered a public mourning for her; during which it was capital for any person to laugh, use the bath, or sup with his parents, wife, or children.
Being inconsolable under his affliction, he went hastily, and in the night-time, from the City; going through <placeName key="tgn,7003005">Campania</placeName> to <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, and then suddenly returned without shaving his beard, or trimming his hair.
Nor did he ever afterwards, in matters of the greatest importance, not even in the assemblies of the people or before the soldiers, swear any otherwise, than "By the divinity ofDrusilla."
The rest of his sisters hedid not treat with so much fondness or regard; but frequently prostituted them to his catamites.
He therefore the more readily condemned them in the case of AEmilius Lepidus, as guilty of adultery, and privy to that conspiracy against him.
Nor did he only divulge their own handwriting relative to the affair, which he procured by base and lewd means, but likewise consecrated to Mars the Avenger three swords which had been prepared to stab
him, with an inscription, setting forth the occasion of their consecration.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="25">
<p>Whether in the marriage of his wives, in repudiating them, or retaining them, he acted with greater infamy, it is difficult to say.
Being at the wedding of Caius with Livia Orestilla, he ordered the bride to be carried to his own house, but within a few days divorced her, and two years after banished her; because it was thought, that upon her divorce she returned to the embraces of her former husband.
Some say, that being invited to the wedding-supper, he sent a message to Piso, who sat opposite to him, in these words: "Do not be too fond with my wife," and that he immediately carried her off.
Next day he published a proclamation, importing, "That he had got a wife as <placeName key="tgn,2072021">Romulus</placeName> and Augustus had done."
<note anchored="yes">Alluding, in the case of Romulus, to the rape of the Sabines; and in that of Augustus to his having taken <placeName key="tgn,2039991">Livia</placeName> from her husband -AUGUSTUS, C. IX.

Lollia Paulina, who was married to a man of consular rank in command of an army, he suddenly called from the province where she was with her husband, upon mention being made that her grandmother was formerly very beautiful, and married her; but he soon afterwards parted with her, interdicting her from having ever afterwards any commerce with man.
He loved with a most passionate and constant affection Caesonia, who was neither handsome nor young, and was besides the mother of three daughters by another man; but a wanton of unbounded lasciviousness.
Her he would frequently exhibit to the soldiers, dressed in a military cloak, with shield and helmet, and riding by his side.
To his friends he even showed her naked.
After she had a child, he honoured her with the title of wife; in one and the same day, declaring himself her husband, and father of the
child of which she was delivered.
He named it Julia Drusilla, and carrying it round the temples of all the goddesses, laid it on the lap of <placeName key="tgn,2516785">Minerva</placeName>; to whom  he recommended the care of bringing up and instructing her.
He considered her as his own child for no better reason than her savage temper, which was such even in infancy, that she would attack with her nails the face and eyes of the children at play with her.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="26">
<p>It would be of little importance, as well as disgusting, to add to all this an account of the manner in which he treated his relations and friends; as Ptolemy, king <placeName key="tgn,1094266">Juba</placeName>'s son, his cousin (for he was the grandson of Mark Antony by his daughter Selene<note anchored="yes">Selene was the daughter of Mark Antony by <placeName key="tgn,2038217">Cleopatra</placeName>.</note>),
and especially Macro himself, and Ennia likewise,<note anchored="yes">See c. xii.
</note>
 by whose assistance he had obtained the empire; all of whom, for their alliance and eminent services, he rewarded with violent deaths.
Nor was he more mild or respectful in his behaviour towards the senate.
Some who had borne the highest offices in the government, he suffered to run by his litter in their togas for several miles together, and to attend him at supper, sometimes at the head of his couch, sometimes at his feet, with napkins.
Others of them, after he had privately put them to death, he nevertheless continued to send for, as if they were still alive, and after a few days pretended that they had laid violent hands upon themselves.
The consuls having forgotten to give public notice of his birth-day, he displaced them; and the republic was three days without any one in that high office.
A quaestor who was said to be concerned in a conspiracy against him, he scourged severely, having first stripped off his clothes, and spread them under the feet of the soldiers employed in the work, that they might stand the more firm.
The other orders likewise he treated with the same insolence and violence.
Being disturbed by the noise of people taking their places at midnight in the circus, as they were to have free admission, he drove them all away with cubs.
In this tumult, above twenty Roman knights were squeezed to death, with as many matrons, with a great crowd besides.
- When stage-plays were acted, to occasion disputes between the people and the knights, he distributed the money-tickets sooner than usual, that the seats assigned to the knights might be all occupied by the mob.
In the spectacles of gladiators, sometimes, when the sun was violently hot, he would order the curtains, which covered the amphitheatre, to be drawn aside,<note anchored="yes">The vast area of the Roman amphitheatres had no roof, but the audience were protected against the sun and bad weather by temporary hangings stretched over it.</note> and forbad any person to be let out; withdrawing at the same time the usual apparatus for the entertainment, and presenting wild beasts almost pined to death, the most sorry gladiators, decrepit with age, and fit only to work the machinery, and decent house-keepers, who were remarkable for some bodily infirmity.
Sometimes shutting up the public granaries, he would oblige thepeople to starve for a while.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="27">
<p>He evinced the savage barbarity of his temper chiefly by the following indications.
When flesh was only to be had at a high price for feeding his wild beasts reserved for the spectacles, he ordered that criminals should be given them to be devoured; and upon inspecting them in a row, while he stood in the middle of the portico, without troubling himself to examine their cases he ordered them to be dragged away, from "bald-pate to bald-pate."<note anchored="yes">A proverbial expression, meaning, without distinction.</note>
Of one person who had made a vow for his recovery to combat with a gladiator, he exacted its performance; nor would he allow him  to desist until he came off conqueror, and after many entreaties.
Another, who had vowed to give his life for the same cause, having shrunk from the sacrifice, he delivered, adorned as a victim, with garlands and fillets, to boys, who were to drive him through the streets, calling on him to fulfil his vow, until he was thrown headlong from the ramparts.
After disfiguring many persons of honorable rank, by branding them in the face with hot irons, he condemned them to .the mines, to work in repairing the highways, or to fight with wild beasts; or tying them by the neck and heels, in the manner of beasts carried to slaughter, would shut them up in cages or saw them asunder.
Nor were these severities merely inflicted for crimes of great enormity, but for making remarks on his public games, or for not having sworn by the Genius of the emperor.
He compelled parents to be present at the execution of their sons; and to one who excused himself on account of indisposition he sent his own litter.
Another he invited to his table immediately after he had witnessed the spectacle, and coolly challenged him to jest and be merry.
He ordered the overseer of the spectacles and wild beasts to be scourged in fetters, during several days successively, in his own presence and did not put him to death until he was disgusted with the stench of his putrefied brain.
He burned alive, in the centre of the arena of the amphitheatre, the writer of a farce, for some witty verse, which had a double meaning.
A Roman knight, who had been exposed to the wild beasts, crying out that he was innocent, he called him back, and having had his tongue cut out, remanded him to the arena.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="28">
<p>Asking a certain person, whom he recalled after a long exile, how he used to spend his time, he replied, with flattery, "I was always praying the gods for what has happened, that <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName> might die and you be emperor."
Concluding, therefore, that those he had himself banished also prayed for his death, he sent orders round the islands<note anchored="yes">The islands off the coast of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, in the <placeName key="tgn,2072785">Tuscan</placeName> sea and in the Archipelago, were the usual places of banishment.

Being very desirous to have a senator torn to pieces, he employed some persons to call him a public enemy, fall upon him as he entered the senate-house, stab him with their styles, and deliver him to the rest to tear asunder.
Nor was he satisfied until he saw the limbs and bowels of the man, after they had been dragged through the streets, piled up in a heap before him.</p></div2>

<p>He aggravated his barbarous actions by language equally outrageous.
"There is nothing in my nature," said he,' that I commend or approve so much as my <foreign lang="greek">a)diatreyi/a</foreign> (inflexible rigour)."   Upon his grandmother <placeName key="tgn,2057890">Antonia</placeName>'s giving him some advice, as if it was a small matter to pay no regard to it, he said to her, "Remember that all things are lawful for me." When about to murder his brother, whom he suspected of taking antidotes against poison, he said, "See then an andidote against Caesar!"  And when he banished his sisters, he told them in a menacing tone, that he had not only islands at command, but also swords.
One of pretorian rank having sent several times from Anticyra,<note anchored="yes">Anticyra, an island in the Archipelago, was famous for the growth of hellebore.

It was his custom  every tenth day to sign the lists of prisoners appointed for execution; and this he called "clearing his accounts."
And having condemned several Gauls and Greeks at one time, he exclaimed in triumph, "I have conquered Gallograecia."<note anchored="yes">Meaning the province in <placeName key="tgn,2097781">Asia</placeName>, called <placeName key="tgn,7016662">Galatia</placeName>, from the Gauls who conquered it, and occupied it jointly with the Greek colonists.</note></p></div2>

<p>He generally prolonged the sufferings of his victims by causing them to be inflicted by slight and frequently repeated  strokes; this being his well-known and

He carried in his left hand a three-pointed lance, called Tridens or Fuscina, and in his right, a net, with which he attempted to entangle his adversary, by casting it over his head, and suddenly drawing it together; when with his trident he usually slew him.

Ptolemy, mentioned before, whom he invited from his kingdom, and received with great honours, he suddenly put to death, for no other reason, but because he observed that upon entering the theatre, at a public exhibition, he attracted the eyes of all the spectators by the splendour of his purple robe.
As often as he met with handsome men, who had fine heads of hair, he would order the back of their heads to be shaved, to make them appear ridiculous.
There was one Esius Proculus, the son of a centurion of the first rank, who, for his great stature and fine proportions, was called the Colossal.
Him he ordered to be dragged from his seat in the arena, and matched with a gladiator in light armour, and afterwards with another completely armed; and upon his worsting them  both, commanded him forthwith to be bound, to be led clothed in rags up and down the streets of the city, and, after being exhibited in that plight to the women, to be then butchered.
There was no man of so abject or mean condition whose excellency in any kind he did not envy.
The Rex Nemorensis
<note anchored="yes">The priest of Diana Nemorensis obtained and held his office by his prowess in arms, having to slay his competitors, and offer human sacrifices, and was called Rex from his reigning paramount in the adjacent forest.

Julius Caesar had a residence there.

having been victorious in an exhibition, and in his joy given freedom to a slave, was applauded so vehemently that Caligula rose in such haste from his seat that, treading upon the hem of his toga, he tumbled down the steps, full of indignation, and crying out, "A people who are masters of the world, pay greater respect to a gladiator for a trifle, than to princes admitted amongst the gods, or to my own majesty here present amongst them."</p></div2>

<note anchored="yes" place="inline">* * * Thomson omits material here * * *</note>
Besides his incest with his sisters, and his notorious passion for Pyrallis, the prostitute, there was hardly any lady of distinction with whom he did not make free.
He used commonly to invite them with their husbands to supper, and as they passed by the couch on which he reclined at table, examine them very closely, like those who traffic in slaves; and if any one from modesty held down her face, he raised it up with his hand.
Afterwards, as often as he was in the humour, he would quit the room, send for her he liked best, and in a short time return with marks of
recent disorder about them.
He would then commend or disparage her in the presence of the company, recounting the charms or defects of her person and behaviour in private.
To some he sent a divorce in the name of their absent husbands, and ordered it to be registered in the public acts.</p></div2>

<p>In the devices of his profuse expenditure, he surpassed all the prodigals that ever lived; inventing a new kind of bath, with strange dishes and suppers, washing in precious unguents, both warm and cold, drinking pearls of immense value dissolved in vinegar, and serving up for his guests loaves and other victuals modelled in gold; often saying, " that a man ought either to be a good economist or an emperor."
Besides, he scattered money to a prodigious amount among the people, from the top of the Julian Basilica,<note anchored="yes">See before, <placeName key="tgn,2008628">JULIUS</placeName>, c. x., and note.</note>
during several days successively.
He built two ships with ten banks of oars, after the Liburnian fashion, the poops of which blazed with jewels, and the sails were of various parti-colours.
They were fitted up with ample baths, galleries, and saloons, and supplied with a great variety of vines and other fruit-trees.
In these he would sail in the day-time along the coast of <placeName key="tgn,7003005">Campania</placeName>, feasting amidst dancing and concerts of music.
In building his palaces and villas, there was nothing he desired to effect so much, in defiance of all reason, as what was considered impossible.

 rocks of the hardest stone cut away, plains raised to the height of mountains with a vast mass of earth, and the tops of mountains levelled by digging; and all these were to be executed with incredible speed, for the least remissness was a capital
offence.
Not to mention particulars, he spent enormous sums, and the whole treasures which had been amassed by Tiberius Caesar, amounting to two thousand seven hundred millions of sesterces, within less than a year.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="38">
<p>Having therefore quite exhausted these funds, and being in want of money, he had recourse to plundering the people, by every mode of false accusation, confiscation, and taxation, that could be invented.
He declared that no one had any right to the freedom of <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, although their ancestors had acquired it for themselves and their posterity, unless they were sons; for that none beyond that degree ought to be considered as posterity. When the grants of the Divine Julius and Augustus were produced to him, he only said, that he was very sorry that they were obsolete and out of date.
He also charged all those with making false returns, who, after the taking of the census, had by any means whatever increased their property.
He annulled the wills of all who had been centurions of the first rank, as testimonies of their base ingratitude, if from the beginning of <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>'s reign they had not left either that prince or himself their heir.
He also set aside the wills of all others, if any person only pretended to say, that they designed at their death to leave Caesar their heir.
The public becoming terrified at this proceeding, he was now appointed joint-heir with their friends, and in the case of parents with their children, by persons unknown to him.
Those who lived any considerable time after making such a will, he said, were only making game of him; and accordingly he sent many of them poisoned cakes.
He used to try such causes himself; fixing previously the sum he proposed to raise during the sitting, and, after he had secured it, quitting the tribunal.
Impatient of the least delay, he condemned by a single sentence forty persons, against
whom there were different charges;  boasting to Caesonia when she awoke, "how much business he had dispatched while she was taking her mid-day sleep."
He exposed to sale by auction, the remains of the apparatus used in the public spectacles; and exacted such biddings, and raised the prices so high, that some of the purchasers were ruined, and bled themselves to death.
There is a well-known story told of Aponius Saturninae, who happening to fall asleep as he sat on a bench at the sale, Caius called out to the auctioneer, not to overlook the praetorian personage who nodded to him so often; and accordingly the salesman went on, pretending to take the nods for tokens of assent, until thirteen gladiators were knocked down to him at the sum of nine millions of sesterces,<note anchored="yes">Most of the gladiators were slaves.</note> he being in total ignorance of what was doing.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="39">
<p>Having also sold in <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> all the clothes, furniture, slaves, and even freedmen belonging to his sisters, at prodigious prices, after their condemnation, he was so much delighted with his pains that he sent to <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> for all the furniture of the old palace;<note anchored="yes">The part of the Palatium built or occupied by Augustus and Tiberius.</note>  pressing for its conveyance all the carriages let to hire in the city, with the horses and mules belonging to the bakers, so that they often wanted bread at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>; and many who had suits at law in progress lost their causes, because they could not make their appearance in due time according to their recognizances.
In the sale of this furniture every artifice of fraud and imposition was employed.
Sometimes he would rail at the bidders for being niggardly, and ask them " if they were not ashamed to be richer than he was ?" at another he would affect to be sorry that the property of princes should be passing into the hands of private persons.
He had found out that a rich provincial had given two hundred thousand sesterces to his chamberlains for an underhand invitation to his table, and he was much pleased to find that honour valued at so high a rate.
The day following, as the same person was sitting at the sale, he sent him some bauble, for which he told him he must pay two hundred thousand sesterces, and " that he should sup with Caesar upon his own invitation."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="40">
<p>He levied new taxes, and such as were never before known, at first by the publicans, but afterwards, because their profit was enormous, by centurions and tribunes of the pretorian guards; no description of property or persons was exempted from some kind of tax or other.
For all eatables brought into the city a certain excise was exacted; for all law-suits or trials, in whatever court, the fortieth part of the sum in dispute; and such as were convicted of compromising litigations were made liable to a penalty.
Out of the daily wages of the porters he received an eighth, and from the gains of common prostitutes, what they received for one favour granted.
There was a clause in the law, that all bawds who kept women for prostitution or sale, should be liable to pay, and that marriage itself should not be exempted.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="41">
<p>These taxes being imposed, but the act by which they were levied never submitted to public inspection, great grievances were experienced from the want of sufficient knowledge of the law.
At length, on the urgent demands of the Roman people, he published the law, but it was written in a very small hand, and posted up in a corner, so that no one could make a copy of it. To leave no sort of gain untried, he opened brothels in the Palatium, with a number of cells, furnished suitably to the dignity of the place; in which married women and free
born youths were ready for the reception of visitors.
He sent likewise his nomenclators about the forums and courts, to invite people of all ages, the old as well as the young; to his brothel, to come and satisfy their lusts: and he was ready to lend his customers money upon interest;  clerks attending to take down their names in public, as persons who contributed to the emperor's revenue.
Another method of raising money, which he thought not below his notice, was gaming, which, by the help of lying and perjury, he turned to considerable account.
Leaving once the management of his play to his partner in the game, he stepped into the court, and observing two rich Roman knights passing by, he ordered them immediately to be seized, and their estates confiscated.
Then returning in great glee, he boasted that he had never made a better throw in his life.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="42">
<p>After the birth of his daughter, complaining of his poverty, and the burdens to which he was subjected, not only as an emperor, but a father, he made a general collection for her maintenance and fortune.
He likewise gave public notice, that he would receive new-year's gifts on the calends of January following; and accordingly stood in the vestibule of his house, to clutch the presents which the people of all ranks threw down before him by handfuls and lapfuls.
At last, being seized with an invincible desire of feeling money, taking off his slippers, he repeatedly walked oyer great heaps of gold coin spread upon the spacious floor, and then laying himself down, rolled his whole body in gold over and over again.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="43">
<p>Only once in his life did he take an active part in military affairs, and then not from any set purpose, but during his journey to <placeName key="tgn,7008876">Mevania</placeName>, to see the grove and river of <placeName key="perseus,Clitumnus">Clitumnus</placeName>.

Being recommended to recruit a body of Batavians, who attended him, he resolved upon an expedition into <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>.
Immediately he drew together several legions, and auxiliary forces from all quarters, and made every where new levies with the utmost rigour.
Collecting supplies of all kinds, such as never had been assembled upon the like occasion, he set forward on his march, and pursued it sometimes with so much haste and precipitation, that the pretorian cohorts were obliged, contrary to custom, to pack their standards on horses or mules, and so follow him.
At other times, he would march so slow and luxuriously, that he was carried in a litter by eight men; ordering the roads to be swept by the people of the neighbouring towns, and sprinkled with water to lay the dust.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="44">
<p>On arriving at the camp, in order to show himself an active general, and severe disciplinarian, he cashiered the lieutenants who came up late with the auxiliary forces from different quarters.
In reviewing the army, he deprived of their companies most of the centurions of the first rank, who had now served their legal time in the wars, and some whose time would have expired in a few days; alleging against them their age and infirmity; and railing at the covetous disposition of the rest of them, he reduced the bounty due to those who had served out their time to the sum of six thousand sesterces.
Though he only received the submission of Adminius, the son of Cunobeline, a British king, who being driven from his native country by his father, came over to him with a small body of troops,<note anchored="yes">Caligula appears to have meditated an expedition to <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName> at the time of his pompous ovation at <placeName key="perseus,Puteoli">Puteoli</placeName>, mentioned in c. xiii.; but if Julius Caesar could gain no permanent footing in this island, it was
very improbable that a prince of Caligula's character would ever seriously attempt it, and we shall presently see that the whole affair turned out a farce.
</note> yet, as if the whole island had
been surrendered to him, he dispatched magnificent letters to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.
ordering the hearers to proceed in their carriages directly up to the forum and the senate-house, and not to deliver the letters but to the consuls in the temple of Mars, and in the presence of a full assembly of the senators.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="45">
<p>Soon after this, there being no hostilities, he ordered a few Germans of his guard to be carried over and placed in concealment on the other side of the <placeName key="tgn,7012611">Rhine</placeName>, and word to be brought him after dinner, that an enemy was advancing with great impetuosity.
This being accordingly done, he immediately threw himself, with his friends, and a party of the pretorian knights, into the adjoining wood, where lopping branches from the trees, and forming trophies of them, he returned by torch-light, upbraiding those who did not follow him, with timorousness and cowardice: but he presented the companions and sharers of his victory with crowns of a new form, and under a new name, having the sun, moon, and stars represented on them, which he called Exploratorie.  Again, some hostages were by his order taken from the school, and privately sent off; upon notice of which he immediately rose from table, pursued them with the cavalry, as if they had run away, and coming up with them, brought them back in fetters; proceeding to an extravagant pitch of ostentation likewise in his military comedy.
Upon his again sitting down to table, it being reported to him that the troops were all reassembled, he ordered them to sit down as they were, in their armour, animating them in the words of the well-known verse of Virgil:
<cit><quote lang="la"><l>Durate, et vosmet rebus servate secundis.</l></quote> <bibl n="Verg. A. 1.207">Aen. 1.207</bibl></cit>

In the meantime he reprimanded the senate and people of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> in a very severe proclamation "For revelling and frequenting the diversions of the circus and the theatre, and enjoying themselves at their villas, whilst their emperor was fighting and exposing himself to the greatest dangers."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="46">
<p>At last, as if resolved to make war in earnest, he drew up his army on the shore of the ocean, with his balistk and other engines of war, and while no one could imagine what he intended to do, on a sudden commanded them to gather up the sea shells, and fill their helmets and the folds of their dress with them, calling them " the spoils of the ocean due to the Capitol and the Palatium."
As a monument of his success, he raised a lofty tower, upon which, as at Pharos,<note anchored="yes">It seems generally agreed that the point of the coast which was signalized by the ridiculous bravado of Caligula, somewhat redeemed by the erection of a lighthouse, was Itium, afterwards called <placeName key="tgn,7016632">Gessoriacum</placeName>, and <placeName key="perseus,Bononia">Bononia</placeName> (<placeName key="tgn,7016632">Boulogne</placeName>), a town belonging to the Gaulish tribe of the Morini; where Julius Casar embarked on his expedition, and which became the usual place of departure for the transit to <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName>.
</note> he ordered lights to be burned in the night-time for the direction of ships at sea; and then promising the soldiers a donative of a hundred denarii<note anchored="yes">The denarius was worth at this time about seven pence or eight
pence of English money.</note>
a man, as if he had surpassed the most eminent examples of generosity, "Go your ways," said he, "and be merry; go, ye are rich."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="47">
<p>In making preparations for his triumph, besides the prisoners and deserters from the barbarian armies, he picked out the men of greatest stature in all <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, such as he said were fittest to grace a triumph, with some of the chiefs, and reserved them to appear in the procession, obliging them not only to dye their hair yellow and let it grow long, but to learn the German language and assume the names commonly used in that country.
He ordered likewise the gallies in which he had entered the ocean to be conveyed to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> a great part of the way by land, and wrote to his comptrollers in the city " to make proper preparations for a triumph against his arrival, at as small expense as possible; but on a scale such as had never been seen before, since they had full power over the property of every one."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="48">
<p>Before he left the province he formed a design of the most horrid cruelty-to massacre the legions which had mutinied upon the death of Augustus, for seizing and detaining his father, Germanicus, their commander, and  himself, then an infant, in the camp.
Though he was with great difficulty dissuaded from this rash attempt, yet neither the most urgent entreaties nor representations could prevent him from persisting in the design of decimating these legions.
Accordingly, he ordered them to assemble unarmed, without so much as their swords, and then surrounded them with armed horse.
But finding that many of them, suspecting that violence was intended, were making off to arm in their own defence, he quitted the assembly as fast as he could, and immediately marched for <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, bending now all his fury against the senate, whom he publicly threatened, to divert the general attention from the clamour excited by his disgraceful conduct.
Amongst other pretexts of offence, he complained that he was defrauded of a triumph which was justly his due, though he had just before forbidden, upon pain of death, any honour to be decreed him.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="49">
<p>In his march he was waited upon by deputies from the senatorian order, entreating him to hasten his return.
He replied to them, "I will come, I will come, and this with me," striking at the same time the
hilt of his sword.
He issued likewise this proclamation: "I am coming, but for those only who wish for me, the equestrian order and the people; for I shall no longer treat the senate as their fellow-citizen or prince."
He forbad any of the senators to come to meet him; and either abandoning or deferring his triumph, he entered the city in ovation on his'birth-day.
Within four months from this period he was slain, after he had perpetrated enormous crimes, and while he was meditating the execution, if possible, of still greater.
He had entertained a design of removing to <placeName key="perseus,Antium">Antium</placeName>, and afterwards to <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName>, having first cut off the flower of the equestrian and senatorian orders.
This is placed beyond all question by two books which were found in his cabinet under different titles, one being called the sword, and the other the dagger.
They both contained private marks, and the names of those who were devoted to death.
There was also found a large chest, filled with a variety of poisons, which being afterwards thrown into the sea by order of Claudius, are said to have so infected the waters that the fish were poisoned and cast dead by the tide upon the neighbouring shores.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="50">
<p>He was tall, of a pale complexion, ill-shaped, his neck and legs very slender, his eyes and temples hollow, his brows broad and knit, his hair thin, and the crown of the head bald.
The other parts of his body were much covered with hair.
On this account it was reckoned a capital crime for any person to look down from above as he was passing by, or so much as to name a goat.
His countenance, which was naturally hideous and frightful, he purposely rendered more so, forming it before a mirror into the most horrible contortions.
He was crazy both in body and mind, being subject, when a boy, to the falling sickness, When he arrived at the age of man
hood he endured fatigue tolerably well; but still, occasionally, he was liable to a faintness, during which he remained incapable of any effort.
He was not insensible of the disorder of his mind, and sometimes had thoughts of retiring to clear his brain.<note anchored="yes">Probably to Anticyra. See before, c. xxix., note.</note> It is believed that his wife Caesonia administered to him a love potion which threw him into a frenzy.
What most of all disordered him was want of sleep, for he seldom had more than three or four hours rest in a night; and even then his sleep was not sound, but disturbed by strange dreams, fancying, among other things, that a form representing the ocean spoke to him.
Being, therefore, often weary with lying awake so long, sometimes he sat up in his bed, at others, walked in the longest porticos about the house, and from time to time invoked and looked out for the approach of day.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="51">
<p>To this crazy constitution of his mind may, I think, very justly be ascribed two faults which he had of a nature directly repugnant one to the other, namely, an excessive confidence and the most abject timidity.
For he, who affected so much to despise the gods, was ready to shut his eyes and wrap up his head in his cloak at the slightest storm of thunder and lightning; and if it was violent he got up and hid himself under his bed.
In his visit to <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, after ridiculing many strange objects which that country affords, he ran away suddenly in the night from <placeName key="tgn,7010924">Messini</placeName>, terrified by the smoke and rumbling at the summit of Mount AEtna.
And though in words he was very valiant against the barbarians, yet upon passing a narrow defile in <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> in his light car, surrounded by a strong body of his troops, some one happening to say, "There would be no small consternation amongst us if an enemy were to appear," he immediately mounted his horse and rode towards the bridge in great haste; but finding them blocked up with camp-followers and baggage-wagons, he was in such a hurry that he caused himself to be carried in men's hands over the heads of the crowd.
Soon afterwards, upon hearing that the Germans were again in rebellion, he prepared to quit <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> and equipped a fleet, comforting himself with this consideration, that if the enemy should prove victorious and possess themselves of the heights of the <placeName key="tgn,2066659">Alps</placeName> as the Cimbri

<p>In the fashion of his clothes, shoes, and all the rest of his dress, he did not wear what was either national, or properly civic, or peculiar to the male sex, or appropriate to mere mortals.
He often appeared abroad in a short coat of stout cloth, richly embroidered and blazing with jewels, in a tunic with sleeves, and with bracelets upon his arms; sometimes all in silks and habited like a woman; at other times in the crepide or buskins; sometimes in the sort of shoes used by the lightarmed soldiers, or in the sock used by women, and commonly with a golden beard fixed to his chin, holding in his hand a thunderbolt, a trident, or a caduceus, marks of
distinction belonging to the gods only.
Sometimes, too, he appeared in the habit of Venus.

<p>With regard to the liberal sciences, he was little conversant in philology, but applied himself with assiduity to the study of eloquence, being indeed in point of enunciation tolerably elegant and ready; and in his perorations, when he was moved to anger, there was an abundant flow of words and periods.
In speaking, his action was vehement, and his voice so strong, that he was heard at a great distance.
When winding up an harangue, he threatened to draw " the sword of his lucubration," holding a loose and smooth style in such contempt, that he said Seneca, who was then much admired, "wrote only detached essays," and that "his language was nothing but sand without lime."
He often wrote answers to the speeches of successful orators; and employed himself in composing accusations or vindications of eminent persons, who were impeached before the senate; and gave his vote for or against the party accused, according to his success in speaking, inviting the equestrian order, by proclamation, to hear him.</p></div2>

<p>He also zealously applied himself to the practice of several other arts of different kinds, such as fencing, charioteering, singing, and dancing.

He was so extremely fond of singing and dancing, that he could not refrain in the theatre from singing with the tragedians, and imitating the gestures of the actors, either by way of applause or correction.
A night exhibition which he
had ordered the day he was slain, was thought to be intended for no other reason, than to take the opportunity afforded by the licentiousness of the season, to make his first appearance upon the stage.

He used to kiss Mnester, the pantomimic actor, publicly in the theatre; and if any person made the least noise while he was dancing, he would order him  to be dragged  from  his seat, and scourged him with his own hand.
A Roman knight once making some bustle, he sent him, by a centurion,
an order to depart forthwith for <placeName key="perseus,Ostia">Ostia</placeName>,<note anchored="yes">The port of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.</note> and carry a letter from him to king Ptolemy in <placeName key="tgn,1000176">Mauritania</placeName>.

He deprived the gladiators called Mirmillones of some of their arms.
One <placeName key="tgn,7013645">Columbus</placeName> coming
off with victory in a combat, but being slightly wounded, he ordered some poison to be infused in the wound, which he thence called Columbinum.
For thus it was certainly named with his own hand in a list of other poisons.
He was so extravagantly fond of the party of charioteers whose colours were green,

that he supped and lodged for some time constantly in the stable where their horses were kept.
At a certain revel, he made a present of two millions of sesterces to one Cythicus, a driver of a chariot.
The day before the Circensian games, he used to send his soldiers to enjoin silence in the neighbourhood, that the repose of his horse <foreign lang="la">Incitatus</foreign>,

For this favourite animal, besides a marble stable, an ivory manger, purple housings, and a jewelled frontlet, he appointed a house, with a retinue of slaves, and fine furniture, for the reception of such as were invited in the horse's name to sup with him.
It is even said that he intended to make him consul.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="56">
<p>In this frantic and savage career, numbers had formed designs for cutting him off; but one or two conspiracies being discovered, and others postponed for want of opportunity, at last two men concerted a plan together.
and accomplished their purpose; not without the privity of some of the greatest favourites amongst his freedmen, and the prefects of the pretorian guards; because, having been nante, though falsely, as concerned in one conspiracy against hipi, they perceived that they were suspected and become objects of his hatred.
For he had immediately endeavoured to render them obnoxious to the soldiery, drawing his sword, and declaring, "That he would kill himself if they thought him worthy of death ;" and ever after he was continually accusing them to one another, and setting them all mutually at variance.
The conspirators having resolved to fall upon him as he returned at noon from the <placeName key="tgn,2118187">Palatine</placeName> garies, Cassius Charea, tribune of the pretorian guards, claimed the part of making the onset.
This Chaerea was now an elderly man, and had been often reproached by Caius for effeminacy.
When he came for the watchword, the latter would give "Priapus," or "<placeName key="tgn,2094077">Venus</placeName>;" and if on any occasion he returned thanks, would offer him his hand to kiss, making with his fingers an obscene gesture.</p></div2>

<p>His approaching fate was indicated by many prodigies.
The statue of <placeName key="tgn,2075298">Jupiter</placeName> at <placeName key="tgn,7013967">Olympia</placeName>, which he had ordered to be taken down and brought to <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, suddenly burst out into such a violent fit of laughter, that, the machines employed in the work giving way, the workmen took to their heels.
When this accident happened, there came up a man named Cassius, who said that he was commanded in a dream to sacrifice a bull to <placeName key="tgn,2075298">Jupiter</placeName>.
The Capitol at <placeName key="tgn,7004529">Capua</placeName> was struck with lightning upon the ides of March [i th March]; as was also, at <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, the apartment of the chief porter of the Palatiun.
Some construed the latter into a presage that the master of the palace was in danger from his own guards; and the other they regarded as a sign, that an illustrious person would be cut off, as had happened before on that day.
Sylla, the astrologer, being consulted by him respecting his nativity, assured him, "That death would unavoidably and speedily befall him."
The oracle of Fortune at <placeName key="tgn,7015535">Antium</placeName> likewise forewarned him of Cassius; on which account he had given orders for putting to death Cassius Longi
nus, at that time proconsul of <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, not considering that Chaerea bore also that name.
The day preceding his death he dreamt that he was standing in heaven near the throne of Jupiter, who giving him a push with the great toe of his right foot, he fell headlong upon the earth.
Some things which happened the very day of his death, and only a little before it, were likewise considered as ominous presages of that event.
Whilst he was at sacrifice, he was bespattered with the blood of a flamingo.
And Mnester, the pantomimic actor, performed in a play, which the tragedian Neoptolemus had formerly acted at the games in which Philip, the king of <placeName key="tgn,7002715">Macedon</placeName>, was slain.
And in the piece called Laureolus, in which the principal actor, running out in a hurry, and falling, vomited blood, several of the inferior actors vying with each other to give the best specimen of their art, made the whole stage flow with blood.
A spectacle had been purposed to be performed that night, in which the fables of the infernal regions were to be represented by Egyptians and Ethiopians.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="58">
<p>On the ninth of the calends of February [24th January], and about the seventh hour of the day, after hesitating whether he should rise to dinner, as his stomach was disordered by what he had eaten the day before, at last, by the advice of his friends, he came forth.
In the vaulted passage through which he had to pass, were some boys of noble extraction, who had been brought from <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> to act upon the stage, waiting for him in a private corridor, and he stopped to see and speak to them; and had not the leader of the party said that he was suffering from cold, he would have gone back, and made them act immediately.
Respecting what followed, two different accounts are given.
Some say, that, whilst he was speaking to the boys, Chaerea came behind him, and
gave him a heavy blow on the neck with his sword first crying out, "Take this:" that then a tribune, by name Cornelius Sabinus, another of the conspirators, ran him through the breast.
Others say, that the crowd being kept at a distance by some centurions who were in the plot, Sabinus came, according to custom,.fr. the word, and that Caius gave him "<placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName>," upon which Chaerea cried out, "Be it so !" and then, on his looking round, clove one of his jaws with a blow.
As he lay on the ground, crying out that he was still alive,<note anchored="yes">Josephus, who supplies us with minute details of the assassination of
Caligula, says that he made no outcry, either disdaining it, or because
an alarm would have been useless; but that he attempted to make his

Among the ruins on the <placeName key="tgn,2118187">Palatine</placeName> hill, these baths still attract attention,
some of the frescos being in good preservation. See the account in
Josephus, xix. i, 2.</note> the rest dispatched him with thirty wounds.
For the word agreed upon among them  all was, "Strike again."
Some likewise ran their swords through his privy parts.
Upon the first bustle, the litter bearers came running in with their poles to his assistance, and, immediately afterwards, his German body guards, who killed some of the assassins, and also some senators who had no concern in the affair.</p></div2>

It was afterwards disinterred by his sisters, on their return from banishment, burnt to ashes, and buried.
Before this was done, it is well-known that the keepers of the gardens were greatly disturbed by apparitions; and that not a night passed without some
terrible alarm or other in the house where he was slain, until it was destroyed by fire.
His wife Caesonia was killed with him, being stabbed by a centurion; and his daughter had her brains knocked out against a wall.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="60">
<p>Of the miserable condition of those times, any person may easily form an estimate from the following circumstances.
When his death was made public, it was not immediately credited.
People entertained a suspicion  that a report of his being killed had been contrived and spread by himself with the view of discovering how they stood affected towards him.
Nor had the conspirators fixed upon any one to succeed him.
The senators were so unanimous in their resolution to assert the liberty of their country, that the consuls assembled them at first not in the usual place of meeting, because it was named after Julius Caesar, but in  the Capitol.
Some proposed to abolish  the memory of the Caesars, and level their temples with the ground.
It was particularly remarked on this occasion, that all the Caesars, who had the praenomen of Caius, died by the sword, from the Caius Caesar who was slain in the times of Cinna.

<div2 type="chapter" n="note">
<head>Remarks on Caligula</head>
<p>Unfortunately, a great chasm in the annals of Tacitus, at this period, precludes all information from that historian respecting the reign of Caligula; but from what he mentions towards the close of the preceding chapter, it is evident that Caligula was forward to seize the reins of government upon the death of Tiberius, whom, though he rivalled him in his vices, he was far from imitating in his dissimulation.
Amongst the people, the remembrance of Germanicus' virtues cherished for his family an attachment which was probably increased by its misfortunes; and they were anxious to see revived in the son the popularity of the father.
Considering, however, that Caligula's vicious disposition was already known, and that it had even been an inducement with Tiberius to procure his succession, in order that it might prove a foil to his own memory, it is surprising that no effort was made
at this juncture to shake off the despotism which had been so intolerable in the last reign, and restore the ancient liberty of the republic.
Since the commencement of the imperial dominion, there never had been any period so favourable for a counter-revolution as the present crisis.
There existed now no <placeName key="tgn,2039991">Livia</placeName> to influence the minds of the senate and people in respect of the government; nor was there any other person allied to the family of Germanicus, whose countenance or intrigues could promote the views of Caligula.
He himself was now only in the twenty-fifth year of his age, was totally inexperienced in the administration of public affairs, had never performed even the smallest service to his country, and was generally known to be of a character which disgraced his illustrious descent.
Yet, in spite of all these circumstances, such was the destiny of <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, that his accession afforded joy to the soldiers, who had known him in his childhood, and to the populace in the capital, as well as the people in the provinces, who were flattered with the delusive expectation of receiving a prince who should adorn the throne with the amiable virtues of Germanicus.</p>
<p>It is difficult to say, whether weakness of understanding, or corruption of morals, were more conspicuous in the character of Caligula.
He seems to have discovered from his earliest years an innate depravity of mind, which was undoubtedly much increased by defect of education.
He had lost both his parents at an early period of life; and from <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>'s own character, as well as his views in training the person who should succeed him on the throne, there is reason to think, that if any attention whatever was paid to the education of Caligula, it was directed to vitiate all his faculties and passions, rather than to correct and improve them.
If such was really the object, it was indeed prosecuted with success.</p>
<p>The commencement, however, of his reign was such as by no means prognosticated its subsequent transition.
The sudden change of his conduct, the astonishing mixture of imbecility and presumption, of moral turpitude and frantic extravagance, which he afterwards evinced; such as rolling himself over heaps of gold, his treatment of his horse Incitatus, and his design of making him consul, seem to justify a suspicion that his brain had actually been affected, either by the potion, said to have been given him by his wife Caesonia, or otherwise.
Philtres, orlopyejotions, as they were called, were frequent in those times, and the people believed that they operated upon the mind by a mysterious and sympathetic power.
It is, however, beyond a doubt, that their effects were produced entirely by the action of their physical
the satyrion, which, according to <placeName key="tgn,2119609">Pliny</placeName>, was a provocative.
They were generally given by women to their husbands at bed-time; and it was necessary towards their successful operation, that the parties should sleep together.
This circumstance explains the whole mystery. The philtres were nothing more than medicines of a stimulating quality, which, after exciting violent, but temporary effects, enfeebled the constitution, and occaioned nervous disorders, by which the mental faculties, as well as the corporeal, might be injured.
That this was really the case with Caligula, seems probable, not only from the falling sickness, to which he was subject, but from the habitual wakefulness of which he complained.</p>
<p>The profusion of this emperor, during his short reign of three years and ten months, is unexampled in history.
In the midst of profound peace, without any extraordinary charges either civil or military, he expended, in less than one year, besides the current revenue of the empire, the sum of $108,796,875, which had been left by <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName> at his death.
To supply the extravagance of future years, new and exorbitant taxes were imposed upon the people, and those too on the necessaries of life.
There existed now among the Romans every motive that could excite a general indignation against the government; yet such was still the dread of imperial power, though vested in the hands of so weak and despicable a sovereign, that no insurrection was attempted, nor any extensive conspiracy formed; but the obnoxious emperor fell at last a sacrifice to a few centurions of his own guard.</p>
<p>This reign was of too short duration to afford any new productions in literature; but, had it been extended to a much longer period, the effects would probably have been the same.
Polite learning never could flourish under an emperor who entertained a design of destroying the writings of <placeName key="tgn,1015191">Virgil</placeName> and Livy.
It is fortunate that these, and other valuable productions of antiquity, were too widely diffused over the world, and too carefully preserved, to be in danger of perishing through the frenzy of this capricious barbarian.

Cluverius places it between the village of Iselvort and the town of Doesborg.</note> which to this day are called by his name.
He overthrew the enemy in several battles and drove them far back into the depths of the desert.
Nor did he desist from pursuing them, until an apparition, in the form of a barbarian woman, of more
than human size, appeared to him, and, in the Latin tongue, forbad him to proceed any further.
For these achievements he had the honour of an ovation and the triumphal ornaments.
After his praetorship, he immediately entered on the office of consul, and returning to <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, died of disease, in the summer encampment, which thence obtained the name of "The Unlucky Camp."
His corpse was carried to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> by the principal persons of the several municipalities and colonies upon the road, being met and received by the recorders of each place, and buried in the <placeName key="tgn,7006964">Campus Martius</placeName>.
In honour of his memory, the army erected a monument, round which the soldiers used, annually, upon a certain day, to march in solemn procession, and persons deputed from the several cities of <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> performed religious rites.
The senate likewise, among various other honours, decreed for him a triumphal arch of marble, with trophies, in the <placeName key="tgn,6006324">Appian Way</placeName>, and gave the cognomen of Germanicus to him and his posterity.
In him the civil and military virtues were equally displayed; for, besides his victories, he gained from the enemy the Spolia Opima,<note anchored="yes">The <foreign lang="la">Spolia Opima</foreign> were the spoils taken from the enemy's king, or chief, when slain in single combat by a Roman general.

Claudius Marcelluls, who sles Viridomarus, king of the Gauls, A.U.C. 330.</note> and frequently marked out the German chiefs in the midst of their army, and encountered them in single combat at the utmost hazard of his life.
He likewise often declared that he would, some time or other, if possible, restore the ancient government, On this account, I suppose, some have ventured to affirm that Augustus was jealous of him
and recalled him; and because he made no haste to com ply with the order, took him off by poison.
This I mention, that I may not be guilty of any omission, more than because I think it either true or probable, since AugustuS loved him so much when living that he always, in his wills made him joint-heir with his sons, as he once declared in the senate; and upon his decease extolled him in a speech to the people, to that degree, that he prayed the gods "to make his Caesars like him, and to grant himself as honourable an exit out of this world as they had given him."
And not satisfied with inscribing upon his tomb an epitaph in verse composed by himself, he wrote likewise the history of his life in prose.
He had by the younger Antonia several children, but left behind him only three, namely, Germanicus, Livilla and Claudius.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="2">
<p>Claudius was born at <placeName key="tgn,7008772">Lyons</placeName>, in the consulship of Julius Antonius and Fabius Africanus, upon the first of August,<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 744</note> the very day upon which an altar was first dedicated there to Augustus.
He was named Tiberius Claudius Drusus, but soon afterwards, upon the adoption of his elder brother into the <placeName key="tgn,2089671">Julian</placeName> family, he assumed the cognomen of Germanicus.
He was left an infant by his father, and during almost the whole of his minority, and for some time after he attained the age of manhood, was afflicted with a variety of obstinate disorders, insomuch that his mind and body being greatly impaired, he was, even after his arrival at years of maturity, never thought sufficiently qualified for any public or private employment.
He was, therefore, during a long time, and even after the expiration of his minority, under the direction of a pedagogue, who, he complains in a certain memoir, " was a barbarous wretch, and formerly superintendent of the mule-drivers, who was selected for his governor on
purpose to correct him severely on every trifling occasion.
On account of this crazy constitution of body and mind, at the spectacle of gladiators, which he gave the people, jointly with his brother, in honour of his father's memory, he presided, muffled up in a pallium-a new fashion.
When he assumed the manly habit, he was carried in a litter, at midnight, to the Capitol, without the usual ceremony.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="3">
<p>He applied himself, however, from an early age, with great assiduity to the study of the liberal sciences, and frequently published specimens of his skill in each of them.
But never, with all his endeavours, could he attain to any public post in the government, or afford any hope of arriving at distinction thereafter.
His mother, <placeName key="tgn,2057890">Antonia</placeName>, frequently called him "an abortion of a man, that had been only begun, but never finished, by nature."
And when she would upbraid any one with dulness, she said, "He was a greater fool than her son, Claudius."  His grandmother, <placeName key="tgn,7017498">Augusta</placeName>, always treated him with the utmost contempt, very rarely spoke to him, and when she did admonish him upon any occasion, it was in writing, very briefly and severely, or by messengers.
His sister, Livilla, upon hearing that he was about to be created emperor, openly and loudly expressed her indignation that the Roman people should experience a fate so severe and so much below their grandeur.
To exhibit the opinion, both favourable and otherwise, entertained concerning him by Augustus, his great-uncle, I have here subjoined some extracts from the letters of that emperor.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="4">
<p>"I have had some conversation with <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>, according to your desire, my dear <placeName key="tgn,2039991">Livia</placeName>, as to what must be done with your grandson, Tiberius, at the games of <placeName key="tgn,2090583">Mars</placeName>.
We are both agreed in this, that, once for all, we ought to determine what course to take with him.
For if he be really sound and, so to speak, quite right in his intellects,<note anchored="yes">This epistle, as it was the habit of Augustus, is interspersed with Greek phrases. </note>
why should we hesitate to promote him by the same steps and degrees we did his brother?     But if we find him below par, and deficient both in body and mind, we must beware of giving occasion for him and ourselves to be laughed at by the world, which is ready enough to make such things the subject of mirth and derision.
For we shall be never easy, if we are always to be debating upon every occasion of this kind, without settling, in the first instance, whether he be really capable of public offices or not.
With regard to what you consult me about at the present moment, I am not against his superintending the feast of the priests, in the games of <placeName key="tgn,2090583">Mars</placeName>, if he will suffer himself to be governed by his kinsman, Silanus's son, that he may do nothing to make the people stare and laugh at him.
But I do not approve of his witnessing the Circensian games from the Pulvinar.
He will be there exposed to view in the very front of the theatre.
Nor do I like that he should go to the Alban Mount,<note anchored="yes">The Alban Mount is the most interesting feature of the scenery of the Campagna about <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, Monti Cavo, the summit, rising above an amphitheatre of magnificent woods, to an elevation of 2965 French feet. The view is very extensive: below is the lake of <placeName key="tgn,2127958">Albano</placeName>, the finest of the volcanic lakes in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, and the modern town of the same name. Few traces remain of <placeName key="tgn,5004326">Alba Longa</placeName>, the ancient capital of <placeName key="tgn,7003080">Latium</placeName>.
</note>
or be at <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> during the Latin festival.<note anchored="yes">On the summit of the Alban Mount, on the site of the present convent, stood the temple of Jupiter Latialis, where the Latin tribes assembled annually, and renewed their league, during the Feriae Latinae, instituted by Tarquinus Superbus. It was here, also, that Roman generals, who were refused the honours of a full triumph, performed the ovation, and sacrificed to Jupiter Latialis.
Part of the triumphal way by which the mountain was ascended, formed of vast blocks of lava, is still in good preservation, leading through groves of chestnut trees of vast size and age.
Spanning them with extended arms-none of the shortest-the operation was repeated five times in compassing their girth.</note>
For if he be capable of attending his brother to the mount, why is he not made prefect of the city? Thus, my dear <placeName key="tgn,2039991">Livia</placeName>, you have my
thoughts upon the matter.
In my opinion, we ought to settle this affair once for all, that we may not be always in suspense between hope and fear.
You may, if you think proper, give your kinsman <placeName key="tgn,2057890">Antonia</placeName> this part of my letter to read."
In another letter, he writes as follows: "I shall invite the youth, <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>, every day during your absence, to supper, that he may not sup alone with his friends Sulpicius and Athenodorus.
I wish the poor creature was more cautious and attentive in the choice of some one, whose manners, air, and gait might be proper for his imitation:
<quote lang="greek"><l>a)tuxei= pa/nu e)n toi=s spoudai/ois li/an</l></quote>
<quote lang="en"><l>In things of consequence he sadly fails.</l></quote>
Where his mind does not run astray, he discovers a noble disposition."
In a third letter, he says, " Let me die, my dear <placeName key="tgn,2039991">Livia</placeName>, if I am not astonished, that the declamation of your grandson, <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>, should please me; for how he who talks so ill, should be able to declaim so clearly and properly, I cannot imagine."
There is no doubt but Augustus, after this, came to a resolution upon the subject, and, accordingly, left him invested with no other honour than that of the Augural priesthood; naming him amongst the heirs of the third degree, who were but distantly allied to his family, for a sixth part of his estate only, with a legacy of no more than eight hundred thousand sesterces.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="5">
<p>Upon his requesting some office in the state, <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName> granted him the honorary appendages of the consulship, and when he pressed for a legitimate appointment, the emperor wrote word back, that "he sent him forty gold pieces for his expenses, during the festivals of the Saturnalia and Sigillaria."
Upon this, laying aside all hope of advancement, he resigned himself entirely to an indolent life; living in great privacy, one while in his gardens, or a villa which he had near the city; another while in <placeName key="tgn,7003005">Campania</placeName>, where he passed his time in the lowest society; by which means, besides his former character of a dull, heavy fellow, he acquired that of a drunkard and gamester.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="6">
<p>Notwithstanding this sort of life, much respect was shown him both in public and private.
The equestrian order twice made choice of him to intercede on their behalf; once to obtain from the consuls the favour of bearing on their shoulders the corpse of Augustus to <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, and a second time to congratulate him upon the death of Sejanus.
When he entered the theatre, they used to rise, and put Off their cloaks.
The senate likewise decreed, that he should be added to the number of the Augustal college of priests, who were chosen by lot; and soon afterwards, when his house was burnt down, that it should be rebuilt at the public charge; and that he should have the privilege of giving his vote amongst the men of consular rank.
This decree was, however, repealed; <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName> insisting to have him excused on account of his imbecility, and promising to make good his loss at his own expense.
But at his death, he named him in his will, amongst his third heirs, for a third part of his estate; leaving him besides a legacy of two millions of sesterces, and expressly recommending him to the armies, the senate and people of <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, amongst his other relations.</p></div2>

<p>At last Caius, his brother's son, upon his advancement to the empire, endeavouring to gain the affections of the public by all the arts of popularity, Claudius also was admitted to public offices, and held the consulship jointly with his nephew for two months.

A second consulship was also allotted him, to commence at the expiration of the fourth year.
He sometimes presided at the public spectacles, as the representative of Caius; being always, on those occasions, complimented with the acclamations of the people, wishing him all happiness, sometimes under the title of the emperor's uncle, and sometimes under that of Germanicus's brother.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="8">
<p>Still he was subjected to many slights. If at any time he came in late to supper, he was obliged to walk round the room some time before he could get a place at table.
When he indulged himself with sleep after eating, which was a common practice with him, the company used to throw olive-stones and dates at him.
And the buffoons who attended would wake him, as if it were only in jest, with a cane or a whip.
Sometimes they would put slippers upon his hands, as he lay snoring, that he might, upon awaking, rub his face with them.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="9">
<p>He was not only exposed to contempt, but sometimes likewise to considerable danger: first, in his consulship; for, having been too remiss in providing and erecting the statues of Caius's brothers, <placeName key="tgn,2538429">Nero</placeName> and Drusus, he was very near being deprived of his office; and afterwards he was continually harassed with  informations against him by one or other, sometimes even by his own domestics.
When the conspiracy of Lepidus and Gaetulicus was discovered, being sent with some other deputies into <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>,<note anchored="yes">A. U. C. 793. Life of CALIGULA, CC. xliv., xlv., c.
</note>
 to congratulate the emperor upon the occasion, he was in danger of his life; Caius being greatly enraged, and loudly complaining, that his uncle was sent to him, as if he was a boy who wanted a governor.
Some even say, that he was thrown into a river, in his travelling dress.
From this period, he voted in the senate always the last of the members of consular rank; being called upon after the rest, on purpose to disgrace him.
A charge for the forgery of a will was also allowed to be prosecuted, though he had only signed it as a witness.
At last, being obliged to pay eight millions of sesterces on entering upon a new office of priesthood, he was reduced to such straits in his private affairs, that in order to discharge his bond to the treasury, he was under the necessity of exposing to sale his whole estate, by an order of the prefects.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="10">
<p>Having spent the greater part of his life under these and the like circumstances, he came at last to the empire in the fiftieth year of his age,<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 794</note> by a very surprising turn of fortune.
Being, as well as the rest, prevented from approaching Caius by the conspirators, who dispersed the crowd, under the pretext of his desiring to be private, he retired into an apartment called the Hermaeum;<note anchored="yes">The chanber of Mercury, the names of deities being given to different apartments, as those "of Isis," "of the Muses," etc.</note> and soon afterwards, terrified by the report of Caius being slain, he crept into an adjoining balcony, where he hid himself behind the hangings of the door.
A common soldier, who happened to pass that way, spying his feet, and desirous to discover who he was, pulled him out; when immediately recognizing him, he threw himself in a great fright at his feet, and saluted him by the title of emperor.
He then conducted him to his fellow-soldiers, who were all in a great rage, and irresolute what they should do. They
put him into a litter, and as the slaves of the palace had all fled, took their turns in carrying him on their shoulders, and brought him into the camp, sad and trembling; the people who met him lamenting his situation, as if the poor innocent was being carried to execution. Being received within the ramparts,<note anchored="yes">See the note, page 259.
</note> he continued all night with the sentries on guard, recovered somewhat from his fright, but in no great hopes of the succession. For the consuls, with the senate and civic troops, had possessed themselves of the Forum and Capitol, with the determination to assert the public liberty; and he being sent for likewise, by a tribune of the people, to the senate-house, to give his advice upon the present juncture of affairs, returned answer, "I am under constraint, and cannot possibly come."  The day afterwards, the senate being dilatory in their proceedings, and worn out by divisions amongst themselves, while the people who surrounded the senate-house shouted that they would have one master, naming Claudius, he suffered the soldiers assembled under arms to swear allegiance to him, promising them fifteen thousand sesterces a man; he being the first of the Caesars who purchased the submission of the soldiers with money.<note anchored="yes">The attentive reader will have marked the gradual growth of the power of the pretorian guard, who now, and on so many future occasions, ruled the destinies of the empire.</note></p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="11">
<p>Having thus established himself in power, his first obect was to abolish all remembrance of the two preceding days, in which a revolution in the state had been canvassed. Accordingly, he passed an act of perpetual oblivion and pardon for everything said or done during that time;  and this he faithfully observed, with the exception only of putting to death a few tribunes and centurions concerned in the conspiracy against Caius, both as an example, and because he understood that
 they had also planned his own death.
He now turned his own thoughts towards paying respect to the memory of his relations.
His most solemn and unusual oath was "By Augustus."
He prevailed upon the senate to decree divine honours to his grandmother <placeName key="tgn,2039991">Livia</placeName>, with a chariot in the Circensian procession drawn by elephants, as had been appointed for Augustus,
<note anchored="yes">See AUGUSTUS, cc. xliii., xlv.
</note>
and public offerings to the shades of his parents.
Besides which, he instituted Circensian games for his father, to be celebrated every year, upon his birthday, and, for his mother, a chariot to be drawn through the circus; with the title of <placeName key="tgn,7017498">Augusta</placeName>, which had been refused by his grandmother.
<note anchored="yes">Ib. c. xcix.
</note>
To the memory of his brother,
<note anchored="yes">Germanicus.
</note>
to which, upon all occasions, he showed a great regard, he gave a Greek comedy, to be exhibited in the public diversions at <placeName key="tgn,7004474">Naples</placeName>,
<note anchored="yes"><placeName key="tgn,7004474">Naples</placeName> and other cities on that coast were Greek colonies.
</note>
and awarded the crown for it, according to the sentence of the judges in that solemnity.
Nor did he omit to make honourable and grateful mention of Mark Antony; declaring by a proclamation, "That he the more earnestly insisted upon the observation of his father Drusus's birth-day, because it was likewise that of his grandfather Antony."
He completed the marble arch near Pompey's theatre, which had formerly been decreed by the senate in honour of Tiberius, but which had been neglected.<note anchored="yes">This arch was erected in memory of the standards (the eagles) lost
by Varus, in <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, having been recovered by Germanicus under
the auspices of Tiberius. See his Life, c. xlvii.; and Tacit. Annal.
ii. 41. It seems to have stood at the foot of the Capitol, on the side
of the Forum, near the temple of Concord; but there are no remains
of it.</note>
And though he cancelled all the acts of Caius, yet he forbad the day of his assassination, notwithstanding it was that of his own accession to
the empire, to be reckoned amongst the festivals.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="12">
<p>But with regard to his own aggrandisement, he
was sparing and modest, declining the title of emperor,
an irefusing all excessive honours. He celebrated the
marriage of his daughter and the birth-day of a grandson
with great privacy, at home. He recalled none of those
who had been banished, without a decree of the senate:
and requested of them permission for the prefect of the
military tribunes and pretorian guards to attend him in
the senate-house;<note anchored="yes">Tacitus informs us that the same application had been made by
Tiberius. Annal. iii. The prefect of the pretorian guards, high and
important as his office had now become, was not allowed to enter the
senate-house, unless he belonged to the equestrian order.</note>  and also that they would be pleased
to bestow upon his procurators judicial authority in the
provinces.<note anchored="yes">The procurators had the administration of some of the less important provinces, with rank and authority inferior to that of the pro-consuls and prefects. Frequent mention of these officers is made by Josephus; and Pontius Pilate, who sentenced our Lord to crucifixion, held
that office in <placeName key="tgn,7001407">Judaea</placeName>, under Tiberius.</note> He asked of the consuls likewise the privilege of holding fairs upon his private estate. He frequently assisted the magistrates in the trial of causes, as
one of their assessors. And when they gave public spectacles, he would rise up with the rest of the spectators,
and salute them both by words and gestures.  When the
tribunes of the people came to him while he was on the
tribunal, he excused himself, because, on account of the
crowd, he could not hear them unless they stood. In a
short time, by this conduct, he wrought himself so much
into the favour and affection of the public, that when,
upon his going to <placeName key="tgn,7007018">Ostia</placeName>, a report was spread in the city
that he had been waylaid and slain, the people never ceased cursing the soldiers for traitors, and the senate as parricides, until one or two persons, and presently after several others, were brought by the magistrates upon the rostra, who assured them that he was alive, and not far from the city, on his way home.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="13">
<p>Conspiracies, however, were formed against him, not only by individuals separately, but by a faction; and at last his government was disturbed with a civil war.
A low fellow was found with a poniard about him, near his chamber, at midnight.
Two men of the equestrian order were discovered waiting for him in the streets, armed with a tuck and a huntsman's dagger; one of them intending to attack him as he came out of the theatre, and the other as he was sacrificing in the temple of Mars.
Gallus Asinius and Statilius Corvinus, grandsons of the two orators, Pollio and Messala,
<note anchored="yes">Pollio and Messala were distinguished orators, who flourished under the Caesars Julius and Augustus.
</note>
formed a conspiracy against him, in which they engaged many of his freedmen and slaves.
Furius Camillus Scribonianus, his lieutenant in <placeName key="tgn,7015451">Dalmatia</placeName>, broke into rebellion, but was reduced in the space of five days; the legions which he had seduced from their oath of fidelity relinquishing their purpose, upon an alarm occasioned by ill omens.
For when orders were given them to march, to meet their new emperor, the eagles could not be decorated, nor the standards pulled out of the ground, whether it was by accident, or a divine interposition.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="14">
<p>Besides his former consulship, he held the office afterwards four times; the first two successively,
<note anchored="yes">A. U. C. 795, 796.
</note>
but the following, after an interval of four years each;<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 800, 804</note> the last for six months, the others for two; and the third, upon
his being chosen in the room of a consul who died; which
had never been done by any of the emperors before him.
Whether he was consul or out of office he constantly attended the courts for the administration of justice, even
upon such days as were solemnly observed as days of rejoicing in his family, or by his friends; and sometimes
upon the public festivals of ancient institution. Nor did
he always adhere strictly to the letter of the laws, but
overruled the rigour or lenity of many of their enactments,
according to his sentiments of justice and equity. For
where persons lost their suits by insisting upon more than
appeared to be their due, before the judges of private
causes, he granted them the indulgence of a second trial.
And with regard to such as were convicted of any great
delinquency, he even exceeded the punishment appointed
by law, and condemned them  to be exposed to wild
beasts.<note anchored="yes">"Ad bestias" had become a new and frequent sentence for malefactors. It will be recollected, that it was the most usual form of martyrdom for the primitive Christians. Polycarp was brought all the way

<div2 type="chapter" n="15">
<p>But in hearing and determining causes, he exhibited a strange inconsistency of temper, being at one
time circumspect and sagacious, at another inconsiderate
and rash, and sometimes frivolous and like one out of his
mind. In correcting the roll of judges, he struck off the
name of one who, concealing the privilege his children
gave him to be excused from serving, had answered to
his name, as too eager for the office. Another who was
summoned before him in a cause of his own, but alleged
that the affair did not properly come under the emperor's
cognizance, but that of the ordinary judges, he ordered to
plead the cause himself immediately before him, and show
in a case of his own, how equitable a judge he would
prove in that of other persons.
A woman refusing to acknowledge her own son, and there being no clear proof on either side, he obliged her to confess the truth, by ordering her to marry the young man.
<note anchored="yes">This reminds us of the decision of Solomon in the case of the two mothers, who each claimed a child as their own, 1 Kings iii. 22-27.
</note>
He was much inclined to determine causes in favour of the parties who appeared, against those who did not, without inquiring whether their absence was occasioned by their own fault, or by real necessity.
On proclamation of a man's being convicted of forgery, and that he ought to have his hand cut off, he insisted that an executioner should be immediately sent for, with a Spanish sword and a block.
A person being prosecuted for falsely assuming the freedom of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and a frivolous dispute arising between the advocates in the cause, whether he ought to make his appearance in the Roman or Grecian dress, to show his impartiality, he commanded him  to change his clothes several times according to the character he assumed in the accusation or defence.
An anecdote is related of him, and believed to be true, that, in a particular cause, he delivered his sentence in writing thus: "I am in favour of those who have spoken the truth."<note anchored="yes">A most absurd judicial conclusion, the business of the judge or court being to decide, on weighing the evidence, on which side the truth preponderated.
</note>
By this he so much forfeited the good opinion of the world, that he was everywhere and openly despised.
A person making an excuse for the non-appearance of a witness whom he had sent for from the provinces, declared it was impossible for him to appear, concealing the reason for some time: at last, after several interrogatories were put to him on the subject, he answered, "The man is dead;" to which Claudius replied, "I think that is a sufficient excuse."
Another thanking him for suffering a person who was prosecuted to make his defence by counsel, added, "And yet it is no more than what is usual."
I have likewise heard some old men say,
<note anchored="yes">See the note in CALIGULA, c. xix., as to Suetonius's sources of information from persons cotemporary with the occurrences he relates.
</note>
that the advocates used to abuse his patience so grossly, that they would not only call him back, as he was quitting the tribunal, but would seize him by the lap of his coat, and sometimes catch him by the heels, to make him stay.
That such behaviour, however strange, is not incredible, will appear from this anecdote.
Some obscure Greek, who was a litigant, had an altercation with him, in which he called out, "You are an old fool."<note anchored="yes">The insult was conveyed in Greek, which seems, from Suetonius, to
have been in very common use at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>:  <foreign lang="greek">kai/ su\ ge/rwn ei)=, kai\ mwro/s.</foreign></note> It is certain that a Roman knight, who was prosecuted by an impotent device of his enemies on a false charge of abominable obscenity with women, observing that common strumpets were summoned against him and allowed to give evidence, upbraided Claudius in very harsh and severe terms with his folly and cruelty, and threw his style, and some books which he had in his hands, in his face, with such violence as to wound him severely in the cheek.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="16">
<p>He likewise assumed the censorship,<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 798 or 800</note>
which had been discontinued since the time that Paulus and Plancus had jointly held it. But this also he administered very unequally, and with a strange variety of humour and conduct.
In his review of the knights, he passed over, without any mark of disgrace, a profligate young man, only because his father spoke of him  in the highest terms; "for," said lie, "his father is his proper censor."
Another, who was infamous for debauching youths and
for adultery, he only admonished " to indulge his youthful inclinations more sparingly, or at least more cautiously;"
<note anchored="yes">There was a proverb to the same effect:  <foreign lang="la">"Si non caste, saltem caute."</foreign>
</note>
adding, "why must I know what mistress you keep?" When, at the request of his friends, he had taken off a mark of infamy which he had set upon one knight's name, he said, "Let the blot, however, remain."
He not only struck out of the list of judges, but likewise deprived of the freedom of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, an illustrious man of the highest provincial rank in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, only because he was ignorant of the Latin language.
Nor in this review did he suffer any one to give an account of his conduct by an advocate, but obliged each man to speak for himself in the best way he could.
He disgraced many, and some that little expected it, and for a reason entirely new, namely, for going out of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> without his license; and one likewise, for having in his province, been the familiar companion of a king; observing, that, in former times, Rabirius Posthumus had been prosecuted for treason, although he only went after Ptolemy to <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName> for the purpose of securing payment of a debt.<note anchored="yes">Ptolemy appointed him to an office which led him to assume a foreign dress. Rabirius was defended by Cicero in one of his orations,
which is extant.</note>  Having tried to brand with disgrace several others, he, to his own greater shame, found them generally innocent, through the negligence of the persons employed to inquire into their characters; those whom he charged with living in celibacy, with want of children, or estate, proving themselves to be husbands, parents, and in affluent circumstances.
One of the knights who was charged with stabbing himself, laid his bosom bare, to show that there was not the least mark of violence upon his body.
The following incidents were remarkable in his censorship.
He ordered a car, plated
with silver, and of very sumptuous workmanship, which was exposed for sale in the Sigillaria,
<note anchored="yes">The Sigillaria was a street in <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, where a fair was held after the Saturnalia, which lasted seven days; and toys, consisting of little images and dolls, which gave their names to the street and festival, were sold. It appears from the text, that other articles were exposed for sale in this street. Among these were included elegant vases of silver and bronze. There appears also to have been a bookseller's shop, for an ancient writer tells us that a friend of his showed him a copy of the Second Book of the Aeneid, which he had purchased there.
</note>
to be purchased, and broken in pieces before his eyes.
He published twenty proclamations in one day, in one of which he advised the people, "Since the vintage was very plentiful, to have their casks well secured at the bung with pitch:" and in another, he told them, " that nothing would sooner cure the bite of a viper, than the sap of the yew-tree."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="17">
<p>He undertook only one expedition, and that was of short duration.
The triumphal ornaments decreed him by the senate, he considered as beneath the imperial dignity, and was therefore resolved to have the honour of a real triumph.
For this purpose, he selected <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName>, which had never been attempted by any one since Julius Caesar,
<note anchored="yes">Opposed to this statement there is a passage in Servius Georgius, iii.
33, asserting that he had heard (accipimus) that Augustus, besides his
victories in the east, triumphed over the Britons in the west; and Horace says:-
<cit><quote lang="la"><l>Augustus adjectis Britannis</l>
<l>Imperio gravibusque Persis.</l></quote> <bibl n="Hor. Carm. 3.5.1">Ode iii. 5, 1.</bibl></cit>
Strabo likewise informs us, that in his time, the petty British kings sent
embassies to cultivate the alliance of Augustus, and make offerings in
the Capitol: and that nearly the whole island was on terms of amity
with the Romans, and, as well as the Gauls, paid a light tribute.-Strabo, B. iv. p. 138.
That Augustus contemplated a descent on the island, but was prevented from attempting it by his being recalled from <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> by the disturbances in <placeName key="tgn,7015451">Dalmatia</placeName>, is very probable. Horace offers his vows for its
success:

<l>Orbis Britannos.</l></quote>  <bibl n="Hor. Carm. 1.35">Ode i. 35.</bibl></cit>
But the word <foreign lang="la">iturus</foreign> shews that the scheme was only projected, and the lines previously quoted are mere poetical flattery.
Strabo's statement of the communications kept up with the petty kings of Britain, who were perhaps divided by intestine wars, are, to a certain extent, probably correct, as such a policy would be a prelude to the intended expedition.

<p>During a scarcity of provisions, occasioned by bad crops for several successive years, he was stopped in the middle of the forum by the mob, who so abused him, at the same time pelting him with fragments of bread, that he had some difficulty in escaping into the palace by a back door.
He therefore used all possible means to bring provisions to the city, even in winter.
He proposed to the merchants a sure profit, by indemnifying them against any loss that might befall them by storms at sea; and granted great privileges to those who built ships for that traffic.
To a citizen of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> he gave an exemption from the penalty of the Papia-Poppaean law;

Caeruleus.
and the other Curtius and Albudinus, as likewise the river of the New Anio, in a stone canal: and distributed them into many magnificent reservoirs.
The canal from  the Fucine lake was undertaken as much for the sake of profit, as for the honour of the enterprise; for there were parties who offered to drain it at their own expense, on condition of their having a grant of the land laid dry.
With great difficulty he completed a canal three miles in length, partly by cutting through, and partly by tunnelling, a mountain; thirty thousand men being constantly employed  in  the work  for eleven years.<note anchored="yes">Respecting the Claudian aqueduct, see CALIGULA, c. xxi.</note>  He formed the harbour at <placeName key="perseus,Ostia">Ostia</placeName>, by carrying out circular piers on the right and on the left, with a mole protecting, in deep water, the entrance of the port.<note anchored="yes"><placeName key="perseus,Ostia">Ostia</placeName> is referred to in a note, TIBERIUS, c. xi.</note>

certainly ever appeared on the sea more astonishing than this vessel;

<p>He often distributed largesses of corn and money among the people, and entertained them with a great variety of public magnificent spectacles, not only such as were usual, and in the accustomed places, but some of new invention, and others revived from ancient models, and exhibited in places where nothing of the kind had been ever before attempted.
In the games which he presented at the dedication of Pompey's theatre,

<note anchored="yes">Contrary to the usual custom of rising and saluting the emperor with loud acclamations.
</note>
He likewise exhibited the secular games,
<note anchored="yes">A. U. C. 800.
</note>
giving out that Augustus had anticipated the regular period; though he himself says in his history, "That they had been omitted before the age of Augustus, who had calculated the years with great exactness, and again brought them to their regular period."<note anchored="yes">The Secular Games had been celebrated by Augustus, A.

of his life, and the Epode of Horace written on the occasion.
</note>
The crier was therefore ridiculed, when he invited people in the usual form, "to games which no person had ever before seen, nor ever would again;" when
many were still living who had already seen them; and some of the performers who had formerly acted in them, were now again brought upon the stage.
He likewise frequently celebrated the Circensian games in the <placeName key="tgn,7001168">Vatican</placeName>,
<note anchored="yes">In the circus which he had himself built.
</note>
sometimes exhibiting a hunt of wild beasts, after every five courses.
He embellished the Circus Maximus with marble barriers, and gilded goals, which before were of common stone
<note anchored="yes">Tophina; Tuffo, a porous stone of volcanic origin, which abounds in the neighbourhood of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and, with the Travartino, is employed in all common buildings.
</note>
and wood, and assigned proper places for the senators, who were used to sit promiscuously with the other spectators.
Besides the chariot-races, he exhibited there the Trojan game, and wild beasts from <placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>, which were encountered by a troop of pretorian knights, with their tribunes, and even the prefect at the head of them; besides Thessalian horse, who drive fierce bulls round the circus, leap upon their backs when they have exhausted their fury, and drag them by the horns to the ground.
He gave exhibitions of gladiators in several places, and of various kinds; one yearly on the anniversary of his accession in the pretorian camp,
<note anchored="yes">In compliment to the troops to whom he owed his elevation: see before, c. xi.
</note>
but without any hunting, or the usual apparatus; another in the Septa as usual; and in the same place, another out of the common way,. and of a few days' continuance only, which he called Sportula; because when he was going to present it, he informed the people by proclamation, " that he invited them to a late supper, got up in haste, and without ceremony."
Nor did he lend himself to any kind of public diversion with more freedom and hilarity; insomuch that he would hold out his left hand, and joined by the common people, count upon his fingers aloud the gold pieces presented to those who came off conquerors.
He would earnestly invite the company to be merry; sometimes calling them his "masters," with a mixture of insipid, far-fetched jests.
Thus when the people called for Palumbus,<note anchored="yes">Palumbus was a gladiator: and Claudius condescended to pun upon his name, which signifies a wood-pigeon.</note> he said, " He would give them one when he could catch it." The following was well-intended and well-timed; having, amidst great applause, spared a gladiator, on the intercession of his four sons, he sent a billet immediately round the theatre, to remind the people, " how much it behooved them to get children, since they had before them an example how useful they had been in procuring favour and security for a gladiator."
He likewise represented in the <placeName key="tgn,7006964">Campus Martius</placeName>, the assault and sacking of a town, and the surrender of the British kings,<note anchored="yes">See before, c. xvii. Described in c. xx. and note.

presiding in his general's cloak.
Immediately before he drew off the waters from the Fucine lake, he exhibited upon it a naval fight.
But the combatants on board the fleets crying out, "Health attend you, noble emperor! We, who are about to peril our lives, salute you;" and he replying, "Health attend you too," they all refused to fight, as if by that response he had meant to excuse them.
Upon this, he hesitated for a time, whether he should not destroy them all with fire and sword.
At last, leaping from his seat, and running along the shore of the lake with tottering steps, the result of his foul excesses, he, partly by fair words, and partly by threats, persuaded them to engage.
This spectacle represented an engagement between the fleets of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName>; consisting each of twelve ships of war, of three banks of oars.
The signal for the encounter was given by a silver
Triton, raised by machinery from  the middle of the lake.</p></div2>

<p>With regard to religious ceremonies, the administration of affairs both civil and military, and the condition of all orders of the people at home and abroad, some practices he corrected, others which had been laid aside he revived; and some regulations he introduced which were entirely new.
In appointing new priests for the several colleges, he made no appointments without being sworn.
When an earthquake happened in the city, he never failed to summon the people together by the praetor, and appoint holidays for sacred rites.
And upon the sight of any ominous bird in the City or Capitol, he issued an order for a supplication, the words of which, by virtue of his office of high-priest, after an exhortation from the rostra, he recited in the presence of the people, who repeated them after him; all workmen and slaves being first ordered to withdraw.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="23">
<p>The courts of judicature, whose sittings had been formerly divided between the summer and winter months, he ordered, for the dispatch of business, to sit the whole year round.
The jurisdiction in matters of trust, which used to be granted annually by special commission to certain magistrates, and in the city only, he made permanent, and extended to the provincial judges likewise.
He altered a clause added by Tiberius to the Papia-Poppaean law,
<note anchored="yes">See before, AUGUSTUS, c xxxiv.
</note>
which inferred that men of sixty years of age were incapable of begetting children.
He ordered that, out of the ordinary course of proceeding, orphans might have guardians appointed them by the consuls; and that those who were banished from any province by the chief magistrate, should be debarred from coming into the City, or any part of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>.
He inflicted on certain persons a new
sort of banishment, by forbidding them to depart further than three miles from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.
When any affair of importance came before the senate, he used to sit between the two consuls upon the seats of the tribunes.
He reserved to himself the power of granting license to travel out of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, which before had belonged to the senate.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="24">
<p>He likewise granted the consular ornaments to his Ducenarian procurators.
From those who declined the senatorian dignity, he took away the equestrian.
Although he had in the beginning of his reign declared, that he would admit no man into the senate who was not the great-grandson of a Roman citizen, yet he gave the "broad hem" to the son of a freedman, on condition that he should be adopted by a Roman knight.
Being afraid, however, of incurring censure by such an act, he informed the public, that his ancestor Appius Caecus, the censor, had elected the sons of freedmen into the senate; for he was ignorant, it seems, that in the times of Appius, and a long while afterwards, persons manumitted were not called freedmen, but only their sons who were free-born.
Instead of the expense which the college of quaestors was obliged to incur in paving the high-ways, he ordered them to give the people an exhibition of gladiators; and relieving them of the provinces of <placeName key="perseus,Ostia">Ostia</placeName> and [Cisalpine] <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, he reinstated them in the charge of the treasury, which, since it was taken from them, had been managed by the praetors, or those who had formerly filled that office.
He gave the triumphal ornaments to Silanus, who was betrothed to his daughter, though he was under age; and in other cases, he bestowed them on so many, and with so little reserve, that there is extant a letter unanimously addressed to him by all the legions, begging him "to grant his consular lieutenants the triumphal ornaments at the time of their appointment to commands, in order to prevent their seeking
occasion to engage in unnecessary wars."
He decreed to Aulus Plautius the honour of an ovation,

<p>His military organization of the equestrian order was this.
After having the command of a cohort, they were promoted to a wing of auxiliary horse, and subsequently received the commission of tribune of a legion.
He raised a body of militia, who were called Supernumeraries, who, though they were a sort of soldiers, and kept in reserve, yet received pay.
He procured an act of the senate to prohibit all soldiers from attending senators at their houses, in the way of respect and compliment.
He confiscated the estates of all freedmen who presumed to take upon themselves the equestrian rank.
Such of them  as were ungrateful to their patrons, and were complained of by them, he reduced to their former condition of slavery; and declared to their advocates, that he would always give judgment against the freedmen, in any suit at law which the masters might happen to have with them.
Some persons having exposed their sick slaves, in a languishing condition, on the island of Aesculapius,
<note anchored="yes">This island in the <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName>, opposite the Campus Martins, is said to have been formed by the corn sown by Tarquin the Proud on that consecrated field, and cut down and thrown by order of the consuls into the river. The water being low, it lodged in the bed of the stream, and gradual deposits of mud raising it above the level of the water, it
was in course of time covered with buildings. Among these was the
temple of AEsculapius, erected A. U. C. 462, to receive the serpent, the
emblem of that deity which was brought to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> in the time of a
plague. There is a coin of Antoninus Pius recording this event, and
Lumisdus has preserved copies of some curious votive inscriptions in
acknowledgment of cures which were found in its ruins, Antiquities of
<placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, p. 379.
It was common for the patient after having been exposed some nights
in the temple, without being cured, to depart and put an end to his
life. Suetonius here informs us that slaves so exposed, at last obtained
their freedom.
</note>
because of the tediousness of their cure; he
declared all who were so exposed perfectly free, never
more to return, if they should recover, to their former
servitude; and that if any one chose to kill at once,
rather than expose, a slave, he should be liable for murder. He published a proclamation, forbidding all travellers to pass through the towns of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> any otherwise than
on foot, or in a litter or chair.<note anchored="yes">Which were carried on the shoulders of slaves. This prohibition
had for its object either to save the wear and tear in the narrow streets,

soldiers at <placeName key="perseus,Puteoli">Puteoli</placeName>, and another at <placeName key="perseus,Ostia">Ostia</placeName>, to be in readiness against any accidents from fire. He prohibited foreigners from adopting Roman names, especially those

<placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, which Tiberius had transferred to his own
administration. He deprived the Lycians of their liberties, as a punishment for their fatal dissensions; but restored to the Rhodians their freedom, upon their repenting of their former misdemeanors. He exonerated for
ever the people of <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilium</placeName> from the payment of taxes, as
being the founders of the Roman race; reciting upon the
occasion a letter in Greek, from the senate and people of

<note anchored="yes">Suetonius has already, in TIBERIUS, C. xxxvi., mentioned the expulsion of the Jews from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and this passage confirms the conjecture, offered in the note, that the Christians were obscurely alluded to in the former notice. The antagonism between Christianity and Judaism appears to have given rise to the tumults which first led the authorities to interfere. Thus much we seem to learn from both passages: but the most enlightened men of that age were singularly ill-informed on the stupendous events which had recently occurred in <placeName key="tgn,7001407">Judea</placeName>, and we find Suetonius, although he lived at the commencement of the first century of the Christian aera, when the memory of these occurrences was still fresh, and it might be supposed, by that time, widely diffused, transplanting Christ from <placeName key="tgn,7001371">Jerusalem</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, and placing him in the time of Claudius, although the crucifixion took place during the reign of Tiberius. St. <placeName key="tgn,2047783">Luke</placeName>, Acts xviii. 2, mentions the expulsion of the Jews from <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> by the emperor Claudius: Dio, however, says that he did not expel them, but only forbad their religious assemblies. It was very natural for Suetonius to write Chrestus instead of Christus, as the former was a name in use among the Greeks and Romans. Among others, Cicero mentions a person of that name in his Fam.

He allowed the ambassadors of the <placeName key="tgn,2088713">Germans</placeName> to sit at the public spectacles in the seats assigned to the senators, being induced to grant them favours by their frank and honourable conduct.
For, having been seated in the rows of benches which were common to the people, on observing the Parthian and Armenian ambassadors sitting among the senators, they took upon themselves to cross over into the same seats, as being, they
said, no way inferior to the others, in point either of merit or rank.  The religiouis rites of the Druids, solemnized
with such horrid cruelties, which had only been forbidden the citizens of <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> during the reigh of Augustus, he utterly
abolished among the Gauls.<note anchored="yes"><placeName key="tgn,2119609">Pliny</placeName> tells us that Druidism had its origin in <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, and was trnsplanted into <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName>, xxi. 1.  Julius Caesar asserts just the contrary, <bibl n="Caes. Gal. 6.13">Bell. Gall. vi.13.11</bibl>.

people.  He concluded treateis with foreign princes in the forum, with the sacrifice of a sow and the form of
words used by the heralds in former times.  But in these and other thigns, and indeed the greater part of his administration,
he was directed not so much by his own judgment, as by the influence of his wives and freedmen;  for the most part
acting in conformity to what their interests or fancies dictated.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="26">
<p>He was trice married at a very early age, first to Aemilia Lepida, the grand-daughter of Autustus, and
afterwards to Livia Medullina, who had the cognomen of Camilla, and was descended from the old dictator Camillus.
The former he divorced while still a virgin, because her parents had incurred the displeasure of Augustus;  and
he lost the latter by sickness on the day fixed for their nuptials.  He next married Plautia Urgulanilla, whose
father had enjoyed the honour of a triumph;  and soon afterwards, Aelia Paetina, the daughter of a man of consular rank.
But he divorced them both; Paetina, upon some trifling cause of disgust; and Urgulanilla, for scandalous lewdness, and the suspicion of murder.
After them he took in marriage Valeria Messalina,the daughter of Barbatus Messala, his cousin.
But finding that, besides her other shameful debaucheries, she had even gone so far as to marry in his own absence Caius Silius, the settlement of her dowry being formally signed, in the presence of the augurs, he put her to death.
When summoning his pretorians to his presence, he made to them this declaration: "As I have been so unhappy in my unions, I am resolved to continue in future unmarried; and if I should not, I give you leave to stab me."</p>
<p>He was, however, unable to persist in this resolution; for he began immediately to think of another wife; and even of taking back Paetina, whom he had formerly divorced: he thought also of Lollia Paulina, who had been married to Caius Caesar.
But being ensnared by the arts of Agrippina, the daughter of his brother Germanicus, who took advantage of the kisses and endearments which their near relationship admitted, to inflame his desires, he got some one to propose at the next meeting of the senate, that they should oblige the emperor to marry Agrippina, as a measure highly conducive to the public interest; and that in future liberty should be given for such marriages, which until that time had been considered incestuous.
In less than twenty-four hours after this, he married her.<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 801</note>
No person was found, however, to follow the example, excepting one freedman, and a centurion of the first rank, at the solemnization of whose nuptials both he and Agrippina attended.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="27">
<p>He had children by three of his wives; by Urgulanilla, Drusus and Claudia; by Petina, Antonia;
and by Messalina, Octavia, and also a son, whom at first he called Germanicus, but afterwards Britannicus.
He lost Drusus at <placeName key="perseus,Pompeii">Pompeii</placeName>, when he was very young; he being choked with a pear, which in his play he tossed into the air, and caught in his mouth.
Only a few days before, he had betrothed him to one of Sejanus's daughters;<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 773</note> and I am therefore surprised that some authors should say he lost his life by the treachery of Sejanus.
Claudia, who was, in truth, the daughter of Bbter his freedman, though she was born five months before his divorce, he ordered to be thrown naked at her mother's door.
He married Antonia to Cneius Pompey the Great,<note anchored="yes">It would seem from this passage, that the cognomen of " the Great," had now been restored to the descendants of Cneius Pompey, on whom it was first conferred.</note> and afterwards to Faustus Sylla,<note anchored="yes">A.

Britannicus was born upon the twentieth day of his reign, and in his second consulship.
He often earnestly commended him to the soldiers, holding him in his arms before their ranks; and would likewise show him to the people in the theatre, setting him upon his lap, or holding him out whilst he was still very young; and was sure to receive their acclamations, and good wishes on his behalf.
Of his sons-in-law, he adopted Nero.
He not only dismissed from his favour both Pompey and <placeName key="tgn,1046911">Silanus</placeName>, but put them to death.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="28">
<p>Amongst his freedmen, the greatest favourite was the eunuch Posides, whom, in his British triumph, he presented with the pointless spear, classing him among the military men.
Next to him, if not equal, in favour was <placeName key="tgn,2324437">Felix</placeName>,<note anchored="yes">This is the <placeName key="tgn,2324437">Felix</placeName> mentioned in the Acts, cc. xxiii., and xxiv., before

He is mentioned by Josephus; and Tacitus, who calls him Felix Antonius, gives his character: Annal. v. 9. 6.
</note> whom  he not only preferred to commands
both of cohorts and troops, but to the government of the province of <placeName key="tgn,7001407">Judea</placeName>; and he became, in consequence of his elevation, the husband of three queens.
<note anchored="yes">It appears that two of these wives of <placeName key="tgn,2324437">Felix</placeName> were named Drusilla. One, mentioned Acts xxiv. 24, and there called a Jewess, was the sister of king Agrippa, and had married before, Azizus, king of the Emessenes. The other Drusilla, though not a queen, was of royal birth, being the grand-daughter of Cleopatra by Mark Antony. Who the third wife of <placeName key="tgn,2101139">Felix</placeName> was, is unknown.

Another favourite was Harpocras, to whom he granted the privilege of being carried in a litter within the city, and of holding public spectacles for the entertainment of the people.
In this class was likewise Polybius, who assisted him in his studies, and had often the honour of walking between the two consuls.

the comptroller of his accounts, were in high favour with him.
He not only allowed them to receive, by decree of the senate, immense presents, but also to be decorated with the questorian and praetorian ensigns of honour.
So much did he indulge them in amassing wealth, and plundering the public, that, upon his complaining, once, of the lowness of his exchequer, some one said, with great reason, that "It would be full enough, if those two freedmen of his would but take him into partnership with them."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="29">
<p>Being entirely governed by these freedmen, and, as I have already said, by his wives, he was a tool to others, rather than a prince.
He distributed offices, or the command of armies, pardoned or punished, according as it suited their interests, their passions, or their caprice; and for the most part, without knowing, or being sensible of what he did.
Not to enter into minute details relative to the revocation of grants, the reversal of judicial decisions, obtaining his signature to fictitious appointments, or the bare-faced alteration of them after signing; he put to death Appius Silanus, the father of his son-in-law, and the two Julias, the daughters of Drusus and Germanicus, without any positive proof of the crimes with which they were charged, or so much as permitting them to make any defence.
He also cut of Cneius Pompey, the husband of his eldest daughter; and Lucius Silanus, who was betrothed to the younger Pompey, was stabbed in the act of unnatural lewdness with a favourite paramour.
Silanus was obliged to quit the office of praetor upon the fourth of the calends of January [29th Dec.], and to kill himself on new year's day<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 802</note> following, the very same on which Claudius and Agrippina were married.
He condemned to death five and thirty senators, and above three hundred Roman knights, with so little attention to what he did, that when a centuon brought him word of the execution ofa man of consular rank, who was one of the number, and told him that he had executed his order, he declared, "he had ordered no such thing, but that he approved of it;" because his freedmen, it seems, had said, that the soldiers did nothing more than their duty, in dispatching the emperor's enemies without waiting for a warrant.
But it is beyond all belief, that he himself, at the marriage of Messalina with the adulterous Silius, should actually sign the writings relative to her dowry; induced, as it is pretended, by the design of diverting from himself and transferring upon another the danger which some omens seemed to threaten him.</p></div2>

<p>Either standing or sitting, but especially when he lay asleep, he had a majestic and graceful apearance;
for he was tall, but not slender.
His grey locks became him well, and he had a full neck.
But his knees were feeble, and failed him in walking, so that his gait was ungainly, both when he assumed state, and when he was taking diversion.
He was outrageous in his laughter, and still more so in his wrath, for then he foamed at the mouth, and discharged from his nostrils.
He also stammered in his speech, and had a tremulous motion of the head at all times, but particularly when he was engaged in any business, however trifling.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="31">
<p>Though his health was very infirm during the former part of his life, yet, after he became emperor, he enjoyed a good state of health, except only that he was subject to a pain of the stomach.
In a fit of this complaint, he said he had thoughts of killing himself.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="32">
<p>He gave entertainments as frequent as they were splendid, and generally when there was such ample room, that very often six hundred guests sat down together.
At a feast he gave on the banks of the canal for draining the Fucine Lake, he narrowly escaped being drowned, the water at its discharge rushing out with such violence, that it overflowed the conduit.
At supper he had always his own children, with those of several of the nobility, who, according to an ancient custom, sat at the feet of the couches.
One of his guests having been suspected of purloining a golden cup, he invited him again the next day, but served him.
with a porcelain jug. It is said, too, that he intended to publish an edict, "allowing to all people the liberty of giving vent at table to any distension occasioned by flatulence," upon hearing of a person whose modesty, when under restraint, had nearly cost him his life.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="33">
<p>He was always ready to eat and drink at any time or in any place.
One day, as he was hearing causes
in the forum of Augustus, he smelt the dinner which was preparing for the Salii,
<note anchored="yes">The Salii, the priests of <placeName key="tgn,2090583">Mars</placeName>, twelve in number, were instituted by <placeName key="tgn,2033144">Numa</placeName>. Their dress was an embroidered tunic, bound with a girdle ornamented with brass. They wore on their head a conical cap, of a considerable height; carried a sword by their side; in their right hand a spear or rod, and in their left, one of the Ancilia, or shields of <placeName key="tgn,2090583">Mars</placeName>. On solemn occasions, they used to go to the Capitol, through the forum and other public parts of the city, dancing and singing sacred songs, said to have been composed by <placeName key="tgn,2033144">Numa</placeName>; which, in the time of <placeName key="tgn,2399200">Horace</placeName>, could hardly be understood by any one, even the priests themselves. The most solemn procession of the Salii was on the first of March, in commemoration of the time when the sacred shield was believed to have fallen from heaven, in the reign of <placeName key="tgn,2033144">Numa</placeName>. After their procession, they had a splendid entertainment, the luxury of which was proverbial.

in the temple of <placeName key="tgn,2090583">Mars</placeName> adjoining, whereupon he quitted the tribunal, and went to partake of the feast with the priests.
He scarcely ever left the table until he had thoroughly crammed himself and drank to intoxication;  and  then he would  immediately fall asleep, lying upon his back with his'mouth open.
While in this condition, a feather was put down his throat, to make him  throw up the contents of his stomach.
Upon composing himself to rest, his sleep was short, and he usually awoke before midnight; but he would sometimes sleep in the daytime, and that, even, when he was upon the tribunal; so that the advocates often found it difficult to wake him, though they raised their voices for that purpose.
He set no bounds to his libidinous intercourse with women, but never betrayed any unnatural desires for the other sex.
He was fond of gaming, and published a book upon the subject.
He even used to play as he rode in his chariot, having  the tables so fitted, that the game was not disturbed by the motion of the carriage.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="34">
<p>His cruel and sanguinary disposition was exhibited upon great as well as trifling occasions.
When any person was to be put to the torture, or criminal punished for parricide, he was impatient for the execution, and would have it performed in his own presence.
When he was at Tibur, being desirous of seeing an example of the old way of putting malefactors to death, some were immediately bound to a stake for the purpose; but there being no executioner to be had at the place, he sent for one from <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, and waited for his coming until night.
In any exhibition of gladiators, presented either by himself or others, if any of the combatants chanced to fall, he ordered them to be butchered, especially the Retiaii, that he might see their faces in the agonies of death.
Two gladiators happening to kill each other, he immediately ordered some little knives to be made of their swords for his own use.
He took great pleasure in seeing men engage with wild beasts, and the combatants who appeared on the stage at noon.
He woul I therefore come to the theatre by break of day, and at noon, dismissing the people to dinner, continued sitting himself; and besides those who were devoted to that sanguinary fate, he would match others with the beasts, upon slight or sudden occasions; as, for instance, the carpenters and their assistants, and people of that sort, if a machine, or any piece of work in which they had been employed about the theatre did not answer the purpose for which it had been intended.
To this desperate kind of encounter he forced one of his nomenclators, even encumbered as he was by wearing the toga.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="35">
<p>But the characteristics most predominant in him were fear and distrust.
In the beginning of his reign, though he much affected a modest and humble appearance, as has been already observed, yet he durst not venture himself at an entertainment without being
attended by a guard of spearmen, and made soldiers wait upon him at table instead of servants.
He never visited a sick person, until the chamber had been first searched, and the bed and bedding thoroughly examined.
At other times, all persons who came to pay their court to him were strictly searched by officers appointed for that purpose; nor was it until after a long time, and with much difficulty, that he was prevailed upon to excuse women, boys, and girls from such rude handling, or suffer their attendants or writing-masters to retain their cases for pens and styles.
When <placeName key="tgn,2068320">Camillus</placeName> formed his plot against him, not doubting but his timidity might be worked upon without a war, he wrote to him a scurrilous, petulant, and threatening letter, desiring him to resign the government, and betake himself to a life of privacy.
Upon receiving this requisition, he had some thoughts of complying with it, and summoned together the principal men of, the city, to consult with them on the subject.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="36">
<p>Having heard some loose reports of conspiracies formed against him, he was so much alarmed, that he thought of immediately abdicating the government.
And when, as I have before related, a man armed with a dagger was discovered near him while he was sacrificing, he instantly ordered the heralds to convoke the senate, and with tears and dismal exclamations, lamented that such was his condition, that he was safe no where; and for a long time afterwards he abstained from appearing in public.
He smothered his ardent love for Messalina, not so much on account of her infamous conduct, as from apprehension of danger; believing that she aspired to share with Silius, her partner in adultery, the imperial dignity.
Upon this occasion he ran in a great fright, and a very shameful manner, to the camp, asking all the way he went, "if the empire were indeed safely his."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="37">
<p>No suspicion was too trifling, no person on whom it rested too contemptible, to throw him into a panic, and inuce him to take precautions for his safety, and meditate reveng, A man engaged in a litigation before his tribunal, having saluted him, drew him aside, and told him he had dreamt that he saw him murdered; and shortly afterwards, when his adversary came to deliver his plea to the emperor, the plaintiff, pretending to have discovered the murderer, pointed to him as the man he had seen in his dream; whereupon, as if he had been taken in the act, he was hurried away to execution.
We are informed, that Appius Silanus was got rid of in the same manner, by a contrivance betwixt Messalina and Narcissus, in which they had their several parts assigned them.
Narcissus therefore burst into his lord's chamber before daylight, apparently in great fright, and told him that he had dreamt that Appius Silanus had murdered him.
The empress, upon this, affecting great surprise, declared she had the like dream for several nights successively.
Presently afterwards, word was brought, as it had been agreed on, that Appius was come, he having, indeed, received orders the preceding day to be there at that time; and, as if the truth of the dream was sufficiently confirmed by his appearance at that juncture, he was immediately ordered to be prosecuted and put to death.
The day following, Claudius related the whole affair to the senate, and acknowledged his great obligation to his freedmen for watching over him even in his sleep.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="38">
<p>Sensible of his being subject to passion and resentment, he excused himself in both instances by a proclamation, assuring the public that " the former should be short and harmless, and the latter never without good cause."
After severely reprimanding the people of <placeName key="tgn,7007018">Ostia</placeName>
for not sending some boats to meet him upon his entering the mouth of the <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName>, in terms which might expose them to the public resentment, he wrote to <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> that he had been treated as a private person; yet immediately afterwards he pardoned them, and that in a way which had the appearance of making them satisfaction, or begging pardon for some injury he had done them.
Some people who addressed him unseasonably in public, he pushed away with his own hand.
He likewise banished a person who had been secretary to a quaestor, and even a senator who had filled the office of praetor.
without a hearing, and although they were innocent; the former only because he had treated him with rudeness while he was in a private station, and the other, because in his aedileship he had fined some tenants of his, for selling some cooked victuals contrary to law, and ordered his steward, who interfered, to be whipped.
On this account, likewise, he took from the ediles the jurisdiction they had over cooks'-shops.
He did not scruple to speak of his own absurdities, and declared in some short speeches which he published, that he had only feigned imbecility in the reign of Caius, because otherwise it would have been impossible for him to have escaped and arrived at the station he had then attained.
He could not, however, gain credit for this assertion; for a short time afterwards, a book was published under the title of <title lang="greek">*mwrw=n a)nasta/sis</title>, "The Resurrection of Fools," the design of which was to show "that nobody ever counterfeited folly."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="39">
<p>Amongst other things, people admired in him his indifference and unconcern; or, to express it in Greek, his <foreign lang="greek">metewci/a</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">a)blefi/a</foreign>.
Placing himself at table a little after Messalina's death, he enquired, "Why the empress did not come?" Many of those whom he had condemned to death, he ordered the day after to be invited to
his table, and to game with him, and sent to reprimand them as sluggish fellows for not making greater haste.
When he was meditating his incestuous marriage with Agrippina, he was perpetually calling her, "My daughter, my nursling, born and brought up upon my lap."
And when he was going to adopt Nero, as if there was little cause for censure in his adopting a son-in-law, when he had a son of his own arrived at years of maturity; he continually gave out in public, "that no one had ever been admitted by adoption into the Claudian family."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="40">
<p>He frequently appeared so careless in what he said, and so inattentive to circumstances, that it was believed he never reflected who he himself was, or amongst whom, or at what time or in what place, he spoke.  In the debate in the senate relative to the butchers and vintners, he cried out, "I ask you, who can live without a bit of meat ?" And mentioned the great plenty of old taverns, from which he himself used formerly to have his wine.
Among other reasons for his supporting a certain person who was candidate for the quaestorship, he gave this: "His father," said he, " once gave me, very seasonably, a draught of cold water when I was sick."
Upon his bringing a woman as a witness in some cause before the senate, he said, "This woman was my mother's freedwoman and dresser, but she always considered me as her nraster; and this I say, because there are some still in my family that do not look upon tie as such."
The people of <placeName key="perseus,Ostia">Ostia</placeName> addressing him in open court with a petition, he flew into a rage at them, and said, "There is no reason why I should oblige you: if any one else is free to act as he pleases, surely I am." The following expressions he had in his mouth every day, and at all hours and seasons: "What! do you take me for a Theogonius?"<note anchored="yes">Scaliger and Casaubon give Teleggenius as the reading of the best manuscripts.
Whoever he was, his name seems to have been a byeword for a notorious fool.

"Speak, but do not touch me;" besides many other familiar sentences, below the dignity of a private person, much more of an emperor, who was not deficient either in eloquence or learning, as having applied himself very closely to the liberal sciences.</p></div2>

<p>By the encouragement of Titus Livius,<note anchored="yes">Titus Livius, the prince of Roman historians, died in the fourth year of the reign of Tiberius, A. U. C. 771; at which time Claudius was about twenty-seven years old, having been born A. U. C. 744.</note> and with the assistance of Sulpicius Flavus, he attempted at an early age the comlpeitiQof a history;   and having called together a numerous auditory, to hear and give their judgment upon it, he read it over with much difficulty, and frequently interrupting himself.
For after he had begun, a great laugh was raised amongst the company, by the breaking of several benches from the weight of a very fat man; and even when order was restored, he could not forbear bursting out into violent fits of laughter, at the remembrance of the accident.
After he became emperor, likewise, he wrote several things which he was careful to have recited to his friends by a reader.
He commenced his history from the death of the dictator Caesar; but afterwards he took a later period, and began at the conclusion of the civil wars; because he found he could not speak with freedom, and a due regard to truth, concerning the former period, having been often taken to task both by his mother and grandmother.
Of the earlier history he left only two books, but of the latter, one and forty.
He compiled likewise the "'History of his Own Life," in eight books, full of absurdities, but in no bad style; also, "A Defence of Cicero against the Books of Asinius Gallus,"<note anchored="yes">Asinius Gallus was the son of Asinius Pollio, the famous orator, and
had written a book comparing his father with Cicero, and giving the
former the preference.
</note>
which exhibited a considerable degree of learning.
He besides invented three new letters, and added them to the former alphabet,<note anchored="yes">Quintilian informs us, that one of the three new letters the emperor
Claudius attempted to introduce, was the AEolic digamma, which had
the same force as v consonant. Priscian calls another anti-sigma, and
says that the character proposed was two Greek sigmas, back to back,
and that it was substituted for the Greek <foreign lang="greek">y</foreign>, ps. The other letter is not
known, and all three soon fell into disuse.</note> as highly necessary.
He published a book to recommend them while he was yet only a private person; but on his elevation to imperial power he had little difficulty in introducing them into common use; and these letters are still extant in a variety of books, registers, and inscriptions upon buildings.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="42">
<p>He applied himself with no less attention to the study ofGreciani literature, asserting upon all occasions his love of that language, and its surpassing excellency.
A stranger once holding a discourse both in Greek and Latin, he addressed him thus: " Since you are skilled in both our tongues."
And recommending Achaia to the favour of the senate, he said, " I have a particular attachment to that province, on account of our common studies."
In the senate he often made long replies to ambassadors in that language.
On the tribunal he frequently quoted the verses of Homer.
When at any time he had taken vengeance on an enemy or a conspirator, he scarcely ever gave to the tribune on guard, who, according to custom, came for the word, any other than this:
<quote lang="greek"><l>a)/ndr' e)pamu/nasqai o(/te tis pro/teros xaleph/nh|</l></quote>
<quote lang="en"><l>'Tis time to strike when wrong demands the blow.</l></quote>
To conclude, he wrote some histories likewise in Greek,
namely, twenty books on Tuscan affairs, and eight on the
Carthaginian; in consequence of which another museum
was founded at <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName>, in addition to the old one, and called after his name; and it was ordered, that, upon certain days in every year, his Tuscan history should be read over in one of these, and his Carthaginian in the other, as in a school; each history being read through by persons who took it in turn.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="43">
<p>Towards the close of his life, he gave some manifest indications that he repented of his marriage with Agrippina, and his adoption of <placeName key="tgn,2538429">Nero</placeName>.  For some of his freedmen noticing with approbation his having condemned, the day before, a woman accused of adultery, he remarked, "It has been my misfortune to have wives who have been unfaithful to my bed; but they did not escape punishment."
Often, when he happened to meet Britannicus, he would embrace him tenderly, and express a desire " that he might grow apace, and receive from him an account of all his actions:" using the Greek phrase, <quote lang="greek">o( trw/sas kai\ i)a/setai</quote>, "He who has wounded will also heal."
And intending to give him the manly habit, while he was under age and a tender youth, because his stature would allow of it, he added, "I do so, that the Roman people may at last have a real Caesar."<note anchored="yes">Caesar by birth, not by adoption, as the preceding emperors had been, and as Nero would be, if he succeeded.</note></p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="44">
<p>Soon afterwards he made his will, and had it signed by all the magistrates as witnesses.
But he was prevented from proceeding further by Agrippina, accused by her own guilty conscience, as well as by informers, of a variety of crimes.
It is agreed that he was taken off by poison; but where, and by whom administered, remains in uncertainty.
Some authors say that it was given him as he was feasting with the priests in the Capitol, by the eunuch Halotus, his taster.
Others say by Agrippina, at his own table, in mushrooms, a dish of which he was
very fond.<note anchored="yes">Tacitus informs us, that the poison was prepared by Locusta, of whom we shall hear, NERO, C. xxiii. etc.</note> The accounts of what followed likewise differ.
Some relate that he instantly became speechless, was racked with pain through the night, and died about daybreak; others, that at first he fell into a sound sleep, -and afterwards.
his food rising, he threw up the whole; but had another dose given him; whether in water-gruel, under pretence of refreshment after his exhaustion, or in a clyster, as if designed to relieve his bowels, is likewise uncertain.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="45">
<p>His death was kept secret until everything was settled relative to his successor.
Accordingly, vows were made for his recovery, and comedians were called to amuse him, as it was pretended, by his own desire.
He died upon the third of the ides of October [13th October], in the consulship of Asinius Marcellus and Acilius Aviola, in the sixty-fourth year of his age, and the fourteenth of his reign.<note anchored="yes">A. U. C. 806; <date value="54">A. D 54</date>.</note>
His funeral was celebrated with the customary imperial pomp, and he was ranked amongst the gods.
This honour was taken from him by Nero, but restored by Vespasian.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="46">
<p>The chief presages of his death were, the appearance of a comet, his father Drusus's monument being struck by lightning, and the death of most of the magistrates of all ranks that year.
It appears from several circumstances, that he was sensible of his approaching dissolution, and made no secret of it. For when he nominated the consuls, he appointed no one to fill the office beyond the month in which he died.
At the last assembly of the senate in which he made his appearance, he earnestly exhorted his two sons to unity with each other, and with earnest entreaties commended to the fathers the care of their tender years.
And in the last cause he heard from the tribunal, he repeatedly declared in open court, "That he was now arrived at the last stage of mortal existence;" whilst all who heard it shrunk at hearing these ominous words.</p></div2>

<head>Remarks on Claudius</head>
<p>It has been already observed, that Claudius was entirely governed by his freedmen; a class of retainers which enjoyed a great share of favour and confidence with their patrons in those times.
They had before been the slaves of their masters, and had obtained their freedom as a reward for their faithful and attentive services.
Of the esteem in which they were often held, we meet with an instance in <placeName key="tgn,2082201">Tiro</placeName>, the freedman of Cicero, to whom that illustrious Roman addresses several epistles, written in the most familiar and affectionate strain of friendship.
As it was common for them to be taught the more useful parts of education in the families of their masters, they were usually well qualified for the management of domestic concerns, and might even be competent to the superior departments of the state, especially in those times when negotiations and treaties with foreign princes seldom or never occurred; and in arbitrary governments, where public affairs were directed more by the will of the sovereign or his ministers, than by refined suggestions of policy.</p>
<p>From the character generally given of Claudius before his elevation to the throne, we should not readily imagine that he was endowed with any taste for literary composition; yet he seems to have exclusively enjoyed this distinction during his own reign, in which learning was at a low ebb.
Besides history, Suetonius informs us that he wrote a Defence of Cicero against the Charges of Asinius Gallus.
This appears to be the only tribute of esteem or approbation paid to the character of Cicero, from the time of Livy the historian, to the extinction of the race of the Caesars.

<div2 type="chapter" n="1">
<p>Two celebrated families, the Calvini and Aenobarbi, sprung from the race of the Domitii.
The AEnobarbi derive both their extraction and their cognomen from one Lucius Domitius, of whom we have this tradition: -- As he was returning out of the country to <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, he was met by two young men of a most august appearance, who desired him to announce to the senate and people a victory, of which no certain intelligence had yet reached the city.
To prove that they were more than mortals, they stroked his cheeks, and thus changed his hair, which was black, to a bright colour, resembling that of brass; which mark of distinction descended to his posterity, for they had generally red beards.
This family had the honour of seven consulships, one triumph, and two censorships; and being admitted into the patrician order, they continued the use of the same cognomen, with no other praenomina, than those of Cneius and <placeName key="tgn,2023439">Lucius</placeName>.
These, however, they assumed with singular irregularity; three persons in succession sometimes adhering to one of them, and then they were changed alternately.
For the first, second, and third of the AEnobarbi had the praenomen of <placeName key="tgn,2023439">Lucius</placeName>, and
again the three following, successively, that of Cneius, while those who came after were called, by turns, one, <placeName key="tgn,2023439">Lucius</placeName>, and the other, Cneius.
It appears to me proper to give a short account of several of the family, to show that <placeName key="tgn,2538429">Nero</placeName> so far degenerated from the noble qualities of his ancestors, that he retained only their vices; as if those alone had been transmitted to him by his descent.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="2">
<p>To begin, therefore, at a remote period, his greatgrandfather's grandfather, Cneius Domitius, when he was tribune of the people, being offended with the high priests for electing another than himself in the room of his father, obtained the transfer of the right of election from the colleges of the priests to the people.
In his consulship,<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 632</note> having conquered the Allobroges and the Arverni,<note anchored="yes">The Allobroges were a tribe of Gauls, inhabiting Dauphiny and <placeName key="tgn,2050549">Savoy</placeName>; the Averni have left their name in <placeName key="tgn,7002871">Auvergne</placeName>.</note> he made a progress through the province, mounted upon an elephant, with a body of soldiers attending him, in a sort of triumphal pomp.
Of this person the orator Licinius Crassus said, "It was no wonder he had a brazen beard, who had a face of iron, and a heart of lead."
His son, during his praetorship,<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 695</note> proposed that Cneius Caesar, upon the expiration of his consulship, should be called to account before the senate for his administration of that office, which was supposed to be contrary both to the omens and the laws.
Afterwards, when he was consul himself,<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 700</note> he tried to deprive Cneius of the command of the army, and having been, by intrigue and cabal, appointed his successor, he was made prisoner at Corsinium, in the beginning of the civil war.
Being set at liberty, he went to <placeName key="tgn,7008781">Marseilles</placeName>, which was then besieged; where having by his presence, animated the people to hold out, he suddenly
deserted them, and at last was slain in the battle of Pharsalia.
He was a man of little constancy, and of a sullen temper.
In despair of his fortunes, he had recourse to poison, but was so terrified at the thoughts of death, that, immediately repenting, he took a vomit to throw it up again, and gave freedom to his physician for having, with great prudence and wisdom, given him only a gentle dose of the poison.
When Cneius Pompey was consulting with his friends in what manner he should conduct himself towards those who were neuter and took no part in the contest, he was the only one who proposed that they should be treated as enemies.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="3">
<p>He left a son, who was, without doubt, the best of the family.
By the Pedian law, he was condemned, although innocent, amongst others who were concerned in the death of Caesar.<note anchored="yes">A. U. C. 711.</note>
Upon this, he went over to Brutus and Cassius, his near relations; and, after their death, not only kept together the fleet, the command of which had been given him some time before, but even increased it.</p>
<p>At last, when the party had everywhere been defeated, he voluntarily surrendered it to Mark Antony; considering it as a piece of service for which the latter owed him no small obligations.
Of all those who were condemned by the law above-mentioned, he was the only man who was restored to his country, and filled the highest offices.
When the civil war again broke out, he was appointed lieutenant under the.same Antony, and offered the chief command by those who were ashamed of Cleopatra; but not daring, on account of a sudden indisposition with which he was seized, either to accept or refuse it, he went over to Augustus,<note anchored="yes">A. U. C. 723.</note>
and died a few days after, not without an aspersion cast upon his memory.
For Antony gave
out, that he was induced to change sides by his impatience to be with his mistress, Servilia Nais.

and no less famous in his youth for his dexterity in chariot-driving, than he was afterwards for the triumphal ornaments which he obtained in the German war.
But he was a man of great arrogance, prodigality, and cruelty.
When he was aedile, he obliged Lucius Plancus, the censor, to give him the way; and in his praetorship, and consulship, he made Roman knights and married women act on the stage.
He gave hunts of wild beasts, both in the Circus and in all the wards of the city; as also a show of gladiators; but with such barbarity, that Augustus, after privately reprimanding him, to no purpose, was obliged to restrain him by a public edict.</p></div2>

During his attendance upon Caius Caesar in the East, he killed a freedman of his own, for refusing to drink as much as he ordered him.

While many fearful conjectures, in respect to his future fortune, were formed by different persons, from the circumstances of his nativity, a saying of his father, Domitius, was regarded as an ill presage, who told his friends who were congratulating him upon the occasion, "That nothing but what was detestable and pernicious to the public, could ever be produced of him  and Agrippina."

He lost his father when he was three years old, being left heir to a third part of his estate; of which he never got possession, the whole being seized by his co-heir, Caius.
His mother being soon after banished, he lived with his aunt Lepida, in a very necessitous condition, under the care of two tutors, a dancing-master and a barber.
After Claudius came to the empire, he not only recovered his father's estate, but was enriched with the additional inheritance of that of his step-father, Crispus Passienus.
Upon his mother's recall from banishment, he ,vas advanced to such favour, through <placeName key="tgn,2538428">Nero</placeName>'s powerful /terest with the emperor, that it was reported, assassins were employed by Messalina, Claudius's wife, to strangle him, as Britannicus's rival, whilst he was taking his noon-day repose.
In addition to the story, it was said that they were frightened by a serpent, which crept from under his cushion, and ran away.
The tale was occasioned by finding on his couch, near the pillow, the skin of a snake, which, by his mother's order, he wore for some time upon his right arm, inclosed in a bracelet of gold.
This amulet, at last, he laid aside, from aversion to her memory; but he sought for it again in vain, in the time of his extremity.</p></div2>

<p>When he was yet a mere boy, before he arrived at the age of puberty, during the celebration of the Circensian Games,<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 806</note>
he performed his part in the Trojan play with a degree of firmness which gained him great applause.  In the eleventh year of his age,
he was adopted by Claudius, and placed under the tuition of Anneus <placeName key="tgn,1002882">Seneca</placeName>,

who had been made a senator.
It is said, that <placeName key="tgn,2652379">Seneca</placeName> dreamt the night after, that he was giving a lesson to Caius Caesar.<note anchored="yes">Caligula</note>  Nero soon verified his dream, betraying the cruelty of his disposition in every way he could.
For he attempted to persuade his father that his brother, Britannicus, was nothing but a changeling, because the latter had saluted him, notwithstanding his adoption, by the name of ,Enobarbus, as usual.
When his aunt, Lepida, was brought to trial, he appeared in court as a witness against her, to gratify his mother, who persecuted the accused.
On his introduction into the Forum, at the age of manhood, he gave a largess to the people and a donative to the soldiers; for the pretorian cohorts, he appointed a solemn procession under arms, and marched at the head of them with a shield in his hand; after which he went to return thanks to his father in the senate.
Before Claudius, likewise, at the time he was consul, he made a speech for the Bolognese, in Latin, and for the Rhodians and people of <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilium</placeName>, in Greek.
He had the jurisdiction of praefect of the city, for the first time, during the Latin festival; during which the most celebrated advocates brought before him, not short and trifling causes, as is usual in that case, but trials of importance, notwithstanding  they had instructions from Claudius himself to the contrary.
Sooa afterwards, he married Octavia, and exhibited the Circensian games, and hunting of wild beasts, in honour of Claudius.</p></div2>

<p>He was seventeen years of age at the death of that prince,<note anchored="yes">A. U. C. 809 -- <date value="87">A. D. 87</date>.</note> and as soon as that event was made public,
he went out to the cohort on guard between the hours of six and seven; for the omens were so disastrous, that no earlier time of the day was judged proper.
On the steps before the palace gate, he was unanimously saluted by the soldiers as their emperor, and then carried in a litter to the camp; thence, after making a short speech to the troops, into the senate-house, where he continued until the evening; of all the immense honours which were heaped upon him, refusing but the title of FATHER OF HIS COUNTRY, on account of his youth.</p></div2>

<p>He began his reign with an ostentation of dutiful regard to the memory of Claudius, whom he buried with the utmost pomp and magnificence, pronouncing the funeral oration himself, and then had him enrolled amongst the gods.
He paid likewise the highest honours to the memory of his father Domitius.
He left the management of affairs, both public and private, to his mother.
The word which he gave the first day of his reign to the tribune on guard, was, "The Best of Mothers," and afterwards he frequently appeared with her in the streets of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> in her litter.
He settled a colony at <placeName key="perseus,Antium">Antium</placeName>, in which he placed the veteran soldiers belonging to the guards; and obliged several of the richest centurions of the first rank to transfer their residence to that place; where he likewise made a noble harbour at a prodigious expense.<note anchored="yes"><placeName key="perseus,Antium">Antium</placeName>, the birth-place of Nero, an ancient city of the Volscians, stood on a rocky promontory of the coast, now called Capo d' Anzo, about thirty-eight miles from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.
Though always a place of some naval importance, it was indebted to Nero for its noble harbour.
The ruins of the moles yet remain; and there are vestiges of the temples and villas of the town, which was the resort of the wealthy Romans, it being a most delightful winter residence.
The Apollo Belvidere was discovered among these ruins.

<p>To establish still further his character, he declared, "that he designed to govern according to the model of
Augustus;" and omitted no opportunity of showing his generosity, clemency, and complaisance.
The more burthensome taxes he either entirely took off, or diminished.
The rewards appointed for informers by the Papian law, he reduced to a fourth part, and distributed
to the people four hundred sesterces a man.
To the noblest of the senators who were much reduced in their circumstances, he granted annual allowances, in some cases as much as five hundred thousand sesterces; and to the pretorian cohorts a monthly allowance of corn gratis.
When called upon to subscribe the sentence, according to custom, of a criminal condemned to die, "I wish," said he, "I had never learnt to read and write."
He continually saluted people of the several orders by name, without a prompter.
When the senate returned him their thanks for his good government, he replied to them, " It will be time enough to do so when I shall have deserved it." He admitted the common people to see him perform his exercises in the <placeName key="tgn,7006964">Campus Martius</placeName>.
He frequently declaimed in public, and recited verses of his own composing, not only at home, but in the theatre; so much to the joy of all the people,'that public prayers were appointed to be put to the gods upon that account; and the verses which had been publicly read, were, after being written in gold letters, consecrated to Jupiter Capitolinus.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="11">
<p>He presented the people with a great number and variety of spectacles, as the Juvenal and Circensian games, stage-plays, and an exhibition of gladiators.
In the Juvenal, he even admitted senators and aged matrons to perform  parts.
In the Circensian games, he assigned the equestrian order seats apart from the rest of the people, and had races performed by chariots drawn each by four camels.
In the games which he instituted for the eternal duration of the empire, and therefore ordered to be called Maximi,
many of the senatorian and equestrian order, of both sexes performed.
A  distinguished Roman knight descended on the stage by a rope, mounted on an elephant.
A Roman play, likewise, composed by Afranius, was brought upon the stage.
It was entitled, "The Fire; " and in it the performers were allowed to carry off, and to keep to themselves, the furniture of the house, which, as the plot of the play required, was burnt down in the theatre.
Every day during the solemnity, many thousand articles of all descriptions were thrown amongst the people to scramble f6r; such as fowls of different kinds, tickets for corn, clothes, gold.
silver, gems. pearls, pictures, slaves, beasts of burden, wild beasts that had been tamed; at last, ships, lots of houses, and lands, were offered as prizes in a lottery.</p></div2>

<p>These games he beheld from the front of the proscenium.

he ordered that none should be slain, not even the condemned criminals employed in the combats.
He secured four hundred senators, and six hundred Roman knights, amongst whom were some of unbroken fortunes and unblemished reputation, to act as gladiators.
From the same orders, he engaged persons to encounter wild beasts, and for various other services in the theatre.
He presented the public with the representation of a naval fight, upon sea-water, with huge fishes swimming in it; as also with the Pyrrhic dance, performed by certain youths, to each of whom, after the performance was over, he granted the freedom of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.
During this diversion, a bull covered Pasiphae, concealed within a wooden statue of a cow, as many of the spectators believed.
Icarus, upon his first attempt to fly, fell on the stage close

For he very seldom presided in the games, but used to
view them reclining on a couch, at first through some narrow apertures, but afterwards with the Podium<note anchored="yes">The Podium was part of the amphitheatre, near the orchestra, allotted
to the senators, and the ambassadors of foreign nations; and where also

aedication of his bath<note anchored="yes">The baths of Nero stood to the west of the Pantheon. They were, probably, incorporated with those afterwards constructed by Alexander Severus; but no vestige of them remains. That the former were magnificent, we may infer from the verses of Martial:

 and gymnasium, he furnished the
senate and the equestrian order with oil. He appointed
as judges of the trial men of consular rank, chosen by lot,
who sat with the praetors. At this time he went down
into the orchestra among the senators, and received the
crown for the best performance in Latin prose and verse,
for which several persons of the greatest merit contended,
but they unanimously yielded to him. The crown for the
best performer an the harp, being likewise awarded to
him by the judges, he devoutly saluted it, and ordered it
to be carried to the statue of Augustus. In the gymnastic exercises, which he presented in the Septa, while they
were preparing the great sacrifice of an ox, he shaved his beard for the first time,
<note anchored="yes">Among the Romans, the time at which young men first shaved the beard was marked with particular ceremony. It was usually in their twenty-first year, but the period varied. Caligula (c. x.) first shaved at twenty; Augustus at twenty-five.

<p>Amongst the spectacles presented by him, the solemn entrance of Tiridates
<note anchored="yes">A. U. C. 819. See afteiwards, c. xxx.

into the city deserves to be mentioned.
This personage, who was king of <placeName key="tgn,7006651">Armenia</placeName>, he invited to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> by very liberal promises.
But being prevented by very unfavourable weather from showing him to the people upon the day fixed by proclamation, he took the first opportunity which occurred; several cohorts being drawn up under arms, about the temples and in the forum, while he was seated on a curule chair on the rostra, in a triumphal dress, amidst the military standards and ensigns.
Upon Tiridates advancing towards him, on a stage made shelving for the purpose, he permitted him to throw himself at his feet, but quickly raised him with his right hand, and kissed him.
The emperor then, at the king's request, took the turban from his head, and replaced it by a crown, whilst a person of pretorian rank proclaimed in Latin the words in which the prince addressed the emperor as a suppliant.
After this ceremony, the king was conducted to the theatre, where, after renewing his obeisance, Nero seated him on his right hand.
Being then greeted by universal acclamation with the title of Emperor, and sending his laurel crown to the Capitol,
Nero shut the temple of the two-faced Janus, as though there now existed no war throughout the Roman empire.</p></div2>

<p>In the administration of justice, he scarcely ever gave his decision on the pleadings before the next day, and then in writing.
His manner of hearing causes was not to allow any adjournment, but to dispatch them in order as they stood.
When he withdrew to consult his assessors, he did not debate the matter openly with them; but silently and privately reading over their opinions, which they gave separately in writing, he pronounced sen-  tence from the tribunal according to his own view of the case, as if it was the opinion of the majority.
-'For a long time he would not admit the sons of freedmen into the senate; and those who had been admitted by former princes, he excluded from all public offices.
To supernumerary candidates he gave command in the legions, to comfort them under the delay of their hopes.
The consulship he commonly conferred for six months; and one of the two consuls dying a little before the first of January, he substituted no one in his place; disliking what had been formerly done for Caninius Rebilus on such an occa-, sion, who was consul for one day only.
He allowed the triumphal honours only to those who were of quaestorian"' rank, and to some of the equestrian order; and bestowed them without regard to military service.
And instead of the quaestors, whose office it properly was, he frequently ordered that the addresses, which he sent to the senate on certain occasions, should be read by the consuls.</p></div2>

<p>He devised a new style of building in the city, ordering piazzas to be erected before all houses both in the streets and detached, to give facilities from their terraces, in case of fire, for preventing it from  spreading; and these he built at his own expense.
He likewise designed to extend the city walls as far as <placeName key="perseus,Ostia">Ostia</placeName>, and bring the sea from thence by a canal into the old city.
Many severe regulations and new orders were made in his time.
A sumptuary law was enacted.
Public suppers were limited to the Sportulae;<note anchored="yes">The Sportulae were small wicker baskets, in which victuals or money

He likewise inflicted punishments on the Christians, a sort of people who held a new and impious<note anchored="yes"><p><quote lang="la">"Superstitionis novae et maleficae,"</quote> are the words of Suetonius;

<p>Tacitus also describes the excruciating torments inflicted on the Roman Christians by Nero. He says that they were subjected to the derision of the people; dressed in the skins of wild beasts, and exposed
to be torn to pieces by dogs in the public games, that they were crucified, or condemned to be burnt; and at night-fall served in place of

<p>To prevent forgery, a method was then first invented, of having writings bored, run  through three times with a thread, and then sealed.
It was likewise provided that in wills, the two first pages, with only the testator's name upon them, should be presented blank to those who were to sign them as witnesses; and that no one who wrote a will for another, should insert any legacy for himself.
It was likewise ordained that clients should pay their advocates a certain reasonable fee, but \, nothing for the court, which was to be gratuitous, the charges for it being paid out of the public treasury; that causes, the cognizance of which before belonged to the judges of the exchequer, should be transferred to the forum, aid the ordinary tribunals; and that all appeals from the judges should be made to the senate.</p></div2>

<p>Among the other liberal arts which he was taught in his youth,
he was instructed in music; and immediately after his advancement to the empire,
he sent for  Terpnus, a performer upon the harp,<note anchored="yes">Citharoedus: the word signifies a vocalist, who with his singing gave an accompaniment on the harp.</note> who flourished at that time with the highest reputation.
Sitting with him for several days following, as he sang and played after supper, until late at night, he began by degrees to practise upon the instrument himself.
Nor did he omit any of those expedients which artists in music adopt, for the preservation and improvement of their voices.
He would lie upon his back with a sheet of lead upon his breast, clear his stomach and bowels by vomits and clysters, and forbear the eating of fruits, or food prejudicial to the voice.
Encouraged by his proficiency, though his voice was neither loud nor clear, he was desirous of appearing upon the stage, frequently repeating amongst his friends a Greek proverb to this effect: " that no one had any regard for music which they never heard."
Accordingly, he made his first public appearance at <placeName key="tgn,7004474">Naples</placeName>; and although the theatre quivered with the sudden shock of an earthquake, he did not desist, until he had finished the piece of music he had begun.
He played and sung in the same place several times, and for several days together; taking only now and then a little respite to refresh his voice.
Impatient of retirement, it was his custom to go from the bath to the theatre; and after dining in the orchestra, amidst a crowded assembly of the people, he promised them in Greek,<note anchored="yes">It has already been observed that <placeName key="tgn,7004474">Naples</placeName> was a Greek colony, and consequently Greek appears to have continued the vernacular tongue.</note> " that after he had drank a little, he would give them a tune which would make their ears tingle."
Being highly pleased with the songs that were sung in his praise by some Alexandrians belonging to the fleet just arrived at <placeName key="tgn,7004474">Naples</placeName>,<note anchored="yes">See AUGUSTUS, c. xciv.</note> he sent for more of the like singers from <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName>.
At the same time, he chose young men of the equestrian order, and above five thousand robust young fellows from the common people, on purpose to learn various kinds of applause, called bombi, imbrices, and testae,<note anchored="yes">Of the strange names given to the different modes of applauding in the theatre, the first was derived from the humming of bees; the second from the rattling of rain or hail on the roofs; and the third from the tinkling of porcelain vessels when clashed together.

  which the  were to practice in his favour, whenever he performed.
They were divided into several parties, and were remarkable for their fine heads of hair, and were extremely well dressed, with rings upon their left hands.
The leaders of these bands had salaries of forty thousand sesterces allowed them.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="21">
<p>At <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> also, being extremely proud of his singing, he ordered the games called Neronia to be celebrated before the time fixed for their return.
All now becoming importunate to hear "his heavenly voice," he informed them, "that he would gratify those who desired it at the gardens."
But the soldiers then on guard seconding the voice of the people, he promised to comply with their request immediately, and with all his heart.
He instantly ordered his name to be entered upon the list of musicians  who proposed  to  contend, and having thrown his lot into the urn among the rest, took his turn, and entered, attended by the prefects of the pretorian cohorts bearing his harp, and followed by the military tbunes, and several of     his intimate friends.
After he had taken his station, and made the usual prelude, he commanded Cluvius Rufus, a man of consular rank, to proclaim in the theatre, that he intended to sing the story of Niobe.
This he accordingly did, and continued it until nearly ten o'clock, but deferred the disposal of the crown, and the remaining part of the solemnity, until the next year; that he might have more frequent opportunities of performing.
But that being too long, he could not refrain from often appearing as a public performer during the interval.
He made no scruple of exhibiting on the stage, even in the spectacles presented to the people by private persons, and was offered by one of the praetors, no less than a million of sesterces for his services.
He likewise sang tragedies in a mask; the visors of the heroes and gods, as also of the heroines and goddesses, being formed into a resemblance of his own face, and that of any woman he was in love with.
Amongst the rest, he sung "Canace in Labour,"<note anchored="yes">Canace was the daughter of an Etrurian king, whose incestuous intercourse with her brother having been detected, in consequence of the cries of the infant of which she was delivered, she killed herself.

<p>He had from his childhood an extravagant passion for horses; and his constant talk was of the  Circensian races, notwithstanding it was prohibited him.
Lamenting once, among his fellow-pupils, the case of a charioteer of the green party, who was dragged round the circus at the tail of his chariot, and being reprimanded by his tutor for it, he pretended that he was talking of
Hector.
In the beginning of his reign, he used to amuse himself daily with chariots drawn by four horses, made of ivory, upon a table.
He attended at all the lesser exhibitions in the circus, at first privately, but at last openly; so that nobody ever doubted of his presence on any particular day.
Nor did he conceal his desire to have the number of the prizes doubled; so that the races being increased accordingly, the diversion continued until a late hour; the leaders of parties refusing now to bring out their companies for any time less than the whole day.
Upon this, he took a fancy for driving the chariot himself, and that even publicly.
Having made his first experiment in the gardens, amidst crowds of slaves and other rabble, he at length performed in the view of all the people, in the Circus Maximus, whilst one of his freedmen dropped the napkin in the place where the magistrates used to give the signal.
Not satisfied with exhibiting various specimens of his skill in those arts at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, he went over to <placeName key="tgn,7002733">Achaia</placeName>, as has been already said, principally for this purpose.
The several cities, in which solemn trials of musical skill used to be publicly held, had resolved to send him the crowns belonging to those who bore away the prize.
These he accepted so graciously, that he not only gave the deputies who brought them an immediate audience, but even invited them to his table.
Being requested by some of them to sing at supper, and prodigiously applauded, he said, " the Greeks were the only people who had an ear for music, and were the only good judges of him and his attainments."
Without delay he commenced his journey, and on his arrival at Cassiope,

exhibited his first musical performance before the altar of Jupiter Cassius.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="23">
<p>He afterwards appeared at the celebrarion of all public games in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>: for such as fell in different years,
he brought within the compass of one, and some he ordered to be celebrated a second time in the same year.
At <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName>, likewise, contrary to custom, he appointed a public performance of music: and that he might meet with no interruption in this employment, when he was informed by his freedman Helius, that affairs at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> required his presence, he wrote to him in these words: "Though now all your hopes and wishes are for my speedy return, yet you ought rather to advise and hope that I may come back with a character worthy of Nero.
During the time of his musical performance, nobody w s allowed to stir out of the theatre upon any account, hoever necessary; insomuch, that it is said some wome with child were delivered there.
Many of the spectator being quite wearied with hearing and applauding hir, because the town gates were shut, slipped privately over . the walls; or counterfeiting themselves dead, were ca ried out for their funeral.
With what extreme anxiety h engaged in these contests, with what keen desire to be r away the prize, and with how much awe of the judges, s scarcely to be believed.
As if his adversaries had been on a level with himself he would watch them narrowly, defame them  privately, and sometimes, upon meeting them, rail at them in very scurrilous language; or bribe them, if they were better performers than himself, He always addressed the judges with the most profound reverence before he began, telling them, " he had done all things that were necessary, by way of preparation, but that the issue of the approaching trial was in the hand of fortune; and that they, as wise and skilful men, ought to exclude from their judgment things merely accidental."
Upon their encouraging him to have a good heart, he
went off with more assurance, but not entirely free from anxiety; interpreting the silence and modesty of some of them into sourness and ill-nature, and saying that he was suspicious of them.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="24">
<p>In these contests, he adhered so strictly to the rules, that he never durst spit, nor wipe the sweat from his forehead in any other way than with his sleeve.
Having, in the performance of a tragedy, dropped his sceptre, and not quickly recovering it, he was in a great fright, lest he should be set aside for the miscarriage, and could not regain his assurance, until an actor who stood by swore he was certain it had not been observed in the midst of the acclamations and exultations of the people.
When the prize was adjudged to him, he always proclaimed it himself; and even entered the list with the heralds.
That no memory or the least monument might remain of any other victor in the sacred Grecian games, he ordered all their statues and pictures to be pulled down, dragged away with hooks, and thrown into the common sewers.
He drove the chariot with various numbers of horses, and at the Olympic games with no fewer than ten; though, in a poem of his, he had reflected upon Mithridates for that innovation.
Being thrown out of his chariot, he was again replaced, but could not retain his seat, and was obliged to give it up, before he reached the goal, but was crowned notwithstanding.
On his departure he declared the whole province a free counry, and conferred upon the judges in the several games the freedom of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, with large sums of money.
All these favours he proclaimed himself with his own voice, from the middle of the Stadium, during the solemnity of the Isthmian games.</p></div2>

<p>On his return from <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, arriving at <placeName key="tgn,7004474">Naples</placeName>, because he had commenced his career as a public performer in that city, he made his entrance in a chariot
drawn by white horses through a breach in the city-wall, according to the practice of those who were victorious in the sacred Grecian games.
In the same manner he entered <placeName key="perseus,Antium">Antium</placeName>, Alba, and <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.
He made his entry into the city riding in the same chariot in which Augustus had triumphed, in a purple tunic, and a cloak embroidered with golden stars, having on his head the crown won at <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName>, and in his right hand that which was given him at the Parthian games: the rest being carried in a procession before him, with inscriptions denoting the places where they had been won, from whom, and in what plays or musical performances; whilst a train followed him with loud acclamations, crying out, that " they were the emperor's attendants, and the soldiers of his triumph."
Having then caused an arch of the Circus Maximus
<note anchored="yes">The Circus Maximus, frequently mentioned by Suetonius, was so called because it was the largest of all the circuses in and about <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.
Rudely constructed of timber by 'arquinius Drusus, and enlarged and improved with the growing fortunes of the republic, under the emperors it became a most superb building.
Julius Caesar (c. xxxix) extended it, and surrounded it with a canal, ten feet deep and as many broad, to protect the spectators against danger from the chariots during the races.
Claudius (c. xxi.) rebuilt the carceres with marble, and gilded the mete.
This vast centre of attraction to the Roman people, in the games of which religion, politics, and amusement, were combined, was, according to Pliny, three stadia (of 625 feet) long, and one broad, and held
260,000 spectators; so that Juvenal says, "Totam hodie Roman circus capit."-Sat. xi. 195. This poetical exaggeration is applied by Addison to the Colosseum: "That on its public shews unpeopled <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>."-Letter to Lord Halfax. The area of the Circus Maximus occupied the hollow between the <placeName key="tgn,3000935">Palatine</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,4012809">Aventine</placeName> hills, so that it was overlooked by the imperial palace, from which the emperors had so full a view of it, that they could from that height give the signals for commencing the races. Few fragments of it remain; but from the circus of Caracalla, which is better preserved, a tolerably good idea of the ancient circus may be formed.

Every where as he marched along, victims were slain, whilst the streets were strewed with saffron, and birds, chaplets, and sweetmeats scattered abroad.
He suspended the sacred crowns in his chamber, about his beds, and caused statues of himself to be erected in the attire of a harper, and had his likeness stamped upon the coin in the same dress.
After this period, he was so tar from abating any thing of his application to music, that, for the preservation of his voice, he never addressed the soldiers but by messages, or with some person to deliver his speeches for him, when he thought fit to make his appearance amongst them.
Nor did he ever do any thing either in jest or earnest, without a voice-master standing by him to caution him against overstraining his vocal organs, and to apply a handkerchief to his mouth when he did.
He offered his friendship, or avowed open enmity to many, according as they were lavish or sparing in giving him their applause.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="26">
<p>Petulancy, lewdness, luxury, avarice, and cruelty, he practised at first with reserve and in private, as if prompted to them only by the folly
of youth, but, even then, the world was of opinion that they were the faults of his nature, and not of his age.
After it was dark, he used to enter the taverns disguised in a cap or a wig, and ramble about the streets in sport, which was not void of mischief.
He used to beat those he met coming home from supper; and, if they made any resistance, would wound them, and throw them  into the common-sewer.
He broke open and robbed shops; establishing an auction at home for selling his booty.
In the scuffles which took place on those occasions, he often ran the hazard of losing his eyes, and even his life; being beaten almost to death by a senator, for handling his wife indecently.
After this adventure, he never again ventured abroad at that time of night, without some tribunes following him at a little distance.
In the day-time he would be carried to the theatre incognito in a litter, placing himself upon the upper part of the proscenium, where he not only witnessed the quarrels which arose on account of the performances, but also encouraged them.
When they came to blows, and stones and pieces of broken benches began to fly about, he threw them plentifully  amongst the people, and once even broke a praetor's head.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="27">
<p>His vices gaining strength by degrees, he laid aside his jocular amusements, and all disguise;  breaking out into enormous crimes, without the least attempt to conceal them.
His revels were prolonged from mid-day to midnight, while he was frequently refreshed by warm baths, and, in the summer time, by such as were cooled with snow.
He often supped in public, in the Naumachia, with the sluices shut, or in the <placeName key="tgn,7006964">Campus Martius</placeName>, or the Circus Maximus, being waited upon at table by common prostitutes of the town, and Syrian strumpets and gleegirls.

<p>In nothing was he more prodigal than in his buildings.
He completed his palace by continuing it from the <placeName key="tgn,3000935">Palatine</placeName> to the <placeName key="tgn,4012794">Esquiline</placeName> hill, calling the building at first only "The Passage," but after it was burnt down and rebuilt, "The Golden House.<note anchored="yes">The Palace of the Caesars, on the <placeName key="tgn,2118187">Palatine</placeName> hill, was enlarged by
Augustus from the dimensions of a private house (see AUGTUSTUS, cc.
xxix., lvii.). Tiberius made some additions to it, and Caligula extended it to the forum (CALIGULA, c. xxxi.). Tacitus gives a similar
account with that of our author of the extent and splendour of the
works of Claudius. Annma  xv. c. xlli. Reaching from the <placeName key="tgn,2118187">Palatine</placeName>
to the <placeName key="tgn,4012794">Esquiline</placeName> hill, it covered all the intermediate space, where the
Colosseum now stands. We shall find that it was still further enlarged
by Domitian, c. xv. of his life in the present work.</note>
Of its dimensions and
furniture, it may be sufficient to say thus much: the porch was so high that there stood in it a colossal statue of himself a hundred and twenty feet in height; and the space included in it was so ample, that it had triple porticos a mile in length, and a lake like a sea, surrounded with buildings which had the appearance of a city.
Within its area were corn fields, vineyards, pastures, and woods, containing a vast number of animals of various kinds, both wild and tame.
In other parts it was entirely over-laid with gold, and adorned with jewels and mother of pearl.
The supper rooms were vaulted, and compartments of the ceilings, inlaid with ivory, were made to revolve, and scatter flowers; while they contained pipes which shed unguents upon the guests.
The chief banqueting room  was circular, and revolved perpetually, night and day, in imitation of the motion of the celestial bodies.
The baths were supplied with water from the sea and the Albula.
Upon the dedication of this magnificent house after it was finished, all he said in approval of it was, "that he had now a dwelling fit for a man."
He commenced making a pond for the reception of all the hot springs from <placeName key="tgn,7004516">Baiae</placeName>, which he designed to have continued from <placeName key="perseus,Misenum">Misenum</placeName> to the Avernian lake, in a conduit, enclosed in galleries: and also a canal from Avernum to <placeName key="perseus,Ostia">Ostia</placeName>, that ships might pass from one to the other, without a sea voyage.
The length of the proposed canal was one hundred and sixty miles; and it was intended to be of breadth sufficient to permit ships with five banks of oars to pass each other.
For the execution of these designs, he ordered all prisoners, in every part of the empire, to be brought to <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>; and that even those who were convicted of the most heinous crimes, in lieu of any other sentence, should be condemned to work at them.
He was encouraged to all this wild and enormous profu

<div2 type="chapter" n="32">
<p>But being disappointed in his expectations of this resource, and reduced to such difficulties, for want of money, that he was obliged to defer paying his troops, and the rewards due to the veterans: he resolved upon supplying his necessities by means of false accusations and plunder.
In the first place, he ordered, that if any freedman, without sufficient reason, bore the name of the family to which he belonged; the half instead of three fourths, of his estate should be brought into the exchequer at his decease: also that the estates of all such persons as had not in their wills been mindful of their prince, shuld be confiscated; and that the lawyers who ha drawn or dictated such wills, shoud   be liable to a fine.
He ordained likewise, that all words and actions, upon which any informer could ground a prosecution, should be deemed treason.
He demanded an equivalent for the cirowris which the cities of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> had at any time offered him in the solemn games.
Having forbad any one to use the colours of amethyst and Tyrian purple, he privately sent a person to sell a few ounces of them upon the day of the Nundinae, and then shut up all the merchants' shops, on the pretext that his edict had been violated.
It is said, that, as he was playing and singing in the theatre, observing a married lady dressed in the purple which he had prohibited, he pointed her out to his procurators; upon which she was immediately dragged out of her seat, and not only stripped of her clothes, but her property.
He never nominated a person to any office without saying to him, " You know what I want: and let us take care that nobody has anything he can call his own."
At last he rifled many temples of the rich offerings with which they were stored, and melted down all the gold and silver statues, and amongst them those of the penates,<note anchored="yes">The penates were worshipped in the innermost part of the house, which was called penetralia.
There were likewise publid penates, worshipped in the Capitol, and supposed to be the guardians of the city and temples.

They were, however, different.
The penates were reputed to be of divine origin; the lares, of human.
Certain persons were admitted to the worship of the lares, who were not to that of thePenates.

<p>He began the practice of parricide and murder with Claudius himself; for although he was not the contriver of his death, he was privy to the plot.
Nor did he make any secret of it; but used afterwards to commend, in a Greek proverb, mushrooms as food fit for the gods, because Claudius had been poisoned with them.
He traduced his memory, both by word and deed in the grossest manner; one while charging him with folly, another while with cruelty.
For he used to say by way cff jest, that he had ceased morari<note anchored="yes">A play upon the Greek word <foreign lang="greek">mwro/s</foreign>, signifying a fool, while the Latin <foreign lang="la">morari</foreign>, from <foreign lang="la">moror</foreign>, means "to dwell," or "continue."

 amongst men, pronouncing the first syllable long; and treated as null many of his decrees and ordinances, as made by a doting old blockhead.
He enclosed the place where his body was burnt with only a low wall of rough masonry.
He attempted to poison Britannicus, as much out of envy because he had a sweeter voice, as from apprehension of what might ensue from  the respect which the people entertained for his father's memory. He employed for this purpose a woman named Locusta who had been a witness against some persons guilty of like practices. But the poison she gave him, working more slowly than he expected, and only causing a purge, he sent for the woman, and beat her with his own hand, charging her with administering an antidote instead of poison; and upon her alleging in excuse, that she had given Britannicus but a gentle mixture in order to prevent suspicion, "Think you," said he, " that I am afraid of the Julian law; " and obliged her to prepare, in his own chamber and before his eyes, as quick and strong a dose as possible. This he tried upon a kid: but the animal lingering for five hours before it expired, he ordered her to go' to work again; and when she had done, he gave the poison to a slave, who dying immediately, he commanded the poison to be brought into the eating-room and given to Britannicus, while he was at supper with him. The prince had no sooner tasted it than he sunk on the floor, Nero meanwhile pretending to the guests, that it was only a fit of the falling sickness, to which, he said, he was subject. He buried him the following day, in a mean and hurried way, during violent storms of rain. He gave Locusta a pardon, and rewarded her with a great estate in land, placing some disciples with her, to be instructed in her trade.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="34">
<p>His mother being used to make strict inquiry into what he said or did, and to reprimand him with the freedom of a parent, he was so much offended, that he endeavoured to expose her to public resentment, by frequently pretending a resolution to quit the government, and retire to <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName>. Soon afterwards, he deprived her of all honour and power, took from her the guard of Roman and German soldiers, banished her from the palace
and from his society, and persecuted  er in every way he could contrive; employing persons to harass her when at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> with law-suits, and to disturb her in her retirement from town with the most scurrilous and abusive language, following her about by land and sea.
But being terrified with her menaces and violent spirit, he resolved upon her destruction, and thrice attempted it by poison.
Finding, however, that she had previously secured herself by antidotes, he contrived machinery, by which the floor over her bed-chamber might be made to fall upon her while she was asleep in the night.
This design miscarrying likewise, through the little caution used by those who were in the secret, his next stratagem was to construct a ship which could be easily shivered, in hopes of destroying her either by drowning, or by the deck above her cabin crushing her in its fall.
Accordingly, under colour of a pretended reconciliation, he wrote her an extremely affectionate letter, inviting her to <placeName key="perseus,Baiae">Baiae</placeName>, to celebrate with him the festival of Minerva.
He had given private orders to the captains of the galleys which were to attend her, to shatter to pieces the ship in which she had come, by falling foul of it, but in such manner that it might appear to be done accidentally.
He prolonged the entertainment, for the more convenient opportunity of executing the plot in the night; and at her return for Bauli,<note anchored="yes">A small port between the gulf of <placeName key="tgn,7004516">Baia</placeName> and cape <placeName key="perseus,Misenum">Misenum</placeName>.</note> instead of the old ship which had conveyed her to <placeName key="perseus,Baiae">Baiae</placeName>, he offered that which he had contrived for her destruction.
He attended her to the vessel in a very cheerful mood, and, at parting with her, kissed her breasts; after which he sat up very late in the night, waiting with great anxiety to learn the issue of his project.
But receiving information that everything had fallen out contrary to his wish, and that she had saved herself by swimming, not knowing what course to take, upon her freedman, Lucius Agerinus, bringing word, with great joy, that she was safe and well, he privately dropped a poniard by him.
He then commanded the freedman to be seized and put in chains, under pretence of his having been employed by his mother to assassinate him; at the same time ordering her to be put to death, and giving out, that, to avoid punishment for her intended crime, she had laid violent hands upon herself.
Other circumstances, still more horrible, are related on good authority; as that he went to view her corpse, and handling her limbs, pointed out some blemishes, and commended other points; and that, growing thirsty during the survey, he called for drink.
Yet he was never afterwards able to bear the stings of his own conscience for this atrocious act, although encouraged by the congratulatory addresses of the army, the senate, and people.
He frequently affirmed that he was haunted by his mother's ghost, and persecuted with the whips and burning torches of the Furies.
Nay, he attempted by magical rites to bring up her ghost from  below, and soften her rage against him.
When he was in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, he durst not attend the celebration of the Eleusinian mysteries, at the initiation of which, impious and wicked persons are warned by the voice of the herald from approaching the rites.

Besides the murder of his mother, he had been guilty of that of his aunt; for, being obliged to keep her bed in consequence of a complaint in her bowels, he paid her a visit, and she, being then advanced in years, stroking his downy chin, in the tenderness of affection, said to him: " May I but live to see the day when this is shaved for the first time,
<note anchored="yes">See before, c. xii.
</note>
and I shall then die contented."
He
turned, however, to those about him, made a jest of it, saying, that he would have his beard immediately taken off; and ordered the physicians to give her more violent purgatives.
He seized upon her estate before she had expired; suppressing her will, that he might enjoy the whole himself.</p></div2>

In the same way, he destroyed all yho were allied to him either by blood or marriage; amongst whom was young Aulus Plautinus.

though upon his desiring leave to retire, and offering to surrender his estate, he solemnly swore, "that there was no foundation for his suspicions, and that he would perish himself sooner than hurt him."
Having promised Burrhus, the pretorian prefect, a remedy for a swelling in his throat, he sent him poison.
Some old rich freedmen of Claudius, who had formerly not only promoted his adoption, but were also instrumental to his advancement

He felt great anxiety on account of this phenomenon, as being informed by one Babilus, an astrologer, that princes were used to expiate such omens by the sacrifice of illustrious persons, and so avert the danger foreboded to their own persons, by bringing it on the heads of their chief men, he resolved on the destruction of the principal nobility in <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>.
He was the more encouraged to this, because he had some plausible pretence for carrying it into execution, from the discovery of two conspiracies against him; the former and more dangerous of which was that formed by <placeName key="tgn,2040810">Piso</placeName><note anchored="yes">See Tacitus, Annal. xv. 48-55.</note> and discovered at <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>; the other was that of Vinicius,<note anchored="yes">The sixteenth book of Tacitus, which would probably have given

Some ingenuously confessed the charge; others avowed that they thought the design against his life an act of favour for which he was obliged to them, as it was impossible in any other way than by death to relieve a person rendered infamous by crimes of the greatest enormity.
The children of those who had been condemned, were banished the city, and afterwards either poisoned or starved to death.

<p>From this period he butchered, without distinction or quarter, all whom his caprice suggested as objects

The charge against Cassius Longinus, a lawyer who had lost his sight, was, that he kept amongst the busts of his ancestors that of Caius Cassius, who was concerned in the death of Julius Caesar.
The only charge objected against Paetus Thrasea was, that he had a melancholy cast of features, and looked like a school-master.
He allowed but one hour to those whom he obliged to kill themselves; and, to prevent delay, he sent them physicians " to cure them immediately, if they lingered beyond that time ;" for so he called bleeding them to death.
There was at that time an Egyptian of a most voracious appetite, who would digest raw flesh, or any thing else that was given him.
It was credibly reported, that the emperor was extremely desirous of furnishing him with living men to tear and devour.
Being elated with his great success in the perpetration of crimes, he declared.
" that no prince before himself ever knew the extent of his power."
He threw out strong intimations that he would not even spare the senators who survived, but would entirely extirpate that order, and put the provinces and armies into the hands of the Roman knights and his own freedmen.

with the old buildings, and the streets,
he set the city on fire so openly, that many of consular
rank caught his own household servants on their property
with tow, and torches in their hands, but durst not meddle
with them. There being near his Golden House some
granaries, the site of which he exceedingly coveted, they
were battered as if with machines of war, and set on fire,
the walls being built of stone. During six days and seven
nights this terrible devastation continued, the people being
obliged to fly to the tombs and monuments for lodging and
shelter.  Meanwhile, a vast number of stately buildings,
the houses of generals celebrated in former times, and
even then still decorated with the spoils of war, were laid
in ashes; as well as the temples of the gods, which had

used on the stage.
To turn this calamity to his own advantage by plunder and rapine, he promised to remove the bodies of those who had perished in the fire, and clear the rubbish at his own expense: suffering no one to meddle with the remains of their property.

emperor Claudius, and also by <placeName key="tgn,2048656">Seneca</placeName>, was exacted. Tacitus adds another cause, the insupportable tyranny and avarice of the centurions
and soldiers. Prasutagus, king of the Iceni, had named the emperor his
heir. His widow Boadicea and her daughters were shamefully used,
his kinsmen reduced to slavery, and his whole territory ravaged; upon
which the Britons flew to arms. See c. xviii., and the note.

But he neither made any inquiry after the authors, nor when information was laid before the senate against some of them, would he allow a severe sentence to be passed. Isidorus, the Cynic philosopher, said to him aloud, as he was passing along the streets, " You sing the misfortunes of Nauplius well, but behave badly yourself." And Datus, a comic actor, when repeating these words in the piece. "Farewell, father! Farewell mother!" mimicked the gestures of persons drinking and swimming, significantly alluding to the deaths of Claudius and Agrippina: and on uttering the last clause, Orcus vobus ducit pedes; You st md this moment on the brink of Orcus; he plainly intimated his application of it to the precarious position of the senate. Yet Nero only banished the player and philosopher from the city and <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>; either because he was insensible to shame, or from apprehension that if he discovered his vexation, still keener things might be said of him.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="40">
<p>The world, after tolerating such an emperor for little less than fourteen years, at length forsook him; the Gauls, headed by Julius Vindex, who at that time governed the province as pro-praetor, being the first to revolt. Nero had been formerly told by astrologers, that it would be his fortune to be at last deserted by all the world; and this occasioned that celebrated saying of his, "An artist can live in any country;" by which he meant to offer as an excuse for his practice of music, that it was
not only his amusement as a prince, but might be his support when reduced to a private station.  Yet some of the astrologers promised him, in his forlorn state, the rule of the East, and in express words the kingdom of <placeName key="tgn,7001371">Jerusalem</placeName>.  But the greater part of them flattered him with assurances o fhis being restored to his former fortune.  And being most incluined to believe the latter prediction, upon losing <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7006651">Armenia</placeName>, he imagined he had run
through all his misfortunes which the fates had decreed him.
But when, upon consulting the oracle of Apollo at <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>, he was advised to beware of the seventy-third year, as if he were not to die till then, never thinking of Galba's age, he conceived such hopes, not only of living to advanced years, but of constant and singular good fortune, that having lost some things of great value by shipwreck, he scrupled not to say amongst his friends, that "the fishes would bring them back to him."
At Naples he heard of the insurrection in <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, on the anniversary of the day on which he killed his mother, and bore it with so much unconcern, as to excite a suspicion that he was really glad of it, since he had now a fair opportunity of plundering those wealthy provinces by the right of war.
Immediately going to the gymnasium, he witnessed the exercise of the wrestlers, with the greatest delight.
Being interrupted at supper with letters which brought yet worse news, he expressed no greater resentment, than only to threaten the rebels.
For eight days together, he never attempted to answer any letters, nor give any orders, but buried the whole affair in profound silence.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="41">
<p>Being roused at last by numerous proclamations of Vindex, treating him with reproaches and contempt, he in a letter to the senate exhorted them to avenge his wrongs and those of the republic; desiring them to excuse his not appearing in the senate house, because he had got cold.
But nothing so much galled him, as to find himself railed at as a pitiful harper, and, instead of Nero, styled Aenobarbus: which being his family name, since he was upbraided with it, he declared he would resume it, and lay aside the name he had taken by adoption.  Passing by the other accusations as wholly groundless, he earnestly refuted that of his want of skill in an art upon which he had bestowed so much pains, and in which he had arrived
at such perfection; asking frequently those about him, "if they knew any one who was a more accomplished musician?" But being alarmed by messengers after messengers of ill news from <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, he returned in great consternation to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.
On the road, his mind was somewhat relieved, by observing the frivolous omen of a Gaulish soldier defeated and dragged by the hair by a Roman knight, which was sculptured on a monument; so that he leaped for joy, and adored the heavens.
Even then he made no appeal either to the senate or people, but calling together some of the leading men at his own house, he held a hasty consultation upon the present state of affairs, and then, during the remainder of the day, carried them about with him to view some musical instruments, of a new invention, which were played by water;<note anchored="yes">Suetonius calls them <foreign lang="la">organa hydraulica</foreign>, and they seem to have been a musical instrument on the same principle as our present organs, only that water was the inflating power.
Vltruvius (iv. i.) mentions the instrument as the invention of Ctesibus of <placeName key="tgn,7002256">Alexandria</placeName>.
It is also well described by Tertullian, De Aniza, c. xiv.
The pneumatic organ appears to have been a later improvement.
We have before us a contorniate medallion, of Caracalla, from the collection of Mr. W. S. Bohn, upon which one or other of these instruments figures.
On the obverse is the bust of the emperor in armour, laureated, with the inscription M. AURELIUS ANTONINUS PIUS AUG.
BRIT. (his latest title). On the reverse is the organ; an oblong chest with the pipes above, and adrapedfigure on each side.
</note> exhibiting all the parts, and discoursing upon the principles and difficulties of the contrivance; which, he told them, he intended to produce in the theatre, if Vindex would give him leave.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="42">
<p>Soon afterwards, he received intelligence that Galba and the Spaniards had declared against him; upon which, he faiited, and losing his reason, lay a long time speechless, and apparently dead.
As soon as he recovered from this state of stupefaction, he tore his clothes, and beat his head, crying, " It is all over with me !" His nurse endeavoring to comfort him, and telling him that the like things had happened to other princes before him, he replied, " I am beyond all example wretched, for I have lost an empire whilst I am  still living."
He, nevertheless, abated nothing of his usual luxury and inattention to business.
Nay, on the arrival of good news from the provinces, he, at a sumptuous entertainment, sung with an air of merriment some jovial verses upon the leaders of the revolt, which were made public; and accompanied them with suitable gestures.
Being carried privately to the theatre, he sent word to an actor who was applauded by the spectators, " that he had it all his own way, now that he himself did not appear on the stage."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="43">
<p>At the first breaking out of these troubles, it is believed that he had formed many designs of a monstrous nature, although conformable enough to his natural disposition.
These were to send new governors and commanders to the provinces and the armies, and employ assassins to butcher all the former governors and commanders, as men unanimously engaged in a conspiracy against him; to massacre the exiles in every quarter, and all the Gaulish population in <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>; the former lest they should join the insurrection; the latter as privy to the designs of their countrymen, and ready to support them; to abandon <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> itself, to be wasted and plundered by his armies; to poison the whole senate at a feast; to fire the city, and then let loose the wild beasts upon the people, in order to impede their stopping the progress of the flames.
But being deterred from  the execution of these designs, not so much by remorse of conscience, as by despair of being able to effect them; and judging an expedition into <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> necessary, he removed the consuls from their office, before
the time of its expiration was arrived; and in their room assumed the consulship himself without a colleague, as if the fates had decreed that <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> should not be conquered, but by a consul.
Upon assuming the fasces, after an entertainment at the palace, as he walked out of the room leaning on the arms of some of his friends, he declared, that as soon as he arrived in the province, he would make his appearance amongst the troops, unarmed, and do nothing but weep: and that, after he had brought the mutineers to repentance, he would, the next day, in the public rejoicings, sing songs of triumph, which he must now, without loss of time, apply himself to compose.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="44">
<p>In preparing for this expedition, his first care was to provide carriages for his musical instruments and machinery to be used upon the stage; to have the hair of the concubines he carried with him dressed in the fashion of men; and to supply them with battle-axes, and Amazonian bucklers.
He summoned the city-tribes to enlist; but no qualified persons appearing, he ordered all masters to send a certain number of slaves, the best they had, not excepting their stewards and secretaries.
He commanded the several orders of the people to bring in a fixed proportion of their estates, as they stood in the censor's books; all tenants of houses and mansions to pay one year's rent forthwith into the exchequer; and with unheard-of strictness, would receive only new coin of the purest silver and the finest gold; insomuch that most people refused to pay, crying out unanimously that he ought to squeeze the informers, and oblige them to surrender their gains.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="45">
<p>The general odium in which he was held received an increase by the great scarcity of corn, and an occurrence connected with it. For, as it happened just at that time, there arrived from <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName> a ship, which was
said to be freighted with dust for the wrestlers belonging to the emperor.
<note anchored="yes">A fine sand from the <placeName key="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName>, similar to fuzzuolano, which was strewed on the stadium; the wrestlers also rolled in it, when their bodies were slippery with oil or perspiration.

This so much inflamed the public rage, that he was treated with the utmost abuse and scurrility.
Upon the top of one of his statues was placed the figure of a chariot with a Greek inscription, that " Now indeed he had a race to run; let him begone."
A little bag was tied about another, with a ticket containing these words: "What could I do?"-"Truly  thou hast merited  the sack."
<note anchored="yes">The words on the ticket about the emperor's neck, are supposed, by a prosopopea, to be spoken by him. The reply is Agrippina's or the people's. It alludes to the punishment due to him for his parricide. By the Roman law, a person who had murdered a parent or any near relation, after being severely scourged, was sewed up in a sack, with a dog, a cock, a viper, and an ape, and then thrown into the sea, or a deep river.
</note>
Some person likewise wrote on the pillars in the forum, " that he had even woke the cocks<note anchored="yes">Gallos, which signifies both cocks and Gauls.</note>  with his singing."
And many, in the night-time, pretending to find fault with their servants, frequently called for a Vindex.
<note anchored="yes">Vndex, it need hardly be observed, was the name of the propraetor who had set up the standard of rebellion in <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>. The word also signifies an avenger of wrongs, redresser of grievances; hence vindicate, vindictive, etc.

<p>He was also terrified with manifest warnings, both old and new, arising from dreams, auspices, and omens.
He had never been used to dream before the murder of his mother.
After that event, he fancied in his sleep that he was steering a ship, and that the rudder was forced from him: that he was dragged by his wife Octavia into a prodigiously dark place; and was at one time covered over with a vast swarm of winged ants, and at another, surrounded by the national images which were
set up near Pompey's theatre, and hindered from advancing farther; that a Spanish jennet he was fond of, had his hinder parts so changed, as to resemble those of an ape; and having his head only left unaltered, neighed very harmoniously.
The doors of the mausoleum of Augustus flying open of themselves, there issued from it a voice, calling on him by name.
The Lares being adorned with fresh garlands on the calends (the first) of January, fell down during the preparations for sacrificing to them.
While he was taking the omens, Sporus presented him with a ring, the stone of which had carved upon it the Rape of Proserpine.
When a great multitude of the several orders was assembled, to attend at the solemnity of making vows to the gods, it was a long time before the keys of the Capitol could be found.
And when, in a speech of his to the senate against Vindex, these words were read, "that the miscreants should be punished and soon make the end they merited," they all cried out, "You will do it, Augustus."
It was likewise remarked, that the last tragic piece which he sung, was Oedipus in Exile, and that he fell as he was repeating this verse:

<p>Meanwhile, on the arrival of the news, that the rest of the armies had declared against him, he tore to pieces the letters which were delivered to him at dinner, overthrew the table, and dashed with violence against the ground two favourite cups, which he called Homer's, because some of that poet's verses were cut upon them.
Then taking from Locusta a dose of poison, which he put up in a golden box, he went into the Servilian gardens, and thence dispatching a trusty freedman to <placeName key="perseus,Ostia">Ostia</placeName>, with orders to make ready a fleet, he endeavoured to prevail with some tribunes and centurions of the pretorian guards

he was in great perplexity whether he should submit himself to Galba, or apply to the Parthians for protection, or else appear before the people dressed in mourning, and, upon the rostra, in the most piteous manner, beg pardon for his past misdemeanors, and, if he could not prevail, request of them to grant him at least the government of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>.
A speech to this purpose was afterwards found in his writing-case.
But it is conjectured that he durst not venture upon this project, for fear of being torn to pieces, before he could get to the forum.
Deferring, therefore, his resolution until the next day, he awoke about midnight, and finding the guards withdrawn, he leaped out of bed, and sent round for his friends.
But none of them vouchsafing any message in reply, he went with a few attendants to their houses.
The doors being every where shut, and no one giving him any answer, he returned to his bed-chamber; whence those who had the charge of it had all now eloped; some having gone one way, and some another, carrying off with them his bedding and box of poison.
He then endeavoured to find Spicillus, the gladiator, or some one to kill him; but not being able to procure any one, "What!" said he, "have I then neither friend nor foe ?" and immediately ran out, as if he would throw himself into the <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName>.</p></div2>

He was suddenly struck with horror at an earthquake, and by a flash of lightning which darted full in his face, and heard from the neighbouring camp

It was easy for Nero to gain the nearest gate, the Nomentan, from the <placeName key="tgn,4012794">Esquiline</placeName> quarter of the palace, without much observation; and on issuing from it (after midnight, it appears), the fugitives would have the pretorian camp so close on their right hand, that they might well hear the shouts of the soldiers.

the shouts of the soldiers, wishing his destruction, and prosperity to Galba.
He also heard a traveller they met on the road say, "They are in pursuit of Nero:" and another ask, "Is there any news in the  city about Nero?"  Uncovering his face when his horse was started by the scent of a carcase which lay in the road, he was recognized and saluted by an old soldier who had been discharged from  the guards.
When they came to the lane which turned up to the house, they quitted their horses, and with much difficulty he wound among bushes and briars, and along a track through a bed of rushes, over which they spread their cloaks for him to walk on. Having reached a wall at the back of the villa, .Phaon advised him to hide himself awhile in a sand-pit; when he replied, "I will not go under-ground alive."
Staying there some little time, while preparations were made for bringing him privately into the villa, he took some water out of a neighbouring tank in his hand, to drink, saying, "This is Nero's distilled water."<note anchored="yes">Decocta.  Pliny informs us that Nero had the water he drank, boiled, to clear it from impurities, and then cooled with ice.</note>
Then his cloak having been torn by the brambles, he pulled out the thorns which stuck in it. At last, being admitted, creeping upon his hands and knees, through a hole made for him in the wall, he lay down in the first closet he came to, upon a miserable pallet, with an old coverlet thrown over it; and being both hungry and thirsty, though he refused some coarse bread that was brought him, he drank a little warm water.</p></div2>

<p>All who surrounded him now pressing him to save himself from the indignities which were 'ready to befall him, he ordered a pit to be sunk before his eyes, of the size of his body, and the bottom to be covered with pieces of marble put together, if any could be found about the house; and water and wood,<note anchored="yes">Wood, to warm the water for washing the corpse, and for the funeral pile.

 to be got ready for immediate use about his corpse; weeping at every thing that was done, and frequently saying, "What an artist is now about to perish!" Meanwhile, letters being brought in by a servant belonging to Phaon, he snatched them out of his hand, and there read, "That he had been declared an enemy by the senate, and that search was making for him, that he might be punished according to the ancient custom of the Romans."
He then inquired what kind of
punishment that was; and being told, that the practice was to strip the criminal naked, and scourge him to death, while his neck was fastened within a forked stake, he was so terrified that he took up two daggers which he had brought with him, and after feeling the points of both, put them up again, saying, " The fatal hour is not yet come."
One while, he begged of Sporus to begin to wail and lament; another while, he entreated that one of them would, set him an example by killing himself; and then again, he condemned his own want of resolution in these words: " I yet live to my shame and disgrace: this is not becoming for Nero: it is not becoming.
Thou oughtest in such circumstances to have a good heart: Come, then: courage, man!"<note anchored="yes">This burst of passion was uttered in Greek, the rest was spoken in Latin. Both were in familiar use. The mixture, perhaps, betrays the disturbed state of Nero's mind.

he drove a dagger into his throat, being assisted in the act by Epaphroditus, his secretary.
A centurion bursting in just as he was half-dead, and applying his cloak to the wound, pretending that he was come to his assistance, he made no other reply but this, "'Tis too late; and "Is this your loyalty ?" Immediately after pronouncing these words, he expired, with his eyes fixed and starting out of his head, to the terror of all who beheld him.
He had requested of his attendants, as the most essential favour, that they would let no one have his head, but that by all means his body might be burnt entire.
And this, Icelus,

Therefore, having a turn for poetry, he composed verses both with pleasure and ease; nor did he, as some think, publish those of other writers as his own.
Several little pocketbooks and loose sheets have come into my possession, which contain some well-known verses in his own hand, and written in such a manner, that it was very evident, from the blotting and interlining, that they had not been transcribed from a copy, nor dictated by another, but were written by the composer of them.</p></div2>

<head>Remarks on <placeName key="tgn,2538429">Nero</placeName></head>
<p>THOUGH no law had ever passed for regulating the transmission of the imperial power, yet the design of conveying it by lineal descent was implied in the practice of adoption.
By the rule of hereditary succession, Britannicus, the son of Claudius, was the natural heir to the throne; but he was supplanted by the artifices of his stepmother, who had the address to procure it for her own son, Nero.
From the time of Augustus it had been the custom of each of the new sovereigns to commence his reign in such a manner as tended to acquire popularity, however much they all afterwards degenerated from those specious beginnings.
Whether this proceeded entirely from policy, or that nature was not yet vitiated by the intoxication of uncontrolled power, is uncertain; but such were the excesses into which they afterwards plunged, that we can scarcely exempt any of them, except, perhaps, Claudius, from the imputation of great original depravity.
The vicious temper of Tiberius was known to his own mother, Livia; that of Caligula had been obvious to those about him from his infancy; Claudius seems to have had naturally a stronger tendency to weakness than to vice; but the inherent wickedness of Nero was discovered at an early period by his preceptor, <placeName key="tgn,1002882">Seneca</placeName>.
Yet even this emperor commenced his reign in a manner which procured him approbation.
Of all the Roman emperors who had hitherto reigned, he seems to have been most corrupted by profligate favourites, who flattered his follies and vices, to promote their own aggrandisement.
In the number of these was Tigellinus, who met at last with the fate which he had so amply merited.</p>
<p>The several reigns from the death of Augustus present us with uncommon scenes of cruelty and horror; but it was reserved for that of <placeName key="tgn,2538429">Nero</placeName> to exhibit to the world the atrocious act of an emperor deliberately procuring the death of his mother.</p>
<p>Julia Agrippina was the daughter of Germanicus, and married Domitius  Enobarbus, by whom she had Nero.
At the death of Messalina she was a widow; and Claudius, her uncle, entertaining a design of entering again into the married state, she aspired to an incestuous alliance with him, in competition with Lollia Paulina, a woman of beauty and intrigue, who had been married to C. Caesar.
The two rivals were strongly supported by their respective parties; but Agrip
pina, by her superior interest with the emperor's favourites, and the familiarity to which her near relations gave her a claim, obtained the preference; and the portentous nuptials of the emperor and his niece were publicly solemnized in the palace.
Whether she was prompted to this flagrant indecency by personal ambition alone, or by the desire of procuring the succession to the empire for her son, is uncertain; but there remains no doubt of her having removed Claudius by poison, with a view to the object now mentioned.
Besides Claudius, she projected the death of L. Silanus, and she accomplished that of his brother Junius Silanus, by means likewise of poison.
She appears to have been richly endowed with the gifts of nature, but in her disposition intriguing, violent, imperious, and ready to sacrifice every principle of virtue, in the pursuit of supreme power or sensual gratification  As she resembled Livia in the ambition of a mother, and the means by which she indulged it, so she more than equalled her in the ingratitude of an unnatural son and a parricide.
She is said to have left behind her some memoirs, of which Tacitus availed .himself in the composition of his Annals.</p>
<p>In this reign, the conquest of the Britons still continued to be the principal object of military enterprise, and Suetonius Paulinus was invested with the command of the Roman army employed in the reduction of that people.
The island of <placeName key="tgn,7005258">Mona</placeName>, now <placeName key="tgn,7008532">Anglesey</placeName>, being the chief seat of the Druids, he resolved to commence his operations with attacking a place which was the centre of superstition, and to which the vanquished Britons retreated as the last asylum of liberty.
The inhabitants, endeavoured, both by force of arms and the terrors of religion, to obstruct his landing on this sacred island.
The women and Druids assembled promiscuously with the soldiers upon the shore, where running about in wild disorder, with flaming torches in their hands, and pouring forth the most hideous exclamations, they struck the Romans with consternation.
But Suetoniusanimating his troops, they boldly attacked the inhabitants, routed them in the field, and burned the Druids in the same fires which had been prepared by those priests for the catastrophe of thle invaders, destroying at the same time all the consecrated groves and altars in the island.
Suetonius having thus triumphed over the religion of the Britons, flattered himself with the hopes of soon effecting the reduction of the people.
But they, encouraged by his absence, had taken arms, and under the conduct of Boadicea, queen of the Iceni, who had been treated in the most ignominious manner by the Roman tribunes, had already driven the haughty invaders from their several settlements, Suetonius hastened to the protection of <placeName key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>, which was by this time a flourishing Roman colony;
but he found upon his arrival, that any attempt to preserve it would be attended with the utmost danger to the army.
<placeName key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> therefore was reduced to ashes; and the Romans, and all strangers, to the number of seventy thousand, were put to the sword without distinction, the Britons seeming determined to convince the enemy that they would acquiesce in no other terms than a total evacuation of the island.
This massacre, however, was revenged by Suetonius in a decisive engagement, where eighty thousand of the Britons are said to have been killed; after which, Boadicea, to avoid falling into the hands of the insolent conquerors, put a period to her own life by means of poison.
It being judged unadvisable that Suetonius should any longer conduct the war against a people whom he had exasperated by his severity, he was recalled, and Petronius Turpilianus appointed in his room.
The command was afterwards given successively to Trebellius Maximus and Vettius Bolanus; but the plan pursued by these generals was only to retain, by a conciliatory administration, the parts of the island which had already submitted to the Roman arms.</p>
<p>During these transactions in <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName>, Nero himself was exhibiting, in <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> or some of the provinces, such scenes of extravagance as almost exceed credibility.
In one place, entering the lists amongst the competitors in a chariot race; in another contending for victory with the common musicians on the stage; revelling in open day in the company of the most abandoned prostitutes and the vilest of men; in the night, committing depredations on the peaceful inhabitants of the capital; polluting with detestable lust, or drenching with human blood, the streets, the palaces, and the habitations of private families; and, to crown his enormities, setting fire to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, while he sung with delight in beholding the dreadful conflagration.
In vain would history be ransacked for a parallel to this emperor, who united the most shameful vices to the most extravagant vanity, the most abject meanness to the strongest but most preposterous ambition; and the whole of whose life was one continued scene of lewdness, sensuality, rapine, cruelty, and folly.
It is emphatically observed by Tacitus, " that Nero, after the murder of many illustrious personages, manifested a desire of extirpating virtue itself."</p>
<p>Among other excesses of Nero's reign, are to be mentioned the horrible cruelties exercised against the Christians in various parts of the empire, in which inhuman transactions the natural barbarity of the emperor was inflamed by the prejudices and interested policy of the pagan priesthood.</p>
<p>The tyrant scrupled not to charge them with the act of burning
<placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>; and he satiated his fury against them by such outrages as are unexampled in history.
They were covered with the skins of wild beasts, and torn by dogs; were crucified, and set on fire, that they might serve for lights in the night-time.
<placeName key="tgn,2538428">Nero</placeName> offered his garden for this spectacle, and exhibited the games of the Circus by this dreadful illumination.
Sometimes they were covered with wax and other combustible materials, after which a sharp stake was put under their chin, to make them stand upright, and they were burnt alive, to give light to the spectators.</p>
<p>In the person of <placeName key="tgn,2538428">Nero</placeName>, it is observed by Suetonius, the race of the Casars became extinct; a race rendered illustrious by the first and second emperors, but which their successors no less disgraced.
The despotism of Julius Caesar, though haughty and imperious, was liberal and humane: that of Augustus, if we exclude a few instances of vindictive severity towards individuals, was mild and conciliating; but the reigns of <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>, Caligula, and <placeName key="tgn,2538428">Nero</placeName> (for we except Claudius from part of the censure), while discriminated from each other by some peculiar circumstances, exhibited the most flagrant acts of licentiousness and perverted authority.
The most abominable lust, the most extravagant luxury, the most shameful rapaciousness, and the most inhuman cruelty, constitute the general characteristics of those capricious and detestable tyrants.
Repeated experience now clearly refuted the opinion of Augustus, that he had introduced amongst the Romans the best form of government: but while we make this observation, it is proper to remark, that, had he even restored the republic, there is reason to believe that the nation would again have been soon distracted with internal divisions, and a perpetual succession of civil wars.
The manners of the people were become too dissolute to be restrained by the authority of elective and temporary magistrates; and the Romans were hastening to that fatal period when general and great corruption, with its attendant debility, would render them an easy prey to any foreign invaders.

<p>THE race of the Caesars became extinct in <placeName key="tgn,2538428">Nero</placeName>; an event prognosticated by various signs, two of which were particularly significant.
Formerly, when <placeName key="tgn,2039991">Livia</placeName>, after her marriage with Augustus, was making a visit to her villa at <placeName key="tgn,7009104">Veii</placeName>,

Livia gave orders to have the hen taken care of, and the sprig of laurel set; and the hen reared such a numerous brood of chickens, that the villa, to this day, is called the <placeName key="tgn,1098841">Vila</placeName> of the Hens.
The laurel grove<note anchored="yes">The conventional term for what is most commonly known as,

is retained throughout the translation. But the tree or shrub which had this distinction among the ancients, the Laurus nobilts of botany, the <placeName key="tgn,7010768">Daphne</placeName> of the Greeks, is the bay tree, indigenous in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> an( the East, and introduced into <placeName key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> about <date value="1562">1562</date>.

It was also their constant custom to plant others on the same spot, immediately after a triumph; and it was observed that, a little before the death of each prince, the tree which had been set by him died away.
But in the last year of Nero, the
whole plantation of laurels perished to the very roots, and the hens all died.
About the same time, the temple of the Caesars<note anchored="yes">The Temple of the Caesars is generally supposed to be that dedicated by Julius Caesar to Venus Genetrix, from whom the Julian family pretended to derive their descent.  See JULIUS, c. lxi.; AUGUSTUS, xcviii. xcix.

sides of the Atrium were supported by pillars, which, in later times,
were marble. The side opposite to the gate was called Tablinum; and

<p>To give even a short account of the whole family, would be tedious.
I shall, therefore, only slightly notice that branch of it from which he was descended.
Why, or whence, the first of the Sulpicii who had the cognomen of Galba, was so called, is uncertain.
Some are of opinion, that it was because he set fire to a city in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, after he had a long time attacked it to no purpose, with torches dipped in the gum called Galbanum: others said he was so named, because, in a lingering disease, he made use of it as a remedy, wrapped up in wool: others, on account of his being prodigiously corpulent, such a one being called, in the language of the Gauls, Galba; or, on the contrary, because he was of a slender habit of body, like those insects which breed in a sort of oak, and are called Galbae.
Sergius Galba, a person of consular rank,
<note anchored="yes">He was consul with L. Aurelius Cotta, A. U. C. 610.
</note>
and the most eloquent man of his time, gave a lustre to the family.
History relates, that, when he was pro-praetor of <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, he perfidiously put to the sword thirty thousand Lusitanians, and by that means gave occasion to the war of Viriatus.

From him were descended the grandfather and father of the emperor Galba.
The grandfather was more celebrated for his application to study, than for any figure he made in the government.
For he rose no higher than the praetorship, but published a large and not uninteresting history.
His father attained to the consulship:<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 775</note> he was a short man and hump-backed, but a tolerable orator, and an industrious pleader.
He was twice married: the first of his wives was Mummia Achaica, daughter of Catulus, and great-grand-daughter of Lucius Mummius, who sacked <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>;<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 608</note>  and the other, Livia Ocellina, a very rich and beautiful woman, by whom it is supposed he was
courted for the nobleness of his descent.
They say, that she was farther encouraged to persevere in her advances, by an incident which evinced the great ingenuousness of his disposition.
Upon her pressing her suit, he took an opportunity, when they were alone, of stripping off his toga, and showing her the deformity of his person, that he might not be thought to impose upon her.
He had by Achaica two sons, Caius and Sergius.
The elder of these, Caius,<note anchored="yes">Caius Sulpicius Galba, the emperor's brother, had been consul A. U. C. 774.</note>

<p>The emperor Sergius Galba was born in the consulship of M. Valerius Messala, and Cn. Lentulus, upon the ninth of the calends of January [24th December],<note anchored="yes">A. U. C. 751.</note>

</note>
Being adopted by his step-mother,<note anchored="yes">Livia Ocellina, mentioned just before.</note>
 he assumed the name of Livius, with the cognomen of Ocella, and changed his praenomen; for he afterwards used that of Lucius, instead of Sergius, until he arrived at the imperial dignity.
It is well known, that when he came once, amongst other boys of his own age, to pay his respects to Augustus, the latter, pinching his cheek, said to him, "And thou, child, too, wilt taste our imperial dignity."
Tiberius, likewise, being told that he would come to be emperor, but at an advanced age, exclaimed, " Let him live, then, since that does not concern me!"  When his grandfather was offering sacrifice to avert some ill omen from lightning, the entrails of the
victim were snatched out of his hand by an eagle and carried off into an oak-tree loaded with acorns.
Upon this, the soothsayers said, that the family would come to be masters of the empire, but not until many years had elapsed: at which he, smiling, said, "Ay, when a mule comes to bear a foal."  When Galba first declared against <placeName key="tgn,2538429">Nero</placeName>, nothing gave him so much confidence of success, as a mule's happening at that time to have a foal.
And whilst all others were shocked at the occurrence, as a most inauspicious prodigy, he alone regarded it as a most fortunate omen, calling to mind the sacrifice and saying of his grandfather.
When he took upon him the manly habit, he dreamt that the goddess Fortune said to him, " I stand before your door weary; and unless I am speedily admitted, I shall fall into the hands of the first who comes to seize me."  On his awaking, when the door of the house was opened, he found a brazen statue of the goddess, above a cubit long, close to the threshold, which he carried with him to <placeName key="tgn,7008406">Tusculum</placeName>, where he used to pass the summer season; and having consecrated it in an apartment of his house, he ever after worshipped it with a monthly sacrifice, and an anniversary vigil.
Though but a very young man, he kept up an ancient but obsolete custom, and now nowhere observed, except in his own family, which was, to have his freedmen and slaves appear in a body before him twice a day, morning and evening, to offer him their salutations.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="5">
<p>Amongst other liberal studies, he applied himself to the law.
He married Lepida,<note anchored="yes">A. U.

Most of all he courted the empress Livia,
<note anchored="yes">The widow of the emperor Augustus.</note>
by whose favour, while she was living, he made a considerable figure, and narrowly missed being enriched by the will which she left at her death; in which she distinguished him from the rest of the legatees, by a legacy of fifty millions of sesterces.
But because the sum was expressed in figures, and not in words at length, it was reduced by her heir, Tiberius, to five hundred thousand: even this he never received.<note anchored="yes">Suetonius seems to have forgotten, that, according to his own testimony, this legacy, as well as those left by Tiberius, was paid by Caligula.  <quote lang="la">"Legata ex testamnento Tiberii, quanmquam abolto, sed et Iulice Augustae, quod Tiberius supresserat, cum fide, ac sine culumnia repraesentata persolvit."</quote>  CALIG.

Being appointed by Caius Caesar<note anchored="yes">Caius Caesar Caligula.
He gave the command of the legions in <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> to Galba.
</note> to supersede Gaetulicus in his command, the day after his joining the legions, he put a stop to their plaudits in a public
spectacle, by issuing an order, "That they should keep their hands under their cloaks."
Immediately upon which, the following verse became very common in the camp:
<quote lang="la"><l>Disce, miles, militare: Galba est, non Gaetulicus.</l></quote>
<quote lang="en"><l>Learn, soldier, now in arms to use your hands,</l>
<l>'Tis Galba, not Getulicus, commands.</l></quote>
With equal strictness, he would allow of no petitions for
leave of absence from the camp.  He hardened the soldiers, both old and young, by constant exercise; and
having quickly reduced within their own limits the barbarians who had made inroads into <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, upon Caius's
coming into <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, he so far recommended himself
and his army to that emperor's approbation, that, amongst
the innumerable troops drawn from  all the provinces
of the empire, none met with higher commendation,
or greater rewards from him. He likewise distinguished
himself by heading an escort, with a shield in his hand;<note anchored="yes">"Scuto moderatus;" another reading in the parallel passage of
Tacitus is scuto immodice oneratus, burdened with the heavy weight of
a shield.</note>
and running at the side of the emperor's chariot twenty

<div2 type="chapter" n="7">
<p>Upon the news of Caius's death, though many earnestly pressed him to lay hold of that opportunity of seizing the empire, he chose rather to be quiet. On this
account, he. was in favour with Claudius, and being received into the number of friends, stood so high in his good
opinion, that the expedition to <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName><note anchored="yes">It would appear that Galba was to have accompanied Claudius in
his expedition to <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName>; which is related before, CLAUDIUS, c. xvii.</note> was for some time

indisposition.  He governed <placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>, as pro-consul, for
two years; being chosen out of the regular course to
restore order in the province, which was in great disorder from civil dissensions, and the alarms of the barbarians.
His administration was distinguished by great strictness and equity, even in matters of small importance.
A soldier upon some expedition being charged with selling, in a great scarcity of corn, a bushel of wheat, which was all he had left, for a hundred denarii, he forbad him to be relieved by anybody, when he came to be in want himself: and accordingly he died of famine.
When sitting in judgment, a cause being brought before him about some beast of burden, the ownership of which was claimed by two persons; the evidence being slight on both sides, and it being difficult to come at the truth, he ordered the beast to be led to the pond at which he had used to be watered, with his head muffled up, and the covering being there removed, that he should be the property of the person whom he followed of his own accord, after drinking.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="8">
<p>For his achievements, both at this time in <placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>, and formerly in <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, he received the triumphal ornaments, and three sacerdotal appointments, one among The Fifteen, another in the college of Titius, and a third amongst the Augustals; and from that time to the middle of Nero's reign, he lived for the most part in retirement.
He never went abroad so much as to take the air, without a carriage attending him, in which there was a million of sesterces in gold ready at hand; until at last, at the time he was living in the town of <placeName key="perseus,Fundi">Fundi</placeName>, the province of Hispanic Tarraconensis was offered him.
After his arrival in the province, whilst he was sacrificing in a temple, a boy who attended with a censer, became all on a sudden grey-headed.
This incident was regarded by some as a token of an approaching revolution in the government, and that an old man would succeed a young one: that is that he would succeed Nero.

<div2 type="chapter" n="9">
<p>He governed the province during eight years, his administration being of an uncertain and capricious character.
At first he was active, vigorous, and indeed excessively severe, in the punishment of offenders.
For, a money-dealer having committed some fraud in the way of his business, he cut off his hands, and nailed them to his counter.
Another, who had poisoned an orphan, to whom he was guardian, and next heir to the estate, he crucified.
On this delinquent imploring the protection of the law, and crying out that he was a Roman citizen, he affected to afford him some alleviation, and to mitigate his punishment, by a mark of honour, ordered a cross, higher than usual, and painted white, to be erected for him   But by degrees he gave himself up to a life of indolence and inactivity, from the fear of giving Nero any occasion of jealousy, and because, as he used to say, " Nobody was obliged to render an account of their leisure hours."
He was holding a court of justice on the circuit at New Carthage,<note anchored="yes">Now Carthagena.</note>
 when he received intelligence of the insurrection in <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>;<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 821</note>  and while the lieutenant of <placeName key="tgn,7002878">Aquitania</placeName> was soliciting his assistance, letters were brought from Vindex, requesting him " to assert the rights of mankind, and put himself at their head to relieve them from the tyranny of Nero."
Without any long demur, he accepted the invitation, from a mixture of fear and hope.
For he had discovered that private orders had been sent by Nero to his procurators in the province to get him dispatched; and he was encouraged to the enterprise, as well by several
auspices and omens, as by the prophecy of a young woman of good family.
The more so, because the priest of Jupiter at <placeName key="tgn,7003119">Clunia</placeName>,
<note anchored="yes">Now <placeName key="tgn,7002824">Corunna</placeName>.
</note>
admonished by a dream, had discovered in the recesses of the temple some verses similar to those in which she had delivered her prophecy.
These had also been uttered by a girl under divine inspiration, about two hundred years before.
The import of the verses was, "That in time, <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName> should give the world a lord and master."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="10">
<p>Taking his seat on the tribunal, therefore, as if there was no other business than the manumitting of slaves, he had the effigies of a number of persons who had been condemned and put to death by Nero, set up before him, whilst a noble youth stood by, who had been banished, and whom he had purposely sent for from one of the neighbouring Balearic isles; and lamenting the condition of the times, and being thereupon unanimously saluted by the title of Emperor, he publicly declared himself "only the lieutenant of the senate and people of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>."
Then shutting the courts, he levied legions and auxiliary troops among the provincials, besides his veteran army consisting of one legion, two wings of horse, and three cohorts.
Out of the military leaders most distinguished for age and prudence, he formed a kind of senate, with whom to advise upon all matters of importance, as often as occasion should require.
He likewise chose several young men of the equestrian order, who were to be allowed the privilege of wearing the gold ring, and, being called " The Reserve," should mount guard before his bed-chamber, instead of the legionary soldiers.
He likewise issued proclamations throughout the provinces of the empire, exhorting all to rise in arms unanimously, and aid the common cause, by all the ways and means in their power.
About the same time, in fortifying a town, which he had pitched upon as a military post, a ring was found, of antique workmanship, in the stone of which was engraved the goddess Victory with a trophy. Presently after, a ship of <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName> arrived at <placeName key="tgn,7008749">Dertosa</placeName>,<note anchored="yes"><placeName key="tgn,7002313">Tortosa</placeName>, on the <placeName key="tgn,7007649">Ebro</placeName>.</note> loaded with arms, without any person to steer it, or so much as a single sailor or passenger on board. From this incident, nobody entertained the least doubt but the war upon which they were entering was just and honourable, and favoured likewise by the gods; when all on a sudden the whole design was exposed to failure. One of the two wings of horse, repenting of the violation of their oath to Nero, attempted to desert him upon his approach to the camp, and were with some difficulty kept in their duty. And some slaves which had been presented to him by a freedman of Nero's, on purpose to murder him, had like to have killed him as he went through a narrow passage to the bath. Being overheard to encourage one another not to lose the opportunity, they were called to an account concerning it; and recourse being had to the torture, a confession was extorted from them.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="11">
<p>These dangers were followed by the death of Vindex, at which being extremely discouraged, as if fortune had quite forsaken him, he had thoughts of putting an end to his own life; but receiving advice by his messengers from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> that Nero was slain, and that all had taken an oath to him as emperor, he laid aside the title of lieutenant, and took upon him that of Caesar. Putting himself upon his march in his general's cloak, and a dagger hanging from his neck before his breast, he did not resume the use of the toga. until Nymphidius Sabinus, prefect of the pretorian guards at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, with the two lieutenants, Fonteius Capito in <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, and Claudius Macer in
<placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>, who  opposed his advancement, were all put down.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="12">
<p>Rumours of his cruelty and avarice had reached the city before his arrival; such as that he had punished some cities of <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, for not joining him readily, by the imposition of heavy taxes, and some by levelling their walls; and had put to death the governors and procurators with their wives and children: likewise that a golden crown, of fifteen pounds weight, taken out of the temple of <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName>, with which he was presented by the people of Tarracona, he had melted down, and had exacted from them three ounces which were wanting in the weight.
This report of him was confirmed and increased, as soon as he entered the town.
For some seamen who had been taken from the fleet, and enlisted among the troops by Nero, he obliged to return to their former condition; but they refusing to comply, and obstinately clinging to the more honourable service under their eagles and standards, he not only dispersed them by a body of horse, but likewise decimated them.
He also disbanded a cohort of Germans, which had been formed by the preceding emperors, for their body guard, and upon many occasions found very faithful; and sent them back into their own country, without giving them any gratuity, pretending that they were more inclined to favour the advancement of Cneius Dolabella, near whose gardens they encamped, than his own.
The following ridiculous stories were also related of him; but whether with or without foundation, I know not; such as, that when a more sumptuous entertainment than usual was served up, he fetched a deep groan; that when one of the stewards presented him with an account of his expenses, he reached fim a dish of legumes from his table as a reward for his care and diligence; and when Canus, the piper, had played  much to his satisfaction, he presented him, with his own hand, five denarii taken out of his pocket.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="13">
<p>His arrival, therefore, in the town was not very agreeable to the people; and this appeared at the next public spectacle.
For when the actors in a farce began a well-known song, <quote lang="la"><l>Venit, io, Simus
<note anchored="yes">"Simus," literally, flat-nos'd, was a cant word, used for a clown; Galba being jeered for his rusticity, in consequence of his long retirement. See c. viii. Indeed, they called <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName> his farm.

<quote lang="en"><l>Lo! Clodpate from his village comes</l></quote>
all the spectators, with one voice, went on with the rest, repeating and acting the first verse several times over.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="14">
<p>He possessed himself of the imperial power with more favour and authority than he administered it, although he gave many proofs of his being an excellent prince: but these were not so grateful to the people, as his misconduct was offensive.
He was governed by three favourites, who, because they lived in the palace, and were constantly about him, obtained the name of his pedagogues.
These were Titus Vinius who had been his lieutenant in Spain, a man of insatiable avarice; Cornelius Laco, who, from an assessor to the prince, was advanced to be prefect of the pretorian guards, a person of intolerable arrogance, as well as indolence; and his freedman Icelus, dignified a little before with the privilege of wearing the gold ring, and the use of the cognomen Martianus, who became a candidate for the highest honour within the reach of any person of the equestrian order.
<note anchored="yes">The command of the pretoran guards.
</note>
He resigned himself so implicitly into the power of those three favourites, who governed in every thing according to the capricious impulse of their vices and tempers, and his authority was so much abused by them, that the tenor of his
conduct was not very consistent with itself.
At one time, he was more rigorous and frugal, at another, more lavish and negligent, than became a prince who had been chosen by the people, and was so far advanced in years.
He condemned some men of the first rank in the senatorian and equestrian orders, upon a very slight suspicion, and without trial.
He rarely granted the freedom of the city to any one; and the privilege belonging to such as had three children, only one or two; and that with great difficulty, and only for a limited time.
When the judges petitioned to have a sixth decury added to their number, he not only denied them, but abolished the vacation which had been granted to them by Claudius for the winter, and the beginning of the year.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="15">
<p>It was thought that he likewise intended to reduce the offices held by senators and men of the equestrian order, to a term of two years' continuance; and to bestow them only on those who were unwilling to accept them, and had refused them.
All the grants of <placeName key="tgn,2538429">Nero</placeName> he recalled, saving only the tenth part of them.
For this purpose he gave a commission to fifty Roman knights; with orders, that if players 'or wrestlers had sold what had been formerly given them, it should be exacted from the purchasers, since the others, having, no doubt spent the money, were in a condition to pay.
But on the other hand, he suffered his attendants and freedmen to sell or give away the revenue of the state, or immunities from taxes, and to punish the innocent, or pardon criminals, at pleasure.
Nay, when the Roman people were very clamorous for the punishment of Halotus and Tigellinus, two of the most mischievous amongst all the emissaries of Nero, he protected them, and even bestowed on I alotus one of the best procurations in his disposal.
And as to Tigellinus, he even reprimanded the people for their cruelty by a proclamation.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="16">
<p>By this conduct he incurred the hatred of all orders of the people, but especially of the soldiery.
For their commanders having promised them in his name a donative larger than usual, upon their taking the oath to him before his arrival at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>; he refused to make it good, frequently bragging, "that it was his custom to choose his soldiers, not buy them."
Thus the troops became exasperated against him in all quarters.
The pretorian guards he alarmed with apprehensions of danger and unworthy treatment; disbanding many of them occasionally as disaffected to his government, and favourers of Nymphidius.
But most of all, the army in Upper Germany was incensed against him, as being defrauded of the rewards due to them for the service they had rendered in the insurrection of the Gauls under Vindex.
They were, therefore, the first who ventured to break into open mutiny, refusing upon the calends [the 1st] of January, to take any oath of allegiance, except to the senate; and they immediately dispatched deputies to the pretorian troops, to let them know, "they did not like the emperor who had been set up in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>," and to desire that " they would make choice of another, who might meet with the approbation of all the armies."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="17">
<p>Upon receiving intelligence of this, imagining that he was slighted not so much on account of his age, as for having no children, he immediately singled out of a company of young persons of rank, who came to pay their compliments to him, Piso Frugi Licinianus, a youth of noble descent and great talents, for whom he had before contracted such a regard, that he had appointed him in his will the heir both of his estate and name.
Him he now styled his son, and taking him to the camp, adopted him in the presence of the assembled troops, but without making any mention of a donative.
This circumstance afforded the better opportunity to Marcus Salvius Otho of accomplishing his object, six days after the adoption.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="18">
<p>Many remarkable prodigies had happened from the very beginning of his reign, which forewarned him of his approaching fate.
In every town through which he passed in his way from <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName> to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, victims were slain on the right and left of the roads; and one of these, which was a bull, being maddened with the stroke of the axe, broke the rope with which it was tied, and running straight against his chariot, with his fore-feet elevated, bespattered him with blood.
Likewise, as he was alighting, one of the guard, being pushed forward by the crowd, had very nearly wounded him with his lance.
And upon his entering the city and, afterwards, the palace, he was welcomed with an earthquake, and a noise like the bellowing of cattle.
These signs of ill-fortune were followed by some that were still more apparently such.
Out of all his treasures he had selected a necklace of pearls and jewels, to adorn his statue of Fortune at <placeName key="perseus,Tusculum">Tusculum</placeName>, But it suddenly occurring to him that it deserved a more august place, he consecrated it to the Capitoline Venus; and next night, he dreamt that Fortune appeared to him, complaining that she had been defrauded of the present intended her, and threatening to resume what she had given him.
Terrified at this denunciation, at break of day he sent forward some persons to <placeName key="perseus,Tusculum">Tusculum</placeName>, to make preparations for a sacrifice which might avert the displeasure of the goddess; and when he himself arrived at the place, he found nothing but some hot embers upon the altar, and an old man in black standing by, holding a little incense in a glass, and some wine in an earthen pot.
It was remarked, too, that whilst he was sacrificing upon the calends of January, the chaplet fell from his head, and upon his consulting the pullets for omens, they flew away.
Farther, upon the day of his adopting Piso, when he was to harangue the soldiers, the seat which he used upon those occasions, through the neglect of his attendants, was not placed, according to custom, upon his tribunal; and in the senate-house, his curule chair was set with the back forward.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="19">
<p>The day before he was slain, as he was sacrificing in the morning, the augur warned him from time to time to be upon his guard, for that he was in danger from assassins, and that they were near at hand.
Soon after, he was informed, that Otho was in possession of the pretorian camp.
And though most of his friends advised him to repair thither immediately, in hopes that he might quell the tumult by his authority and presence, he resolved to do nothing more than keep close within the palace, and secure himself by guards of the legionary soldiers, who were quartered in different parts about the city.
He put on a linen coat of mail, however; remarking at the same time, that it would avail him little against the points of so many swords.
But being tempted out by false reports, which the conspirators had purposely spread to induce him  to venture abroad-some few of those about him too hastily assuring him that the tumult had ceased, the mutineers were apprehended, and the rest coming to congratulate him, resolved to continue firm in their obedience-he went forward to meet them with so much confidence, that upon a soldier's boasting that he had killed Otho, he asked him, " By what authority?" and proceeded as far as the forum.
There the knights appointed to dispatch him, making their way through the crowd of citizens, upon seeing him at a distance, halted a while; after which, galloping up to him, now abandoned by all his attendants, they put him to death.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="20">
<p>Some authors relate, that upon their first approach
he cried out, "What do you mean, fellow-soldiers ? I am yours, and you are mine," and promised them a donative: but the generality of writers relate, that he offered his throat to them, saying, " Do your work, and strike, since you are resolved upon it." It is remarkable, that not one of those who were at hand, ever made any attempt to assist the emperor; and all who were sent for, disregarded the summons, except a troop of Germans.
They, in consideration of his late kindness in showing them particular attention during a sickness which prevailed in the camp, flew to his aid, but came too late: for, being not well acquainted with the town, they had taken a circuitous route.
He was slain near the Curtian Lake,<note anchored="yes">In the Forum. See AUGUSTUS, c. Ivii.</note> and there left, until a common soldier returning from the receipt of his allowance of corn, throwing down the load which he carried, cut off his head.
There being upon it no hair, by which he might hold it, he hid it in the bosom of his dress; but afterwards thrusting his thumb into the mouth, he carried it in that manner to Otho, who gave it to the drudges and slaves who attended the soldiers; and they, fixing it upon the point of a spear, carried it in derision round the camp, crying out as they went along, "You take your fill of joy in your old age."
They were irritated to this pitch of rude banter, by a report spread a few days before, that, upon some one's commending his person as still florid and vigorous, he replied,
<cit><quote lang="greek"><l part="F">e)/ti moi me/nos e)/mpedo/n e)stin.</l></quote> <bibl n="Hom. Il. 5.254">Il. 5.254</bibl></cit>

A freedman of Patrobius's, who himself had belonged to Nero's family, purchased the head from them at the price of a hundred gold pieces, and threw it into the place where, by Galba's order, his patron had been put to death.
At last, after some  time, his steward Argius buried it, with the rest of his body, in his own gardens near the <placeName key="tgn,6006325">Aurelian Way</placeName>.</p></div2>

<head>Remarks on Galba</head>
<p>GALBA was, for a private man, the most wealthy of any who had ever aspired to the imperial dignity.
He valued himself upon his being descended from the family of the Servi, but still more upon his relation to Quintus Catulus Capitolinus, celebrated for integrity and virtue.
He was likewise distantly related to Livia, the wife of Augustus; by whose interest he was preferred from the station which he held in the palace, to the dignity of consul; and who left him a great legacy at her death.
His paisimonious way of living, and his aversion to all superfluity or excess, were construed into avarice as soon as he became emperor; whence Plutarch observes, that the pride he took in his tem
perance and economy was unseasonable.
While he endeavoured to reform the profusion in the public expenditure, which prevailed in the reign of Nero, he ran into the opposite extreme; and it is objected to him by some historians, that he maintained not the imperial dignity in a degree consistent with decency.
He was not sufficiently attentive either to his own security or the tranquillity of the state, when he refused to pay the soldiers the donative which he had promised them.
This breach of faith seems to be the only act in his life that affects his integrity; and it contributed more to his ruin than even the odium which he incurred by the open venality and rapaciousness of his favnurites, particularly Vinius.

<head><rs key="Otho"><placeName key="tgn,2561794">Otho</placeName></rs></head>
<div2 type="chapter" n="1">
<p>THE ancestors of <placeName key="tgn,2561792">Otho</placeName> were originally of the town of Ferentum, of an ancient and honourable family, and, indeed, one of the most considerable in Etruria.
His grandfather, M. Salvius Otho (whose father was a Roman knight, but his mother of mean extraction, for it is not certain whether she was free-born), by the favour of Livia Augusta, in whose house he had his education, was made a senator, but never rose higher than the praetorship.
His father, Lucius Otho, was by the mother's side nobly descended, allied to several great families, and so dearly beloved by <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>, and so much resembled him in his features, that most people believed <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName> was his father.
He behaved with great strictness and severity, not only in the city offices, but in the pro-consulship of <placeName key="tgn,2086787">Africa</placeName>, and some extraordinary commands in the army.
He had the courage to punish with death some soldiers in <placeName key="tgn,7016683">Illyricum</placeName>, who, in the disturbance attempted by <placeName key="tgn,2068320">Camillus</placeName>, upon changing their minds, had put their generals to the sword, as promoters of that insurrection against Claudius.
He ordered the execution to take place in the front of the camp,
<note anchored="yes">On the esplanade, where the standards, objects of religious reverence, were planted. See note to c. vi. Criminals were usually executed outside the Valium, and in the presence of a centurion.
</note>
and under his own eyes; though he knew they had been advanced to higher ranks in the army by Claudius, on that very account.
By this action he acquired
fame, but lessened his favour at court; which, however, he soon recovered, by discovering to Claudius a design upon his life, carried on by a Roman knight,
<note anchored="yes">Probably one of the two mentioned in CLAUDIUS, c. xiii.
</note>
and which he had learnt from some of his slaves.
For the senate ordered a statue of him to be erected in the palace; an honour which had been conferred but upon very few before him.
And Claudius advanced him to the dignity of a patrician, commending him, at the same time, in the highest terms, and concluding with these words: " A man, than whom I don't so much as wish to have children that should be better."
He had two sons by a very noble woman, Albia Terentia, namely, Lucius Titianus, and a younger called Marcus, who had the same cognomen as himself.
He had also a daughter, whom he contracted to Drusus, Germanicus's son, before she was of marriageable age.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="2">
<p>The emperor Otho was born upon the fourth of the calends of May [28th April], in the consulship of Camillus Aruntius and Domitius Aenobarbus.<note anchored="yes">A. U. C. 784 or 785.</note>
He was from his earliest youth so riotous and wild, that he was often severely scourged by his father.
He was said to run about in the night-time, and seize upon any one he met, who was either drunk or too feeble to mal e resistance, and toss him in a blanket.<note anchored="yes">" Distento sago impositum in sublime jactare."
</note>
After his father's death, to make his court more effectually to a freedwoman about the palace, who was in great favour, he pretended to be in love with her, though she was old and almost decrepit.
Having by her means got into <placeName key="tgn,2538429">Nero</placeName>'s good graces, he soon became one of the principal favourites, by the congeniality of his disposition to that of the emperor.
He had so great a sway at court, that when a man of consular rank was condemned for bribery, having tampered with him for a large sum of money, to procure his pardon; before he had quite effected it, he scrupled not to introduce him into the senate, to return his thanks.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="3">
<p>Having by means of this woman, insinuated himself into all the emperor's secrets, he, upon the day designed for the murder of his mother, entertained them both at a very splendid feast, to prevent suspicion.

</note>
and entrusted her to him, he received, and went through the form of marrying her.
And not satisfied with obtaining her favour, he loved her so extravagantly, that he could not with patience bear Nero for his rival.
It is certainly believed that he not only refused admittance to those who were sent by Nero to fetch her, but that, on one occasion, he shut him out, and kept him standing before the door, mixing prayers and menaces in vain, and demanding back again what was entrusted to his keeping.
His pretended marriage, therefore, being dissolved, he was sent lieutenant into <placeName key="tgn,1000090">Lusitania</placeName>.
This treatment of him was thought sufficiently severe, because harsher proceedings might have brought the whole farce to light, which notwithstanding, at last came out, and was published to the world in the following distich:
<quote lang="la"><l>Cur Otho mentitus sit, quaeritis, exul honore?</l>
<l>Uxoris moechus cseperat esse suae.</l></quote>
<quote lang="en"><l>You ask why Otho's banish'd? Know, the cause</l>

He governed the province in quality of quaestor for ten years, with singular moderation and justice.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="4">
<p>As soon as an opportunity of revenge offered, he readily joined in Galba's enterprises, and at the same time conceived hopes of obtaining the imperial dignity for himself. To this he was much encouraged by the state of the times, but still more by the assurances given him by Seleucus, the astrologer, who, having formerly told him that he would certainly out-live <placeName key="tgn,2538429">Nero</placeName>, came to him at that juncture unexpectedly, promising him again that he should succeed in the empire, and that in a very short time. He, therefore, let slip no opportunity of making his court to every one about him by all manner of civilities. As often as he entertained Galba at supper, he distributed to every man of the cohort which attended the emperor on guard, a gold piece; endeavouring likewise to oblige the rest of the soldiers in one way or another. Being chosen an arbitrator by one who had a dispute with his neighbour about a piece of land, he bought it, and gave it to him; so that now almost every body thought and said, that he was the only man worthy of succeeding to the empire.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="5">
<p>He entertained hopes of being adopted by Galba, and expected it every day. But finding himself disappointed. by Piso's being preferred before him, he turned his thoughts to obtaining his purpose by the use of violence; and to this he was instigated, as well by the greatness of his debts, as by resentment at Galba's conduct towards him. For he did not conceal his conviction, "that he could not stand his ground unless he became emperor, and that it signified nothing whether he fell by the hands of his enemies in the field, or of his creditors in the forum." He had a few days before squeezed out of one of the emperor's slaves a million of sesterces for procuring him a stewardship; and this was the whole fund he had for carrying on so great an enterprise. At first the design was entrusted to only five of the guard, but afterward to ten others, each of the five naming two.
They had every one ten thousand sesterces paid down, and were promised fifty thousand more.
By these, others were drawn in, but not many; from a confident assurance, that when the matter came to the crisis, they should have enough to join them.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="6">
<p>His first intention was, immediately after the departure of Piso, to seize the camp, and fall upon Galba whilst he was at supper in the palace; but he was restrained by a regard for the cohort at that time on duty, lest he should bring too great an odium upon it; because it happened that the same cohort was on guard before, both when Caius was slain, and  Nero  deserted.
For some time afterwards, he was restrained also by scruples about the omens, and by the advice of Seleucus.
Upon the day fixed at last for the enterprise, having given his accomplices notice to wait for him in the forum near the temple of Saturn, at the gilded mile-stone,
<note anchored="yes">The Milliare Aureum was a pillar of stone set up at the top of the forum, from which all the great military roads throughout <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> started, the distances to the principal towns being marked upon it. Dio (lib. liv.) says that it was erected by the emperor Augustus, when he was curator of the roads.
</note>
he went in the morning to pay his respects to Galba; and being received with a kiss as usual, he attended him at sacrifice, and heard the predictions of the augur.
<note anchored="yes">Haruspex, Auspex, or Augur, denoted any person who foretold futurity, or interpreted omens. There was at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> a body of priests, or college, under this title, whose office it was to foretell future events, chiefly from the flight, chirping, or feeding of birds, and from other appearances. They were of the greatest authority in the Roman state; for nothing of importance was done in public affairs, either at home or abroad, in peace or war, without consulting them. The Romans derived the practice of augury chiefly from the Tuscans; and anciently their youth used to be instructed as carefully in this art, as afterwards they were in the Greek literature. For this purpose, by a decree of the
senate, a certain number of the sons of the leading men at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> was sent to the twelve states of Etruria for instruction.</note>
A freedman of his, then bringing him  word that the architects were come, which was the signal agreed upon, he withdrew, as if it were with a design to view a house upon sale, and went out by a back-door of the palace to the place appointed. Some say he pretended to be seized with an ague fit, and ordered those about him  to make that excuse for him, if he was inquired after. Being then quickly concealed in a woman's litter, he made the best of his way for the camp. But the bearers growing tired, he got out, and began to run.  His shoe becoming loose, he stopped  again, but being immediately raised by his attendants upon their shoulders, and unanimously saluted by the fitle of EMPEROR, he came amidst auspicious acclamations and drawn swords into the Principia<note anchored="yes">See before, note, c. i. The Principia was a broad open space,
which separated the lower part of the Roman camp from the upper,
and extended the whole breadth of the camp.  In this place was
erected the tribunal of the general, when he either administered justice
or harangued the army. Here likewise the tribunes held their courts,
and punishments were inflicted. The principal standards of the army,
as it has been already mentioned, were deposited in the Principia; and
in it also stood the altars of the gods, and the images of the emperors,
by which the soldiers swore.</note> in the camp; all who met him joining in the cavalcade, as if they had been privy to the design.  Upon this, sending some soldiers to dispatch Galba and Piso, he said nothing else in his address to the soldiery, to secure their affections, than these few words: ",I shall be content with whatever ye think fit to leave me."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="7">
<p>Towards the close of the day, he entered the senate, and after he had made a short speech to them, pretending that he had been seized in the streets, and compelled by violence to assume the imperial authority, which he designed to exercise in conjunction with them, he retired to the palace
Besides other compliments which he received from those who flocked about him to congratulate and flatter him, he was called Nero by the mob, and manifested no intention of declining that cognomen.
Nay, some authors relate, that he used it in his official acts, and the first letters he sent to the governors of provinces.
He suffered all his images and statues to be replaced, and restored his procurators and freedmen to their former posts.
And the first writing which he signed as emperor, was a promise of fifty millions of sesterces to finish the Golden-house.<note anchored="yes">See NERO, c. xxxi. The sum estimated as requisite for its completion amounted to $10,500,000 of our money.</note>
He is said to have been greatly frightened that night in his sleep, and to have groaned heavily; and being found, by those who came running in to see what the matter was, lying upon the floor before his bed, he endeavoured by every kind of atonement to appease the ghost of Galba, by which he had found himself violently tumbled out of bed.
The next day, as he was taking the omens, a great storm arising, and sustaining a grievous fall, he muttered to himself from time to time:
<quote lang="greek"><l>ti/ gar/ moi kai\ makroi=s au)loi=s;<note anchored="yes">The two last words, literally translated, mean "long trumpets;" such as were used at sacrifices.

<div2 type="chapter" n="8">
<p>About the same time, the armies in <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> took an oath to Vitellius as emperor.
Upon receiving this intelligence, he advised the senate to send thither deputies, to inform them, that a prince had been already chosen; and to persuade them to peace and a good understanding.
By letters and messengers, however, he offered Vitellius to make him  his colleague in the empire, and his son-in-law.
But a war being now unavoidable, and the generals and troops sent forward by Vitellius, advancing, he had a proof of the attachment and fidelity of the pretorian guards, which had nearly proved fatal to the senatorian order.
It had been judged proper that some arms should be given out of the stores, and conveyed to the fleet by the marine troops.
While they were employed in fetching these from the camp in the night, some of the guards suspecting treachery, excited a tumult; and suddenly the whole body, without any of their officers at their head, ran to the palace, demanding that the entire senate should be put to the sword; and having repulsed some of the tribunes who endeavoured to stop them, and slain others, they broke, all bloody as they were, into the banquetting room, inquiring for the emperor; nor would they quit the place until they had seen him.
He now entered upon his expedition against Vitellius with great alacrity, but too much precipitation, and without any regard to the ominous circumstances which attended it.</p>
<p>For the Ancilia<note anchored="yes">The Ancile was a round shield, said to have fallen from heaven in the reign of Numa, and supposed to be the shield of Mars.

He likewise set forward upon the day when the worshippers of the Mother of the gods<note anchored="yes">This ideal personage, who has been mentioned before, AUGUSTUS, c. lxviii., was the goddess of Cybele, the wife of Saturn, called also Rhea, Ops, Vesta, Magna, Mater, c.

The victims offered to the infernal gods were black: they were killed with their faces bent downwards; the knife was applied from below, and the blood was poured into a ditch.</note> he found the signs such as upon all other occasions are regarded as favourable; whereas, in that sacrifice, the contrary intimations are judged the most propitious.
At his first setting forward, he was stopped by inundations of the <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName>; and at twenty miles'
distance from the city, found the road blocked up by the fall of houses.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="9">
<p>Though it was the general opinion that it would be proper to protract the war, as the enemy were distressed by famine and the straitness of their quarters, yet he resolved with equal rashness to force them to an engagement as soon as possible; whether from impatience of prolonged anxiety, and in the hope of bringing matters to an issue before the arrival of Vitellius, or because he could not resist the ardour of the troops, who were all clamorous for battle.
He was not, however, present at any of those which ensued, but stayed behind at <placeName key="tgn,1043633">Brixellum</placeName>.<note anchored="yes">A town between <placeName key="perseus,Mantua">Mantua</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Cremona">Cremona</placeName>. </note>

Immediately upon this he determined to put an end to his life, more, as many think, and not without reason, out of shame, at persisting in a struggle for the empire to the hazard of the public interest and so many lives, than from despair, or distrust of his troops. For he had still in reserve, and in full force, those whom he had kept about him for a second trial of his fortune, and others were coming up from <placeName key="tgn,7015451">Dalmatia</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,4008442">Pannonia</placeName>, and <placeName key="tgn,7016746">Moesia</placeName>; nor were the troops lately defeated so far discouraged as not to be ready, even of themselves, to run all risks in order to wipe off their recent disgrace.</p></div2>

<p>My father, Suetonius Lenis,
<note anchored="yes">Lenis was a name of similar signification with that of Tranquillus, borne by his son, the author of the present work. We find from Tacitus, that there was, among Otho's generals, in this battle, another person of the name of Suetonius, whose cognomen was Paulinus; with whom our author's father must not be confounded. Lenis was only a tribune of the thirteenth legion, the position of which in the battle is mentioned by Tacitus, Hist. xi 24, and was angusticlavias, wearing only the narrow stripe, as not being of the senatorial order; while Paulinus was a general, commanding a legion, at least, and a consular man; having filled that office A. u. c. 818.

was  in this battle, being at that time an angusticlavian tribune in the thirteenth legion. He used frequently to say, that Otho, before his advancement to the empire, had such an abhorrence of civil war, that once, upon hearing an account given at table of the death of Cassius and Brutus, he fell into a trembling, and that he neverwould have interfered with Galba, but that he was confident of succeeding in his enterprise without a war. Moreover, that he was then encouraged to despise life by the example of a common soldier, who bringing news of the defeat of the army, and finding that he met with no credit, but was railed at for a liar and a coward, as if he had run away from the field of battle, fell upon his sword at the emperor's feet; upon the sight of which, my father said that Otho cried out, " that he would expose to no farther danger such brave men, who had deserved so well at his hands." Advising therefore his brother, his brother's son, and the rest of his friends, to provide for their security in the best manner they could, after he had embraced and kissed them, he sent them away; and them  withdrawing into a private room by himself, he wrote a letter of consolation to his sister, containing two sheets. He likewise sent another to Messalina, Nero's widow, whom he had intended to marry, committing her the care of his relics and memory. He then burnt all the letters which he had by him, to prevent the danger and mischief that might otherwise befall the writers from the conqueror. What ready money he had, he distributed among his domestics.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="11">
<p>And now being prepared, and just upon the point of dispatching himself, he was induced to suspend the
execution of his purpose by a great tumult which had broken out in the camp. Finding that some of the soldiers who were making off had been seized and detained as deserters, " Let us add," said he, " this night to our life."  These were his very words. He then gave orders that no violence should be offered to any one; and keeping his chamber-door open until late at night, he allowed all who pleased the liberty to come and see him. At last, after quenching his thirst with a draught of cold water, he took up two poniards, and having examined the points of both, put one of them under his pillow, and shutting his chamber-door, slept very soundly, until, awaking about break of day. he stabbed himself under the left pap. Some persons bursting into the room upon his first groan, he at one time covered, and at another exposed his wound to the view of the bystanders, and thus life soon ebbed away. His funeral was hastily performed, according to his own order, in the thirty-eighth year of his age, and ninety-fifth day of his reign.<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 823</note></p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="12">
<p>The person and appearance of Otho no way corresponded to the great spirit he displayed on this occasion; for he is said to have been of low stature, splayfooted, and bandy-legged. He was, however, effeminately nice in the care of his person: the hair on his body he plucked out by the roots; and because he was somewhat bald, he wore a kind of peruke, so exactly fitted to his head, that nobody could have known it for such. He used to shave every day, and rub his face with soaked bread; the use of which he began when the down first appeared upon his chin, to prevent his having any beard. It is said likewise that he celebrated publicly the sacred rites of Isis,
<note anchored="yes"><placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName>, to prevent the discovery of his amour with Io, the daughter of the river Inachus, transformed her into a heifer, in which metamorphosis she was placed by Juno under the watchful inspection of <placeName key="tgn,2086061">Argus</placeName>; but flying into <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, and her keeper being killed by Mercury, she recovered her human shape, and was married to Osiris.
Her husband afterwards became a god of the Egyptians, and she a goddess, under the name of Isis.
She was represented with a mural crown on her head, a cornucopia in one hand, and a sistrum (a musical instrument) in the other.
</note> clad in a linen garment, such as is used by the worshippers of that goddess.
These circumstances, I imagine, caused the world to wonder the more that his death was so little in character with his life.
Many of the soldiers who were present, kissing and bedewing with their tears his hands and feet as he lay dead, and celebrating him as "a most gallant man, and an incomparable emperor," immediately put an end to their own lives upon the spot, not far from his funeral pile.
Many of those likewise who were at a distance, upon hearing the news of his death, in the anguish of their hearts, began fighting amongst themselves, until they dispatched one another.
To conclude: the generality of mankind, though they hated him whilst living, yet highly extolled him after his death; insomuch that it was the common talk and opinion, "that Galba had been driven to destruction by his rival, not so much for the sake of reigning himself, as of restoring <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> to its ancient liberty."</p></div2>

<head>Remarks on Otho</head>
<p>IT is remarkable, in the fortune of this emperor, that he owed both his elevation and catastrophe to the inextricable embarrassments in which he was involved; first, in respect of pecuniary circumstances, and next, of political.
He was not, so far as we can learn, a follower of any of the sects of philosophers which justified, and even recommended suicide, in particular cases: yet he perpetrated that act with extraordinary coolness and resolution; and, what is no less remarkable, from the motive, as he avowed, of public expediency only.
It was observed of him, for many years after his death, that "none ever died like Otho."

I am inclined to think, that these several representations have been made by the flatterers and detractors of Vitellius, after he became emperor, unless the fortunes of the family varied before.

and some others relate that he was likewise a cobbler, whose son having made a considerable fortune by agencies and dealings in confiscated property, begot, by a common strumpet, daughter of one Antiochus, a baker, a child, who afterwards became a Roman knight.

<div2 type="chapter" n="2">
<p>It is certain, however, that Publius Vitellius, of Nuceria, whether of an ancient family, or of low extraction, was a Roman knight, and a procurator to Augustus.
He left behind him four sons, all men of very high station, who had the same cognomen, but the different praenomina of Aulus, Quintus.
Publius, and <placeName key="tgn,2023439">Lucius</placeName>. Aulus died in the enjoyment of the consulship,<note anchored="yes">A. U. C. 785.</note> which office he bore jointly with Domitius, the father of Nero Caesar.
He was elegant to excess in his manner of living, and notorious for the vast expense of his entertainments.
Quintus was deprived of his rank of senator, when, upon a motion
made by Tiberius, a resolution passed to purge the senate of those who were in any respect not duly qualified for that honour.
Publius, an intimate friend and companion of Germanicus, prosecuted his enemy and murderer, Cneius Piso, and procured sentence against him.
After he had been made praetor, being arrested among the accomplices of Sejanus, and delivered into the hands of his brother to be confined in his house, he opened a vein with a penknife, intending to bleed himself to death.
He suffered, however, the wound to be bound up and cured, not so much from repenting the resolution he had formed, as to comply with the importunity of his relations.
He died afterwards a natural death during his confinement.
Lucius, after his consulship,<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 787</note>

and by his politic management not only brought Artabanus, king of the Parthians, to give him an interview, but to worship the standards of the Roman legions.
He afterwards filled two ordinary consulships,<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 796, 800</note> and also the censorship<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 801</note> jointly with the emperor Claudius.
Whilst that prince was absent upon his expedition into <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName>,<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 797.  See Claudius, c. xvii.</note> the care of the empire was committed to him, being a man of great integrity and industry.
But he lessened his character not a little, by his passionate fondness for an abandoned freedwoman, with whose spittle, mixed with honey, he used to anoint his throat and jaws, by way of remedy for some complaint, not privately nor seldom, but daily and publicly.
Being extravagantly prone to flattery, it was he who gave rise to the worship of Caius Caesar as a god, when, upon his return from <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>, he would not
presume to accost him otherwise than with his head covered, turning himself round, and then prostrating himself upon the earth.
And to leave no artifice untried to secure the favour of Claudius, who was entirely governed by his wives and freedmen, he requested as the greatest favour from Messalina, that she would be pleased to let him take off her shoes; which, when he had done, he took her right shoe, and wore it constantly betwixt his toga and his tunic, and from time to time covered it with kisses.
He likewise worshipped golden images of Narcissus and Pallas among his household gods.
It was he, too, who, when Claudius exhibited the secular games, in his compliments to him upon that occasion, used this expression, "May you often do the same."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="3">
<p>He died of palsy, the day after his seizure with it, leaving behind him two sons, whom he had by a most excellent and respectable wife, Sextilia.
He had lived to see them  both consuls, the same year and during the whole year also; the younger succeeding the elder for the last six months.<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 801</note>
The senate honoured him after his decease with a funeral at the public expense and with a statue in the Rostra, which had this inscription upon the base: "One who was stedfast in his loyalty to his prince."
The emperor Aulus Vitellius, the son of this Lucius, was born upon the eighth of the calends of October [24th September], or, as some say, upon the seventh of the ides of September [7th September], in the consulship of Drusus Caesar and Norbanus Flaccus.<note anchored="yes">A. U. C. 767; being the year after the death of the emperor Augustus; from whence it appears that Vitellius was seventeen years older than Otho.</note>   His parents were so terrified with the predictions of astrologers upon
the calculation of his nativity, that his father used his utmost endeavours to prevent his being sent governor into any of the provinces, whilst he was alive.
His mother, upon his being sent to the legions<note anchored="yes">He was sent to <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> by Galba.</note> and also upon his being proclaimed emperor, immediately lamented him as utterly ruined.
He spent his youth with Tiberius at <placeName key="tgn,7006855">Capri</placeName>, in all manner of debauchery, which course of life he never altered.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="4">
<p>In the subsequent part of his life, being still more scandalously vicious, he rose to great favour at court; being upon a very intimate footing with Caius [Caligula], because of his fondness for chariot-driving, and with Claudius for his love of gaming.
But he was in a still higher degree acceptable to Nero, as well on the same accounts, as for other services which he rendered him.
When Nero presided in the games instituted by himself, though he was extremely desirous to perform amongst the harpers, yet his modesty would not permit him, notwithstanding the people entreated much for it.  Upon his quitting the theatre, Vitellius fetched him back again, pretending to represent the determined wishes of the people, and so afforded him the opportunity of yielding to their entreaties.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="5">
<p>By the favour of these three princes, he was not only advanced to the great offices of the state, but to the highest dignities of the sacred order; after which he held the proconsulship of <placeName key="tgn,2086787">Africa</placeName>, and had the superintendence of the public works, in which appointment his conduct, and, consequently, his reputation, were very different.
For he governed the province with singular integrity during two years, in the latter of which he acted as deputy to his brother, who succeeded him.
But in his office in the city, he was said to pillage the temples of their gifts and ornaments, and to have exchanged brass and tin for gold and silver.

<p>He took to wife <placeName key="tgn,2004876">Petronia</placeName>, the daughter of a man of consular rank, and had by her a son named Petronius, who was blind of an eye.
The mother being willing to appoint this youth her heir, upon condition that he should be released from his father's authority, the latter discharged him accordingly; but shortly after, as was believed, murdered him, charging him with a design upon his life, and pretending that he had, from consciousness of his guilt, drank the poison he had prepared for his father.
Soon afterwards, he married Galeria Fundana, the daughter of a man of pretorian rank, and had by her both sons and daughters.
Among the former was one who had such a stammering in his speech, that he was little better than if he had been dumb.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="7">
<p>He was sent by Galba into Lower Germany,<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 821</note> contrary to his expectation.
It is supposed that he was assisted in procuring this appointment by the interest of Titus Junius, a man of great influence at that time; whose friendship he had long before gained by favouring the same set of charioteers with him in the Circensian games.
But Galba openly declared that none were less to be feared than those who only cared for their bellies, and that even his enormous appetite must be satisfied with the plenty of that province; so that it is evident he was selected for that government more out of contempt than kindness.
It is certain, that when he was to set out, he
had not money for the expenses of his journey; he being at that time so much straitened in his circumstances, that he was obliged to put his wife and children, whom he left at <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, into a poor lodging which he hired for them, in order that he might let his own house for the remainder of the year; and he pawned a pearl taken from his mother's ear-ring, to defray his expenses on the road.
A crowd of creditors who were waiting to stop him, and amongst them the people of Sineussa and <placeName key="tgn,7006711">Formia</placeName>, whose taxes he had converted to his own use, he eluded, by alarming them with the apprehension of false accusations.
He had, however, sued a certain freedman, who was clamorous in demanding a debt of him, under pretence that he had kicked him; which action he would not withdraw, until he had wrung from the freedman fifty thousand sesterces.
Upon his arrival in the province, the army, which was disaffected to Galba, and ripe for insurrection, received him with open arms, as if he had been sent them from heaven.
It was no small recommendation to their favour, that he was the son of a man who had been thrice consul, was in the prime of life, and of an easy, prodigal disposition.
This opinion, which had been long entertained of him, Vitellius confirmed by some late practices; having kissed all the common soldiers whom he met with upon the road, and been excessively complaisant in the inns and stables to the muleteers and travellers; asking them in a morning, if they had got their breakfasts, and letting them see, by belching, that he had eaten his.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="8">
<p>After he had reached the camp, he denied no man any thing he asked for, and pardoned all who lay under sentence for disgraceful conduct or disorderly habits.
Before a month, therefore, had passed, without regard to the day or season, he was hurried by the soldiers out of his bed-chamber, although it was evening, and he in an
undress, and unanimously saluted by the title of EMPEROR.<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 822</note> He was then carried round the most considerable towns in the neighbourhood, with the sword of the Divine Julius in his hand; which had been taken by some person out of the temple of <placeName key="tgn,2090583">Mars</placeName>, and presented to him when he was first saluted.
Nor did he return to the pretorium, until his dining-room was in flames from the chimney's taking fire.
Upon this accident, all being in consternation, and considering it as an unlucky omen, he cried out, " Courage, boys! it shines brightly upon us." And this was all he said to the soldiers.
The army of the Upper Province, likewise, which had before declared against Galba for the senate, joining in the proceedings, he very eagerly accepted the cognomen of Germanicus, offered him by the unanimous consent of both armies, but deferred assuming that of Augustus, and refused for ever that of Caesar.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="9">
<p>Intelligence of Galba's death arriving soon after, when he had settled his affairs in <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> he divided his troops into two bodies, intending to send one of them before him against Otho, and to follow with the other himself.
The army he sent forward had a lucky omen; for, suddenly, an eagle came flying up to them on the right, and having hovered round the standards, flew gently before them on their road.
But, on the other hand, when he began his own march, all the equestrian statues, which were erected for him in several places, fell suddenly down with their legs broken; and the laurel crown, which he had put on as emblematical of auspicious fortune, fell off his head into a river.
Soon afterwards, at <placeName key="tgn,7003321">Vienne</placeName>,<note anchored="yes"><placeName key="tgn,7003321">Vienne</placeName> was a very ancient city of the province of <placeName key="tgn,7008368">Narbonne</placeName>, famous in ecclesiastical history as the early seat of a bishopric in <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>.</note> as he was upon the tribunal administering justice, a cock perched
upon his shoulder, and afterwards upon his head.
The issue corresponded to these omens; for he was not able to keep the empire which had been secured for him by his lieutenants.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="10">
<p>He heard of the victory at Bedriacum,<note anchored="yes">See Otho, c. ix</note>  and the death of Otho, whilst he was yet in <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, and without the least hesitation, by a single proclamation, disbanded all the pretorian cohorts, as having, by their repeated treasons, set a dangerous example to the rest of the army; commanding them to deliver up their arms to his tribunes.
A hundred and twenty of them, under whose hands he had found petitions presented to Otho, for rewards of their service in the murder of Galba, he besides ordered to be sought out and punished.
So far his conduct deserved approbation, and was such as to afford hope of his becoming an excellent prince, had he not managed his other affairs in a way more corresponding with his own disposition, and his former manner of life, than to the imperial dignity.
For, having begun his march, he rode through every city in his route in a triumphal procession; and sailed down the rivers in ships, fitted out with the greatest elegance, and decorated wigh various kinds of crowns, amidst the most extravagant entertainments.
Such was the want of discipline, and the licentiousness both in his family and army, that, not satisfied with the provision every where made for them at the public expense, they committed every kind of robbery and insult upon the inhabitants, setting slaves at liberty as they pleased; and if any dared to make resistance, they dealt blows and abuse, frequently wounds, and  sometimes slaughter amongst them.
When he reached the plains on which the battles were fought,<note anchored="yes">See OTHO, c. xi.</note>
some of those around him being offended at the smell of the carcases which lay rotting upon the ground, he had the audacity to encourage them by a most detestable remark, "That a dead enemy smelt not amiss, especially if he were a fellow-citizen."
To qualify, however, the offensiveness of the stench, he quaffed in public a goblet of wine, and with equal vanity and -insolence distributed a large quantity of it among his troops.
On his observing a stone with an inscription upon it to the memory of Otho, he said, "It was a mausoleum good enough for such a prince."
He also sent the poniard, with which Otho killed himself, to the colony of Agrippina,<note anchored="yes">Agrippina, the wife of Nero and mother of Germanicus, founded a colony on the <placeName key="tgn,7012611">Rhine</placeName> at the place of her birth.

Upon the Appenine hills he celebrated a Bacchanalian feast.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="11">
<p>At last he entered the City with trumpets sounding, in his general's cloak, and girded with his sword, amidst a display of standards and banners; his attendants being all in the military habit, and the arms of the soldiers unsheathed.
Acting more and more in open violation of all laws, both divine and human, he assumed the office of Pontifex Maximus, upon the day of the defeat at the Allia;
<note anchored="yes">A <foreign lang="la">dies non fastus</foreign>, an unlucky day in the Roman calendar, being the anniversary of the great defeat by the Gauls on the river Allia, which joins the <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName> about five miles from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. This disaster happened on the 16th of the calends of August (7th July).

ordered the magistrates to be elected for ten years of office; and made himself consul for life.
To put it out of all doubt what model he intended to follow in his government of the empire, he nmade his offerings to the shade of Nero in the midst of the <placeName key="tgn,7006964">Campus Martius</placeName>, and with a full assembly of the public priests attending him.
And at a solemn entertainment, he desired a harper who pleased the company much, to sing something in praise
of Domitius; and upon his beginning some songs of Nero's, he started up in presence of.the whole assembly, and could not refrain from applauding him, by clapping his hands.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="12">
<p>After such a commencement of his career, he conducted his affairs, during the greater part of his reign, entirely by the advice and direction of the vilest amongst the players and charioteers, and especially his freedman Asiaticus.
This fellow had, when young, been engaged with him in a course of riotous living, but, being at last quite tired of the occupation, ran away.
His master, some time after, caught him at <placeName key="perseus,Puteoli">Puteoli</placeName>, selling a liquor called Posca,<note anchored="yes">Posca was sour wine or vinegar mixed with water, which was used
by the Roman soldiery as their common drink. It has been found

Growing weary, however, of his rough and stubborn temper, he sold him to a strolling-fencing-master; after which, when the fellow was to have been brought up to play his part at the conclusion of an entertainment of gladiators, he suddenly carried him off, and at length, upon his being advanced to the government of a province, gave him his freedom.
The first day of his reign, he presented him with the gold rings at supper, though in the morning, when all about him requested that favour in his behalf, he expressed the utmost abhorrence of putting so great a strain upon the equestrian order.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="13">
<p>He was chiefly addicted to the vices of luxury and cruelty.
He always made three meals a day, sometimes four; breakfast, dinner, and supper, and a drunken revel after all.
This load of victuals he could well enough bear, from a custom to which he had enured himself, of frequently vomiting.
For these several meals he
would make different appointments at the houses of his friends on the same day.
None ever entertained him at less expense than four hundred thousand sesterces.<note anchored="yes">Upwards of &pound; 4000 sterling.  See note, p. 510.</note> The most famous was a set entertainment given him by his brother, at which, it is said, there were served up no less than two thousand choice fishes, and seven thousand birds.
Yet even this supper he himself outdid, at a feast which he gave upon the first use of a dish which had been made for him, and which, for its extraordinary size, he called " The Shield of Minerva."
In this dish there were tossed up together the livers of char-fish, the brains of pheasants and peacocks, with the tongues of flamingos, and the entrails of lampreys, which had been brought in ships of war as far as from  the Carpathian Sea, and the Spanish Straits.
He was not only a man of an insatiable appetite, but would gratify it likewise at unseasonable times, and with any garbage that came in his way; so that, at a sacrifice, he would snatch from the fire flesh and cakes, and eat them upon the spot.
When he travelled, he did the same at the inns upon the road, whether the meat was fresh dressed and hot, or what had been left the day before, and was half-eaten.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="14">
<p>He delighted in the infliction of punishments, and even those which were capital, without any distinction of persons or occasions.
Several noblemen, his schoolfellows and companions, invited by him to court, he treated with such flattering caresses, as seemed to indicate an affection short only of admitting them to share the honours of the imperial dignity; yet he put them all to death by some base means or other.
To one he gave poison with his own hand, in a cup of cold water which he called for in a fever.
He scarcely spared one of all the usurers, notaries, and publicans, who had ever demanded a debt of
him at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, or any toll or custom upon the road.
One of these, while in the very act of saluting him, he ordered for execution, but immediately sent for him back; upon which all about him applauding his clemency, he commanded him to be slain in his own presence, saying, "I have a mind to feed my eyes."
Two sons who interceded for their father, he ordered to be executed with him.
A Roman knight, upon his being dragged away for execution, and crying out to him, " You are my heir," he desired to produce his will: and finding that he had made his freedman joint heir with him, he commanded that both he and the freedman should have their throats cut.
He put to death some of the common people for cursing aloud the blue party in the Circensian games; supposing it to be done in contempt of himself, and the expectation of a revolution in the government.
There were no persons he was more severe against than jugglers and astrologers; and as soon as any one of them was informed against, he put him to death without the formality of a trial.
He was enraged against them, because, after his proclamation by which he commanded all astrologers to quit <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> also, before the calends [the first] of October, a bill was immediately posted about the city, with the following words :-" TAKE NOTICE:<note anchored="yes">In imitation of the form of the public edicts, which began with the words, BONUM FACTUM.</note>
The Chaldaeans also decree that Vitellius Germanicus shall be no more, by the day of the said calends."
He was even suspected of being accessary to his mother's death, by forbidding sustenance to be given her when she was unwell; a German witch,<note anchored="yes">Catta muliere: The Catta were a German tribe who inhabited the present countries of <placeName key="tgn,7003678">Hesse</placeName> or <placeName key="tgn,7005172">Baden</placeName>.

whom he held to be oracular, having told him, "That he would long reign in security if he survived his mother."
But others say, that being quite weary of the state of affairs, and apprehensive of the future, she obtained without difficulty a dose of poison from her son.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="15">
<p>In the eighth month of his reign, the troops both in <placeName key="tgn,7016746">Moesia</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,4008442">Pannonia</placeName> revolted from him; as did likewise, of the armies beyond sea, those in <placeName key="tgn,7001407">Judaea</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>, some of which swore allegiance to Vespasian as emperor in his own presence, and others in his absence.
In order, therefore, to secure the favour and affection of the people, Vitellius lavished on all around whatever he had it in his power to bestow, both publicly and privately, in the most extravagant manner.
He also levied soldiers in the city, and promised all who enlisted as volunteers, not only their discharge after the victory was gained, but all the rewards due to veterans who had served their full time in the wars.
The enemy now pressing forward both by sea and land, on one hand he opposed against them his brother with a fleet, the new levies, and a body of gladiators, and in another quarter the troops and generals who were engaged at Bedriacum.
But being beaten or betrayed in every direction, he agreed with Flavius Sabinus, Vespasian's brother, to abdicate, on condition of having his life spared, and a hundred millions of sesterces granted him; and he immediately, upon the palace-steps, publicly declared to a large body of soldiers there assembled, " that he resigned the government, which he had accepted reluctantly;" but they all remonstrating against it, he deferred the conclusion of the treaty.
Next day, early in the morning, he came down to the forum in a very mean habit, and with many tears repeated the declaration from a writing which he held in his hand; but the soldiers and people again interposing, and encouraging him not to give way, but to
rely on their zealous support, he recovered his courage, and forced Sabinus, with the rest of the Flavian party, who now thought themselves secure, to retreat into the Capitol, where he destroyed them all by setting fire to the temple of <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName>, whilst he beheld the contest and the fire from Tiberius's house,<note anchored="yes">Suetonius does not supply any account of the part added by Tiberius to the palace of the Casars on the <placeName key="tgn,3000935">Palatine</placeName>, although, as it will be recollected, he has mentioned or described the works of Augustus, Caligula, and Nero.
The banquetting-room here mentioned would easily command a view of the Capitol, across the narrow intervening valley.
Flavius Sabinus, Vespasian's brother, was prefect of the city.
</note> where he was feasting.
Not long after, repenting of what he had done, and throwing the blame of it upon others, he called a meeting, and swore "that nothing was dearer to him than the public peace;" which oath he also obliged the rest to take.
Then drawing a dagger from his side, he presented it first to the consul, and, upon his refusing it, to the magistrates, and then to every one of the senators; but none of them being willing to accept it, he went away, as if he meant to lay it up in the temple of Concord; but some crying out to him, "You are Concord," he came back again, and said that he would not only keep his weapon, but for the future use the cognomen of Concord.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="16">
<p>He advised the senate to send deputies, accompanied by the Vestal Virgins, to desire peace, or, at least, time for consultation.
The day after, while he was waiting for an answer, he received intelligence by a scout, that the enemy was advancing.
Immediately, therefore, throwing himself into a small litter, borne by hand, with only two attendants, a baker and a cook, he privately withdrew to his father's house, on the <placeName key="tgn,4012809">Aventine</placeName> hill, intending to escape thence into <placeName key="tgn,7003005">Campania</placeName>.
But a groundless report being circulated, that the enemy was willing to come to terms, he suffered himself to be carried back to the palace.
Finding, however, nobody there, and those who were with him stealing away, he girded round his waist a belt full of gold pieces, and then ran into the porter's lodge, tying the dog before the door, and piling up against it the bed and bedding.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="17">
<p>By this time the forerunners of the enemy's army had broken into the palace, and meeting with nobody, searched, as was natural, every corner.
Being dragged by them out of his cell, and asked " who he was ?" (for they did not recognize him), "and if he knew  where Vitellius was ?" he deceived them by a falsehood.
But at last being discovered, he begged hard to be detained in custody, even were it in a prison; pretending to have something to say which concerned Vespasian's security.
Nevertheless, he was dragged half-naked into the forum, with his hands tied behind him, a rope about his neck, and his clothes torn, amidst the most contemptuous abuse, both by word and deed, along the Via Sacra; his head being held back by the hair, in the manner of condemned criminals, and the point of a sword put under his chin, that he might hold up his face to public view; some of the mob, meanwhile, pelting him with dung and mud, whilst others called him " an incendiary and glutton."
They also upbraided him with the defects of his person, for he was monstrously tall, and had a face usually very red with hard-drinking, a large belly, and one thigh weak, occasioned by a chariot running against him, as he was attending upon Caius,

<head>Remarks on Vitellius</head>
<p>AFTER the extinction of the race of the Caesars, the possession of the imperial power became extremely precarious; and great influence in the army was the means which invariably led to the throne.
The soldiers having arrogated to themselves the right of nomination, they either unanimously elected one and the same person, or different parties supporting the interests of their respective favourites, there arose between them a contention, which was usually determined by an appeal to arms, and followed by the assassination of the unsuccessful competitor.
Vitellius, by being a parasite of all the empelors from Tiberius to Nero inclusively, had arisen to a high military rank, by which, with a spirit of enterprise, and large promises to the soldiery, it was not difficult to snatch the reins of government, while they were yet fluctuating in the hands of Otho.
His ambition prompted to the attempt, and his boldness was crowned with success.
In the service of the four preceding emperors, Vitelliis had imbibed the principal vices from them all: but what chiefly distinguished him was extreme voraciousness, which, though he usually pampered it with enormous luxury, could not yet be gratified by the vilest and most offensive garbage.
The pusillanimity discovered by this emperor at his death forms a striking contrast to the heroic behaviour of Otho.

<p>THE empire, which had been long thrown into a disturbed and unsettled state, by the rebellion and violent death of its three last rulers, was at length restored to peace and security by the Flavian family, whose descent was indeed obscure, and which boasted no ancestral honours; but the public had no cause to regret its elevation; though it is acknowledged that Domitian met with the just reward of his avarice and cruelty.
Titus Flavius Petro, a townsman of <placeName key="perseus,Reate">Reate</placeName>,<note anchored="yes"><placeName key="perseus,Reate">Reate</placeName>, the original seat of the Flavian family, was a city of the Sabines.

His son, surnamed Sabinus, was never engaged in the military service, though some say he was a centurion of the first order, and others, that whilst he held that rank, he was discharged on account of his bad state of health: this Sabinus, I say, was a republican, and received the tax of the fortieth penny in <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>.

And he had so great a regard for the memory of his grandmother, that, upon solemn occasions and festival days, he constantly drank out of a silver cup which she had been accustomed to use.
After assuming the manly habit, he had a long time a distaste for the senatorian toga, though his brother had obtained it- nor could he be persuaded by any one but his mother to sue for that badge of honour.
She at length drove him to it, more by taunts and reproaches, than by entreaties and authority, calling him now and then, by way of reproach, his brother's footman.
He served as military tribune in <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>.
When made quaestor, the province of <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7000639">Cyrene</placeName> fell to him by lot.
He was candidate for the aedileship, and soon after
for the praetorship, but met with a repulse in the former case; though at last, with much difficulty, he came in sixth on the poll-books.
But the office of praetor he carried upon his first canvass, standing amongst the highest at the poll.

<p>Meanwhile, he married Flavia Domitilla, who had formerly been the mistress of Statilius Capella, a Roman knight of <placeName key="tgn,7000646">Sabrata</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>, who [Domitilla] enjoyed Latin rights; and was soon after declared fully and freely a citizen of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, on a trial before the court of Recovery, brought by her father Flavius Liberalis, a native of Ferentum, but no more than secretary to a quaestor.

there is no word in the English language which exactly conveys the

they transferred it to a union with one woman who was in a higher position than a concubine, but, for some reason, could not acquire the

<div2 type="chapter" n="4">
<p>In the reign of Claudius, by the interest of Narcissus, he was sent to <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, in command of a legion; whence being removed into <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName>, he engaged the enemy in thirty several battles.
He reduced under subjection to the Romans two very powerful tribes, and above twenty great towns, with the Isle of Wight, which lies close to the coast of <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName>; partly under the command of Aulus Plautius, the consular lieutenant, and partly under Claudius himself.
<note anchored="yes">This expedition to <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName> has been mentioned before, CLAUDIUS, c xvii. and note; and see ib. xxiv. Valerius Flaccus, i. 8, and Silius Italicus, iii. 568, celebrate the triumphs of Vespasian in <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName>. In representing him, however, as carrying his arms among the Caledonian tribes, their flattery transferred to the emperor the glory of the victories gained by his lieutenant, Agricola. Vespasian's own conquests, while he served in <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName>, were principally in the territories of the Brigantes, lying north of the Humber, and including the present counties of <placeName key="tgn,7011995">York</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7008127">Durham</placeName>.
</note>
For this success he received the triumphal ornaments, and in a short time after two priesthoods, besides the consulship, which he held during the last two
months of the year.<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 824</note>
The interval between that and his proconsulship he spent in leisure and retirement, for fear of Agrippina, who still held great sway over her son, and hated all the friends of Narcissus, who was then dead.
Afterwards he got by lot the province of <placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>, which he governed with great reputation, excepting that once, in an insurrection at Adrumetum, he.was pelted with turnips.
It is certain that he returned thence nothing richer; for his credit was so low, that he was obliged to mortgage his whole property to his brother, and was reduced to the necessity of dealing in mules, for the support of his rank; for which reason he was commonly called "the Muleteer."
He is said likewise to have been convicted of extorting from a young man of fashion two hundred thousand sesterces for procuring him the broad-stripe, contrary to the wishes of his father, and was severely reprimanded for it.
While in attendance upon Nero in <placeName key="tgn,7002733">Achaia</placeName>, he frequently withdrew from  the theatre while Nero was singing, and went to' sleep if he remained, which gave so much offence, that he was not only excluded from his society, but debarred the liberty of saluting him in public.
Upon this, he retired to a small out-of-the-way town, where he lay skulking in constant fear of his life, until a province, with an army, was offered him.</p>
<p>A firm persuasion had long prevailed through all the East,<note anchored="yes">Tacitus, Hist. V. xiii. 3, mentions this ancient prediction, and its currency through the East, in nearly the same terms as Suetonius.
The coming power is in both instances described in the plural number, <foreign lang="la">profecti</foreign>, "those shall come forth;" and Tacitus applies it to Titus as well as Vespasian.
The prophecy is commonly supposed to have reference to a passage in Micah, v. 2, "Out of thee [Bethlehem-Ephrata] shall He come forth, to be ruler in <placeName key="tgn,1000119">Israel</placeName>."
Earlier prophetic intimations of a similar character, and pointing to a more extended dominion, have been traced in the sacred records of the Jews; and there is reason to believe that these books were at this time not unknown in the heathen world, particularly at <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName>, and through the Septuagint version.
These predictions, in their literal sense, point to the establishment of a universal monarchy, which should take its rise in <placeName key="tgn,7001407">Judea</placeName>.
The Jews looked for their accomplishment in the person of one of their own nation, the expected Messiah, to which character there were many pretenders in those times.
The first disciples of Christ, during the whole period of his ministry, supposed that they were to be fulfilled in him.
The Romans thought that the conditions were answered by Vespasian and Titus having been called from <placeName key="tgn,7001407">Judea</placeName> to the seat of empire.
The expectations entertained by the Jews, and naturally participated in and appropriated by the first converts to Christianity, having proved groundless, the prophecies were subsequently interpreted in a spiritual sense.
</note> that it was fated for the empire of the world, at that time, to devolve on some one who should go forth from <placeName key="tgn,7001407">Judaea</placeName>.
This prediction referred to a Roman emperor, as the event shewed; but the Jews, applying it to themselves, broke out into rebellion, and having defeated and slain their governor,
<note anchored="yes">Gessius Florus was at that time governor of <placeName key="tgn,7001407">Judaea</placeName>, with the title and rank of preposius, it not being a proconsular province, as the native princes still held some parts of it, under the protection and with the alliance of the Romans. Gessius succeeded Florus Albinus, the successor of <placeName key="tgn,2324437">Felix</placeName>.

</note>
a man of consular rank, who was advancing to his assistance, and took an eagle, the standard of one of his legions.
As the suppression of this revolt appeared to require a stronger force and an active general, who might be safely trusted in an affair of so much importance, Vespasian was chosen in preference to all others, both for his own activity, and on account of the obscurity of his origin and name, being a person of whom there could be not the least jealousy.
Two legions, 'therefore, eight squadrons of horse, and ten cohorts, being added to the former troops in <placeName key="tgn,7001407">Judaea</placeName>, and, taking with him his eldest son as lieutenant, as soon as he arrived in his province, he turned the eyes of the neighbouring provinces upon him, by reforming immediately the discipline of the camp, and engaging the enemy once or twice with such resolution, that, in the attack of a castle,<note anchored="yes">See note to c. vii.</note> he had his knee hurt by the stroke of a stone, and received several arrows in his shield.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="5">
<p>After the deaths of Nero and Galba, whilst Otho and Vitellius were contending for the sovereignty, he entertained hopes of obtaining the empire, with the prospect of which he had long before flattered himself, from the following omens.
Upon an estate belonging to the Flavian family, in the neighbourhood of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, there was an old oak, sacred to Mars, which, at the three several deliveries of Vespasia, put out each time a new branch; evident intimations of the future fortune of each child. The
first was but a slender one, which quickly withered away;
and accordingly, the girl that was born did not live long.
The second became vigorous, which portended great good
fortune; but the third grew like a tree. His father Sabinus, encouraged by these omens, which were confirmed
by the augurs, told his mother, "that her grandson would
be emperor of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>;" at which she laughed heartily,
wondering, she said, "that her son should be in his
dotage whilst she continued still in full possession of her
faculties."</p>
<p>Afterwards in his aedileship, when Caius Caesar, being
enraged at his not taking care to have the streets kept
clean, ordered the soldiers to fill the bosom of his gown
with dirt, some persons at that time construed it into a
sign that the government, being trampled under foot and
deserted in some civil commotion, would fall under his
protection, and as it were into his lap. Once, while he
was at dinner, a strange dog that wandered about the
streets, brought a man's hand,<note anchored="yes">A right hand was the sign of sovereign power, and, as every one
knows, borne upon a staff among the standards of the armies.</note> and laid it under the table.
And another time, while he was at supper, a plough-ox
throwing the yoke off his neck, broke into the room, and
after he had frightened away all the attendants, on a suddren, as if he was tired, fell down at his feet, as he lay
still upon his couch, and hung down his neck. A cypress-tree likewise, in a field belonging to the family, was torn
up by the roots, and laid flat upon the ground, when there
was no violent wind; but next day it rose again fresher
and stronger than before.</p>
<p>He dreamt in <placeName key="tgn,7002733">Achaia</placeName> that the good fortune of himself
and his family would begin when Nero had a tooth drawn;
and it happened that the day after, a surgeon coming into
the hall, showed him a tooth which he had just extracted
from Nero. In <placeName key="tgn,7001407">Judea</placeName>, upon his consulting the oracle of the
divinity at <placeName key="tgn,1064616">Carmel</placeName>,<note anchored="yes">Tacitus says, " <placeName key="tgn,1064616">Carmel</placeName> is the name both of a god and a mountain;
but there is neither image nor temple of the god; such are the ancient
traditions; we find there only an altar and religious awe."-Hist xi.
78, 4. It also appears, from his account, that Vespasian offered sacrifice on <placeName key="tgn,7001405">Mount Carmel</placeName>, where Basilides, mentioned hereafter, c. vii.,
predicted his success from an inspection of the entrails.</note> the answer was so encouraging as to assure him of success in anything he projected, however great
or important it might be. And when Josephus,<note anchored="yes">Josephus, the celebrated Jewish historian, who was engaged in these
wars, having been taken prisoner, was confined in the dungeon at
Jotapata, the castle referred to in the preceding chapter, before which
Vespasian was wounded.-De Cell. cxi. 14.</note> one of the
noble prisoners, was put in chains, he confidently affirmed
that he should be released in a very short time by the
same Vespasian, but he would be emperor first.<note anchored="yes">The prediction of Josephus was founded on the Jewish prophecies
mentioned in the note to c. iv., which he, like others, applied to Vespasian.</note> Some
omens were likewise mentioned in the news from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>,
and among others, that Nero, towards the close of his
days, was commanded in a dream to carry Jupiter's sacred
chariot out of the sanctuary where it stood, to Vespasian's
house, and conduct it thence into the circus. Also not
long afterwards, as Galba was going to the election in
which he was created consul for the second time, a statue
of the Divine Julius<note anchored="yes">Julius Caesar is always called by our author after his apotheosis,
Divus Julius.</note> turned towards the east. And in
the field of Bedriacum,<note anchored="yes">The battle at Bedriacum secured the empire for Vitellius. See
OTHO, c. ix.. VITELLIUS,, C. X.</note> before the battle began, two
eagles engaged in the sight of the army; and one of them
being beaten, a third came from the east, and drove away
the conqueror.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="6">
<p>He made, however, no attempt upon the sovereignty
though his friends were very ready to support him, and
even pressed him to the enterprise untl he was encouraged to it by the fortuitous aid of persons unknown to
him and at a distance. Two thousand men, drawn out of
three legions in the Moesian army, had been sent to the
assistance of Otho. While they were upon their march,
news came that he had been defeated, and had put an end
to his life; notwithstanding which they continued their
march as far as <placeName key="perseus,Aquileia">Aquileia</placeName>, pretending that they gave no
credit to the report. There, tempted by the opportunity
which the disorder of the times afforded them, they ravaged and plundered the country at discretion; until at
length, fearing to be called to an account on their return,
and punished for it, they resolved upon choosing and
creating an emperor. "For they were no ways inferior,"
they said, "to the army which made Galba emperor,
nor to the praetorian troops which had set up Otho, nor
the army in <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, to whom Vitellius owed his elevation." The names of all the consular lieutenants, therefore, being taken into consideration, and one objecting to
one, and another to another, for various reasons; at last
some of the third legion, which a little before Nero's
death had been removed out of <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName> into <placeName key="tgn,7016746">Moesia</placeName>, extolled
Vespasian in high terms; and all the rest assenting, his
name was immediately inscribed on their standards. The
design was nevertheless quashed for a time, the troops
being brought to submit to Vitellius a little longer.</p>
<p>However, the fact becoming known, Tiberius Alexander,
governor of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, first obliged the legions under his
command to swear obedience to Vespasian as their emperor, on the calends [the 1st] of July, which was observed
ever after as the day of his accession to the empire; and
upon the fifth of the ides of the same month [the 28th
of July], the army in <placeName key="tgn,7001407">Judaea</placeName>, where he then was, also
swore allegiance to him.   What contributed greatly to
forward the affair, was a copy of a letter, whether real or
counterfeit, which was circulated, and said to have been
written by Otho before his decease to Vespasian, recommending to him in the most urgent terms to avenge his
death, and entreating him to come to the aid of the commonwealth; as well as a report which was circulated, that
Vitellius, after his success against Otho, proposed to change
the winter quarters of the legions, and remove those in
<placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> to a less hazardous station and a warmer climate. Moreover, amongst the governors of provinces,
Lucinius Mucianus dropping the grudge arising from a
jealousy of which he had hitherto made no secret, promised to join him with the Syrian army, and, among the
allied kings, Vologesus, king of the Parthians, offered
him a reinforcement of forty thousand archers.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="7">
<p>Having, therefore, entered on a civil war, and sent
forward his generals and forces into <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, he himself, in
the meantime, passed  over to <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName>, to obtain possession of the key of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>.<note anchored="yes"><placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName> may well be called the key, <foreign lang="la">claustra</foreign>, of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, which

without attendants, the temple of Serapis, to take the auspices respecting the establishment of his power, and having done his utmost to propitiate the deity, upon turning
round, [his freedman] Basilides<note anchored="yes">Tacitus describes Basilides as a man of rank among the Egyptians, and
he appears also to have been a priest, as we find him officiating at Mount
Carmel, c. v. This is so incompatible with his being a Roman freedman, that commentators concur in supposing that the word "libertus,"
although found in all the copies now extant, has crept into the text by
some inadvertence of an early transcriber. Basilides appears, like Philo
Judaeus, who lived about the same period, to have been half-Greek, half-Jew, and to have belonged to the celebrated Platonic school of Alexandria.</note> appeared before him,
and seemed to offer him the sacred leaves, chaplets, and
cakes, according to the usage of the place, although no
one had admitted him, and he had long laboured under a
muscular debility, which would hardly have allowed him
to walk into the temple; besides which, it was certain that
at the very time he was far away. Immeiately after this,
arrived letters with intelligence that Vitellius's troops had
been defeated at Cremona,  and he himself slain at Rome.
Vespasian, the new emperor, having been raised unexpectedly from a low estate, wanted something which might
clothe him with divine majesty and authority. This, likewise, was now added. A poor man who was blind, and
another who was lame, came both together before him,
when he was seated on the tribunal, imploring him to heal
them,<note anchored="yes">Tacitus informs us that Vespasian himself believed Basilides to have
been at this time not only in an infirm state of health, but at the distance of several days' journey from Alexandria. But (for his greater
satisfaction) he strictly examined the priests whether Basilides had entered the temple on that day: he made inquiries of all he met, whether
he had been seen in the city; nay, further, he dispatched messengers on
horseback, who ascertained that at the time specified, Basilides was more
than eighty miles from Alexandria. Then Vespasian comprehended that
the appearance of Basilides, and the answer to his prayers given through
him, were by divine interposition. Tacit. Hist. iv. 82. 2.</note> and saying that they were admonished in a dream
by the god Serapis to seek his aid, who assured them that
he would restore sight to the one by anointing his eyes
with his spittle, and give strength to the leg of the other,
if he vouchsafed but to touch it with his heel. At first he
could scarcely believe that the thing would any how succeed, and therefore hesitated to venture on making the
experiment. At length, however, by the advice of his
friends, he made the attempt publicly, in the presence of
the assembled multitudes, and it was crowned with success in both cases.<note anchored="yes">The account given by Tacitus of the miracles of Vespasian is fuller
than that of Suetonius, but does not materially vary in the details, except
that, in his version of the story, he describes the impotent man to be
lame in the hand, instead of the leg or the knee, and adds an important
circumstance in the case of the blind man, that he was "notus tabe occulorum," notorious for the disease in his eyes. He also winds up the
narrative with the following statement: "They who were present, relate
both these cures, even at this time, when there is nothing to be gained
by lying." Both the historians lived within a few years of the occurrence, but their works were not published until advanced periods of
their lives. The closing remark of Tacitus seems to indicate that, at
least, he did not entirely discredit the account; and as for Suetonius,
his pages are as full of prodigies of all descriptions, related apparently
in all good faith, as a monkish chronicle of the Middle Ages.
The story has the more interest, as it is one of the examples of successful imposture, selected by Hume in his Essay on Miracles; with the
reply to which by Paley, in his Evidences of Christianity, most readers
are familiar. The commentators on Suetonius agree with Paley in considering the whole affair as a juggle between the priests, the patients, and,
probably, the emperor. But what will, perhaps, strike the reader as
most remarkable, is the singular coincidence of the story with the accounts given of several of the miracles of Christ; whence it has been
supposed that the scene was planned in imitation of them. It did not
fall within the scope of Dr. Paley's argument to advert to this; and our
own brief illustration must be strictly confined within the limits of historical disquisition. Adhering to this principle, we may point out that
if the idea of plagiarism be accepted, it receives some confirmation from
the incident related by our author in a preceding paragraph, forming,
it may be considered, another scene of the same drama, where we find
Basilides appearing to Vespasian in the temple of Serapis, under circumstances which cannot fail to remind us of Christ's suddenly standing in the midst of his disciples, "when the doors were shut."  This
incident, also, has very much the appearance of a parody on the evangelical history. But if the striking similarity of the two narratives be
thus accounted for, it is remarkable that while the priests of Alexandria,
or, perhaps, Vespasian himself from his residence in Judaea, were in
possession of such exact details of two of Christ's miracles -- if not of
a third striking incident in his history -- we should find not the most
distant allusion in the works of such cotemporary writers as Tacitus and
Suetonius, to any one of the still more stupendous occurrences which
had recently taken place in a part of the world with which the Romans
had now very intimate relations. The character of these authors induces us to hesitate in adopting the notion, that either contempt or
disbelief would have led them to pass over such events, as altogether
unworthy of notice; and the only other inference from their silence is,
that they had never heard of them. But as this can scarcely be reconciled with the plagiarism attributed to Vespasian or the Egyptian
priests, it is safer to conclude that the coincidence, however singular,
was merely fortuitous. It may be added that Spartianus, who wrote
the lives of Adrian and succeeding emperors, gives an account of a
similar miracle performed by that prince in healing a blind man.</note>    About the same time, at Tegea in
Arcadia, by the direction of some soothsayers, several
vessels of ancient workmanship were dug out of a consecrated place, on which there was an effigy resembling
Vespasian.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="8">
<p>Returning now to Rome, under these auspices,
and with a great reputation, after enjoying a triumph for
victories over the Jews, he added eight consulships<note anchored="yes">A. U. C. 823-833, excepting 826 and 831.</note> to his
former one. He likewise assumed the censorship, and
made it his principal concern, during the whole of his
government, first  to restore order in the state, which had
been almost ruined,     and  was in a tottering condition, and
then to improve it.  The soldiers, one part of them emboldened by victory, and the other smarting with the disgrace of their defeat, had abandoned themselves to every
species of licentiousness and insolence. Nay, the provinces, too, and free cities, and some kingdoms in alliance
with Rome, were all in a disturbed state.   He, therefore,
disbanded   many of Vitellius's    soldiers, and punished
others; and so far was he from granting any extraordinary favours   to the sharers of his success, that it was
late before he paid the gratuities due to them by law.
That he might let slip no opportunity of reforming the
discipline of the army, upon a young man's coming much
perfumed to return him thanks for having appointed him
to command a squadron of horse, he turned away his
head in disgust, and giving him this sharp reprimand, "I
had rather you had smelt of garlic," revoked his commission. When the men belonging to the fleet, who travelled by turns from Ostia and Puteoli to Rome, petitioned
for an addition to their pay, under the name of shoe-money, thinking that it would answer little purpose to send
them away without a reply, he ordered them for the future
to run bare-footed; and so they have done ever since.
He deprived of their liberties, Achaia, Lycia, Rhodes, Byzantium, and Samos, and reduced them into the form of
provinces; Thrace, also, and Cilicia, as well as Comagene,
which until that time had been under the government of
kings. He stationed some legions in Cappadocia on account of the frequent inroads of barbarians, and, instead
of a Roman knight, appointed as governor of it a man of
consular rank. The ruins of houses which had been
burnt down long before, being a great desight to the city,
he gave leave to any one who would, to take possession
of the void ground and build upon it, if the proprietors
should hesitate to perform the work themselves. He resolved upon rebuilding the Capitol, and was the foremost
to put his hand to clearing the ground of the rubbish, and
removed some of it upon his own shoulder. And he undertook, likewise, to restore the three thousand tables of
brass which had been destroyed in the fire which consumed the Capitol; searching in all quarters for copies of
those curious and ancient records, in which were contained the decrees of the senate, almost from the building of
the city, as well as the acts of the people, relative to alliances, treaties, and privileges granted to any person.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="9">
<p>He likewise erected several new public buildings,
namely the temple of Peace<note anchored="yes">The temple of Peace, erected <date value="71">A. D. 71</date>, on the conclusion of the
wars with the Germans and the Jews, was the largest temple in Rome.
Vespasian and Titus deposited in it the sacred vessels and other spoils
which were carried in their triumph after the conquest of Jerusalem.
They were consumed, and the temple much damaged, if not destroyed,
by fire, towards the end of the reign of Commodus, in the year 191.
It stood in the Forum, where some ruins on a prodigious scale, still remaining, were traditionally considered to be those of the Temple of
Peace, until Piranesi contended that they are part of Nero's Golden
House. Others suppose that they are the remains of a Basilica. A
beautiful fluted Corinthian column, forty-seven feet high, which was removed from this spot, and now stands before the church of S. Maria

that Augustus had projected such a work. He purified
the senatorian and equestrian orders, which had been
much reduced by the havoc made amongst them at several times, and was fallen into disrepute by neglect. Having   expelled the most unworthy, he chose in their room
the most honourable persons in Italy and the provinces.
And to let it be known that those two orders differed not
so much in privileges as in dignity, he declared publicly
when some altercation passed between a senator and a
Roman knight, "that senators ought not to be treated
with scurrilous language, unless they were aggressors, and then it was fair and lawful to return it."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="10">
<p>The business of the courts had prodigiously accumulted, partly from  old law-suits which, on account of the interruption that had been given to the course of justice, still remained undecided, and partly from the accession of new suits arising out of the disorder of the times.
He, therefore, chose cmmissioners by lot to provide for the restitution of what had been seized by violence during the war, and others with extraordinary jurisdiction to decide causes belonging to the centumviri, and reduce them to as small a number as possible, for the dispatch of which, otherwise, the lives of the litigants could scarcely allow sufficient time.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="11">
<p>Lust and luxury, from the licence which had long prevailed, had also grown to an enormous height.
He, therefore, obtained a decree of the senate, that a woman who formed an union with the slave of another person, should be considered a bondwoman herself; and that usurers should not be allowed to take proceedings at law for the recovery of money lent to young men whilst they lived in their father's family, not even after their fathers were dead.</p></div2>

<p>In other affairs, from  the beginning to the end of his government, he conduct  himself-wihgreatmedeation and clemency.
He was so far from disseriibling the obscurity of his extraction, that he frequently made mention of it himself.

whose monument is still to be seen on the Salarian road, he laughed at them for it. And he was so little fond
of external and adventitious ornaments, that, on the day
of his triumph,' being quite tired of the length and
tediousness of the procession, he could not forbear saying, "he was rightly served, for having in his old age.
been so silly as to desire a triumph; as if it was either
due to his ancestors, or had ever been expected by himself."  Nor would he for a long time accept of the tribunitian
authority, or the title of Father of his Country.  And in regard to the custom of searching those who came to salute him, he dropped it even in the time of the civil war.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="13">
<p>He bore with great mildness the freedom used
by his friends, the satirical allusions of advocates, and the
petulance of philosophers. Licinius Mucianus, who had
been guilty of notorious acts of lewdness, but, presuming
upon his great services, treated him very rudely, he re-
proved only in private; and when complaining of his con-
duct to a common friend of theirs, he concluded with
these words, "However, I am a man."  Salvius Liberalis,
in pleading the. cause of a rich man under prosecution,
presuming to say, "What is it to Caesar, if Hipparchus
possesses a hundred millions of sesterces?" he com-
mended him for it. Demetrius, the Cynic philosopher,<note anchored="yes">Demetrius, who was born at Corinth, seems to have been a close
imitator of Diogenes, the founder of the sect. Having come to Rome
to study under Apollonius, he was banished to the islands, with other
philosophers, by Vespasian.</note> who
had been sentenced to banishment, meeting him on the
road, and refusing to rise up or salute him, nay, snarling
at him in scurrilous language, he only called him a cur.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="14">
<p>He was little disposed to keep up the memory of affronts or quarrels, nor did he harbour any resentment on account of them.
He made a very splendid marriage for the daughter of his enemy Vitellius, and gave her, besides, a suitable fortune and equipage.
Being in a great consternation after he was forbidden the court in the time of Nero, and asking those about him, what he should do? or, whither he should g ? one of those whose office it was to introduce people to the emperor, thrusting him out, bid him go to Morbonia.<note anchored="yes">There being no such place as Morbonia, and the supposed name being derived ftom morbus, disease, some critics have supposed that Anticyra, the asylum of the incurables, (see CALIGULA, C. xxix) is meant; but the probability is, that the expression used by the imperial chamberlain was only a courtly version of a phrase not very commonly adopted in the present day.
</note> But when this same person came afterwards to beg his pardon, he only vented his resentment in nearly the same words.
He was so far from being influenced by suspicion or fear to seek the destruction of any one, that, when his friends advised him to beware of Metius Pomposianus, because it was commonly believed, on his nativity being cast, that he was destined by fate to the empire, he made him consul, promising for him, that he would not forget the benefit conferred.</p></div2>

Although Helvidius Priscus

was the only man who presumed to salute him on his return from Syria by his private name of Vespasian, and, when he came to be praetor, omitted any mark of honour to him, or even any mention of him
in his edicts, yet he was not angry, until Helvidius proceeded to inveigh against him with the most scurrilous language.
Though he did indeed banish him, and afterwards ordered him  to be put to death, yet he would gladly have saved him notwithstanding, and accordingly dispatched messengers to fetch back the executioners; and he would have saved him, had he not been deceived by a false account brought, that he had already perished.
He never ejroiced at the death of any man; nay, he would shed tears, and sigh, atthe just punishment of the guilty.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="16">
<p>The only thing deservedly blameable in his character was his love of money.
For not satisfied with reviving the imposts which had been repealed in the time of Galba he imposed
new and onerous taxes, augmented the tribute of the provinces, and doubled that of some of them.  He likewise openly engaged in a traffic, which is discreditable<note anchored="yes">Cicero speaks in strong terms of the sordidness of retail trade.-- Off. i. 24.</note> even to a private individual, buying great quantities of goods, for the purpose of retailing them again to advantage.
Nay, he made no scruple of selling the great offices of the state to candidates, and pardons to persons under prosecution, whether they were innocent or guilty.
It is believed, that he advanced all the most rapacious amongst the procurators to high offices, with the view of squeezing them after they had acquired great wealth.
He was commonly said, "to have used them as sponges," because it was  his practice, as we may say, to wet them when dry, and squeeze them when wet.
It is said that he was naturally extremely covetous, and was upbraided with it by an old herdsman of his, who, upon the emperor's refusing to enfranchise him gratis, which on his advancement he humbly petitioned for, cried out,
"That the fox changed his hair, but not his nature."
On the other hand, some are of opinion, that he was urged to his rapacious proceedings by necessity, and the extreme poverty of the treasury and exchequer, of which he took public notice in the beginning of his reign; declaring that "no less than four hundred thousand millions of sesterces were wanting to carry on the government."
This is the more likely to be true, because he applied to the best purposes what he procured by bad means.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="17">
<p>His liberality, however, to all ranks of people, was excessive.
He made up to several senators the estate required by law to qualify them for that dignity; relieving likewise such men of consular rank as were poor, with a yearly allowance of five hundred thousand sesterces;<note anchored="yes">The sesterce being worth about two-pence half-penny of English money, the salary of a Roman senator was, in round numbers, five thousand pounds a year; and that of a professor, as stated in the succeeding chapter, one thousand pounds.
From this scale, similar calculations may easily be made of the sums occurring in Suetonius's statements from time to time.
There appears to be some mistake in the sum stated in c. xvi.

<p>His method of life was commonly this. After he became emperor, he used to rise very early, often before day-break.
Having read over his letters, and the briefs of all the departments of the government offices, he admitted his friends; and while they were paying him their
compliments, he would put on his own shoes, and dress himself with his own hands.
Then, after the dispatch of such business as was brought before him, he rode out, and afterwards retired to repose, lying on his couch with one of his mistresses, of whom he kept several after the death of Caenis.<note anchored="yes">See c. iii and note.</note> Coming out of his private apartments, he passed to the Bath," 'and then entered the supper-room.

<p>At supper, and, indeed, at other times, he was extremely free and jocose.
For he had humour, but of a low kind, and he would sometimes use indecent language, such as is addressed to ygung girls about to be married.

Being once reminded by Mestrius Florus, that plaustra was a more proper expression than plostra, he the next day saluted him by the name of Flaurus.<note anchored="yes">Probably the emperor had not entirely worn off, or might even affect the rustic dialect of his Sabine countrymen: for among the peasantry the au was still pronounced o, as in plostrum for plaustrum, a waggon; and in orum for aurum, gold, c.

He chiefly affected wit upon his own shameful means of
raising money, in order to wipe off the odium by some
joke, and turn it into ridicule. One of his ministers, who
was much in his favour, requesting of him a stewardship
for some person, under pretence of his being his brother,
he deferred granting him his petition, and in the meantime sent for the candidate, and having squeezed out of
him as much money as he had agreed to give to his
friend at court, he appointed him immediately to the
office. The minister soon after renewing his application,
"You must," said he, "find another brother; for the one
you adopted is in truth mine."</p>
<p>Suspecting once, during a journey, that his mule-driver
had alighted to shoe his mules, only in order to have an
opportunity for allowing a person they met, who was engaged in a law-suit, to speak to him, he asked him, " how
much he got for shoeing his mules?" and insisted on
having a share of the profit. When his son Titus blamed
him for even laying a tax upon urine, he applied to his
nose a piece of the money he received in the first instalment, and asked him, " if it stunk?"  And he replying no, "And yet," said he,   it is derived from urine."
Some deputies having come to acquaint him that a large statue, which would cost a vast sum, was ordered to be erected for him at the public expense, he told them to pay it down immediately, holding out the hollow of his hand, and saying, " there was a base ready for the statue."
Not even when he was under the immediate apprehension and peril of death, could he forbear jesting.

<head>Remarks on Vespasian</head>
<p>NEITHER consanguinity nor adoption, as formerly, but great influence in the army having now become the road to the imperial throne, no person could claim a better title to that elevation than Titus Flavius Vespasian.
He had not only served with great reputation in the wars both in Britain and Judaea, but seemed as yet untainted with any vice which could pervert his conduct in the civil administration of the empire.
It appears, however, that he was prompted more by the persuasion of friends, than by his own ambition, to prosecute the attainment of the imperial dignity.
To render this enterprise more successful, recourse was had to a new and peculiar artifice, which, while well accommodated to the superstitious credulity of the Romans, impressed them with an idea, that Vespasian's destiny to the throne was confirmed by supernatural indications.
But, after his elevation, we hear no more of his miraculous achievements.</p>
<p>The prosecution of the war in Britain, which had been suspended for some years, was resumed by Vespasian; and he sent thither Petilius Cerealis, who by his bravery extended the limits of the Roman province.
Under Julius Frontinus, successor to the general, the invaders continued to make farther progress in the reduction of the island: but the commander who finally established the dominion of the Romans in Britain, was Julius Agricola, not less distinguished for his military achievements, than for his prudent regard to the civil administration of the country.
He began his operations with the conquest of North Wales, whence passing over into the island of Anglesey, which had revolted since the time of Suetonius Paulinus, he again reduced it to subjection.
Then proceeding northwards with his victorious army, he defeated the Britons in every engagement, took possession of all the territories in the southern parts of the island, and driving before him all who refused to submit to the Roman arms, penetrated even into the forests and mountains of Caledonia.
He defeated the natives under Galgacus, their leader, in a decisive battle; and fixing a line of garrisons between the friths of Clyde and Forth, he secured the Roman province from the incursions of the people who occupied the parts of the island beyond that boundary.
Wherever he established the Roman power, he introduced laws and civilization amongst the inhabitants, and employed every means of conciliating their affection, as well as of securing their obedience.</p>
<p>The war in Judaea, which had been commenced under the former reign, was now continued in that of Vespasian; but he left the siege of Jerusalem to be conducted by his son Titus, who displayed great valour and military talents in the prosecution of the enterprise.
After an obstinate defence by the Jews, that city, so much celebrated in the sacred writings, was finally demolished, and the glorious temple itself, the admiration of the world, reduced to ashes; contrary, however, to the will of Titus, who exerted his utmost efforts to extinguish the flames.</p>
<p>The manners of the Romans had now attained to an enormous pitch of depravity, through the unbounded licentiousness of the times; and, to the honour of Vespasian, he discovered great zeal in his endeavours to effect a national reformation.
Vigilant, active, and persevering, he was indefatigable in the management of public affairs, and rose in the winter before day-break, to give audience to his officers of state.
But if we give credit to the whimsical imposition of a tax upon urine, we cannot entertain any high opinion, either of his talents as a financier, or of the resources of the Roman empire.
By his encouragement of science, he displayed a liberality, of which there occurs no example
under all the preceding emperors, since the time of Augustus.
Pliny the elder was now in the height of reputation, as well as in great favour with Vespasian; and it was probably owing not a little to the advice of that minister, that the emperor showed himself so much the patron of Literary men.
A writer mentioned frequently by Pliny, and who lived in this reign, was Licinius Mucianus, a Roman knight: he treated of the history and geography of the eastern countries.
Juvenal, who had begun his Satires several years before, continued to inveigh against the flagrant vices of the times; but the only author whose writings we have to notice in the present reign, is a poet of a different class.

<div2 type="chapter" n="1">
<p>TITUS, who had the same cognomen with his father, was the darling and the delight of mankind; so much did the natural genius, address, or good fortune he possessed tend to conciliate the favour of all.
This was, indeed, extremely difficult, after he became emperor, as before that time, and even during the reign of his father, he lay under public odium  and censure.
He was born upon the third of the calends of January [30th Dec.], in the year remarkable for the death of Caius,<note anchored="yes">Caligula.  Titus was born A. U. C. 794; about <date value="49">A. D. 49</date>.</note>
near the Septizonium,<note anchored="yes">The Septizonium was a circular building of seven stories. The remains of that of Septimis Severus, which stood on the side of the Palatine Hill, remained till the time of Pope Sixtus V., who removed it, and employed thirty-eight of its columns in ornamenting the church of St. Peter.
It does not appear whether the Septizonium here mentioned as existing in the time of Titus, stood on the same spot.
</note>
 in a mean house, and a very small and dark room, which still exists, and is shown to the curious.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="2">
<p>He was educated in the palace with Britannicus, and instructed in the same branches of learning, and under the same masters.
During this time, they say, that a physiognomist being introduced by Narcissus, the freedman of Claudius, to examine the features of Britannicus,<note anchored="yes">Britannicus, the son of Claudius and Messalina.</note> positively affirmed that he would never become emperor, but that Titus, who stood by, would.
They were so familiar, that Titus being next him at table, is thought to have
tasted of the fatal potion which put an end to Britannicus's life, and to have contracted from it a distemper which hung about him a long time.
In remembrance of all these circumstances, he afterwards erected a golden statue of him in the Palatium, and dedicated to him an equestrian statue of ivory; attending it in the Circensian procession, in which it is still carried to this day.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="3">
<p>While yet a boy, he was remarkable for his noble endowments both of body and mind; and as he advanced in years, they became still more conspicuous.
He had a fine person, combining an equal mixture of majesty and grace; was very strong, though not tall, and somewhat corpulent.
Gifted with an excellent memory, and a capacity for all the arts of peace and war; he was a perfect master of the use of arms and riding; very ready in the Latin and Greek tongues, both in verse and prose; and such was the facility he possessed in both, that he would harangue and versify extempore.
Nor was he unacquainted with music, but could both sing and play upon the harp sweetly and scientifically.
I have likewise been informed by many persons, that he was remarkably quick in writing short-hand, would in merriment and jest engage with his secretaries in the imitation of any hand-writing he saw, and often say, " that he was admirably qualified for forgery."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="4">
<p>He filled with distinction the rank of a military tribune both in Germany and Britain, in which he conducted himself with the utmost activity, and no less modesty and reputation; as appears evident from the great number of statues, with honourable inscriptions, erected to him in various parts of both those provinces.
After serving in the wars, he frequented the courts of law, but with less assiduity than applause.
About the same time, he married Arricidia, the daughter of Tertullus, who was
only a knight, but had formerly been prefect of the pretorian guards.
After her decease, he married Marcia Furnilla, of a very noble family, but afterwards divorced her, taking from her the daughter he had by her.
Upon the expiration of his quaestorship, he was raised to the rank of commander of a legion,<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 820</note>
and took the two strong cities of Tarichaea and Gamala, in Judaea; and having his horse killed under him in a battle, he mounted another, whose rider he had encountered and slain.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="5">
<p>Soon afterwards, when Galba came to be emperor, he was sent to congratulate him, and turned the eyes of all people upon himself, wherever he came: it being the general opinion amongst them, that the emperor had sent for him with a design to adopt him for his son.
But finding all things again in confusion, he turned back upon the road; and going to consult the oracle of Venus at Paphos about his voyage, he received assurances of obtaining the empire for himself.
These hopes were speedily strengthened, and being left to finish the reduction of Judea, in the final assault of Jerusalem, he slew seven of its defenders, with the like number of arrows, and took it upon his daughter's birth-day.<note anchored="yes">Jerusalem was taken, sacked, and burnt, by Titus, after a two years' siege, on the 8th of September, A U. C. 821, <date value="69">A. D. 69</date>; it being the Sabbath. It was in the second year of the reign of Vespasian, when the emperor was sixty years old, and Titus himself, as he informs us, thirty. For particulars of the siege, see Josephus, De Bell. Jud. vi. and vii.; Hegesippus, Excid. Hierosol. v.; Dio, lxvi.; Tacitus Hist. v.; Orosius, vii. 9.
</note>
 So great was the joy and attachment of the soldiers, that, in their congratulations, they unanimously saluted him by the title of Emperor;<note anchored="yes">For the sense in which Titus was saluted with the title of Emperor by the troops, see JULIUS CAESAR, c. lxxvi.</note> and, upon his quitting the province soon afterwards, would
needs have detained him, earnestly begging him, and that not without threats, "either to stay, or take them all with him."
This occurrence gave rise to the suspicion of his being engaged in a design to rebel against his father, and claim for himself the government of the East; and the suspicion increased, when, on his way to Alexandria, he wore a diadem  at the consecration of the ox Apis at Memphis; and, though he did it only in compliance with an ancient religious usage of the country, yet there were some who put a bad construction upon it. Making, therefore, what haste he could into Italy, he arrived first at Rhegium, and sailing thence in a merchant ship to Puteoli, went to Rome with all possible expedition.
Presenting himself unexpectedly to his father, he said, by way of contradicting the strange reports raised concerning him, "I am come, father, I am come."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="6">
<p>From  that time he constantly acted as colleague with his father, and, indeed, as regent of the empire.
He triumphed<note anchored="yes">The joint triumph of Vespasian and Titus, which was celebrated A. U. C. 824, is fully described by Josephus, De Bell.
Jud. vii. 24. It is commemorated by the triumphal monument called the Arch of Titus, erected by the senate and people of Rome after his death, and still standing at the foot of the Palatine Hill, on the road leading from the Colosseum to the Forum, and is one of the most beautiful as well as the most interesting models of Roman art.
It consists of four stories of the three orders of architecture, the Corinthian being repeated in the two highest.
Some of the bas-reliefs, still in good preservation, represent the table of the shew-bread, the seven-branched golden candlestick, the vessel of incense, and the silver-trumpets, which were taken by Titus from the Temple at Jerusalem, and, with the book of the law, the veil of the temple, and other spoils, were carried in the triumph.
The fate of these sacred relics is rather interesting.
Josephus says, that the veil and books of the law were deposited in the Palatium, and the rest of the spoils in the Temple of Peace.
When that was burnt, in the reign of Commodus, these treasures were saved, and they were afterwards carried off by Genseric to Africa.
Belisarius recovered them, and brought them to Constantinople, <date value="520">A. D. 520</date>.
Procopius informs us, that a Jew, who saw them, told an acquaintance of the emperor that it would not be advisable to carry them to the palace at Constantinople, as they could not remain anywhere else, but where Solomon had placed them.
This, he said, was the reason why Genseric had taken the Palace at Rome, and the Roman army had in turn taken that of the Vandal kings.
Upon this, the emperor was so alarmed. that he sent the whole of them to the Christian churches at Jerusalem.
</note>with his father, bore jointly with him the office
of censor;<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 825</note> and was, besides, his colleague not only in the tribunitian authority,<note anchored="yes">A.U.C. 824</note> but in seven consulships.<note anchored="yes">A. U. C. 823, 825, 827-830, 832.
</note>
Taking upon himself the care and inspection of all'offices, he dictated letters, wrote proclamations in his father's name, and pronounced his speeches in the senate in place of the quaestor.
He likewise assumed the command of the pretorian guards, although no one but a Roman knight had ever before been their prefect.
In this he conducted himself with great haughtiness and violence, taking off without scruple or delay all those he had most reason to suspect, after he had secretly sent his emissaries into the theatres and camp, to demand, as if by general consent, that the suspected persons should be delivered up to punishment.
Among these, he invited to supper A. Cacina, a man of consular rank, whom he ordered to be stabbed at his departure, immediately after he had gone out of the room.
To this act, indeed, he was provoked by an imminent danger; for he had discovered a writing under the hand of Cecina, containing an account of a plot hatched among the soldiers.
By these acts, though he provided for his future security, yet for the present he so much incurred the hatred of the people, that scarcely ever any one came to the empire with a more odious character, or more universally disliked.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="7">
<p>Besides his cruelty, he lay under the suspicion of giving way to habits of luxury, as he often prolonged his revels till midnight with the most riotous of his acquaintance.
Nor was he unsuspected of lewdness, and his well-known attachment to queen Berenice,<note anchored="yes">Berenice, whose name is written by our author and others Beronice, was daughter of Agrippa the Great, who was by Aristobulus, grandson of Herod the Great.
Having been contracted to Mark, son of Alexander Lysimachus, he died before their union, and Agrippa married her to Herod, Mark's brother, for whom he had obtained from the emperor Claudius the kingdom of Chalcis.
Herod also dying, Berenice, then a widow, lived with her brother, Agrippa, and was suspected of an incestuous intercourse with him.
It was at this time that, on their way to the imperial court at Rome, they paid a visit to Festus, at Casarea, and were present when St. Paul answered his accusers so eloquently before the tribunal of the governor.
Her fascinations were so great, that, to shield herself from the charge of incest, she prevailed on Polemon, king of Cilicia, to submit to be circumcised, become a Jew, and marry her.
That union also proving unfortunate, she appears to have returned to Jerusalem, and having attracted Vespasian by magnificent gifts, and the young Titus by her extraordinary beauty, she followed them to Rome, after the termination of the Jewish war, and had apartments in the palace, where she lived with Titus, "to all appearance, as his wife," as Xiphilinus informs us; and there seems no doubt that he would have married her, but for the strong prejudices of the Romans against foreign alliances.
Suetonius tells us with what pain they separated.
</note>
who received from him, as it is reported, a promise of marriage.
He was supposed, besides, to be of a rapacious disposition; for it is certain, that, in causes which came before his father, he used to offer his interest for sale, and take bribes.
In short, people publicly expressed an unfavourable opinion of him, and said he would prove another Nero.
This prejudice, however, turned out in the end to his advantage, and enhanced his praises to the highest pitch when he was found to possess no vicious propensities, but, on the contrary, the noblest virtues.
His entertainments were
agreeable rather than extravagant: and he surrounded himself with such excellent friends, that the succeeding princes adopted them as most serviceable to themselves and the state.
He immediately sent away Berenice from the city, much against both their inclinations.
Some of his old eunuchs, though such accomplished dancers, that they bore an uncontrollable sway upon the stage, he was so far from treating with any extraordinary kindness, that he would not so much as witness their performances in the crowded theatre.
He violated no private right; and if ever man refrained from injustice, he did; nay, he would not accept of the allowable and customary offerings.
Yet, in munificence, he was inferior to none of the princes before him.
Having dedicated his amphitheatre,
<note anchored="yes">The Colosseum: it had been four years in building. See VESPAS. c. ix.
</note>
and built some warm  baths<note anchored="yes">The Baths of Titus stood on the Esquiline Hill, on part of the
ground which had been the gardens of Maecenas. Considerable remains
of them are still found among the vineyards; vaulted chambers of vast
dimensions, some of which were decorated with arabesque paintings,
still in good preservation. Titus appears to have erected a palace for
himself adjoining; for the Laocoon, which is mentioned by Pliny as
standing in this palace, was found in the neighbouring ruins.</note>
close by it with great expedition, he entertained the people with most magnificent spectacles.
He likewise exhibited a naval fight in the old Naumachia, besides a combat of gladiators; and in one day brought into the theatre five thousand wild beasts of all kinds.<note anchored="yes">If the statements were not well attested, we might be incredulous
as to the number of wild beasts collected for the spectacles to which
the people of Rome were so passionately devoted. The earliest account
we have of such an exhibition, was A. U. C. 502, when one hundred and
forty-two elephants, taken in Sicily, were produced. Pliny. who gives
this information, states that lions first appeared in any number, A. U. C.
652; but these were probably not turned loose. In 661, Sylla, when
he was praetor, brought forward one hundred. In 696, besides lions,
elephants, and bears, one hundred and fifty panthers were shown for the first time.
At the dedication of Pompey's Theatre, there was the greatest exhibition of beasts ever then known; including seventeen elephants, six hundred lions, which were killed in the course of five days, four hundred and ten panthers, c. A rhinoceros also appeared for the first time.
This was A. U. c. 70I. The art of taming these beasts was carried to such perfection, that Mark Antony actually yoked them to his carriage.
Julius Caesar, in his third dictatorship, A. U. c. 708, showed a vast number of wild beasts, among which were four hundred lions and a cameleopard.
A tiger was exhibited for the first time at the dedication of the Theatre of Marcellus, A. U. C. 743.
It was kept in a cage. Claudius afterwards exhibited four together.
The exhibition of Titus, at the dedication of the Colosseum, here mentioned by Suetonius, seems to have been the largest ever made; Xiphilinus even adds to the number, and says, that including wild-boars, cranes and other animals, no less than nine thousand were killed.
In the reigns of succeeding emperors, a new feature was given to these spectacles, the Circus being converted into a temporary forest, by planting large trees, in which wild animals were turned loose, and the people were allowed to enter the wood and take what they pleased.
In this instance, the game consisted principally of beasts of chase; and, on one occasion, one thousand stags, as many of the ibex, wild sheep (moufflons from Sardinia?), and other grazing animals, besides one thousand wild boars, and as many ostriches, were turned loose by the emperor Gordian.</note></p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="8">
<p>He was by nature  extremely  benevolent;  for whereas all the emperors after Tiberius, according to the example he had set them, would not admit the grants made by former princes to be valid, unless they received their own sanction, he confirmed them all by one general edict, without waiting for any applications respecting them.
Of all who petitioned for any favour, he sent none away without hopes.
And when his ministers represented to him that he promised more than he could perform, he replied, " No one ought to go away downcast from an audience with his prince."
Once at supper, reflecting that he had done nothing for any that day, he broke out into that memorable and justly-admired  saying, "My friends, I have lost a day."<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="la">"Diem perdidi."</foreign>  This memorable speech is recorded by several other historians, and praised by Eusebius in his Chronicles.
</note>
More particularly, he treated the people on all occasions with so much courtesy, that, on his presenting them with a show of gladiators, he declared, "He should manage it, not according to his own fancy, but that of the spectators," and did accordingly.
He denied them  nothing, and very frankly encouraged them to ask what they pleased.
Espousing the cause of the Thracian party among the gladiators, he frequently joined in the popular demonstrations in their favour, but without compromising his dignity or doing injustice.
To omit no opportunity of acquiring popularity, he sometimes made use himself of the baths he had erected, without excluding the common people.
There happened in his reign some dreadful accidents; an enrption of mount Vesuvius,
<note anchored="yes">A. U. C. 832, <date value="79">A. D. 79</date>. It is hardly necessary to refer to the well-known Epistles of Pliny the younger, vi. 16 and 20, giving an account of the first eruption of Vesuvius, in which Pliny, the historian, perished. And see hereafter, p. 499.
</note>
in Campania, and a fire in Rome, which continued three days and three nights;<note anchored="yes">The great fire at Rome happened in the second year of the reign of Titus. It consumed a large portion of the city, and among the public buildings destroyed were the temples of Serapis and Isis, that of Neptune, the baths of Agrippa, the Septa, the theatres of Balbus and Pompey, the buildings and library of Augustus on the Palatine, and the temple of Jupiter in the Capitol.
</note>
besides a plague, such as was scarcely ever known before.
Amidst these many great disasters, he not only manifested the concern which might be expected from a prince, but even the affection of a father, for his people; one while comforting them by his proclamations, and another while relieving them to the utmost of his power.
He chose by lot, from among the men of consular rank, commissioners for repairing the losses in Campania.
The estates of those who had perished by the eruption of Vesuvius, and who had left no heirs, he applied to the repair of the ruined cities.
With regard to the public buildings destroyed by fire in the City, he declared that nobody should be a loser but himself.
Accordingly, he applied all the ornaments of his palaces to the decoration of the temples, and purposes of public utility, and appointed several men of the equestrian order to superintend the work.
For the relief of the people during the plague, he employed, in the way of sacrifice and medicine, all means both human and divine.
Amongst the calamities of the times, were informers and their agents; a tribe of miscreants who had grown up under the licence of former reigns.
These he frequently ordered to be scourged or beaten with sticks in the forum, and then, after he had obliged them to pass through the amphitheatre as a public spectacle, commanded them to be sold for slaves, or else banished them to some rocky islands.
And to discourage such practices for the future, amongst other things, he prohibited actions to be successively brought under different laws for the same cause, or the state of affairs of deceased persons to be inquired into after a certain number of years.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="9">
<p>Having declared that he accepted the office of Pontifex Maximus for the purpose of preserving his hands undefiled, he faithfully adhered to his promise.
For after that time he was neither directly nor indirectly concerned in the death of any person, though he sometimes was justly irritated.
He swore "that he would perish himself rather than prove the destruction of any man."
Two men of patrician rank being convicted of aspiring to the empire, he only advised them to desist, saying, "that the sovereign power was disposed of by fate," and promised them, that if there was any thing else
they desired of him, he would grant it. He also immediately sent messengers to the mother of one of them, who was at a great distance, and in deep anxiety about her son, to assure her of his safety.
Nay, he not only invited them to sup with him, but next day, at a show of gladiators, purposely placed them  close by him; and handed to them the arms of the combatants for their inspection.
It is said likewise, that having had their nativities cast, he assured them, " that a great calamity was impending on both of them, but from another hand, and not from his."
Though his brother was continually plotting against him, almost openly stirring up the armies to rebellion, and contriving to get away, yet he could not endure to put him to death, or to banish him from his presence; nor did he treat him with less respect than before.
But from his first accession to the empire, he constantly declared him his partner in it, and that he should be his successor; begging of him  sometimes in private, with tears in his eyes, "to return the affection he had for him."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="10">
<p>Amidst all these favourable circumstances, he was cut off by an untimely death, more to the loss of mankind than himself.
At the close of the public spectacles, he wept bitterly in the presence of the people, and then retired into the Sabine country,
<note anchored="yes">See VESPASIAN cc. i. and xxiv. The love of this emperor and his son Titus for the rural retirement of their paternal acres in the Sabine country, forms a striking contrast to the vicious attachment of such tyrants as Tiberius and Caligula for the luxurious scenes of Baiae, or the libidinous orgies of Capri.
</note>
rather melancholy, because a victim had made its escape while he was sacrificing, and loud thunder had been heard while the atmosphere was serene.
At the first resting-place on the road, he was seized with a fever, and being carried forward in a litter, they say that he drew back the curtains,
and looked up to heaven, complaining heavily, " that his life was taken from him, though he had done nothing to deserve it; for there was no action of his that he had occasion to repent of, but one."
What that was, he neither disclosed himself, nor is it easy for us to conjecture.
Some imagine that he alluded to the connection which he had formerly had with his brothers wife.
But Domitia solemnly denied it on oath; which she would never have done, had there been any truth in the report; nay, she would certainly have gloried in it, as she was forward enough to boast of all her scandalous intrigues.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="11">
<p>He died in the same villa where his father had died before him, upon the Ides of September [the i3th of September]; two years, two months, and twenty days after he had succeeded his father; and in the one-and-fortieth year of his age.
<note anchored="yes">A. U. C. 834, <date value="82">A. D. 82</date>.
</note>
As soon as the news of his death was published, all people mourned for him, as for the loss of some near relative.
The senate assembled in haste, before they could be summoned by proclamation, and locking the doors of their house at first, but afterwards opening them, they gave him such thanks, and heaped upon him such praises, now he was dead, as they never had done whilst he was alive and present amongst them.</p></div2>

<head>Remarks on Titus</head>
<p>TITUS FLAVIUS VESPASIAN, the younger, was the first prince who succeeded to the empire by hereditary right; and having constantly acted, after his return from Judaea, as colleague with his father in the administration, he seemed to be as well qualified by experience as he was by abilities, for conducting the affairs of the empire.
But with respect to his natural disposition, and moral behaviour, the expectations entertained by the public were not equally flattering.
He was immoderately addicted to luxury; he had betrayed a strong inclination
to cruelty; and he lived in the habitual practice of lewdness, no less unnatural than intemperate.
But, with a degree of virtuous resolution unexampled in history, he had no sooner taken into his hands the entire reins of government, than he renounced every vicious attachment.
Instead of wallowing in luxury, as before, he became a model of temperance; instead of cruelty, he displayed the strongest proofs of humanity and benevolence; ard in the room of lewdness, he exhibited a transition to the most unblem 'bed chastity and virtue.
In a word, so sudden and great a change was never known in the character of mortal; and he had the peculiar glory to receive the appellation of " the darling and delight of mankind."</p>
<p>Under a prince of such a disposition, the government of the empire could not but be conducted with the strictest regard to the public welfare.
The reform, which was begun in the late reign, he prosecuted with the most ardent application; and, had he lived for a longer time, it is probable that his authority and example would have produced the most beneficial effects upon the manners of the Romans.</p>
<p>During the reign of this emperor, in the seventy-ninth year of the Christian era, happened the first eruption of Mount Vesuvius, which has ever since been celebrated for its volcano.
Before this time, Vesuvius is spoken of, by ancient writers, as being covered with orchards and vineyards, and of which the middle was dry and barren.
The eruption was accompanied by an earthquake, which destroyed several cities of Campania, particularly Pompeii and Herculaneum; while the lava, pouring down the mountain in torrents, overwhelmed, in various directions, the adjacent plains.
The burning ashes were covered not only over the neighbouring country, but as far as the shores of Egypt, Libya, and even Syria.
Amongst those to whom  this dreadful eruption proved fatal, was Pliny, the celebrated naturalist, whose curiosity to examine the phenomenon led him so far within the verge of danger, that he could not afterwards escape.

<p>DOMITIAN was born upon the ninth of the calends of November<note anchored="yes">A. U. C. 804.</note>
[24th October], when his father was consul elect (being to enter upon his office the month following), in the sixth region of the city, at the Pomegranate,<note anchored="yes">A street. in the sixth region of Rome, so called, probably, from a remarkable specimen of this beautiful shrub which had made free growth on the spot.</note>
in the house which he afterwards converted into a temple of the Flavian family.
He is said to have spent the time of his youth in so much want and infamy, that he had not one piece of plate belonging to him; and it is well known, that Clodius Pollio, a man of pretorian rank, against whom there is a poem of Nero's extant, entitled Luscio, kept a note in his hand-writing, which he sometimes produced, in which Domitian made an assignment with him for bad purposes.
<note anchored="yes" place="inline">* * * Thomson omits material here * * *</note>
In the war with Vitellius, he fled into the capital with his uncle Sabinus, and a part of the troops they had in tie city.s But the enemy breaking in, and the temple being set on fire, he hid himself all night with the sacristan; and next morning, assuming the disguise of a worshipper of Isis, and mixing with the priests of that idle superstition, he got over the Tiber,
<note anchored="yes">VITELLIUS, c. XV. Tacitus (Hist. iii.) differs from Suetonius, saying that Domitian took
refuge with a client of his father's near the Velabrum.
Perhaps he found it more safe afterwards to cross the Tiber.
</note>
with only one attendant, to
the house of a woman who was the mother of one of his school-fellows, and lurked there so close, that, though the enemy, who were at his heels, searched very strictly after him, they could not discover him.
At last, after the success of his party, appearing in public, and being unanimously saluted by the title of Caesar, he assumed the office of praetor of the City, with consular authority, but in fact had nothing but the name; for the jurisdiction he transferred to his next colleague.
He used, however his absolute power so licentiously, that even then he plainly discovered what sort of prince he was likely to prove.
Not to go into details, after he had made free with the wives of many men of distinction, he took Domitia Longina from her husband, AElias Lamia, and married her; and in one day disposed of above twenty offices in the city and provinces; upon which Vespasian said several times, "he wondered he did not send him a successor too."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="2">
<p>He likewise designed an expedition into Gaul and Germany,
<note anchored="yes">One of Domitian's coins bears on the reverse a captive female and soldier, with GERMANIA DEVICTA.
</note>
without the least necessity for it, and contrary to the advice of all his father's friends; and this he did only with the view of equalling his brother in military achievements and glory.
But for this he was severely reprimanded, and that he might the more effectually be reminded of his age and position, was made to live with his father, and his litter had to follow his father's and brother's carriage, as often as they went abroad; but he attended them in their triumph for the conquest of Judaea,<note anchored="yes">VESPASIAN, C. xii; TITUS, c. vi.</note> mounted on a white horse.
Of the six consulships which he held, only one was ordinary; and that he obtained by
the cession and interest of his brother.
He greatly affected a modest behaviour, and, above all, a taste for poetry; insomuch, that he rehearsed his performances in public, though it was an art he had formerly little cultivated, and which he afterwards despised and abandoned.
Devoted, however, as he was at this time to poetical pursuits, yet when Vologesus, king of the Parthians, desired succours against the Alani, with one of Vespasian's sons to command them, he laboured hard to procure for himself that appointment.
But the scheme proving abortive, he endeavoured by presents and promises to engage other kings of the East to make a similar request.
After his father's death, he was for some time in doubt, whether he should not offer the soldiers a donative double to that of his brother, and made no scruple of saying frequently, " that he had been left his partner in the empire, but that his father's will had been fraudulently set aside."
From that time forward, he was constantly engaged in plots against his brother, both publicly and privately: until, falling dangerously ill, he ordered all his attendants to leave him, under pretence of his being dead, before he really was so; and, at his decease, paid him no other honour than that of enrolling him amongst the gods; and he often, both in speeches and edicts, carped at his memory by sneers and insinuations.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="3">
<p>In the beginning of his reign, he used to spend daily an hour by himself in private, during which time he did nothing else but catch flies, and stick them through the body with a sharp pin.
When some one therefore inquired, "whether any one was with the emperor," it was significantly answered by Vibius Crispus, "Not so much as a fly."
Soon after his advancement, his wife Domitia, by whom he had a son in his second consulship, and whom the year following he complimented with the
title of Augusta, being desperately in love with Paris, the actor, he put her away; but within a short time afterwards, being unable to bear the separation, he took her again, under pretence of complying with the people's importunity.
During some time, there was in his administration a strange mixture of virtue and vice, until at last his virtues themselves degenerated into vices; being, as we may reasonably conjecture concerning his character, inclined to avarice through want, and to cruelty through fear.</p></div2>

<p>He frequently entertained the people with most magnificent and costly shows, not only in the amphitheatre, but the circus; where, besides the usual races with chariots drawn by two or four horses a-breast, he exhibited the representation of an engagement between both horse and foot, and a sea-fight in the amphitheatre.
The people were also entertained with the chase of wild beasts and the combat of gladiators, even in the night-time, by torch-light.
Nor did men only fight in these spectacles, but women also.
He constantly attended at the games given by the quaestors, which had been disused for some time, but were revived by him; and upon those occasions, always gave the people the liberty"of demanding two pair of gladiators out of his own school, who appeared last in court uniforms.
Whenever he attended the shows of gladiators, there stood at his feet a little boy dressed in scarlet, with a prodigiously small head, with whom he used to talk very much, and sometimes seriously.
We are assured, that he was overheard asking him, "if he knew for what reason he had in the late appointment, made Metius Rufus governor of Egypt?" He presented the people with naval fights, performed by fleets almost as numerous as those usually employed in real engagements; making a vast lake near the Tiber,<note anchored="yes">Such excavations had been made by Julius and by Augustus [AUG. xliii.], and the seats for the spectators fitted up with timber in a rude way.

He likewise celebrated the Secular games,

</note>
reckoning not from the year in which they had been exhibited by Claudius, but from the time of Augustus's celebration of them.
In these, upon the day of the Circensian sports, in order to have a hundred races performed, he reduced each course from  seven rounds to five., He likewise instituted, in honour of Jupiter Capitolinus, a solemn contest in music to be performed every five years; besides horse-racing and gymnastic exercises, with more prizes than are at present allowed.
There was also a public performance in elocution, both Greek and Latin; and besides the musicians who sung to the harp, there were others who played concerted pieces or solos, without vocal accompaniment.
Young girls also ran races in the Stadium, at which he presided in his sandals, dressed in a purple robe.
made after the Grecian fashion, and wearing upon his head a golden crown bearing the effigies of Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva; with the flamen of Jupiter, and the college of priests sitting by his side in the same dress; excepting only that their crowns had also his own image on them.
He celebrated also upon the Alban mount every year the festival of Minerva, for whom he had appointed a college of priests, out of which were chosen by lot persons to preside as governors over the college; who were obliged to entertain the people with extraordinary chases of wildbeasts, and stage-plays, besides contests for prizes in oratory and poetry.
He thrice bestowed upon the people
largess of three hundred sesterces each man; and, at a public show of gladiators, a very plentiful feast.
At the festival of the Seven Hills,
<note anchored="yes">This feast was held in December. Plutarch informs us that it was instituted in commemoration of the seventh hill being included in the city bounds.
</note>
he distributed large hampers of provisions to the senatorian and equestrian orders, and small baskets to the common people, and encouraged them to eat by setting them the example.
The day after, he scattered among the people a variety of cakes and other delicacies to be scrambled for; and on the greater part of them falling amidst the seats of the crowd, he ordered five hundred tickets to be thrown into each range of benches belonging to the senatorian and equestrian orders.</p></div2>

<p>He rebuilt many noble edifices which had been destroyed by fire, and amongst them the Capitol, which had been burnt down a second time;
<note anchored="yes">The Capitol had been burnt, for the third time, in the great fire mentioned TITUS, c. viii. The first fire happened in the Marian war, after which it was rebuilt by Pompey, the second in the reign of Vitellius.

but all the inscriptions were in his own name, without the least mention of the original founders.
He likewise erected a new temple in the Capitol to Jupiter Custos, and a forum,<note anchored="yes">This forum, commenced by Domitian and completed by Nerva, adjoined the Roman forum and that of Augustus, mentioned in c. xxix. of his life. From its communicating with the two others, it was called Transitorium. Part of the wall which bounded it still remains, of a great height, and 144 paces long. It is composed of square masses of freestone, very large, and without any cement; and it is not carried in a straight line, but makes three or four angles, as if some buildings had interfered with its direction.</note> which is now called Nerva's, as also the temple of the Flavian family,<note anchored="yes">The residence of the Flavian family was converted into a temple.

<p>He undertook several expeditions, some from choice, and some from necessity.
That against the Catti<note anchored="yes">See VESPASIAN, c. xiv.</note>  was unprovoked, but that against the Sarmatians was necessary; an entire legion, with its commander, having been cut off by them.
He sent two expeditions against the Dacians; the first upon the defeat of Oppius Sabinus.
a man of consular rank; and the other, upon that of Cornelius Fuscus, prefect of the pretorian cohorts, to whom he had entrusted the conduct of that war.
After several battles with the Catti and Daci, he celebrated a double triumph.
But for his successes against the Sarmatians, he only bore in procession the laurel crown to Jupiter Capitolinus.
The civil war, begun by Lucius Antonius, governor of Upper Germany, he quelled, without being obliged to be personally present at it, with remarkable good fortune.
For, at the very moment of joining battle, the Rhine suddenly thawing.
the troops of the barbarians which were ready to join L. Antonius, were prevented from crossing the river.
Of this victory he had notice by some presages, before the messengers who brought the news of it arrived.
For upon the very day the battle was fought, a splendid eagle spread his wings round his statue at Rome, making most joyful cries.
And shortly after, a rumour became common, that Antonius was slain; nay, many positively affirmed, that they saw his head brought to the city.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="7">
<p>He made many innovations in common practices. He abolished the Sportula,<note anchored="yes">See NERO, c. xvi.</note>
and revived the old practice of regular suppers.
To the four former parties in the Circensian games, he added two new, who wore gold and scarlet.
He prohibited the players from acting in the theatre, but permitted them the practice of their art in private houses.
He forbad the castration of males; and reduced the price of the eunuchs who were still left in the hands of the dealers in slaves.
On the occasion of a great abundance of wine, accompanied by a scarcity of corn, supposing that the tillage of the ground was neglected for the sake of attending too much to the cultivation of vineyards, he published a proclamation forbidding the planting of any new vines in Italy, and ordered the vines in the provinces to be cut down, nowhere permitting more than one half of them to remain.<note anchored="yes">This absurd edict was speedily revoked. See afterwards c. xiv.
</note>
But he did not persist in the execution of this project.
Some of the greatest offices he conferred upon his freedmen and soldiers.
He forbad two legions to be quartered in the same camp, and more than a thousand sesterces to be deposited by any soldier with the standards; because it was thought that Lucius Antonius had been encouraged in his late project by the large sum deposited in the military chest by the two legions which he had in the same winterquarters.
He made an addition to the soldiers' pay, of three gold pieces a year.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="8">
<p>In the administration of justice he was diligent and assiduous; and frequently sat in the forum out of course, to cancel the judgments of the court of The One Hundred, which had been procured through favour, or interest.
He occasionally cautioned the judges of the court of recovery to beware of being too ready to admit
claims for freedom brought before them.
He set a mark of infamy upon judges who were convicted of taking bribes, as well as upon their assessors.
He likewise instigated the tribunes of the people to prosecute a corrupt aedile for extortion, and to desire the senate to appoint judges for his trial.
He likewise took such effectual care in punishing magistrates of the city, and governors of provinces, guilty of malversation, that they never were at any time more moderate or more just.
Most of these, since his reign, we have seen prosecuted for crimes of various kinds.
Having taken upon himself the reformation of the public manners, he restrained the licence of the populace in sitting promiscuously with the knights in the theatre.
Scandalous libels, published to defame persons of rank, of either sex, "he suppressed, and inflicted upon their authors a mark of infamy.
He expelled a man of quaestorian rank from the senate, for practicing mimicry and dancing.
He debarred infamous women the use of litters; as also the right of receiving legacies, or inheriting estates.
He struck out of the list of judges a Roman knight for taking again his wife whom he had divorced and prosecuted for adultery.
He condemned several men of the senatorian and equestrian orders, upon the Scantinian law.<note anchored="yes">This was an ancient law levelled against adultery and other pollutions, named from its author Caius Scatinius, a tribune of the people.
There was a Julian law, with the same object.
See AUGUSTUS, c. xxxiv.</note>
The lewdness of the Vestal Virgins, which had been overlooked by his father and brother, he punished severely, but in different ways; viz.
offences committed before his reign, with death, and those since its commencement, according to ancient custom.
For to the two sisters called Ocellatae, he gave liberty to choose the mode of death which they preferred, and banished their
paramours.
But Cornelia, the president of the Vestals, who had formerly been acquitted upon a charge of incontinence, being a long time after again prosecuted and condemned, he ordered to be buried alive; and her gallants to be whipped to death with rods in the Comitium; excepting only a man of praetorian rank, to whom, because he confessed the fact, while the case was dubious, and it was not established against him, though the witnesses had been put to the torture, he granted the favour of banishment.
And to preserve pure and undefiled the reverence due to the gods, he ordered the soldiers to demolish a tomb, which one of his freedmen had erected for his son out of the stones designed for the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, and to sink in the sea the bones and relics buried in it.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="9">
<p>Upon his first succeeding to power, he felt such an abhorrence for the shedding of blood, that, before his father's arrival in Rome, calling to mind the verse of Virgil,
<cit><quote lang="la"><l>Impia quam caesis gens est epulata juvencis</l></quote> <bibl n="Verg. G. 2.537">G. ii.537</bibl></cit>
<quote lang="en"><l>Ere impious man, restrain'd from blood in vain,</l>
<l>Began to feast on flesh of bullocks slain</l></quote>
he designed to have published a proclamation, "to forbid the sacrifice of oxen."
Before his accession to the imperial authority, and  during  some time afterwards, he scarcely ever gave the least grounds for being suspected of covetousness or avarice; but, on the contrary, he often afforded proofs, not only of his justice, but his liberality.
To all about him he was generous even to profusion, and recommended nothing more earnestly to them  than to avoid doing anything mean.
He would not accept the property left him by those who had children.
He also set aside a legacy bequeathed by the will of Ruscus Caepio, who had ordered "his heir to make a present yearly to each of the senators upon their first assembling."
He exonerated all those who had been under prosecution from the treasury for above five years before; and would not suffer suits to be renewed, unless it was done within a year, and on condition, that the prosecutor should be banished, if he could not make good his cause.
The secretaries of the quaestors having engaged in trade, according to custom, but contrary to the Clodian law,<note anchored="yes">See Livy, xxi. 63, and Cicero against Verres, v. i8.</note>
he pardoned them for what was past.
Such portions of land as had been left when it was divided amongst the veteran soldiers, he granted to the ancient possessors, as belonging to them  by prescription.
He put a stop to false prosecutions in the exchequer, by severely punishing the prosecutors; and this saying of his was much taken notice of: " that a prince who does not punish informers, encourages them."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="10">
<p>But he did not long persevere in this course of clemency and justice, although he sooner fell into cruelty than into avarice.
He put to death a scholar of Paris, the pantomimic,<note anchored="yes">See VESPASIAN, C. iii.
</note>
though a minor, and then sick, only because, both in person and the practice of his art, he resembled his master; as he did likewise Hermogenes of Tarsus for some oblique reflections in his History; crucifying, besides, the scribes who had copied the work.
One who was master of a band of gladiators, happening to say, "that a Thrax was a match for a Marmillo,<note anchored="yes">Cant names for gladiators.</note>
 but not so for the exhibitor of the games," he ordered him to be dragged from the benches into the arena, and exposed to
 the dogs, with this label upon him, "A Parmularian<note anchored="yes">The faction which favoured the "Thrax" party.</note>
guilty of talking impiously."
He put to death many senators, and amongst them several men of consular rank.
In this number were, Civica Cerealis, when he was proconsul in Africa, Salvidienus Orfitus, and Acilius Glabrio in exile, under the pretence of their planning to revolt against him.
The rest he punished upon very trivial occasions; as iElius Lamia for some jocular expressions, which were of old date, and perfectly harmless; because, upon his commending his voice after he had taken his wife from him,<note anchored="yes">DOMITIAN, C. i.</note> he replied, "Alas! I hold my tongue."
And when Titus advised him to take another wife, he answered him thus: 'What! have you a mind to marry?"  Salvius Cocceianus was condemned to death for keeping the birth-day of his uncle Otho, the emperor: Metius Pomposianus, because he was commonly reported to have an imperial nativity,<note anchored="yes">See VESPASIAN, C. xiv.</note> and to carry about with him a map of the world upon vellum, with the speeches of kings and generals extracted out of Titus Livius; and for giving his slaves the names of Mago and Annibal; Sallustius Lucullus, lieutenant in Britain, for suffering some lances of a new invention to be called " Lucullean;" and Junius Rusticus, for publishing a treatise in praise of Patus Thrasea and Helvidius Priscus, and calling them both "most upright men."
Upon this occasion; he likewise banished all the philosophers from the city and Italy He put to death the younger Helvidius, for writing a farce, in which, under the character of Paris and Oenone, he reflected upon his having divorced his wife; and also Flavius Sabinus, one of his cousins, because, upon his being chosen at the consular election to that office, the public crier had, by a blunder, proclaimed him to the
people not consul, but emperor.
Becoming still more savage after his success in the civil war, he employed the utmost industry to discover those of the adverse party who absconded: many of them he racked with a newinvented torture, inserting fire through their private parts; and from some he cut off their hands.
It is certain, that only two of any note were pardoned, a tribune who wore the narrow stripe, and a centurion; who, to clear themselves from the charge of being concerned in any rebellious project, proved themselves to have been incapable of exercising any influence either over the general or the soldiers.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="11">
<p>His cruelties were not only excessive, but subtle and unexpected.
The day before he crucified a collector of his rents, he sent for him into his bed-chamber, made him sit down upon the bed by him, and sent him away well pleased, and, so far as could be inferred from his treatment, in a state of perfect security; having vouchsafed him the favour of a plate of meat from his own table.
When he was on the point of condemning to death Aretinus Clemens, a man of consular rank, and one of his friends and emissaries, he retained him about his person in the same or greater favour than ever; until at last, as they were riding together in the same litter, upon seeing the man whd had informed against him, he said, " Are you willing that we should hear this base slave to morrow?" Contemptuously abusing the patience of men, he never pronounced a severe sentence without prefacing it with words which gave hopes of mercy; so that, at last, there was not a more certain token of a fatal conclusion, than a mild commencement.
He brought before the senate some persons accused of treason, declaring, "that he should prove that day how dear he was to the senate;" and so influenced them, that they condemned the accused
to be punished according to the ancient usage.
<note anchored="yes">This cruel punishment is described in NERO, C. xlix.
</note>
Then.
as if alarmed at the extreme severity of their punishment, to lessen the odiousness of the proceeding, he interposed in these words; for it is not foreign to the purpose to give them precisely as they were delivered: "Permit, me, Conscript Fathers, so far to prevail upon your affection for me, however extraordinary the request may seem, as to grant the condemned criminals the favour of dying in the manner they choose.
For by so doing, ye will spare your own eyes, and the world will understand that I interceded with the senate on their behalf."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="12">
<p>Having exhausted the exchequer by the expense of his buildings and public spectacles, with the augmentation of pay lately granted to the troops, he made an attempt at the reduction of the army, in order to lessen the military charges.
But reflecting, that he should, by this measure, expose himself to the insults of the barbarians, while it would not suffice to extricate him from his embarrassments, he had recourse to plundering his subjects by every mode of exaction.
The estates of the living and the dead were sequestered upon any accusation, by whomsoever preferred.
The unsupported allegation of any one person, relative to a word or action construed to affect the dignity of the emperor, was sufficient.
Inheritances, to which he had not the slightest pretension, were confiscated, if there was found so much as one person to say, he had heard from the deceased when living, " that he had made the emperor his heir."
Besides the exactions from others, the poll-tax on the Jews was levied with extreme rigour, both on those who lived after the manner of Jews in the city, without publicly professing themselves to be such,

He was not a little pleased too, at hearing the acclamations of the people in the amphitheatre on a day of festival, "All happiness to our lord and lady."
But when, during the celebration of the Capitoline trial of skill, the whole concourse of people entreated him with one voice to restore Palfurius Sura to his place in the senate, from which he had been long before expelled -he having then carried away the prize of eloquence from all the orators who had contended for it,-he did not vouchsafe to give them any answer, but only commanded silence to be proclaimed by the voice of the crier.
With equal arrogance, when he dictated the form of a letter to be used by his procurators, he began it thus: " Our lord and god commands so and so;" whence it became a rule that no one should style him otherwise either in writing or speaking.
He suffered no statues to be erected for him in the Capitol, unless they were of gold and silver, and of a certain weight.
He erected so many magnificent gates and arches, surmounted by representations of chariots drawn by four horses, and other triumphal ornaments, in different quarters of the city, that a wag inscribed on one of the arches the Greek word '<foreign lang="greek">a)/rkei</foreign><note anchored="yes">The pun turns on the similar sound of the Greek word for "enough" and the latin word for "an arch".</note>, " It is enough."'

He had long entertained a suspicion of the year and day when he should die, and even of the very hour and manner of his death: all which he had learned from the Chaldaeans, when he was a very young man.
His father once at supper laughed at him for refusing to eat some mushrooms, saying, that if he knew his fate, he would rather be afraid of the sword.
Being, therefore, in perpetual apprehension and anxiety, he was kernly alive to the slightest suspicions, insomuch that he is thought to have withdrawn the edict ordering the destruction of the vines, chiefly because the copies of it which were dispersed had the following lines written upon them:
<quote lang="greek"><l>kh)/n me fa/ghs e)pi/ r(i/zan o(/mws e)/ti karpoforh/sw,</l>
<l>o)/sson e)pispei=sai *kai/sari *quome/nw|.<note anchored="yes"> The lines, with a slight accommodation, are borrowed from the poet Evenus, Anthol. i. vl. i., who applies them to a goat, the great enemy of vineyards. Ovid, Fasti, i. 357, thus paraphrases them:

<quote lang="en"><l>Gnaw thou my root, yet shall my juice suffice</l>

<p>It was from the same principle of fear, that he refused a new  honour, devised  and  offered him  by the senate, though he was greedy of all such compliments.
It was this: "that as often as he held the consulship, Roman knights, chosen by lot, should walk before him, clad in the Trabea, with lances in their hands, amongst his lictors and apparitors."
As the time of the danger which he apprehended drew near, he became daily more and more disturbed in mind; insomuch that he lined the walls of the porticos in which he used to walk, with the stone called

almost before he was well out of his consulship.
By this violent act he very much hastened his own destruction.
During eight months together there was so much lightning at Rome, and such accounts of the phenomenon were brought from other parts, that at last he cried out, "Let him now strike whom he will."
The Capitol was struck by lightning, as well as the temple of the Flavian family, with the Palatine-house, and his own bed-chamber.
The tablet also, inscribed upon the base of his triumphal statue was carried away by the violence of the storm, and fell upon a neighbouring monument.
The tree which just before the advancement of Vespasian had been prostrated, and rose again,<note anchored="yes">See VESPASIAN c. v.</note> suddenly fell to the ground.
The goddess
Fortune of Praeneste, to whom it was his custom on new year's day to commend the empire for the ensuing year, and who had always given him a favourable reply, at last returned him a melancholy answer, not without mention of blood.
He dreamt that Minerva, whom he worshipped even to a superstitious excess, was withdrawing from her sanctuary, declaring she could protect him no longer, because she was disarmed by Jupiter.
Nothing, however, so much affected him as an answer given by Ascletario, the astrologer, and his subsequent fate.
This person had been informed against, and did not deny his having predicted some future events, of which, from the principles of his art, he confessed he had a foreknowledge.
Domitian asked him, what end he thought he should come to himself?  To which replying, "I shall in a short time be torn to pieces by dogs," he ordered him immediately to be slain, and, in order to demonstrate the vanity of his art, to be carefully buried.
But during the preparations for executing this order, it happened that the funeral-pile was blown down by a sudden storm, and the body, halfburnt, was torn to pieces by dogs; which being observed by Latinus, the comic actor, as he chanced to pass that way, he told it, amongst the other news of the day, to the emperor at supper.</p></div2>

And turning to those who were nearest him, he said, "To-morrow the moon in Aquarius will be bloody instead of watery, and an event will happen, which will be much talked of all the
world over."
About midnight, he was so terrified that he leaped out of bed.
That morning he tried and passed sentence on a soothsayer sent from Germany, who being consulted about the lightning that had lately happened, predicted from it a change of government.
The blood running down his face as he scratched an ulcerous tumour on his forehead, he said, " Would this were all that is to befall me!"  Then, upon his asking the time of the day, instead of five o'clock.
which was the hour he dreaded, they purposely told him it was six.
Overjoyed at this information, as if all danger were now passed, and hastening to the bath, Parthenius, his chamberlain, stopped him, by saying that there was a person come to wait upon him about a matter of great importance, which would admit of no delay.
Upon this, ordering all persons to withdraw, he retired into his chamber, and was there slain.</p></div2>

Clemens, and says that she was banished to Ponza, for having become

But Domitian, though wounded, making resistance, Clodianus, one of his guards, Maximus, a freedman of Parthenius's, Saturius, his principal chamberlain, with some gladiators, fell upon him, and stabbed him in seven places.
A boy who had the charge of the Lares in his bed-chamber, and was then in attendance as usual, gave these further particulars: that he was ordered by Domitian, upon receiving his first wound, to reach him a dagger which lay under his pillow, and call in his domestics; but that he found nothing at the head of the bed, excepting the hilt of a poniard, and that all the doors were fastened: that the emperor in the mean time got hold of Stephanus, and throwing him upon the ground, struggled a long time with him; one while endeavouring to wrench the dagger from him, another while, though his fingers were miserably mangled, to tear out his eyes.
He was slain upon the fourteenth of the calends of October [18th Sept.], in the forty-fifth year of his age, and the fifteenth of his reign.

His corpse was carried out upon a common bier by the public bearers, and buried by his nurse Phyllis, at his suburban villa on the Latin Way.
But she afterwards privfately conveyed his remains to the temple of the Flavian family,

<p>He was tall in stature, his face modest, and very ruddy; he had large eyes, but was dim-sighted; naturally graceful in his person, particularly in his youth, excepting only that his toes were bent somewhat inward, he was at last disfigured by baldness, corpulence, and the slenderness of his legs, which were reduced by a long illness.
He was so sensible how much the modesty of his countenance recommended him, that he once made this boast to
the senate, "Thus far you have approved both of my disposition and my countenance."
His baldness so much annoyed him, that he considered it an affront to himself, if any other person was reproached with it, either in jest or in earnest; though in a small tract he published, addressed to a friend, "concerning the preservation -of the hair," he uses for their mutual consolation the words following:
<quote lang="greek"><l>ou)k w(ra/as oi(=os ka)gw\ ka/los te me/gas te;</l></quote>
<quote lang="en"><l>Seest thou my graceful mien, my stately form?</l></quote>

<p>He so shrunk from undergoing fatigue, that he
scarcely ever walked through the city on foot. In his
expeditions and on a march, he seldom rode on horseback, but was generally carried in a litter. He had no
inclination for the exercise of arms, but was very expert
in the use of the bow. Many persons have seen him
often kill a hundred wild animals, of various kinds, at his
Alban retreat, and fix his arrows in their heads with such
dexterity, that he could, in two shots, plant them, like a
pair of horns, in each. He would sometimes direct his
arrows against the hand of a boy standing at a distance,
and expanded as a mark, with such precision, that they
all passed between the boy's fingers, without hurting him.</p></div2>

never gave himself the trouble of reading history or poetry, or of employing his pen even for his private purposes.
He perused nothing but the Commentaries and Acts of Tiberius Caesar.
His letters, speeches, and edicts, were all drawn up for him by others; though he could converse with elegance, and sometimes expressed himself in memorable sentiments.
"I could wish," said he once, "that I was but as handsome as Metius fancies himself to be."  And of the head of some one whose hair was partly reddish, and partly grey, he said "that it was snow sprinkled with mead."</p></div2>

His brother's daughter<note anchored="yes">Julia, the daughter of Titus.

was offered him in marriage when she was a virgin; but being at that time enamoured of Domitia, he obstinately refused her.
Yet not long afterwards, when she was given to another, he was ready enough to debauch her, and that even while Titus was living.
But after she had lost both her father and her husband, he loved her most passionately, and without disguise; insomuch that he was the occasion of her death, by obliging her to procure a miscarriage when she was with child by him.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="23">
<p>The people shewed little concern at his death, but the soldiers were roused by it to great indignation, and immediately endeavoured to have him ranked among the gods.
They were also ready to avenge his loss, if there had been any to take the lead.
However, they soon after effected it, by resolutely demanding the punishment of all those who had been concerned in his assassination.
On the other hand, the senate was so overjoyed, that they met in all haste, and in a full assembly reviled his memory in the most bitter terms; ordering ladders to be brought in, and his shields and images to be pulled down before their eyes, and dashed in pieces upon the floor of the senate-house; passing at the same time a decree to obliterate his titles every where, and abolish all memory of him.
A few months before he was slain, a raven on the Capitol uttered these words: "All
will be well."
Some person gave the following interpretation of this prodigy:
<quote lang="la"><l>Nuper Tarpeio, quae sedit culmine cornix.</l>

<quote lang="en"><l>Late croaked a raven from-Tarpeia's height,</l>
<l>"All is not yet, but shortly will be, right."</l></quote>
They say likewise that Domitian dreamed that a golden hump grew out of the back of his neck, which he considered as a certain sign of happy days for the empire after him.
Such  an auspicious change indeed  shortly afterwards took place, through the justice and moderation of the succeeding emperors.

<head><rs key="Cato">M. Porcius Cato</rs></head>
<div2 type="chapter" n="1">
<p>M. PORCIUS CATO, great-grandson of Cato the Censor, and surnamed Uticensis from Utica, the place of his death, was born <date value="-95"><date value="-95">B. C. 95</date></date>. In early childhood he lost both his parents, and was brought up in the house of his mother's brother, M. Livius Drusus.
While yet of tender age, he gave token of a certain sturdy independence.
The Italian socii were now seeking the right of Roman citizenship, and Q. Pompaedius Silo was endeavouring to enlist Drusus on their side.
Silo playfully asked Cato and his half brother, Q. Caepio, if they would not take his part with their uncle.
Caepio at once smiled, and said he would; but Cato frowned, and persisted in saying that he would not, though Silo pretended that he was going to throw him out of the window for his refusal.
Cato had not that quick apprehension and instinctive tact which make learning to some happily-organized children a constant, but unobtrusive growth.
He did not trust, and observe, and feel; but he acquired his knowledge by asking questions and receiving explanations.
That which he thus acquired slowly, he retained tenaciously. Throughout his life, the same want of flexibility and gradation was one of his obvious defects.</p>
<p>As a boy he took little interest in childish pursuits.
He rarely smiled, and he exhibited a firmness of purpose which was not to be cajoled by flattery nor daunted by violence.
Sarpedon, his tutor, took him occasionally, when he was in his fourteenth year, to pay his respects to Sulla.
The tortures and executions which sometimes were conducted  in Sulla's house made it resemble "the place of the damned."
On one of his visits, seeing the heads of several illustrious citizens carried forth, and hearing with indignation the suppressed groans of those who were present, he turned to his preceptor with the question: "Why does no one kill that tyrant?"  "Because," answered Sarpedon, " men fear him more strongly than they hate him."
"Why, then," subjoined Cato, "would you not let me have a sword, that I might put him to death, and restore my country to freedom?"</p>
<p>He addicted himself to political studies, and practised in solitude oratorical declamation.
As he hated luxury and was accustomed to self-denial, the precepts of the Porch found favor in his sight.
The virtue
he chiefly worshipped was a rigid justice, not only unmoved by favour,
but rejecting the corrective of equity and mercy. Differing widely in
disposition and natural gifts from his great ancestor, the Censor, he
yet looked to him as a model, adopted his principles, and imitated his
conduct. His constitution was naturally vigorous, and he endeavoured
to harden it still more by excessive toil. He married Atilia, the
daughter of Serranus, but was obliged to divorce her for adultery after
she had borne him two children.</p>
<p>He served his first campaign as a volunteer, <date value="-72"><date value="-72">B. C. 72</date></date>, under the consul
Gellius Publicola, in the servile war of Sparticus. The general offered
him military rewards, which he refused on the ground that he had done
nothing to deserve them. About the year <date value="-67">B. c. 67</date>, he was elected military tribune, and joined the army of the proprietor M. Rubrius, in
Macedonia. Here he was appointed to command a legion, and he won
the esteem and attachment of the soldiery by the force of reason, by
sharing all their labours, and by a strict attention to his duty. Cato
was now doomed to suffer a severe misfortune, and to put to the test all
the lessons of his philosophy. Servilius Caepio, on his way to Asia,
was taken ill at Aenus, a town of Thrace. Cato did not arrive in time
to close the eyes of his beloved brother. His grief was excessive. He
embraced the corpse with tears and cries, and spared no expense in the
splendour of the funeral.</p>
<p>He was now at an age to offer himself for the quaestorship, but he
determined not to put himself forward as a candidate until he was
master of the details of his duties. Armed with that knowledge, he
was elected to the quaestorship. The clerks of the treasury, accustomed
to the routine of official business, relied upon their own experience,
and the ignorance of ordinary quaestors, and thus were able to
rule their rulers.  Cato broke in upon this official monopoly,
and, in spite of the resistance which might have been expected
from such an interested swarm, he routed and exposed their misdeeds. In <date value="-63"><date value="-63">B. C. 63</date></date> he was looked upon by many as a suitable candidate for the tribuneship, but he declined to stand for that office. On
learning, however, that Metellus Nepos sought the office, he changed
his mind and became a candidate. He succeeded in gaining his own
election, but not in ousting Metellus. This was the famous year of
Cicero's consulship and the suppression of Catiline's conspiracy. Cato
supported the consul in proposing that the conspirators should suffer
death, and was the first who gave to Cicero the name of pater patriae.
Induced by the example of Sulla, several ambitious men were now aspiring to supreme power. The wealth of Crassus and the character and
position of Pompey were directed to this end. Caesar saw their object,
and had the address to baffle their schemes. He contrived, by entering
into a combination with Pompey and Crassus, to detach both from the
senatorial party. Cato wished to defeat this combination, but the
measures he resorted to were clumsy and injudicious.</p>
<p>After his divorce from Atilia, Cato had married Marcia, the daughter
of Philippus, and had three children by his second wife. About the
year <date value="-56">B. C. 56</date> happened that strange transaction by. which he ceded
Marcia to his friend, Q. Hortensius, with the consent of her father.
At the death of Hortensius, in the year 50, he took her back again.</p>
<p>Cato continued to oppose the triumvirs. In <date value="-55">B. C. 55</date> he actively
assisted L. Domitius Ahenobarbus in canvassing for the consulship
against Pompey and Crassus, who were elected. In the election riots
he was wounded and narrowly escaped with life. With no better success was he himself a candidate for the praetorship, in the same year, in
opposition to Vatinius. He would not submit to employ the bribery
which was necessary to obtain a majority. Again, in an unsuccessful
opposition to the Trebonian law conferring extraordinary powers upon
the triumvirs, we find him engaged in popular tumults and personal
conflict. At length, <date value="-54">B. C. 54</date>, he was made praetor, and this was the
highest office to which he attained. His exertions during his praetorship to put down the notorious bribery of the consular comitia disgusted
both the buyers and the sellers of votes. In <date value="-52">B. C. 52</date>, Pompey was
anxious to obtain the dictatorship; but Bibulus proposed that he
should be created sole consul, and in this proposition was supported by
Cato. In the following year, Cato himself, mistrusting Pompey, was a
candidate for the consulship; but he would not bribe, and his competitors, S. Sulpicius and M. Claudius Marcellus, who had the support of
Caesar and Pompey, were elected. On the announcement of the civil
war, <date value="-49">B. C. 49</date>, Cato supported those illegal proceedings which gave some
colour of right to the hostile preparations of Caesar. On the approach
of Caesar to the city, Cato took flight with the consuls to Campania,
and yielded himself up to unavailing grief.</p>
<p>The Senate entrusted Cato, as propraetor, with the defence of Sicily;
but on the landing of Curio with three of Caesar's legions, Cato, thinking resistance useless, took flight, and proceeded to join Pompey at
Dyrrachium. After Pompey's victory at Dyrrachium, Cato was left in
charge of the camp, and was thus saved from being present at the disastrous battle of Pharsalia. After this battle he proceeded to Africa,
where he hoped to find Pompey; but on his route he received intelligence from Cornelia of Pompey's assassination. In the spring of the
year <date value="-47">B. C. 47</date>, Cato marched his troops across the desert, and formed a
junction with Scipio Metellus, Attius Varus, and the Numidian Juba.
Cato resisted the counsel of Scipio to put Utica to the sword, and advised
him not to risk a decisive engagement; but Scipio disregarded his advice, and was utterly routed at Thapsus. All Africa now, with the
exception of Utica, submitted to Caesar.  Careless for his own safety,
Cato was anxious for the safety of his friends, advised them to flee,
accompanied them to the port, and composed the speech in which L.
Caesar interceded for them, but would not allow his own name to appear.
Bewildered and oppressed, he felt that the only way to preserve his
high personal character and unbending moral dignity, and to leave to
posterity a lofty Roman name, was to die. After spending the greater
part of the night in perusing Plato's Phaedo, he stabbed himself below
the breast and expired, <date value="-46">B. C. 46</date>, at the age of forty-nine.</p>
<p>There was deep grief in Utica on account of his death. The inhabitants buried him on the coast, and celebrated his funeral with much
pomp. Caesar had hastened his march in order to catch Cato; but,
arriving too late, he exclaimed, "Cato, I grudge thee thy death, since
thou hast grudged me the glory of sparing thy life." Cato soon became the subject of biography and panegyric. Shortly after his death
appeared Cicero's "Cato," which provoked Caesar's "Anticato," also
called "Anticatones," as it consisted of two books; but the accusations
of Caesar appear to have been wholly unfounded, and were not believed
by his contemporaries. In Lucan the character of Cato is a personification of godlike virtue.

<div1 type="life" n="pompey">
<head><rs key="Pompey">Cn. Pompeius Magnus</rs></head>
<div2 type="chapter" n="1">
<p>CNEIUS POMPEIUS, surnamed the Great (Magnus), was born <date value="-106">B. C. 106</date>.
As soon as he had assumed the manly gown, he entered the army and
served with distinction under his father. The beauty of his person,
the grace and elegance of his manners, and his winning eloquence
gained him at an early age the hearts of both citizens and soldiers.
After the death of his father, a charge was brought against the latter
that he had converted the public money to his own use; and Pompey,
as his heir, was obliged to answer the charge, which he did with so
much ability that Antisius, the pretor who had the case in charge, offered him his daughter in marriage. After the establishment of Cinna's
power at Rome, Pompey returned to Picenum, where he had influence
enough to raise an army of 16,000 or 17,000 men. With this force he
marched to join Sylla, with whose army, after repelling several attacks
by the adverse party, he effected a junction. Sylla gave him a flattering reception and saluted him (though he was only twenty-three years
of age) with the title of Imperator. Sylla also persuaded him to divorce the daughter of Antisius, in order to marry his (Sylla's) daughter-in-law, AEmilia. Three years after this (<date value="-80">B. C. 80</date>), Pompey re-took
Sicily from the partisans of Marius and also drove them from Africa in
the space of forty days. These successes so excited the jealousy of
Sylla that he commanded Pompey to dismiss his forces and return to
Rome; but, on his arrival at the capital, Sylla received him with a great
show of affection, and saluted him with the title of Magnus, which
Pompey thenceforth bore. When Pompey demanded a triumph, Sylla
declared that he should oppose it; but the former reminded him that
the people were more ready to worship the rising than the setting sun;
and he obtained the honor.</p>
<p>On the death of Sylla, Pompey was recognized as the chief of the
aristocratic party, and the heir of Sylla's influence with the soldiers.
After the troubles arising from the ambitious projects of the consul
Lepidus were settled, a period of quiet ensued when efforts were made
to oblige Pompey to dismiss his troops, but this demand was evaded
under various pretexts. At length the progress of Sertorius induced
the Senate to send Pompey, now thirty years of age, to the support of
Metullus; but Sertorius defeated both of his opponents, and this war
was only terminated by the death of that commander at the hands of
his own officers. When Pompey returned to Rome, the servile war was
raging. Crassus had already gained a decisive victory over Spartacus,
the leader of the rebels, but Pompey destroyed the remnant of the
servile force, and on that ground assumed the honor of a triumph in
<date value="-70">B. C. 70</date>. The same year he was chosen consul, with Crassus as colleague. At the expiration of this office in <date value="-68">B. C. 68</date>, the pirates of the
Mediterranean had become so powerful that they carried on a regular
warfare along a great extent of coast, being masters of 1000 galleys and
400 towns.  Pompey was, after much opposition, on constitutional
grounds, invested with extraordinary powers, by sea and land, for three
years, in order to check the ravages of the pirates. In four months he
cleared the seas of this scourge, and peopled a number of deserted coast
towns of Cilicia and other provinces with 20,000 pirates whom he had
taken prisoners. It was now proposed by the tribune Manlius, that
Pompey should be placed over Lucullus in the conduct of the war in
the East, while at the same time he retained the supreme command at
sea. Such an accumulation of power in the hands of one man was opposed as dangerous to the state by Hortensius and Catulus; but Cicero
favored the measure with all his eloquence. Caesar also lent it his support, and it was finally carried. Pompey arrived in Asia <date value="-67">B. C. 67</date>, and
proceeded to abolish all the regulations of Lucullus. On his return to
Italy after the war, he dismissed his troops on landing at Brundisium
and entered Rome as a private citizen. The whole city met him with
acclamations, and Rome had never before witnessed such a display as
that of his two days' triumph.</p>
<p>Pompey's plan was now, under the guise of a private citizen, to maintain the first place in the state; but Lucullus and Crassus were superior
to him in wealth; the republicans regarded him with suspicion; and
Caesar's star was beginning to rise. The latter, aspiring to the consulship, effected his purpose by reconciling Pompey and Crassus, and forming with them, the famous First Triumvirate. Caesar was chosen consul
<date value="-59">B. C. 59</date>, and by the marriage of his daughter Julia with Pompey
(AEmilia having died), seemed to have cemented his union with the
latter.  Pompey's studied deference to the Senate secured his influ
ence with that body; and he gained the good-will of the people by his
successful discharge of the duties of commissary of supplies in a time
of scarcity. In the meantime, however, he secretly fomented the disorders of the state, while his friends covertly suggested the need of a
dictator, pointing to him as best entitled to that place by his great services and his devotion to the public interests.
At this time Pompey gratified both Senate and people, by procuring, through the agency of the tribune Milo, the recall of Cicero (<date value="-57">B. C. 57</date>) from the banishment into which he had been driven by the tribune Clodius on a charge of having executed citizens (some of those implicated in the Catilinarian conspiracy) without the forms of law.
Pompey had connived at Cicero's banishment; but when Clodius began to assert himself as his equal, he changed his course.
The sequel was such as to hasten his advance to the dictatorship.
Clodius, as he was returning to Rome from the country, was murdered by Milo and some attendants.
The populace, struck with consternation, passed the night in the streets, and at daybreak brought in the body of Clodius, carrying it to the Senate-house, where the benches were torn up and converted into a funeral pile and the body burned.
Milo, irritated at the honor thus paid Clodius, returned to the city, and distributing money to a part of the multitude, addressed them from the tribunal, defending his act and denouncing Clodius.
While he was speaking, the rest of the tribunes and that part of the populace which had not been bribed, rushed into the forum armed.
Milo escaped, but a bloody and indiscriminate assault was made on the other citizens.
The tumult continued several days, during which anarchy prevailed, and then the Senate, in a state of terror, proposed to Pompey the dictatorship.
At Cato's suggestion, the title of Sole Consul was substituted for that of Dictator, as the latter had become odious since the tyranny of Sylla.
Pompey, accepting, proceeded to restore order and to pass popular acts.
He framed a law against bribery and corruption, and instituted an inquiry into the administration of all who had held magistracies from the time of his own first consulship.
As a result, several officials were fined or banished. With a show of moderation, Pompey declined to act as sole consul to the end of the term, but associated his father-in-law, Lucius Scipio, in the office, though, in fact, he continued to exercise the power.</p>
<p>Pompey and his adherents now felt the necessity of reducing the formidable power of Caesar, and it was especially desired that he should be separated from his military command.
Caesar knew that in returning to a private station he would be at the mercy of Pompey and his party, and he therefore resisted the decree of his recall, except on conditions that would secure him against danger.
Curio loudly protested against Caesar's being recalled, unless Pompey would also disband his legions and resign his provinces.
Pompey professed that he had received his command against his will, and that he would cheerfully lay it down.
Curio, however, contended that the promise was not to be taken for the
performance, and urged so forcibly the necessity either of both retaining
their commands, the one as a check upon the other, or of both alike resigning, that he brought the Senate over to his opinion. On a rumor
that Caesar had crossed the Alps and was on his march to Rome, the
Consul Marcellus ran to Pompey, and, presenting him with a sword,
said: "We order you to march against Caesar and fight for your
country." Curio fled to Caesar, and urged him to advance with his
forces upon Rome. But Caesar first sent letters to the Senate in which
he distinctly offered to resign his command provided Pompey would do
the same; otherwise he would not only retain it, but would come and
revenge the injuries offered to himself and to the country. This was
received as a declaration of war, and Lucius Domitius was appointed as
Caesar's successor, and ordered to march with 4,000 new-raised troops.
While Pompey was exerting himself in collecting 13,000 veterans from
Thessaly, and mercenaries from other foreign nations, Caesar, leaving
his commanders to concentrate and bring forward the rest of his army,
took the field with some cavalry and a division of 5,000 men. On
reaching the boundary of Gaul, he crossed the Rubicon, and entered
Italy with his troops, exclaiming, "The die is cast."</p>
<p>The Senate now
repented its rejection of Caesar's proposals, and Cicero moved that an
embassy be sent to him to treat for peace, but was overruled by the
consuls. Pompey had boasted that if need were, he could raise an army
by stamping with his foot; and Favonius now reminded him that "it
was high time for him to stamp." Domitius, sent to supersede Caesar,
was taken prisoner by the latter and honorably discharged, his troops
going over to Caesar. Pompey, with the consuls, and the greater part
of the Senate and the nobility crossed over into Greece. On entering
Rome, Caesar was, by the remnant of the Senate, created Dictator; but
he held the office only eleven days, exchanging it for that of consul,
and taking Servilius as his colleague. Having seized the treasury, and
secured Sicily and Sardinia, the granaries of Rome, he set out for Spain
where, in the hither province, he reduced, by cutting off their supplies,
the Pompeian army under Petreius and Afranius, whom he dismissed in
safety and allowed to join Pompey; and in the farther province he
compelled the surrender of Varro with his legion. Caesar himself experienced a reverse in Illyricum, where, his army suffering greatly for
want of food, he assaulted, near Dyrrachium, the entrenched camp of
Pompey, whose policy had been to decline a battle, and was repulsed
with the panic of his troops and the loss of many standards.</p>
<p>Caesar retreated into Thessaly, followed by Pompey. A general battle was
fought on the plains of Pharsalia. The army of Pompey was greatly
superior in numbers, consisting of 40,000 foot and 12,000 horse; while
that of Caesar did not exceed 30,000 foot and 1,000 horse. Pompey
was, however, out-generaled, his army thrown into total rout, his camp
pillaged, and himself obliged to fly, leaving the field with only his son
Sextus and a few followers of rank. He set sail for Mytilene, having
taken on board his wife Cornelia, and made for Egypt, intending to
claim the hospitality of the young King Ptolemy, to whom the Senate
had appointed him guardian. Ashe came near Mt. Cassius, the Egyptian
army was seen on the shore, and their fleet lying off at some distance,
when presently a boat was observed approaching the ship from the land.
The persons in the boat invited him to enter for the purpose of land-
ing; but, as he was stepping ashore he was stabbed in the sight of his
wife and son, and his head and ring were sent to Caesar, who, shedding
tears, turned away his face, and ordered the head to be burned with
perfumes, according to the Roman custom. The tears that were shed
for Pompey were not only those of domestic affliction; his fate called
forth a more general and honorable mourning. No man had ever
gained, at so early an age, the affections of his countrymen; none had
enjoyed them so largely, or preserved them so long with so little interruption, and at the distance of eighteen centuries, the feeling of his
contemporaries may be sanctioned by the sober judgment of history.
Pompey's many and rare virtues have been forgotten in the faults of the
Triumvirate, and in the weakness of temper which he displayed in the
conduct of the last campaign.

uncle, received their education under the direction of L. Crassus, a
man eminent as an orator, and for the public offices he had filled. As
soon as young Cicero had assumed the manly robe, he studied law under
Q. Mucius Scaevola, the augur; but he relieved his legal and philosophical studies by an intermixture of poetry. Among his boyish productions are the poems "Pontius Glaucus," "Marius," and "Limon."</p>
<p>Having, in <date value="-89">B. C. 89</date>, reached the age when he was called to the military
service of his country, he served his first campaign in the Marsic war
under Pompeius Strabo, father of the great Pompey. On the termination of this war in the following year, Cicero attended the lectures of
the Greek philosophers Philo and Apollonius Molo, who had been
driven from their homes by the arms of Mithridates. This prince,
taking advantage of the civil war, had attacked Rome, and having
overrun the province of Asia, was now master of nearly all Greece.
The Romans therefore concluded the war with their Italian allies with the
intention of opposing this formidable enemy. But unhappily, the dispute between old Marius and Sulla for the command of the war against
Mithridates, led to a series of civil commotions. Of Cicero's pursuits
during this time little more is known than that he wrote some rhetorical
works which his maturer judgment did not approve, one of these probably being "De Inventione."</p>
<p>In his twenty-sixth year (<date value="-81">B. C. 81</date>), when Sulla had extinguished all
the democratic elements of the constitution, Cicero first appeared as an
advocate. The following year his voice was heard in defence of Sextus
Roscius of Ameria, on a charge of parricide. As the case was connected with the late civil dissensions, it attracted much attention, and
the speaker made so favorable an impression that, to use his own words,
the public voice at once placed him among the first orators of Rome.
In <date value="-77">B. C. 77</date>, after two years spent in travel and study in Greece and
Syria, he returned to Rome, married Terentia, and applied himself
zealously to the legal profession. The most distinguished orators at
this time were Aurelius Cotta and Hortensius, but next to them Cicero
already ranked, and his services were constantly in demand for the
most important causes. In <date value="-76">B. C. 76</date>, the three first orators of Rome
were successful candidates for the several offices of consul, aedile and
quaestor, which they filled in the following year. The provinces of
quaestors being distributed by lot, the island of Sicily (or rather the
western part of it) fell to Cicero's share. Sicily was one of the granaries of Rome, and as there happened to be a peculiar scarcity in the
capital that year, Cicero displayed marked efficiency by his prompt and
abundant shipments; and his administration gave the highest satisfaction to all concerned. He came away from the island flattering himself
that all Rome was full of his praise; but on landing at Puteoli, he was
not a little mortified on being asked by the first friend he met, "How
long he had left Rome, and what news he brought from there?" This
led him to reflect that the people of Rome had dull ears, but quick
eyes; so that from this moment he resolved to stick close to the forum,
and to live perpetually in the view of his countrymen.</p>
<p>At this time Pompey was carrying on the war against Sertorius in
Spain; the consuls Lucullus and Cotta were opposing the King of
Pontus in Asia; while at home the alarming insurrection of slaves and
gladiators, led by Spartacus, threatened the very existence of the State.
But during these agitations Cicero applied himself closely to the forum,
though none of his speeches of this period are preserved save those
against Verres. The latter, during a three years' rule had made the
Sicilians feel in their worst form the evils which the Roman system of
provincial administration were so well calculated to produce. In his
strenuous endeavor to bring the criminal to punishment, Cicero visited
Sicily and spent fifty days in the collection of evidence to support the
indictment. On his return, in order to prevent a postponement of the
trial which would have defeated the prosecution, Cicero was obliged to
waive the privilege of employing twenty days in the accusation, and a
single speech of his, followed by an examination of witnesses and the
production of documentary evidence, made such a profound impression
against the accused that even his advocate Hortensius was abashed, and
Verres was sent into exile.</p>
<p>The aedileship of Cicero, <date value="-69">B. C. 69</date>, had little of that magnificence
which was so commonly displayed in this office, but it gave the Sicilians
an opportunity of showing their gratitude to the prosecutor of Verres,
by supplies for the public festivals. After an interval of two years
Cicero became praetor, and it fell to his lot to preside in the court of
extortion. His tenure of this office was marked by the conviction of
Licinius Macer, in opposition to the influence of his kinsman Crassus,
and by the still more remarkable event of the passage of the Manilian
law by which the command of the war against Mithridates was transferred
to Pompey whose claim Cicero supported in a speech which still remains.
On the expiration of his office, he declined the government of a province,
preferring to employ his best efforts at home towards the attainment of
the consular office. In <date value="-64">B. C. 64</date> his ambition was gratified by his election
to this high dignity, having triumphed over a number of illustrious and
influential competitors. On the kalends of January, immediately upon
his assuming the consular robes, he attacked a tribune, P. Servilius
Rullus, who had a few days before given notice of an agrarian law.
This speech showed that Cicero was already prepared to attach himself
to the aristocratic party, whereas up to this time his political life had
been of an opposite complexion; but before the people, to whom he
addressed two speeches on the agrarian laws, Cicero still wore the
popular mask. In the defence of Rabirius, who was charged with the
murder of the tribune Saturninus, thirty-three years before, he went so
far as to maintain the right of the Senate to place Rome in a state of
siege, or, in other words, to suspend all the laws which protect the lives
of the citizens; yet in the same speech he sought to curry favor by heaping the highest praises on their favorite Marius.</p>
<p>About this time occurred the desperate plot of Catiline, which was
defeated by the vigilance and energy of Cicero. Catiline, born about
<date value="-108">B. C. 108</date>, was descended from a patrician and impoverished family. He
had filled the offices of praetor and of governor of Africa, and he desired
in the year 68 to stand for the consulate, but was disqualified on
account of the accusations brought against him of maladministration in
his province. Disappointed in his political ambition, and burdened
with debts, he saw no hope for himself but in the chances of revolution,
and therefore conceived an infamous scheme of wholesale murder and
treason, in which were associated with him a number of congenial
spirits. The plot, however, was revealed to Cicero by the mistress of
one of the conspirators. On the night of November 6, <date value="-63">B. C. 63</date>, Catiline assembled his confederates, and explained to them his plan for
assassinating Cicero; for bringing up the Tuscan army (which had
been seduced from its allegiance) under Manlius, from the encampment
at Faesula; for setting fire to Rome, and putting to death the hostile
senators and citizens.  In the course of a few hours everything was
made known to Cicero. Accordingly, when the assassins came to his
house on pretense of a visit, they were immediately repulsed. On the
8th of November, Catiline audaciously appeared in the Senate, when
Cicero, who had received intelligence that the insurrection had already
broken out in Etruria, commenced the celebrated invective, beginning:
<quote lang="la">Quosque tandem abutere, Catilina, patientia nostra?</quote> etc. ("How long
now, Catiline, will you abuse our patience?") The scoundrel was
abashed, less by the keenness of Cicero's attack, than by the minute
knowledge he displayed of the conspiracy. His attempted reply was
drowned in execrations. He escaped from Rome at night. He and
Manlius were denounced as traitors, and an army was sent against
them.</p>
<p>The success of Cicero in crushing the Catilinarian conspiracy would
probably have earned for him the unmixed good will of the aristocratic
party, had he not offended them by the vanity and presumption which
that success engendered, and which were the more offensive to them in
one whose origin they despised. On the other hand, he had damaged
his reputation with the people by his evident change of principles, and
the precipitate execution of the conspirators without the form of a trial
was an offense against the laws of the country which the sanction of the
Senate could not justify. While the associates of Catiline were, for the
most part, prosecuted and banished, it pleased the party of the Senate
to screen P. Sulla, whose guilt was generally asserted. Hortensius and
Cicero were his advocates, and the support of the latter is reported to
have been bought by a loan of money which Cicero required for the
purchase of a house on the Palatine Hill.</p>
<p>The trial of C. Antonius, who was Cicero's colleague in the consulship, shows how far the zeal of the latter for pure administration had
declined. Being recalled from the province of Macedonia, over which
he had presided for two years, Antonius had to defend himself against
an impeachment for gross rapacity. This province had originally fallen
to the lot of Cicero, who took credit, on many occasions, for his disinterestedness in transferring the lucrative appointment to his colleague.
He omitted to state, however, that there was a secret agreement between
them by which Antonius bound himself to make a pecuniary return to
Cicero, and the extortion of which he had been guilty was, in part, owing
to this obligation. The very day on which Antonius was condemned
was marked by an event still more fatal to the peace of Cicero. His
enemy, Clodius, was adopted into a plebeian family, by means of which
he was elected to the tribunate, from which his patrician rank formerly
excluded him. One of the first acts of Clodius was the introduction of
a law providing that whoever took the life of a citizen, uncondemned
and without a trial, should be interdicted from fire and water. This
law was so evidently aimed at Cicero that, finding that Pompey would
not support him, he went into voluntary exile, towards the end of March,
<date value="-58">B. C. 58</date>. Shortly after his departure, a special law was passed forbidding his presence within four hundred miles of the capital. He found
an asylum in Thessalonica. During his exile, he so abandoned himself
to depression that his mind was supposed to be deranged. Meanwhile
his friends at Rome were exerting themselves on his behalf, and, at
last, on the 24th of May, <date value="-57">B. C. 57</date>, a decree in his favor passed the
Senate, and was confirmed on the 4th of August by the people at the
meeting of the Centuries. In the cities through which he passed on his
return, and at the capital, Cicero received the warmest greetings of the
people.</p>
<p>To Pompey, who had assisted in procuring his recall from banishment, Cicero early showed his gratitude by proposing that, in order to
secure a better supply of corn at Rome, Pompey should be invested
with absolute power over all the public stores and corn-rents of the
empire for five years.
The law was passed and Pompey named its proposer the first among his fifteen assistant commissioners, which appointment Cicero accepted with the condition that he should not be called away from Rome.
In the same year Cicero gratified both Pompey and Caesar by appearing as the advocate of L. Cornelius Balbus, a native of Gades, the legality of whose franchise was in question.
It is somewhat strange to find Cicero so closely allied as he was at this time with Caesar, on whom he had showered his abuse on almost every occasion.
The fact and the disgrace of it are acknowledged by himself in letters to his friend Atticus: "It is a bitter pill," he says, "and I have been long swallowing it; but farewell now to honor and patriotism."</p>
<p>Shortly after this he began his political treatise "De Republica," of which Angelo Maio, in <date value="1823">1823</date>, discovered a considerable portion in the Vatican library.
The greater part of <date value="-54">B. C. 54</date> was employed in his usual occupation of defending the accused.
Among others he defended Messius, one of Caesar's lieutenants; then Drusus, accused of undertaking a cause with the intention of betraying it, and after that, Vatinius.
His undertaking the case of Vatinius, who was an intimate ally of Caesai's, and who, on that account, had, on more than one occasion.
been the object of Cicero's abuse, at once surprised and offended the aristocratic party.
The compliment of an epic poem  addressed to Caesar was another proof of the change in his political views; but a still more decisive evidence is furnished by his conduct in relation to Gabinius, who, returning at this time from his government of Syria, was at once overwhelmed with prosecutions.
Cicero had not forgotten that Gabinius, as one of the consuls at the time of his exile, had supported his enemy, Clodius; and he had openly avowed his opinion of the crimes of Gabinius in Syria-crimes which included murder, peculation and treason; but he was willing to sacrifice both his public and his private feelings at the intercession of Pompey.</p>
<p>At the end of the year Cicero consented to be one of Pompey's lieutenants in Spain, and was preparing to set out, when he was induced to abandon the appointment on perceiving that such a step would probably offend Caesar, whose sole bond of sympathy with Pompey had just been broken by the death of his daughter Julia, Pompey's wife.
A vacancy in the college of augurs occurring at this time, Cicero was elected to that office, which, in addition to the dignity it conferred, gave him additional influence in his efforts to secure the election of his friend Milo to the consulate.
But the murder of Clodius, by one of Milo's gladiators, in the presence and at the command of his master, put an end to Milo's hopes of success.
The fury of the people at the
death of their favorite led to violent excesses, which were at last terminated by the appointment of Pompey as sole consul with the powers of a dictator.
Milo was brought to trial, and in spite of Cicero's eloquence was banished from Italy.</p>
<p>It appears to have been soon after the death of Clodius that Cicero wrote his treatise "On Laws" (De Legibus), three books of which are still extant.
But the civil and literary pursuits of Cicero were soon interrupted by demands for his services abroad.
Among the laws introduced by Pompey for checking the corruptions employed by candidates for office, was one which disqualified future consuls and praetors from holding any province until five years after the expiration of their magistracies.
But Pompey procured an exception for himself, getting the government of Spain and Africa continued to him for five years longer; while to gratify Caesar, Cicero, at Pompey's request, had a law brought forward by which Caesar's presence might be dispensed with in standing for the consulate in the following year.
Thus Cicero and Pompey were chiefly responsible for the very law which they afterwards declared unconstitutional, thereby bringing on their country the horrors of civil war.
As the magistrates of the time being were precluded from provincial government by Pompey's law, it was provided that for the next five years the senators of consular and praetorian rank who had not held foreign command should, upon the expiration of their terms, divide the vacant provinces among them by lot.
The government of Cilicia thus fell to Cicero's share.
He reluctantly left Rome about the 1st of May, and on reaching Ephesus he had a foretaste of the duties that he had to perform; for among the deputations that waited upon him, was one from the citizens of Salamis to lay before him their complaints against the extortion and cruelty of a Roman citizen named Scaptius, who had claimed from the city a large sum upon a bond, together with an accumulation of interest at forty-eight per cent.; and who had used the military to besiege the Senate of Salamis in their council-room, until five had died of starvation.
As Brutus had recommended the interests of Scaptius to Appius (who was his father-in-law), yo now he labored to secure for him the favor of Cicero; but the grossness of this extortion moved Cicero's indignation, and he resisted the claims of Scaptius, though Brutus at last confessed that the debt was really his own, and Scaptius only his agent in it. When Cicero refused to allow the usurious interest, Scaptius told him that though the principal was only 106 talents, the Salaminians, by mistake, believed it to be 200 talents, and suggested that Cicero might safely award the larger sum. Cicero assented to this, but was unable to effect the object, as
the Salaminians proved to be more precisely acquainted with the accounts than Scaptius supposed.</p>
<p>The military proceedings of Cicero were not important.
He attacked some of the mountain tribes of Amanus, took a number of prisoners, and was saluted by his soldiers as imperator.
He was also successful in the siege of a robber-fort called Pindenissus, for which his friends in Rome procured him thehonourofapublic thanksgiving.
On his return to Italy at the expiration of his administrative year, he found affairs at a serious crisis.
The Senate had just passed a decree that Caesar should dismiss his army.
The condition on which Caesar expressed his willingness to comply with this decree, being rejected by the Senate, the civil conflict was at once precipitated.
When Caesar had entered Italy with his army, and was moving rapidly on the capital, the consuls fled from Rome, accompanied by Cicero and the leaders of the aristocracy, in the hope of defending the southern part of the peninsula.
To Cicero was assigned the defence of the coast south of Formiae and the adjacent territory; but the rapid advance of Caesar caused him to disavow this military engagement, and to frame various excuses for not joining Pompey, and finally to find a pretext for opening a negotiation with Caesar.
When Pompey sailed from Brundisium, abandoning Italy to his opponent, Cicero found an opportunity for an interview with Caesar at Rome, in which he pledged himself to observe a strict neutrality.</p>
<p>After Caesar had departed for Spain, an account of some temporary success of the Senatorial forces under Afranius being magnified into a certain prospect of speedily destroying Caesar and his army, led many, including Cicero, to flee from Italy to the camp in Greece.
He was not present at the battle of Pharsalia, but received at Dyrrhachium the news of that decisive engagement, and refusing to join those who crossed over into Africa with the intention of still maintaining the war, he again committed himself to the mercy of the conqueror, and landed at Brundisium at the end of October, <date value="-48">B. C. 48</date>. After long suspense and much mortification, he at last received a kind letter from Caesar, who subsequently gave him a reception, which removed his fears and induced him to follow the conqueror to Rome.
He there shut himself up with his books, and entered into a close friendship with Varro,-a friendship which was cemented by the dedication of Cicero's "Academic Questions" to Varro, and of Varro's "Treatise on the Latin Language" to Cicero.
One of the fruits of this leisure was his dialogue on famous orators, called "Brntus."</p>
<p>He now parted with his wife, Terentia, with whom he had lived more than thirty years, and whatever were the causes or pretexts for this
separation, he exposed himself to no little suspicion by marrying almost immediately after a young ward, named Publilia, possessing much beauty and considerable property.
Amidst his domestic infelicities, Cicero may have found some consolation in the marked attention paid him by Caesar; but any gratification he derived from this source must have been diminished by the estrangement of his former friends through his intimacy with the Dictator.
At the end of <date value="-46">B. C. 46</date> he was painfully stricken by the death of his daughter, Tullia.
In this grief he drew little comfort from the condolence of his friends.
All the relief he found was in reading and writing, and it was at this time that he composed his treatise on " Consolation," which was much read by the early Christian fathers.
His grief was completed by the misery of his illassorted marriage which was dissolved after a union of less than a year.
Again taking refuge with his books, this period of his life was peculiarly rich in literary results.
" The Orator" completed his rhetorical works, forming a sort of supplement to " De Oratore " and " Brutus."
His philosophical writings of this period were "Hortensius"; the four books in favor of the academn  dedicated to Varro; " De Finibus "; the "Tusculan Disputations "; the " Nature of the Gods"; " Divination"; "Fate"; the beautiful treatise on "Old Age"; an essay on "Glory"; the "Topica"; and "De Officiis."
The publication of these works extended over the years <date value="-45">B. C. 45</date> and 44.</p>
<p>In the autumn of the former year, Caesar returned from Spain, and Cicero was induced to quit his retirement and come to Rome.
His intimacy with the Dictator seemed to be daily increasing when the Ides of March changed the whole face of affairs.
Cicero was present at the assassination in the Senate-house, where he had the pleasure, he tells us, of seeing the tyrant perish.
But as soon as the first stupor had passed away, public indignation drove the murderers from  Rome.
Cicero himself fled as far as Syracuse; but on hearing of a change of popular feeling, he returned to the capital, arriving on the 31st of August.
Two days later he delivered in the Senate the first of those orations which he called Philippics.
The violence of this harangue committed him with Antony, and he retired for security to one of his villas near Naples where he composed the second Philippic.
The latter, full of invective, well charged with falsehood, against the whole life of Antony is supposed to have been the chief cause of Cicero's death.
When Antony departed for Gaul, Cicero returned to Rome where he delivered twelve more of his Philippics, designed to inflame the people against Antony and his party.
But the prospects of Cicero and his friends were finally disappointed by the treachery of Octavianus and Lepidus
in joining forces with Antony, and dividing among them the whole power of the state.
The proscription which followed was levelled against the assassins, or the advocates and panegyrists of the deed.
Cicero had not only lauded the murderers of Csesar, but, when he found Antony in his way, he had repeatedly expressed his regret that the conspirators had not served up one more dish at the glorious feast of the Ides of March.
He fled from his lusculan villa to Astura, where he found a vessel, on which he at once embarked, but was compelled by the weather to land near Circeii.
The next day he again embarked and landed at Caieta, whence he proceeded to his Formian villa; but in the night he was overtaken by soldiers who slew him, and cut off his head and his hands and carried them to Rome, where Antony caused them to be exposed on the rostra of the forum.
Cicero's death occurred on the 7th of December, <date value="-43">B. C. 43</date>.</p>
<p>The character of Cicero is not difficult to estimate.
No one could follow in the footsteps of virtue with greater dignity than he when attended by the popular applause; but he was weak enough to yield to the depraved spirit of the times and to act according to his convictions only when they were not discordant with his interests.
Few men possessing such talents have been so  tterly-deid of anything approaching to heroism.
He was one of the greatest masters of rhetoric that ever lived.
His orations were the result of consummate art, combined with unwearied industry, and survive as memorials of a time when eloquence, far more than at present, was a power which bent the verdicts of judicial tribunals and influenced the decrees of the state.

<head><rs key="Hortensius">Q. Hortensius Hortalus</rs><rs key="Horrea of Hortensius"></rs></head>
<div2 type="chapter" n="1">
<p>QUINTUS HORTENSIUS, one of the most distinguished of the Roman orators, was born <date value="-114">B.C. 114</date> of an equestrian Roman family.
He began to plead at a very early age, and had already attained a great reputation in his profession when Cicero made his appearance in the forum.
From that time Cicero and Hortensius were considered as professional rivals, but they lived on friendly, and even intimate, terms with each other, as Cicero acknowledges in several of his writings.
At the beginning of his book " De Claris Oratoribus," Cicero pays an eloquent and ap. parently sincere tribute of praise to the memory of Hortensius, who was then lately dead.
He styles him his friend and adviser, who often assisted him in their common career, "being not, as many imagined,   ,8                 a rival or detractor of his fame, but a fellow-labourer in a glorious vocation" ; and yet in some of his letters Cicero had bitterly complained of the duplicity and ungenerous conduct of Hortensius towards him when he was obliged to quit Rome in the Clodian business.
Hortensius went through the regular career of public offices and honours; he was made in succession quaestor, sedile, praetor, and lastly consul, with Q. Csecilius Metellus Creticus, <date value="-69">B. C. 69</date>.</p>
<p>The character of Hortensius was rather fitted to conciliate than to command-to call forth regard rather than esteem.
He was not at all scrupulous about the means he took to gain verdicts; but in considering this, we must not forget the low state of Roman manners (not to speak of morals) at this period.
Personally he seems to stand above suspicion of corruption.
Yet his enormous wealth was not all well-gotten. Though he was honest as quaestor, though he would not accept a province to drain it of its riches, yet no doubt he shared the plunder of provinces, not immediately indeed, but in the shape of large fees and presents from the Dolabellas and other persons like Verres, whom he so often and so successfully defended.
He liked to live at Rome and at his villas; he loved an easy life and a fair fame, had little ambition, and therefore avoided all acts that might have made him amenable to prosecution.
The same easy temper, joined as it often is with a kind heart and generous disposition, won him many friends; and perhaps we may say that he had no enemies.
He lived to a good age, little disturbed by ill health, surrounded by all that wealth can give, alive to all his enjoyments, with as much of active occupation as he desired, without being disturbed by the political turbulence of his times.
He died, just at the time when civil war broke out, a complete specimen of an amiable Epicurean.</p>
<p>His eloquence was of the florid or (as it was termed) "Asiatic" style, fitter for hearing than for reading.
Yet he did write his speeches -- on occasions at least.
His voice was soft and musical; his memory so ready and retentive, that he is said to have been able to come out of a sale-room and repeat the auction list backward.</p>
<p>Of his luxurious habits many stories are told.
His house on the Palatine was that afterwards occupied by Augustus; but this was comparatively simple and modest.
In his villas no expense was spared. The most splendid of these was that near Laurentum   Here he laid up such a stock of wine that he left Io,ooo casks of Chian to his heir.
Here he had a park full of all sorts of animals; and it was customary, during his sumptuous dinners, for a slave, dressed like Orpheus, to issue forth from the woods with these creatures following the sound of his
cithara.
At Bauli he had immense fish ponds, into which the sea came. The fish were so tame that they would feed from his hand; none of them were molested, for he used to buy for his table at Puteoli, and he was so fond of them that he is said to have wept for the death of a favorite murena.
He was also very curious in trees, which he is said to have fed with wine.
In pictures also he must have spent large sums, at least he gave 144,000 sesterces for a single work from the hand of Cydias.
It is a characteristic trait, that he came forward from his retirement to oppose the sumptuary law of Pompey and Crassus, and spoke so eloquently and wittily as to procure its rejection.
He was the first person at Rome who brought peacocks to table.
He was not happy in his family.
By his first wife, the daughter of Catulus, he had one son. It was after the death of Lutatia that the curious transaction took place by which he bought or borrowed Marcia, the wife of Cato.
He is acquitted of sensual profligacy by Plutarch, though he wrote love songs not of the most chaste description.</p>
<p>He died <date value="-50">B. C. 50</date>, while Cicero was returning from his government of Cilicia, and Cicero considers it a continuation of the good fortune which had attended him through life, that he died just before the breaking out of civil war, and was thus spared the grief of seeing the fall of the republic.
The "Orations" of Hortensius, which are mentioned by Cicero and Quintilian, are lost, as well as his "Annals," and some erotic poems which he is said to have written.
</p></div2></div1>
<div1 type="life" n="antony">
<head><rs key="Antony">M. Antonius</rs></head>
<div2 type="chapter" n="1">
<p>MARC ANTONY, the son of M. Antonius Creticus and Julia, the sister of L. Julius Caesar, consul in <date value="-64">B. C. 64</date>, was born, in all probability, iu <date value="-83">B. C. 83</date>. His father died while he was still young, and he was brought up in the house of Cornelius Lentulus, who married his mother Julia, and who was subsequently put to death by Cicero, in 63, as one of Catiline's conspirators.
Antony indulged in his very youth in every kind of dissipation, and became distinguished by his lavish expenditure and extravagance; and, as he does not appear to have received a large fortune from his father, his affairs soon became deeply involved.
He was, however, released from his difficulties by his friend Curio, who was his companion in all his dissipation, and between whom and Antony there existed, if report be true, a most dishonourable connection.
The desire of revenging the execution of his step-father, Lentulus, led Antony to join Clodius in his opposition to Cicero and the aristocratical party.
But their friendship was not of long continuance; and Antony, pressed by his creditors, repaired to Greece in 58, and from thence to Syria, where he served under the proconsul A. Gabinius as commander of the cavalry.
He soon became distinguished as a brave and enterprising officer.
He took part in the campaigns against Aristobulus in Palestine (57, 56), and also in the restoration of Ptolemy Auletes to Egypt in 55. In the following year he went to Csesar in Gaul, whose favour and influence he acquired, and was in consequence, on his return to Rome t53), elected quaestor for the following year.
He was supported in his canvass for the qumstorship by Cicero, who became reconciled to him through the mediation of Csesar.. As quaestor (52), he returned to Gaul, and served under Caesar for the next two years.</p>
<p>Antony's energy and intrepidity pointed him out to Csesar as the most useful person to support his interests at Rome, where it was evident that the aristocratical party had made up their minds to crush Caesar, if it were possible.
Antony accordingly left Gaul, <date value="-50">B. C. 50</date>, and came to Rome.
Through the influence of Csesar, he was elected into the college of augurs, and was also chosen one of the tribunes of the plebs.
He entered on his office on the Ioth of December, and immediately commenced attacking the proceedings of Pompey and the aristocracy.
On the 1st of January in the following year (49), the Senate passed a decree depriving Csesar of his command.
Antony and his colleague Q. Cassius interposed their veto; but as the Senate set this at naught, and threatened the lives of the two tribunes, Antony and his colleague fled from Rome on the 7th of January, and took refuge with Caesar in Gaul.
Caesar now marched into Italy, and within a few weeks obtained complete possession of the peninsula.</p>
<p>Antony was one of his legates, and received in the same year the supreme command of Italy, when Caesar crossed into Spain to prosecute the war against the Pompeian party.
In the following year (48), he conducted reinforcements to Caesar in Greece, and was present at the battle of Pharsalia, where he commanded the left wing.
In 47, Caesar, who was then dictator, appointed Antony master of the horse; and, during the absence of the former in Africa, he was again left in the command of Italy.
The quiet state of Italy gave Antony an opportunity of indulging his natural love of pleasure.
Cicero, in his second Philippic, has given a minute account of the flagrant debaucheries and licentiousness of which Antony was guilty at this time, both in Rome and the various towns of Italy; and it is pretty certain that most of these accounts are substantially true, though they are no doubt exaggerated by the orator.
It was during this time that Antony divorced his wife Antonia (he had been previously married to Fadia), and lived with an actress named Cytheris, with whom he appeared in public.</p>
<p>About the same time, a circumstance occurred which produced a coolness between Csesar and Antony.
Antony had purchased a great part of Pompey's property, when it was confiscated, under the idea that the money would never be asked for.
But Caesar insisted that it should be paid, and Antony raised the sum with difficulty.
It was perhaps owing to this circumstance that Antony did not accompany Caesar either to Africa or Spain in 46. During this year he married Fulvia, the widow of Clodius.
In the next year all trace of disagreement between Caesar and Antony disappears; he went to Narbo in Gaul to meet Caesar on his return from Spain, and shortly afterward offered him the diadem at the festival of the Lupercalia.
In <date value="-44">B. C. 44</date> he was consul with Caesar, and during the time that Caesar was murdered (i5th of March), was kept engaged in conversation by some of the conspirators outside the Senate-house.
The conspirators had wished to engage Antony as an accomplice, and he was sounded on the point the year before by Trebonius, while he was in Gaul; but the proposition was rejected with indignation.
Antony had now a difficult part to play. The murder of Caesar had paralyzed his friends and the people, and for a time placed the power of the state in the hands of the conspirators.
Antony therefore thought it more prudent to come to terms with the Senate; but meantime he obtained from Calpurnia the papers and private property of Caesar; and by his speech over the body of Caesar and the reading of his will, he so roused the feelings of the people against the murderers, that the latter were obliged to withdraw from the popular wrath.
Antony, however, seems not to have considered himself strong enough yet to break with the Senate entirely; he accordingly effected a reconciliation with them, and induced them to accept a number of laws, which he alleged were found among Caesar's paperst Antony was now the most powerful man in the state, and seemed likely to obtain the same position that Caesar had occupied.
But a new and unexpected rival appeared in young Octavianus, the adopted son and great-nephew of the Dictator, who came from Apollonia to Rome, as. sumed the name of Caesar, and managed to secure equally the goodwill of the Senate and of his uncle's veteran troops.
A struggle now ensued between Antony and Caesar.
The former went to Brindisium, to take the command of the legions which had come from Macedonia; the latter collected an army in Campania.
Two of Antony's legions shortly afterwards deserted to Caesar, and Antony, towards the end of
November, proceeded to Cisalpine Gaul, which had been previously granted him by the Senate, and laid siege to Mutina, into which Dec. Brutus had thrown himself. At Rome, meantime, Antony was declared a public enemy, and the conduct of the war against him committed to Caesar and the two consuls, C. Vibius Pansa and A. Hirtius, at the beginning of the next year, <date value="-43">B. C. 43</date>. Several battles were fought with various success, till at length, in the battle of Mutina (about the 27th of April, 43), Antony was completely defeated, and obliged to cross the Alps. Both the consuls, however, had fallen, and the command now devolved upon Dec. Brutus. In Gaul, Antony was joined by Lepidus with a powerful army, and was soon in a condition to prosecute the war with greater vigour than ever. Meantime, Caesar, who had been slighted by the Senate, and who had never heartily espoused its cause, became reconciled to Antony, through the mediation of Lepidus, and thus the celebrated triumvirate was formed in the autumn of this year (43). The reconciliation was made on the condition that the government of the state should be vested in Antony, Casar, and Lepidus, who were to take the title of <foreign lang="la">Triumviri Reipublicae Constituendae</foreign> for the next five years; and that Antony should receive Gaul as his province; Lepidus, Spain; and Caesar, Africa, Sardinia, and Sicily. The mutual friends of each were proscribed, and in the executions that followed, Cicero fell a victim to the revenge of Antony-an act of cruelty, for which even the plea of necessity could not be urged.</p>
<p>The war against Brutus and Cassius, who commanded the Senatorial army, was entrusted to Caesar and Antony, and was decided by the battle of Philippi (42), which was mainly gained by the valour and military talents of Antony. Caesar returned to Italy, and Antony, after remaining some time in Greece, crossed over into Asia to collect the money which he had promised to the soldiers. At Tarsus, in Cilicia, he saw the fascinating Cleopatra, whose influence so fatally affected his fortunes. He had summoned her to answer some accusations brought against her of assisting Cassius in the late war; and the Queen, in obedience to the command, appeared in her gorgeous barge upon the Cydnus attired as the goddess Venus. Antony was led captive to Alexandria where he lost sight of all that was going on in the world around him. But he was roused from his inactivity by the Parthian invasion of Syria, <date value="-40">B. C. 40</date>, and was at the same time summoned to support his brother Lucius and his wife Fulvia, who were engaged in a war with Caesar. But before Antony could reach Italy, Caesar had obtained possession of Perusia, in which Lucius had taken refuge; and the death of Fulvia in the same year removed the chief cause of the war, and led
to a reconciliation between Caesar and Antony.
To cement their union, Antony married Caesar's sister Octavia.
A new division of the Roman world was made, in which Antony received as his share all the provinces east of the Adriatic.</p>
<p>In the following year, <date value="-39">B. C. 39</date>, the Triumvirs concluded a peace with Sext.
Pompey, and Antony afterwards went to his provinces in the East. He entrusted the war against the Parthians to Ventidius, who gained a complete victory over them both in this and the following year.
Sosius, another of his generals, conquered Antigonus, who claimed the throne of Judaea in opposition to Herod, and took Jerusalem.
In <date value="-37">B. C. 37</date>, Antony crossed over to Italy, and a rupture, which had nearly taken place between him and Caesar, was averted by the mediation of Octavia.
The triumvirate, which had terminated on the 3ist of December, 38, was now renewed for five years, which were to be reckoned from the day on which the former had ceased.
After concluding this arrangement, Antony returned to the East.
He shortly afterwards sent Octavia back to her brother, and surrendered himself entirely to the charms of Cleopatra, on whom he conferred Ccele-Syria, Phoenicia, and other provinces.
From this time forward, Cleopatra appears as Antony's evil genius.
He had collected a large army to invade the Parthian empire; but, unable to tear himself away from Cleopatra, he delayed his march till late in the year.
The expedition was a failure; he lost a great number of his troops, and returned to Syria covered with disgrace (B. C.
on both sides, and it was not till September in the next year (3I) that the contest was decided in the sea fight off Actium, in which Antony's fleet was completely defeated.
His land forces surrendered to Caesar, and he himself and Cleopatra, who had been present at the battle, fled to Alexandria.
In the following year (30), Caesar appeared before Alexandria.
Antony's fleet and cavalry deserted to the conqueror; his infantry was defeated, and upon a false report that Cleopatra had put an end to her life, he killed himself by falling on his sword.
The death of Cleopatra soon followed, and Caesar thus became the undisputed master of the Roman world.

<div1 type="life" n="brutus">
<head><rs key="Brutus">M. Junius Brutus</rs></head>
<div2 type="chapter" n="1">
<p>MARCUS JUNIUS BRUTUS, the son of M. Junius Brutus, was born in the autumn of <date value="-85">B. C. 85</date>. He was subsequently adopted by his uncle, Q. Servilius Caepio, and hence he is sometimes called Caepio, or Q. Caepio Brutus, especially in public documents, on coins and inscriptions.
He lost his father at the early age of eight years, but his mother, Servilia, assisted by her two brothers, continued to conduct his education with the utmost care, and he acquired an extraordinary love for learning, which he never lost in after life.
M Porcius Cato became his great political model, though in his moral conduct he did not follow his example.
In 59, when J. Caesar was consul, and had to silence some young and vehement republicans, L. Vettius, on the instigation of the tribune P. Vatinius, denounced Brutus as an accomplice in a conspiracy against Pompey's life; but as it was well known that Brutus was perfectly innocent, Caesar put a stop to the prosecution.
When it was necessary, in 58, to remove from Rome some of the leading republicans, Cato was sent to Cyprus, and Brutus accompanied him.
After his return to Rome, Brutus seems, for some years, to have taken no part in public proceedings, and not to have attached himself to any party.
In
becoming the successor of Appius Claudius in Cilicia, brought about a sort of connection between Cicero and Brutus, though each disliked the sentiments of the other.
Cicero, when in Cilicia, took care that the money which Brutus had lent was repaid him, but at the same time endeavoured to prevent his transgressing the laws of usury, at which Brutus, who did not receive as high a percentage as he had expected, appears to have been greatly offended.
In 50, Brutus defended Appius Claudius, against whom two serious charges were brought, and succeeded in getting him acquitted.</p>
<p>When the civil war broke out in <date value="-49">B. C. 49</date>, between Caesar and Pompey, it was believed that Brutus would join the party of Caesar; but Brutus, who saw in Pompey the champion of the aristocracy, suppressed his personal feelings towards the murderer of his father, and followed the example of Cato, who declared for Pompey.
Brutus, however, did not accompany Cato, but went with P. Sextius to Cilicia, probably to arrange matters with his debtors in Asia, and to make preparations for the war.
In 48, he distinguished himself in the engagements in the neighbourhood of Dyrrhachium, and Pompey treated him with great distinction.
In the battle of Pharsalia, Caesar gave orders not to kill Brutus, probably for the sake of Servilia, who implored Caesar to spare him.
After the battle, Brutus escaped to Larissa, but did not follow Pompey any further.
Here he wrote a letter to Caesar, soliciting his pardon, which was generously granted by the conqueror, who even invited Brutus to come to him.
Brutus obeyed, and, if we may believe Plutarch.
he informed Caesar of Pompey's flight to Egypt. As Caesar did not require Brutus to fight against his former friends, he withdrew from the war, and spent his time either in Greece or at Rome in his favourite literary pursuits.
He did not join Caesar again till the autumn of 47, at Nicaea in Bithynia, on which occasion he endeavoured to interfere with the Conqueror on behalf of a friend of Deiotarus, but Caesar refused to comply with the request.
In the year following Brutus was made governor of Cisalpine Gaul, though he had been neither praetor nor consul; and he continued to serve the dictator Caesar, although the latter was making war against Brutus's own relatives in Africa.
The provincials in Cisalpine Gaul were delighted with the mild treatment and justice of Brutus, whom they honoured with public monuments: Caesar, too, afterwards testified his satisfaction with his administration.
As his province was far from the scene of war, Brutus, as usual, devoted his time to study.
At this time, Cicero made him one of the speakers in the treatise which bears the name of Brutus, and in 46 he dedicated to him his "Orator."
In 45, Brutus was succeeded in his province by
C. Vibius Pansa, but did not go to Rome immediately.
Before his return, he published his eulogy on Cato, in which Cicero found sentiments that hurt his vanity, as his suppression of the conspiracy of Catiline was not spoken of in the terms he would have liked.
Accordingly, upon the arrival of Brutus at one of his country seats near Rome, a certain degree of coldness and want of confidence existed between the two, although they wrote letters to each other, and Cicero, on the advice of Atticus, even dedicated to him his work De Finibus.
About this time, Brutus divorced Claudia, apparently for no other reason than that he wished to marry Porcia, the daughter of Cato.
After the close of Casar's war in Spain, Brutus went from Rome to meet him, and, in the beginning of August, returned to the city with him.</p>
<p>In 44, Brutus was prator, and C. Cassius, who had been disappointed in his hope of obtaining the pratorship, was as much enraged against Brutus as against the Dictator.
Casar promised Brutus the province of Macedonia, and also held out to him hopes of the consulship.
Up to this time Brutus had borne Caesar's dictatorship without expressing the least displeasure; he had served the Dictator and paid homage to him, nor had he thought it contrary to his republican principles to accept favours and offices from him.
His change of mind which took place at this time was not the result of his reflections or principles, but of the influence which Cassius exercised over him.
He was persuaded by Cassius to join the conspirators who murdered Casar on the Isth of March, 44. After the deed was perpetrated, he went to the forum to address the people, but found no favour.
The Senate, indeed, pardoned the murderers, but this was only a farce played by M. Antony to obtain their sanction of the Julian laws.
The murderers then assembled the people on the capitol, and Brutus in his speech promised that they should receive all that Casar had destined for them.
All parties wererapparently reconciled.
But the arrangements which Antony made for the funeral of Casar, and in consequence of which the people made an assault upon the houses of the conspirators, showed them clearly the intentions of Antony.
Brutus withdrew into the country, and during his stay there he gave, in the month of July, most splendid Ludi Apollinares, hoping thereby to turn the disposition of the people in his favour.
But in this he was disappointed, and as Antony assumed a threatening position, he sailed in September to Athens, with the intention of taking possession of the province of Macedonia, which Casar had assigned him, and of repelling force by force.
After staying at Athens a short time in the company of philosophers, and several young Romans who attached themselves to his cause, and after receiving a very large sum
of money from the quaestor, M. Appuleius, who brought it from Asia, Brutus intended to proceed to Macedonia.
But the Senate had now assigned this province to Antony, who, however, towards the end of the year, transferred it to his brother, the praetor, C. Antonius.
Before, however, the latter arrived, Brutus, who had been joined by the scattered troops of Pompey, marched into Macedonia, where he was received by Q. Hortensius, the son of the orator, as his legitimate successor.
Brutus found an abundance of arms, and the troops stationed in Illyricum, as well as several other legions, joined him.
C. Antonius, who also arrived in the meantime, was unable to advance beyond the coast of Illyricum, and at the beginning of 43 was besieged in Apollonia, and compelled to surrender.Brutus disregarded all the decrees of the Senate, and resolved to act for himself.
While Octavianus in the month of August, 43, obtained the condemnation of Caesar's murderers, Brutus was engaged m a war against some Thracian tribes to procure money for himself and booty for his soldiers.
About this time he assumed the title imperator, which, together with his portrait, appears on many of his coins.
The things which were going on meantime in Italy seemed to affect neither Brutus nor Cassius; but after the triumvirate was established, Brutus began to prepare for war.
Instead, however, of endeavouring to prevent the enemy from landing on the coast of the Ionian sea, Brutus and Cassius separated their forces and ravaged Rhodes and Lycia.
Loaded with booty, Brutus and Cassius met again at Sardis in the beginning of 42, but it was only the fear of the triumvirs that prevented them from falling out with each other.
Their carelessness was indeed so great that only a small fleet was sent to the Ionian sea under the command of Statius Murcus.</p>
<p>When Brutus and Cassius were about to leave Asia for their Macedonian campaign, it is said that an apparition admonished Brutus of his approaching fate.
Brutus was of a spare habit, abstemious in diet and in sleep.
One night, when he was overcome by watching, and was reading alone in his tent by a dim light at a late hour, while the whole army around him lay wrapped in sleep and silence, he thought he perceived something enter his tent, and saw "a horrible, and monstrous spectre standing silently by his side.
'Who art thou?' said he, boldly;
art thou God or man, and what is thy business with me ?' The spectre answered, ' I am thy evil genius, Brutus: thou wilt see me at Philippi I' To which he calmly replied, 'I'll meet thee there.'  When the apparition was gone he called his servants, who told him that they had neither heard any noise nor seen any vision." On the night before the second battle, " they say," continues Plutarch, " that the spectre
again appeared and assumed its former figure, but vanished without speaking."
In the autumn of <date value="-42">B. C. 42</date> the battle of Philippi was fought. In the first engagement Brutus conquered the army of Octavianus, while Cassius was defeated by Antony.
But in a second battle, about twenty days later, Brutus was defeated and fell upon his own sword.</p>
<p>From his first visit to Asia, Brutus appears as a man of considerable wealth, and he afterwards increased it by lending money upon interest.
He possessed an extraordinary memory and a still more extraordinary imagination, which led him into superstitions differing only from those of the multitude by a strange admixture of philosophy.
He was deficient in knowledge of mankind and the world, whence he was never able to foresee the course of things, and was ever surprised at the results.
Hence also his want of independent judgment.
The quantity of his varied knowledge, which he had acquired by extensive reading and his intercourse with philosophers, was beyond his control, and was rather an encumbrance to him than any thing else.
Nothing had such charms for him as study, which he prosecuted by day and night, at home and abroad.
He made abridgements of the historical works of C. Fanius and Caelius Antipater, and on the eve of the battle of Pharsalia he is said to have been engaged in making an abridgement of Polybius.
He also wrote several philosophical treatises, among which we have mention of those On Duties, On Patience, and On Virtue.
The best of his literary productions, however, appear to have been his orations, though they are censured as having been too dry and serious, and deficient in animation.
Nothing would enable us so much to form a clear notion of his character as his letters, but we unfortunately possess only a few (among those of Cicero), the authenticity of which is acknowledged, and a few passages of others quoted by Plutarch.

<p>PORCIA, the wife of Brutus, and daughter of Cato, inherited her father's republican principles, and likewise his courage and firmness of will.
She induced her husband on the night before the igth of March to disclose to her the conspiracy against Caesar's life, and she is reported to have wounded herself in the thigh in order to show that she had a courageous soul and could be trusted with the secret.
At the same time her affection for her husband was stronger than her stoicism, and on the morning of the Isth, her anxiety for his safety was so great that she fainted away, and word was brought to Brutus in the Senate-house that his wife was dying.
She parted from Brutus at Velia in Lucania in the course of the same year, when he embarked for Greece.
She then returned to Rome, where she continued to live unmolested by the trium
virs.
But after she learned the loss of the battle of Philippi, and the death of Brutus, she resolved not to survive the ruin of her party and the death of her husband, and accordingly put an end to her own life.
The common tale was, that her friends, suspecting her design, had taken all weapons out of her way, and that she therefore destroyed herself by swallowing live coals.
The real fact may have been that she suffocated herself by the vapour of a charcoal fire, which we know was a frequent means of self-destruction among the Romans.

<div1 type="life" n="varro">
<head><rs key="Varro">M. Terentius Varro</rs></head>
<div2 type="chapter" n="1">
<p>MARCUS TERENTIUS VARRO was born at Rome in the year <date value="-116">B. C. 116</date>, and descended from an ancient senatorial family.
He was instructed by L. Aelius, and afterwards by Antiochus, an Academic philosopher.
The whole of his early life must have been spent in the acquisition of that prodigious learning which he afterwards displayed in his works.
In <date value="-67">B. C. 67</date> we find him at the head of a part of the fleet of Pompey the Great in his war against the pirates.
During the civil war between Caesar and Pompey, Varro steadily adhered to Pompey, and was appointed one of his generals in Spain.
When his colleagues had been compelled to surrender, and Caesar marched westward, Varro also surrendered in the neighborhood of Corduba, and, after being set at liberty, he went to Pompey at Dyrrhacbium, where he was staying at the time of the battle of Pharsalia.
During the absence of Caesar in Egypt, <date value="-47">B. C. 47</date>, Antony destroyed Varro's villa near Casinum, where a great part of his property was lost.
After the defeat of Pompey, Varro withdrew altogether from public life, and returned to Italy; and when Caesar came to Rome Varro became reconciled to him, and was intrusted by him with the purchasing of the books for, and the whole management of, the Greek and Latin libraries which were then established at Rome.
He now enjoyed for a few years perfect peace, and gave himself up entirely to study and the composition of several works.
But new troubles arose.
After the murder of Caesar, in <date value="-43">B. C. 43</date>, Varro, then a man of upwards of seventy years of age, was put by Antony on the list of the proscribed, apparently for no other reason but because Varro was a staunch friend of republican freedom.
Varro himself escaped, but his libraries were irrecoverably lost.
Notwithstanding the great loss of books and other property which Varro had sustained, his literary activity remained unabated to a very advanced.
age. In his eighty-eighth year he was still writing.
He died in his ninetieth year (<date value="-27">B. C. 27</date>).</p>
<p>Varro was one of the most extraordinary men that ever lived.
He was certainly the most learned of the Romans; but his learning was not the learning of the closet only.
He had acquired a practical knowledge of men and things during his public career, and on the basi, of this solid knowledge he wrote his works in the retirement of his villas.
There was scarcely any branch of knowledge with which he was not thoroughly conversant: he was a historian, a philosopher, a naturalist, a grammarian, and a poet; and in all these branches lie is spoken of in terms of the highest praise.
Varro was for his time and for the Romans what Aristotle was to the Greeks.
He himself says that he wrote 490 books, but all of them, with the exception of two and a few fragments of others, are now lost.</p>
<p>The two extant works of Varro are on the Latin language (" De Lingua Latina") and  on Agriculture ("De Re Rustica").  The former, of which a part only is extant, consisted originally of twenty-four books, of which we now possess only books 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, and these are much mutilated and interpolated.
The work was written between the years <date value="-46">B. C. 46</date> and 44, and was dedicated to his intimate friend Cicero.
In the first three of the extant books Varr o treats of the origin of words, and in the last three of the accidents of words, such as declension and conjugation.
The work is of great value on account of the philological remarks, as well as various historical and archaological matters which are mentioned incidentally.</p>
<p>The work "De Re Rustica," which is complete, consists of three books, the first of which treats of agriculture; the second, of rearing of cattle; and the third, of feeding animals for the use of the table.
In the last of these, we meet with a remarkable instance of the prevalence of habit and fashion over human sentiment, where the author delivers instructions relative to the best method of fattening rats.</p>
<p>Varro likewise composed satires in various kinds of verse.
It is impossible to behold the numerous fragments of this venerable author without feeling the strongest regret for the loss of that vast collection of information which he had compiled, and of judicious observations which he had made on a variety of subjects, during a life of eighty-eight years, almost entirely devoted to literature.
The remark of St.
Augustine is well founded that it is astonishing how Varro, who read such a number of books, could find time to compose so many volumes, and how he who composed so many volumes could be at leisure to peruse such a variety of books, and to gain so much literary information.

<div1 type="life" n="catullus">
<head><rs key="Catullus">C. Valerius Catullus</rs></head>
<div2 type="chapter" n="1">
<p>CAIUS VALERIUS CATULLUS was born at Verona, <date value="-87">B. C. 87</date>, about seventeen years before Virgil and twenty-two before Horace.
His father, Valerius, was of a respectable municipal family in that city, and lived in habits of intimacy with Julius Casar, who appears, when his affairs led him to visit or pass through Cis-Alpine Gaul, to have taken up his abode at the house of Valerius.
Catullus left his paternal roof at an early age for Rome, where he plunged into dissipation and extravagance, mortgaged his estate, and fell into great poverty.
His pecuniary misfortunes do not seem to have broken his spirit or abated his good humour.
He laughs off his mortgage with a pun, and jokes on his poverty with the utmost indifference.
However, to improve his fortune, he, together with his brother, accompanied the prator, Memmius, to Bithynia.
This expedition, as respects the object our poet had in view, was completely unsuccessful.
He returned as poor as he went, and on his voyage home had the additional misfortune to lose his brother, to whom he was affectionately attached, and who died on the coast of Troy.
The death of his brother he deplores on more than one occasion in his works with great pathos, and in a style of natural and genuine feeling.</p>
<p>The voyage from Bithynia home was performed by sea in a small open pinnace, called a <foreign lang="la">phaselus</foreign>.
A voyage of that length, from its commencement in the Euxine to its termination on the shores of the Lake Benacus, in so fragile a bark, satisfactorily proves that Catullus was not deficient in at least one Roman virtue -- a contempt of danger.
He concluded this arduous enterprise by ascending the Po, and finally by the Mincius reached the promontory of Sermio on Lake Benacus.
On this promontory, where he appears to have possessed some property, he dedicated his little bark to Castor and Pollux, in some verses which have been much admired.
From the time of his return from Bithynia he continued to reside mostly at Rome, pursuing his pleasures, though living, as we collect from his writings, in poverty.
From the same sources we derive the information that he possessed estates both in the Sabine country and at Sirmio, probably of little value.</p>
<p>His chief or only patron was Manlius Torquatus, on whose marriage with Julia he wrote his <bibl n="Catul. 64">"Carmen Nuptiale."</bibl>
Notwithstanding his poverty, he lived in intimacy with all the men of talent of his day.
Cicero is supposed by some to have pleaded a cause for him; good critics, however, deny or doubt the fact.
Judging from his writings and the freedom with which he indulges in satire, without regard to the rank, power, or wealth of the object of it, we may fairly pronounce that Catullus possessed a lofty independent spilit.
His boldest flight was against Julius Caesar, even in the plenitude of his power.
He lashed his extravagance and his partiality for Mamurra with unsparing severity.
For this, however, he afterwards apologized; and the generous conqueror invited the poet to his table on the same day, and still continued his intercourse with his father, Valerius.</p>
<p>Of all the poet's favourites, Clodia, who appears under the feigned name of Lesbia, seems to have enjoyed the greatest share of his affection and of the effusions of his muse.
His lines on the death of Lesbia's sparrow are perhaps as well known as any verses he ever wrote (<bibl n="Catul. 3">poem 3</bibl>).
In his day Catullus bore the character of a learned person, and the epithet <foreign lang="la">doctus</foreign> is frequently applied to his name in the various testimonials which have reached us of his fame and merits.
This he perhaps obtained from his knowledge of the Greek language, and from the translations he made of some of the odes of Sappho and the poems of Callimachus.</p>
<p>A considerable part of the writings of Catullus is supposed to be lost.
He died, according to some, at the age of forty or thereabouts; according to others he attained the advanced age of seventy-one.
The latter opinion is combated at great length, and very successfully, by
Bayle. The concurrent testimony of all the men of wit and learning
of his own and after times establishes his character as a man of first-rate talents and a true poet. He possessed a brilliant imagination, and
clothed his thoughts in the best language. His style is easy and unaffected; he is always free from conceit or bombast; his lines are full of
sweetness and harmony. In his playful moods he has many touches of
humour, and is always entertaining and agreeable. When pathetic, his
feelings are natural and unrestrained. Many of his thoughts have been
borrowed by subsequent writers. He fell into the vice of his age, and
several of his pieces are degraded by the most obscene ideas couched
in the most revolting expressions. The only palliation for this offence
that can be offered is the manners of the times, when the grossest violations of propriety were overlooked, if not encouraged, by those whose
power, wealth, and influence enabled them to set the fashion.</p>
<p>His longest and most beautiful poem is the "Epithalamium of Peleus
and Thetis" (<bibl n="Catul. 64">poem 64</bibl>).  It has been objected to this piece that the author, immediately after its commencement, digresses into an episode longer than all the rest of the poem, being a narrative of the desertion of Ariadne by Theseus on the shores of Naxos, and having no reference to or connection with the main story, into which it is introduced as a description of the embroidery on the garment of Thetis.
To this criticism, which applies to the plan and not to the execution of the poem, it may be observed that what editors and commentators have thought fit to call the " Epithalamium of Peleus and Thetis," is possibly only part of a longer and unfinished work, intended by the author to bear a different designation, or it is only the fragment of the entire work which has come down to us. However that may be, the sufferings of Ariadne, and her desertion of her father's house, form a fine contrast with the chaste loves and the happy marriage of the parents of Achilles, and her story may have been selected by the poet with a view to produce that effect.</p>
<p>Catullus was the first who naturalized many of the more beautiful species of Greek verse, and Horace can only claim the merit of having extended the number.
At the same time, most of his shorter poems bear deep impress of original invention, are strikingly national, and have a strong flavour of the old republican roughness.
Even when he employs foreign materials, he works them up in such a manner as to give them a Roman air and character, and thus approaches much more nearly to Lucretius and the ancients than to the highly polished and artificial school of Virgil and the Augustans.
Hence arose the great popularity he enjoyed among his countrymen, as proved by the long catalogue of testimonies from the pens of poets, historians, philosophers, men of science, and grammarians.

<p>THE information to be derived from ancient writers regarding the personal history of LUCRETIUS is very scanty in amount and somewhat suspicious in character.
That he was a Roman, or at least an Italian, by birth, may be inferred from his own words, for he twice speaks of the Latin language as his native tongue.
The Eusebian Chronicle fixes <date value="-95">B.

Donatus, -on the contrary, affirms that his death happened in <date value="-55">B. C. 55</date>, on the
very day on which Virgil assumed the toga virilis, an event which, in the Eusebian Chronicle, is placed two years later.
From what source the tale about the philtre may have been derived we know not.
Pomponius Sabinus, in a note on the third Georgic, states that the drug employed was hippomanes, while later writers, twisting a passage in the works of St. Jerome to their own views, have declared that the potion was administered by his own wife Lucilia, in order that she might inspire him with more deep and fervent affection.
It has been ingeniously conjectured that the whole story was an invention of some enemy of the Epicureans, who conceived that such an end would be peculiarly appropriate for one who so boldly professed and so zealously advocated the principles of that philosophy.</p>
<p>The work which has immortalized the name of Lucretius, and which, happily, has been preserved entire, is a philosophical didactic poem, divided into six books extending to upwards of seven thousand four hundred lines, addressed to C. Memmius Gemellus, who was praetor in <date value="-58">B. C. 58</date>. It is entitled De Rerum Natura, and contains a development of the physical and ethical doctrines of Epicurus.
Notwithstanding the nature of the subject, which gave the poet little opportunity for those descripions of the passions and the feelings which generally form the chief charm in poetry, Lucretius has succeeded in imparting -to his didactic and philosophical work much of the real spirit of poetry; and if he had chosen a subject which would have afforded him greater scope for the exercise of his powers, he might have been ranked among the first of poets.
Even in the work which has come down to us, we find many passages which are not equalled by the best lines of any Latin poet, and which, for vigour of conception and splendour of diction, will bear a comparison with the best efforts of the poets of any age and country.
In no writer does the Latin language display its majesty and stately grandeur so effectively as in Lucretius.
There is a power and an energy in his descriptions which we rarely meet with in the Latin poets; and no one who has read his invocation to Venus at the beginning of the poem, or his beautiful picture of the busy pursuits of men at the commencement of the second book, or the progress of the arts and sciences in the fifth, or his description o" the plague which devastated Athens during the Peloponnesian war at the close of the sixth, can refuse to allow Lucretius a high rank among the poets of antiquity.</p>
<p>The object of Lucretius was to inculcate the great doctrine of Epicurus, so frequently misunderstood and misrepresented, that it is the great object of man's life to increase to the utmost his pleasures, and to diminish to the utmost his pains; and since the happiness of man
kind was chiefly prevented in his opinion by two things, superstition or a slavish fear of the gods and a dread of death, he endeavours to show that the gods take no interest in and exercise no control over the affairs of mankind, and that the soul is material and perishes with the body.
In the first three books he develops the Epicurean tenets respecting the formation of all things from atoms which existed from all eternity, and also maintains the materiality of the soul, which he supposes to be compounded of different kinds of air inhaled from the atmosphere; in the fourth book he inquires into the origin of sense and perception, and the nature and origin of dreams, which leads to a long digression on the follies and miseries of unlawful love; in the fifth he gives an account of the origin and laws of the world, and describes the gradual progress of mankind from a state of nature to civilisation, as well as the origin and progress of the arts and sciences; and in the sixth he attempts to account for a number of extraordinary phenomena, such as waterspouts, hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanoes, and pestilential diseases.</p>
<p>The poetry of Lucretius does not appear to have been highly estimated by the majority of his countrymen.
Ovid certainly speaks of it in the highest terms; but Quintilian mentions him rather slightingly; and Cicero does not praise him without considerable reservation.
The nature of his subject, and the little taste which the Romans in general manifested for speculations like those of Lucretius, may perhaps account for his poetry being estimated below its real merits.

<div2 type="chapter" n="1">
<p>M. VIPSANIUS AGRIPPA was born <date value="-63">B. C. 63</date>. He was the son of Lucius, and was descended from a very obscure family.
At the age of twenty he studied at Apollonia in Illyria, together with young Octavius, afterwards Octavianus and Augustus.
After the murder of J. Caesar in <date value="-44">B. C. 44</date>, Agrippa was one of those intimate friends of Octavius who advised him to proceed immediately to Rome.
Octavius took Agrippa with him, and charged him to receive the oath of fidelity from several legions which had declared in his favour.
Having been chosen consul in <date value="-43">B. C. 43</date>, Octavius gave to his friend Agrippa the delicate commission of prosecuting C. Cassius, one of the murderers of J. Caesar.
At the outbreak of the Perusinian war between Octavius, now Octavianus, and L. Antonius, in <date value="-41">B. C. 41</date>, Agrippa, who was then praetor, commanded part of the forces of Octavianus, and after distinguishing himself by skilful manceuvres, besieged L. Antonius in Perusia.
He took the town in <date value="-40">B. C. 40</date>, and towards the end of the same year re-took Sipontum, which had fallen into the hands of Marc Antony.
In <date value="-38">B. C. 38</date>, Agrippa obtained fresh success in Gaul, where he quelled a revolt
of the native chiefs; he also penetrated into Germany as far as the
country of the Catti; and transplanted the Ubil to the left bank of the
Rhine; whereupon he turned his arms against the revolted Aquitani,
whom he soon brought to obedience. His victories, especially those in
Aquitania, contributed much to securing the power of Octavianus, and
he was recalled by him to undertake the command of the war against
Sex. Pompeius, which was on the point of breaking out, <date value="-37">B. C. 37</date>. Octavianus offered him a triumph, which Agrippa declined, but he accep-
ted the consulship, to which he was promoted by Octavianus in B. C.
37. Immediately after his promotion to this dignity, he was charged
by Octavianus with the construction of a fleet, which was the more
necessary, as Sextus Pompey was master of the sea. Agrippa, in whom
thoughts and deeds were never separated, executed this order with
prompt energy. The Lucrine lake, near Baiae, was transformed by him
into a safe harbour, which he called the Julian port in honour of Octavianus, and where he exercised his sailors and marines till they were
able to encounter the experienced sailors of Pompey. In <date value="-36">B. C. 36</date>,
Agrippa defeated Sex Pompey, first at Mylae, and afterwards at Naulochus, on the coast c Sicily, and the latter of these victories broke
the naval supremacy  f Pompey.  He received in consequence the
honour of a naval crown, which was first conferred upon him; though,
according to other authorities, M. Varro was the first who obtained it,
from Pompey the Great.</p>
<p>In <date value="-35">B. C. 35</date>, Agrippa had the command of the war in Illyria, and
afterwards served under Octavianus, when the latter had proceeded to
that country. On his return, he voluntarily accepted the aedileship in
<date value="-33">B. C. 33</date>, although he had been consul, and expended immense sums of
money upon great public works. He restored the Appian, Marcian,
and Anienian aqueducts, constructed a new one, fifteen miles in length,
from the Tepula to Rome, to which he gave the name of the Julian, in
honour of Octavianus, and had an immense number of smaller water
works made, to distribute the water within the town. He also had the
large cloaca of Tarquinius Priscus entirely cleansed.  His various
works were adorned with statues by the first artists of Rome. These
splendid buildings he augmented in <date value="-27">B. C. 27</date>, during his third consulship, by several others, and among these was the Pantheon, on
which we still read the inscription:  <foreign lang="la">"M. Agrippa L. F. Cos.
Tertium fecit."</foreign></p>
<p>When the war broke out between Octavianus and M. Antonius, Agrippa was appointed commander-in-ehief of the fleet, <date value="-32">B. C. 32</date>. He took Methone in the Peloponnesus, Leucas, Patrae, and Corinth; and in the battle of Actium (B. C 3I), where he commanded, the victory was mainly owing to his skill.
On his return to Rome in D. c. 30, Octavianus, now Augustus, rewarded him with a "vexillum ceruleum," or sea-green flag.
In <date value="-28">B. C. 28</date>, Agrippa became consul for the second time with Augustus, and about this time married Marcella, the niece of Augustus, and the daughter of his sister Octavia.
His former wife, Ponponia, the daughter of T Pomponius Atticus, was either dead or divorced.
In the following year, <date value="-27">B. C. 27</date>, he was again consul the third time with Augustus.
In <date value="-25">B. C. 25</date>, Agrippa accompanied Augustus to the war against the Cantabrians.
About this time jealousy arose between him and his brother-in-law, Marcellus, the nephew of Augustus, who seemed to be destined as his successor.
Augustus, anxious to prevent differences that might have had serious consequences for him, sentAgrippa as proconsul to Syria.
Agrippa, of course, left Rome, but he stopped at Mitylene, in the island of Lesbos, leaving the government of Syria to his legate.
The apprehensions of Augustus were removed by the death of Marcellus in <date value="-23">B. C. 23</date>, and Agrippa immediately returned to Rome, wheie he was the more anxiously expected, as troubles had broken out during the election of the consuls in B c. 21. Augustus resolved to receive his faithful friend into his own family, and accordingly induced him to divorce his wife Marcella, and marry Julia, the widow of Marcellus, and the daughter of Augustus by his third wife, Scribonia (B. a. 2I).</p>
<p>In <date value="-19">B. C. 19</date>, Agrippa went into Gaul.
He pacified the turbulent natives, and constructed four great public roads and a splendid aqueduct at Nemausus (Nimes). From thence he proceeded to Spain, and subdued the Cantabrians, after a short but bloody and obstinate struggle; but, in accordance with his usual prudence, he neither announced his victories in pompous letters to the Senate, nor did he accept a triumph which Augustus offered him.
In <date value="-18">B. C. 18</date>, he was invested with the tnbunician power for five years together with Augustus; and in the following year (B. . 17), his two sons, Caius and Lucius, were adopted by Augustus.
At the close of the year, he accepted an invitation of Herod the Great, and went to Jerusalem.
He founded the military colony of Berytus (Beyrut); thence he proceeded in B. C i6 to the Pontus Euxinus, and compelled the Bosporani to accept Polemo for their king, and
to restore the Roman eagles which had been taken by Mithridates.
On his return, he stayed some time in Ionia, where he granted privileges to the Jews, whose cause was pleaded by Herod, and then proceeded to Rome, where he arrived in <date value="-13">B.C. 13</date>. After his tribunician power had been prolonged for five years, he went to Pannonia to restore tranquillity to that province.
He returned in B. C. I2, after having been successful as usual, and retired to Campania.
There he died unexpectedly in the month of March, <date value="-12">B. C. 12</date>, in his 5Ist year.
His body was carried to Rome, and was buried in the mausoleum of Augustus, who himself pronounced a funeral oration over it.</p>
<p>Dion Cassius tells us that, in the year B. . 29, Augustus assembled his friends and counsellors, Agrippa and Maecenas, demanding their opinion as to whether it would be advisable for him to usurp monarchical power, or to restore to the nation its former republican government.
This is corroborated by Suetonius, who says that Augustus twice deliberated upon that subject.
The speeches which Agrippa and Maecenas delivered on this occasion are given by Dion Cassius; but the artificial character of them makes them suspicious.
However, it does not seem likely from the general character of Dion Cassius as a historian that these speeches are invented by him; and it is not improbable, and such a supposition suits entirely the character of Augustus, that those speeches were really pronounced, though preconcerted between Augustus and his counsellors to make the Roman nation believe that the fate of the republic was still a matter of discussion, and that Augustus would not assume monarchical power till he had been convinced that it was necessary for the welfare of the nation.
Besides, Agrippa, who, according to Dion Cassius, advised Augustus to restore the republic, was a man whose political opinions had evidently a monarchical tendency.</p>
<p>Agrippa was one of the most distinguished and important men of the age of Augustus.
He must be considered as a chief support of the rising monarchical constitution, and without Agrippa Augustus could scarcely have succeeded in making himself the absolute master of the Roman empire.</p>
<p>It throws a curious light upon Agrippa's story to read the comment on it in the pages of the naturalist Pliny.
He is speaking of the superstitious fancy that misery clouded the lives of all who were called Agrippa.
In spite, he says, of his brilliant exploits he was no exception to the rule.
He was unlucky in his wife Julia, who dishonoured his good name; in his children, who died by poison or in exile; and unhappy also in bearing all his life what he calls the hard bondage of Augustus.
The friend for whom he toiled so long and faithfully showed
little tenderness of heart; the master whom he served had tasked his energies in every sphere and called for many an act of self-devotion, but he had already looked coldly on his loyal minister, and he might at any moment weary of a debt he could not pay, and add another page to the long chronicle of the ingratitude of princes.</p>
<p>Agrippa left several children.
By his first wife, Pomponia, he had Vipsania, who was married to Tiberius Caesar, the successor of Augustus.
By his second wife, Marcella, he had several children, who are not mentioned; and by his third wife, Julia, he had two daughters, Julia, married to L. .Emilius Paullus; and Agrippina, married to Germanicus; and three sons, Caius, Lucius, and Agrippa Postumus.

<div1 type="life" n="maecenas">
<head><rs key="Maecenas">C. Clinius Maecenas</rs></head>
<div2 type="chapter" n="1">
<p>OF the life of Maecenas we must be content to glean what scattered notices we can find from the poets and historians of Rome, since it does not appear to have been formally recorded by any ancient author.
We are in the dark both as to the date and place of his birth, and the manner of his education.
It is probable, however, that he was born between <date value="-73">B. C. 73</date> and 63; and we learn from Horace that his birthday was the 13th of April.
His family, though belonging only to the equestrian order, was of high antiquity and honour, and traced its descent from the Lucumones of Etruria.
The scholiast on Horace informs us that he numbered Porsena among his ancestors; and his authority is in some measure confirmed by a fragment of one of Augustus's letters to Maecenas, in which he.is addressed as "berylle Porsenae."
His paternal ancestors (Cilnii) are mentioned by Livy as having attained to so high a pitch of power and wealth at Arretium, about the middle of the fifth century of Rome, as to excite the jealousy and hatred of their fellow-citizens, who rose against and expelled them; and it was not without considerable difficulty that they were at length restored to their country, through the interference of the Romans.
The maternal branch of the family was likewise of Etruscan origin, and it was from them that the name of Maecenas was derived, it being customary among the Etruscans to assume the mother's as well as the father's name.
It seems probable, as Varro tells us, that this name was taken from some place, possibly that mentioned by Pliny as producing an inland sort of wines called the vina Macenatzana.
The names both of Cilnius and Maecenas occur on Erruscan cinerary urns, but always separately, a fact from which Miller   ioo                has inferred that the union of the two families did not take place till a late period.
Be that as it may, the first notice that occurs of any of the family as a citizen of Rome, is in Clcero's speech for Cluentius, where a knight named C. Maecenas is mentioned among the robora populi Romani, and as having been instrumental in putting down the conspiracy of the tribune, M. Livius Drusus, <date value="-91">B. C. 91</date>. This person has been generally considered the father of the subject of this memoir; but Frandsen, in his life of Maecenas, thinks, and perhaps with more probability, that it wai his grandfather.</p>
<p>Although it is unknown where Maecenas received his education, it must have been a careful one.
We learn from Horace that he was versed both in Greek and Roman literature, and his taste for literary pursuits was shown, not only by his patronage of the most eminent poets of his time, but also by several performances of his own, both in verse and prose.
Shortly after the appearance of Octavianus on the political stage, we find the name of Maecenas in frequent conjunction with his, and there can be no doubt that he was of great use to him in assisting to establish and consolidate the empire; but the want of materials prevents us from tracing his services in this way with the accuracy that could be wished.
The first authentic account we have of Maecenas is of his being employed by Octavianus, <date value="-40">B. C. 40</date>, in negotiating a marriage for him with Scribonia, daughter of Libo, the father-in-law of Sex.
Pompeius, which latter, for political reasons, Octavianus was at that time desirous of conciliating.
In the same year, Maecenas took part in the negotiations with Antony (whose wife, Fulvia, was now dead), which led to the peace of Brundisium, confirmed by the marriage of Antony with Octavia, Caesar's sister.
According to Appian, however, Cocceius Nerva played the principal part.
About two years afterwards Maecenas seems to have been again employed in negotiating with Antony, and it was probably on this occasion that Horace accompanied him to Brundisium, a journey which he has described in the 5th satire of the ist book.
In <date value="-36">B. C. 36</date>, we find Maecenas in Sicily with Octavianus, then engaged in an expedition against Sex.
Pompeius. during the course of which Maecenas was twice sent back to Rome for the purpose of quelling some disturbances which had broken out there.
According to Dion Cassius, this was the first occasion on which Maecenas became Caesar's vicegerent, and he was entrusted with the administration, not only of Rome, but of all Italy.
His fidelity and talents had now been tested by several years' experience, and it had probably been found that the bent of his genius fitted him for the cabinet rather than for the field, since his services could be so easily dispensed with in the latter.
From this time till the battle of Actium (<date value="-31">B. C. 31</date>), history is silent concerning Macenas; but at that period we again find him  entrusted with the administration of the civil affairs of Italy.
It has, indeed, been maintained by many critics that Maecenas was present at the sea fight of Actium; but the best modern scholars who have discussed the subject have shown that this could not have been the case, and that he remained in Rome during this time, where he suppressed the conspiracy of the younger Lepldus.</p>
<p>By the detection of the conspiracy of Lepidus, Maecenas nipped in the bud what might have proved another fruitful germ of civil war.
Indeed, his services at this period must have been most important and invaluable; and how faithfully and ably he acquitted himself may be inferred from the unbounded confidence reposed in him.
In conjunction with Agrippa, we now find him empowered not only to open all letters addressed by Caesar to the Senate, but even to alter their contents as the posture of affairs at home might require; and for this purpose he was entrusted with his master's seal, in order that the letters might be delivered as if they had come directly from Octavianus's own hand.
Yet, notwithstanding the height of favour and power to which he had attained, Maecenas, whether from policy or inclination, remained content with his equestrian rank; a circumstance which seems somewhat to have diminished his authority with the populace.</p>
<p>After Octavianus's victory over Antony and Cleopatra, the whole power of the triumvirate centered in the former; for Lepidus had been previously reduced to the condition of a private person.
On his return to Rome, Caesar is represented to have taken counsel with Agrippa and Macenas respecting the expediency of restoring the republic.
Agrippa advised him to pursue that course, but Maecenas strongly urged him to establish the empire; and Dion Cassius has preserved the speech which he is said to have addressed to Octavianus on that occasion.
The genuineness of that document is, however, liable to very great suspicion.
It is highly improbable that Maecenas, in a cabinet consultation of that kind, would have addressed Octavianus in a set speech of so formal a description; and still more so that any one should have been present to take it down, or that Maecenas himself should have afterwards published it. Yet Suetonius, in his life of Augustus, confirms the account of Dion Cassius so far as that some such consultation took place; and the tenor of the speech perfectly agrees with the known character and sentiments of Maecenas.
If, therefore, we should be disposed to regard the part here attributed by Dion Cassius to Agrippa and Maecenas as something more than a mere fiction of the historian, for the purpose of stating the most popular arguments that might be advanced against, or in favor of, the establishment of the empire, the most probable solution is that the substance of the speech was extant in the Roman archives in the shape of a state paper or minute, drawn up by Maecenas.
However that may be, the document is certainly a very able one, and should be carefully consulted by all who are studying the history of Rome during its transition from a republic to an empire.</p>
<p>The description of power exercised by Maecenas during the absence of Caesar, should not be confounded with the prefectura urbis.
It was not till after the civil wars that the latter office was established as a distinct and substantive one; and, according to Dion Cassius, by the advice of Maecenas himself.
This is confirmed by Tacitus and by Suetonius, who reckons it among the nova oficia.
The prefectus urbis was a mere police magistrate, whose jurisdiction was confined to Rome and the adjacent country within a radius of 750 stadia<note anchored="yes">The stadium, a Greek and Roman measure, was equal to 600 Greek
or 625 Roman feet, or to 125 Roman paces, and the Roman mile contained 8 stadia.  The stadium was therefore equal to 606 feet and 9
inches, English.</note>; but Maecenas had the charge of political as well as municipal affairs, and his administration embraced the whole of Italy.
Thus we are told by Seneca that he was invested with judicial power; and also that he gave the watchword, a function of the very highest authority, and afterwards exercised by the emperors themselves.
It is the more necessary to attend to this distinction, because the neglect of it has given rise to the notion that Maecenas was never entrusted with the supreme administration after the close of the civil wars.
The office of prafectus urbis was a regular and continuous one; and we learn from Tacitus that it was first filled by Messalla Corvinus, who held it but a few days; then by Statilius Taurus, who, it is plain from Dion, must have enjoyed it for upwards of ten years at least; and next by Piso, who, Tacitus tells us, was prafectus for the space of twenty years.
But there is nothing in all this to show that Maecenas might not have been Caesar's vicegerent whilst Taurus filled the subordinate office of prrefectus.
When Agrippa, indeed, could remain at Rome, he seems to have had the preference, as on the occasion of Augustus's expedition into Sicily n <date value="-2">B. C. 2</date>I. But when Agrippa accompanied the Emperor, as in his Spanish campaign in <date value="-27">B. C. 27</date>, it is hardly to be doubted that Msecenas exercised the functions of Augustus at Rome.</p>
<p>It must be confessed, however, that we have no means of determining
with certainty on what occasions, and for how long, after the establishment of the empire, Maecenas continued to exercise his political power
though, as before remarked, we know that he had ceased to enjoy it in
B. c. i6. That he retained the confidence of Augustus till at least <date value="-21">B. C. 21</date>, may be inferred from the fact that about that time he advised him
to marry his daughter Julia to Agrippa, on the ground that he had
made the latter so rich and powerful that it was dangerous to allow him
to live unless he advanced him still further. The fact to which we have
before alluded, of Agrippa being entrusted in that year with the administration, and not Maecenas, affords no ground for concluding that any
breach had yet been made in the friendship of the Emperor and Maecenas. Agrippa, being more nearly connected with Augustus, would of
course obtain the preference; and such an act of self-renunciation was
quite in the character of Maecenas, and might have even formed part of
his advice respecting the conduct to be observed towards Agrippa.
Between <date value="-21">B. C. 21</date> and 16, however, we have direct evidence that a coolness, to say the least, had sprung up between the Emperor and his faith-
ful minister. This estrangement, for it cannot be called actual disgrace,
is borne out by the silence of historians respecting the latter years of
Maecenas's life, as well as by the express testimony of Tacitus, who tells
us that during this period he enjoyed only the appearance, and not the
reality, of his sovereign's friendship.  The cause of this rupture is
enveloped in doubt. Seneca drops a mysterious hint about Maecenas
having taken in his sails too late; whilst Dion Cassius positively attributes it to an intrigue carried on by Augustus with Terentia, Maecenas's
wife. It is certain that such a connection existed; and the historian
just cited tnentions a report that Augustus's motive for going into Gaul
in <date value="-16">B. C. 16</date> was to enjoy the society of Terentia, unmolested by the lampoons which it gave occasion to at Rome. But, whatever may have
been the cause, the political career of Maecenas may be considered as
then at an end; and we shall therefore now turn to contemplate him in
private life.</p>
<p>The public services of Maecenas, though important were unobtrusive;
and notwithstanding the part that he played in assisting to establish the
empire, it is by his private pursuits, and more particularly by his reputation as a patron of literature, that he has been best known to posterity.
His retirement was probably far from disagreeable to him, as it was
accompanied with many circumstances calculated to recommend it to
one of his turn of mind, naturally a votary of ease and pleasure. He
had amassed an enormous fortune, which Tacitus attributes to the liberality of Augustus.
It has been sometimes insinuated that he grew rich by the proscriptions; and Pliny, speaking of Maecenas's private seal, which bore the impression of a frog, represents it as having been an object of terror to the tax-payers.
It by no means follows, however, that the money levied under his private seal, was applied to his private purposes; and had he been inclined to misappropriate the taxes, we know that Caesar's own seal was at his unlimited disposal, and would better have covered his delinquencies.</p>
<p>Maecenas had purchased a tract of ground on the Esquiline hill, which had formerly served as a burial place for the lower orders.
Here he had planted a garden, and built a house remarkable for its loftiness, on account of a tower by which it was surmounted, and from the top of which Nero is said to have afterwards contemplated the burning of Rome.
In this residence he seems to have passed the greater part of his time, and to have visited the country but seldom; for though he might possibly have possessed a villa at Tibur, near the falls of the Anio, there is no direct authority for the fact.
Tacitus tells us that he spent his leisure urbe in ipsa; and the deep tranquillity of his repose may be conjectured from the epithet by which the same historian designates itvelut peregrinum  otium.
The height of the situation seems to have rendered it a healthful abode, and we learn from Suetonius that Augustus had, on one occasion, retired thither to recover from a sickness.</p>
<p>Maecenas's house was the rendezvous of all the wits and virtuosi of Rome, and whoever could contribute to the amusement of the company was always welcome to a seat at his table.
In this kind of society he does not appear to have been very select; and it was probably from his undistinguishing hospitality that Augustus called his board parasiica mensa.
Yet he was naturally of a reserved and taciturn disposition, and drew a broad distinction between the acquaintances that he adopted for the amusement of an idle hour, and the friends whom he admitted to his intimacy and confidence.
In the latter case he was as carefil and chary as he was indiscriminating in the former.
His really intimate friends consisted of the greatest geniuses and most learned men of Rome; and if it was from his universal inclination towards men of talent hiat he obtained the reputation of a literary patron, it was by his friendshi, for such poets as Virgil and Horace that he deserved it. In recent time,, and by some German authors, especially the celebrated Wieland, Maecenas's claims to the title of a literary patron have been depreciated.
It is urged that he is not mentioned by Ovid and Tibullus; that the Sabine farm which he gave to Horace was not so very large; that his conduct was perhaps not altogether disinterested, and
that he might have befriended literary men either out of vanity or from political motives; that he was not singular in his literary patronage, which was a fashion amongst the eminent Romans of the day, as Messalla Corvinus, Asinius Pollio, and others; and that he was too knowing in pearls and beryls to be a competent judge of the higher works ot genius.
As for his motives, or the reasons why he did not adopt Tlbullis and Ovid, we shall only remark that, as they are utterly unknown to us, so it is only fair to put the most liberal construction on them; and that he had naturally a love of literature for its own sake, apart from all political or interested views, may be inferred from the fact of his having been himself a voluminous author.
Though literary patronage may have been the fashion of the day, it would be difficult to point out any contemporary Roman, or indeed any at all, who indulged it so magnificently.
His name had become proverbial for a patron of letters at least as early as the time of Martial; and though the assertion of that author that the poets enriched by the bounty of Maecenas were now not easily to be counted, is not, of course, to be taken literally, it would have been utterly ridiculous had there not been some foundation for it. That he was no bad judge of literary merit is shown by the sort of men whom he patronized-Virgil, Horace, Propertius; besides others, almost their equals in reputation, but whose works are now unfortunately lost, as Varius, Tucca, and others.
But as Virgil and Horace were by far the greatest geniuses of the age, so it is certain that they were more beloved by Maecenas, the latter especially, than any of their contemporaries.
Virgil was indebted to him for the recovery of his farm, which had been appropriated by the soldiery in the division of lands, in <date value="-41">B. C. 41</date>; and it was at the request of Maecenas that he undertook the Georgics, the most finished of all his poems.
To Horace he was a still greater benefactor.
He not only procured him a pardon for having fought against Octavianus at Philippi, but presented him with the means of comfortable subsistence, a farm in the Sabine country.
If the estate was but a moderate one, we learn from Horace himself that the bounty of Maecenas was regulated by his own contented views, and not by his patron's want of generosity.
Nor was this liberality accompanied with any servile and degrading conditions.
The poet was at liberty to write or not, as he pleased, and lived in a state of independence creditable alike to himself and to his patron.
lideed their intimacy was rather that of two familiar friends of equal station, than of the royally-descended and powerful minister of Caesar, with the son of an obscure freedman.</p>
<p>Of Maecenas's own literary productions, only a few fragments exist.
From these, however, and from the notices which we find of his writings in ancient authors, we are led to think that we have not suffered any great loss by their destruction; for although a good judge of literary merit in others he does not appear to have been an author of much taste himself.
It has been thought that two of his works, of which little more than the titles remain, were tragedies, namely, the Prometheus aad Octavia.
An hexameter line supposed to have belonged to an epic poem; another line, thought to have been part of a Galliambic poem, one or two epigrams, and some other fragments, are extant.
In prose, he wrote a work on natural history, which Dliny several times alludes to, but which seems to have related chiefly to fishes and gems.
Servius attributes a Symposium to him.
If we may trust the same authority, he also composed some memoirs of Augustus, and Horace alludes to at least some project of the kind, but which was probably never carried into execution.
Maecenas's prose style was affected, unnatural, and often unintelligible, and for these qualities he was derided by Augustus.
Macrobius has preserved part of a letter of the Emperor's, in which he takes off his minister's way of writing.
The author of the dialogue De Causis Corrupta Eloquentia enumerates him among the orators, but stigmatises his affected style by the term calamistros Mfecenatzs.
Quintilian and Seneca also condemn his style, and the latter author gives a specimen of it which is almost wholly unintelligible.
Yet, he likewise tells us that he would have been very eloquent if he had not been spoiled by his good fortune, and allows him to have possessed an ingenium grande et virile.
According to Dion Cassius, Maecenas first introduced shorthand, and instructed many in the art through his freedman Aquila.
By other authors, however, the invention has been attributed to various persons of an earlier date; as to Tiro, Cicero's freedman, to Cicero himself, and even to Enmus.</p>
<p>But though seemingly in possession of all the means and appliances of enjoyment, Maecenas cannot be said to have been altogether happy in his domestic life.
We have already alluded to an intrigue between Augustus and his  ife Terentia; but this was not the only infringement of his domestic peace; Terentia, though exceedingly beautiful, was of a morose and haughty temper, and thence quarrels were continually occurring between the pair.
Yet the natural uxoriousness of Maecenas as constantly prompted him to seek a reconciliation; so that Seneca remarks that he married a wife a thousand times, though he never had more than one.
Her influence over him was so great, that in spite of his cautious and taciturn temper, he was.
on one occasion, weak enough to confide an important state secret to her, respecting her
brother Murena, the conspirator.
Maecenas himself, however, was probably in some measure to blame for the terms on which he lived with his wife, for he was far from being the pattern of a good husband.
His own adulteries were notorious.
Plutarch relates of him the story of the accommodating husband, Galba, who pretended to be asleep after dinner in order to give him an opportunity with his wife.</p>
<p>In his way of life Maecenas was addicted to every species of luxury.
We find several allusions in the ancient authors to the effeminacy of his
dress. Instead of girding his tunic above his knees, he suffered it to hang loose about his heels, like a woman's petticoat; and when sitting on the tribunal he kept his head covered with his pallium. Yet, in spite of this softness, he was capable of exerting himself when the occasion required, and of acting with energy and decision. So far was he from wishing to conceal the softness and effeminacy of his manners, that he made a parade of his vices; and during the greatest heat of the civil wars, openly appeared in the public places of Rome with a couple of eunuchs in his train. Je was fond of theatrical entertainments, especially pantomimes; as may be inferred from his patronage of Bathyllus, the celebrated dancer, who was a freedman of his. It has been concluded from  Tacitus that he first introduced that species of representation at Rome; and, with the politic view of keeping the people quiet by amusing them, persuaded Augustus to patronize it. Dion Cassius tells us that he was the first to introduce warm swimming baths at Rome. His love of ointments is tacitly satirized by Augustus, and his passion for gems and precious stones is notorious. According to Pliny, he paid some attention to cookery; and as the same author mentions a book on gardening, which had been dedicated to him by Sabinus Tiro, it has been thought that he was partial to that pursuit.  His tenacious, and indeed unmanly love of life, he has himself painted in some verses preserved by Seneca. It has been conjectured that he belonged to the sect of the Epicureans; but of his philosophical principles nothing certain is known.</p>
<p>That moderation of character which led him to be content with his equestrian rank, probably arose from the love of ease and luxury which we have described, or it might have been the result of more prudent and political views. As a politician, the principal trait in his character was fidelity to his master, and the main end of all his cares was the consolidation of the empire. But, though he advised the establishment of a despotic monarchy, he was at the same time the advocate of mild and liberal measures.  He recommended Augustus to put no check on the free expression of public opinion; but above all, to avoid that cruelty, which, for so many years, had stained the Roman annals with blood. To the same effect is the.anecdote preserved by Cedrenus, the Byzantine historian; that when'on some occasion Octavianus sat on the tribunal, condemning numbers to death, Maecenas, who was among the by-standers, and could not approach Caesar by reason of the crowd, wrote upon his tablets, " Rise, hangman I" (Surge tandem carmfex), and threw them into Caesar's lap, who immediately left the judgment seat.</p>
<p>Maecenas appears to have been a constant valetudinarian. If Pliny's statement is to be taken literally, he laboured under a continual fever. According to the same author, he was sleepless during the last three years of his life; and Seneca tells us that he endeavoured to procure that sweet and indispensab'e refreshment, by listening to the sound of distint symphonies. We may infer from  Horace that he was rather hypochondriacal. He died in the consulate of Gallus and Censorinus, <date value="-8">B. C. 8</date>, and was buried on the Esquiline. He left no children, and thus by his death his ancient family became extinct. He bequeathed his property to Augustus, and we find that Tiberius afterwards resided in his house.  Though the Emperor treated Maecenas with coldness during the latter years of his life, he sincerely lamented his death, and seems to have sometimes felt the want of so able, so honest, and so faithful a counsellor.

<head><rs key="Drusus">Nero Claudius Drusus</rs></head>
<div2 type="chapter" n="1">
<p>NERO CLAUDIUS DRUSUS (commonly called by the moderns Drusus Senior, to distinguish him from his nephew, the son of Tiberius), had originally the praenomen Decimus, which was afterwards exchanged for Nero; and after his death received the honourable agnomen Germanicus, which is appended to his name on coins.
Hence, care should be taken not to confound him with the celebrated Germanicus, his son.
His parents were Livia Drusilla (afterwards Julia Augusta) and Tiberius Claudius Nero, and through both of them he inherited the noble blood of the Claudii, who had never yet admitted an adoption into their family, or stock.
From the adoption of his maternal grandfather by a Iiviu; Drusus, he became legally one of the representatives of another illustrious race.
He was a younger brother of Tiberius Nero, who was afterwards emperor.
Augustus, having fallen in love with his mother, procured a divorce between her and her husband, and married her himself.
Drusus was born in the house of Augustus three months after this
marriage, in <date value="-38">B. C. 38</date>, and a suspicion prevailed that Augustus was more than a step-father.
Augustus sent the boy to Nero, his reputed father, who soon after died, having appointed Augustus guaidian to Tiberius and Drusus.</p>
<p>Drusus, as he grew up, was more liked by the people than was his brother.
He was free from dark reserve, and in him the character of the Claudian race assumed its most attractive, as in Tiberius its most odious, type.
In everything he did there was an air of high breeding, and the noble courtesy of his manners was set off by singular beauty of person and dignity of form.
He possessed in a high degree the winning quality of always exhibiting towards his friends an even and consistent demeanour, without capricious alternations of familiarity and distance, and he seemed adapted by nature to sustain the character of a prince and statesman.
It was known that he had a desire to see the commonwealth restored, and the people cherished the hope that he would give them back their ancient liberties.
He wrote a letter to his brother, in which he broached the notion of compelling Augustus to resign the empire, and this letter was betrayed by Tiberius to Augustus.
But notwithstanding this indication that the affection of Tiberius was either a hollow pretence, or yielded to his sense of duty to Augustus, the brothers maintained during their lives the appearance, at least, of fraternal tenderness, which, according to Valerius Maximus, had only one parallel-the friendship of Castor and Pollux! In the domestic relations of life.
the conduct of Drusus was exemplary. He married the beautiful and illustrious Antonia, a daughter, and, according to the preponderance of authority, the younger daughter, of M. Antonius, the triumvir, by Octavia, the sister of Augustus.
Their mutual attachment was unusually great, and the unsullied fidelity of Drusus to the marriage bed became a theme of popular admiration and applause in a profligate age.
He must have been young when he married; for, though he died at the age of thirty, he had several children who died before him, besides the three, Germanicus, Livia, and Claudius, who survived their father.</p>
<p>He began public life early.
In <date value="-19">B. C. 19</date> he obtained permission, by a decree of the Senate, to fill all magistracies five years before the regular time.
In the beginning of <date value="-16">B. C. 16</date>, we find him presiding with his brother at a gladiatorial show; and when Augustus, upon his departure for Gaul, took Tiberius, who was then praetor, along with him, Drusus was left in the city to discharge, in his brother's place, the important duties of that office.
In the following year he was made quaestor, and sent against the Rhatians, who were accused of having committed dep
redations upon Roman travellers and allies of the Romans.
The mountainous parts of the country were inhabited by banditti, who levied contributions from the peaceful cultivators of the plains, and plundered all who did not purchase freedom from attack by special agreement.
Every chance male who fell into their hands was murdered. Drusus attacked and routed them  near the Tridentine Alps, as they were about to make a foray into Italy.
His victory was not decisive, but he obtained praetorian honours as his reward.
The Rhsetians, after being repulsed from Italy, continued to infest the frontier of Gaul.
Tiberius was then despatched to join Drusus, and the brothers jointly defeated some of the tribes of the Rhzeti and Vindelici, while others submitted without resistance.
A tribute was imposed upon the country. The greater part of the population was carried off, while enough were left to till the soil without being able to rebel.</p>
<p>On the return of Augustus to Rome from Gaul, in <date value="-13">B. C. 13</date>, Drusus was sent into that province, which had been driven into revolt by the exaction of the Roman governor, Licinius, who, in order to increase the amount of the monthly tribute, had divided the year into fourteen months.
Drusus made a new assessment of property for the purpose of taxation, and in <date value="-12">B. C. 12</date> quelled the tumults which had been occasioned by his financial measures.
The Sicambri and their allies, under pretence of attending an annual festival held at Lyons at the altar of Augustus, had fomented the disaffection of the Gallic chieftains.
In the tumults which ensued, their troops had crossed the Rhine.
Drusus now drove them back into the Batavian island, and pursued them in their own territory, laying waste the greater part of their country.
He then followed the course of the Rhine, sailed to the ocean, subdued the Frisians, and passed by shallows into the territory of the Chauci, where his vessels grounded upon the ebbing of the tide.
From this danger he was rescued by the friendly assistance of the Frisians.
Winter now approached.
He returned to Rome, and in <date value="-11">B. C. 11</date> was made praetor urbanus.</p>
<p>Drusus was the first Roman general who penetrated to the German ocean.
It is probable that he united the military design of reconnoitering the coast with the spirit of adventure and scientific discovery.
From the migratory character of the tribes he subdued, it is not easy to fix their locality with precision; and the difficulty of geographical exactness is increased by the alterations which time and the elements have made in the face of the country.
It is by no means certain by what course Drusus reached the ocean, although it is the general opinion that he had already constructed a canal uniting the eastern arm of the Rhine
with the Yssel, and so had opened himself a way by the Zuydersee.
This opinion is confirmed by a passage in Tacitus, where Germanicub, upon entering the Fossa Drusiana, prays for the protection of his father, who had gone the same way before him, and then sails by the Zuydersee (Lacus Flevus) to the ocean, up to the mouth of the Ems (Amlsla). To this expedition of Drusus may perhaps be referred the naval battle in the Ems mentioned by Strabo, in which the Bructeri were defeated, and the subjugation of the islands on the coast, especially Byrchamis (Borkum). Ferdinand Wachter thinks that the canal of Drusus must have been too great a work to be completed at so early a period, and that Drusus could not have had time to run up the Ems.
He supposes that Drusus sailed to the ocean by one of the natural channels of the river, and that the inconvenience he experienced and the geographical knowledge he gained led him to avail himself of the capabilities afforded by the Lacus Flevus for a safer junction with the ocean; that his works on the Rhine were probably begun in this campaign, and were not finished until some years afterwards.
The precise nature of those works cannot now be determined.
The most probable opinion seems to be, that Drusus dug a canal from the Rhine near Arnheim to the Yssel, near Doesberg (which bears a trace of his name), and that he also widened the bed of the narrow outlet which at that time connected the Lacus Flevus with the ocean.
These were his fossa. With regard to his ager or moles, it is supposed that he partly dammed up the south-western arm of the Rhine (the Vahalis or Waal), in order to allow more water to flow into the north-eastern arm, upon which his canal was situated.
But this hypothesis as to the situation of the dyke is very doubtful.
Some modem authors hold that the Yssel ran into the Rhine, and did not run into the Zuydersee, and that the chief work of Drusus consisted in connecting the Yssel with a river that ran from  Zutphen into the Zuydersee.</p>
<p>He did not tarry long at Rome.
On the commencement of spring he returned to Germany, subdued the Usipites, built a bridge over the Lippe, invaded the country of the Sicambri, and passed on through the territory of the Cherusci as far as the Visurgis (Weser). This he was able to effect front meeting with no opposition from the Sicambri, who were engaged with all their forces in fighting against the Chatti.
He would have gone on to cross the Weser, had he not been deterred (such were the ostensible reasons) by scarcity of provisions, the approach of winter, and the evil omen of a swarm of bees which settled upon the lances in front of the tent of the prafectus castrorum.
No doubt Drusus found it prudent to retreat.
In retiring, he was often in danger
from the stratagems of the enemy, and once was nearly shut up in a dangerous pass near Arbalo, and narrowly escaped perishing with his whole army.
But the cartless bravery of the Germans saved him. His enemies had already, by anticipation, divided the spoil.
The Cheruscl chose the horses, the Suevi the gold and silver, and the Sicambri the prisoners.
Thinking that the Romans were as good as taken, after immolating twenty Roman centurions as a preparatory sacrifice, they rushed on without order, and were repulsed.
It was now they, and their horses, and sheep, and neck-chains (torques), that were sold by Drusus.
Henceforward they confined themselves to distant attacks.</p>
<p>Drusus had breathing time to build two castles, one at the confluence of the Luppia and the Aliso, and the other near the country of the Chatti, on the Rhine.
The latter is probably the modern Cassel over against Mayence.
The former is thought by some who identify the Aliso with the Aim, to be the modern Elsen Neuhaus, in the district of Paderborn; by others, who identify the Aliso with the Llse, to be Lisborn, near Lippstadt, in the district of Minster.
Drusus now returned to Rome with the reputation of having conquered several tribes beyond the Rhine, and received as his reward a vote of the Senate granting him an ovation with the insignia of a triumph, and decreeing that at the end of his praetorship he should have proconsular authority.
But Augustus would not allow him to bear the title of impnerator, which had been conferred upon him by the army in the field.</p>
<p>In the next year, B. C. IO, Drusus was again at his post.
The Chatti left the territory which had been assigned to them by the Romans.
After having long refused to become allies of the Sicambri, they now consented to join that powerful people; but their united forces were not a match for Drusus.
Some of the Chatti he subdued; others he could do no more than harass and annoy.
He attacked the Nervii, who were headed by .Snectius and Anectius, and it was probably in this campaign that he bui.
a castle upon the Taunus. He then returned to Rome with Augustus and Tiberius, who had been in Lugdunensian Gaul, watching the result of the war in Germany, and upon his arrival he was elected to the consulship, which was to commence on the kalends of January, <date value="-9">B. C. 9</date>. Drusus could not rest in peace at Rome.
To worry and subjugate the Germans appeared to be the main object of his life.
Without waiting for the actual commencement of his consulship he returned to the scene of battle, undeterred by evil forebodings, of which there was no lack  There had been horrible storms and inundations in the winter months, and the lightning had struck three temples at Rome.
He attacked the Chatti, won a hard-fought battle, penetrated
to the country of the Suevi, gave the Marcomanni (who were a portion of the Suevi), a signal defeat, and with the arms taken as spoil erected a mound as a trophy.
It was now, perhaps, that he gave the Suevi Vannius as their king.
He then turned his forces against the Cherusci, crossed the Weser (?), and carried all before him to the Elbe.
The course that Drusus took on his way to the Elbe cannot be determined.
Florus speaks of his making roads through the Hercynian forest, and Wilbelm thinks that he advanced through Thuringia.
Drusus endcavoured in vain to cross the Elbe.
A miraculous event occurred; a woman of dimensions greater than human appeared to him, and said to him in the Latin tongue, "Whither goest thou, insatiable Drusus? The fates forbid thee to advance.
Away! The end of thy deeds and thy life is nigh."
Dion Cassius cannot help believing the fact of the apparition, seeing that the prophetic warning was so soon fulfilled i Thus deterred by the guardian genius of the land, Drusus hastened back to the Rhine, after erecting trophies on the banks of the Elbe.
Suetonius varies from Dion Cassius in the particulars of this legend, and some of the moderns endeavour to explain it by referring the denunciation to a German propheess or Wala.
On his retreat, wolves howled round the camp, two stiange youths appeared on horseback among the intrenchments, the screams of women were heard, and the stars raced about in the sky.
Such were the superstitious fears which oppressed the minds of the Romans, who would rather flatter themselves that they were submitting to supernatural forces than avoiding the human might of dangerous enemies.
Between the Elbe and the Sala (probably the Thuringian Saal), death overtook Drums.
According to the Epitomiser of Livy (whose last book contained a full account of these transactions), the horse of Drusus fell upon his leg, and Drusus died of the fracture on the thirtieth day after the accident.
Of the numerous writers who mention the death of Drusus, no one besides alludes to the broken leg.
Suetonius, whose history is a rich receptacle of scandal, mentions the incredible report that Drusus was poisoned by Augustus, after having disobeyed an order of the Emperor for his recall.
It is indeed probable enough that the Emperor thought he had advanced far enough, and that it would be unwise to exasperate into hostility the inoffensive tribes beyond the Elbe.
Tiberius, Augustus, and Livia were in Pavia (Ticinum). when the tidings of the dangerous illness of Drusus reached them.
Tiberius, with extraordinary speedt crossed the Alps, performing a journey of 200 Roman miles through a difficult and dangerous country, without stopping day or night, and arrived in time to close the eyes of his brother.
Drusus, though at the point of death,
had yet presence of mind enough to command that Tiberius should be received with all the distinction due to a consular and an imperator.</p>
<p>The summer camp where Drusus died was called Scelerata, the Accursed.
The corpse was carried in a marching military procession to the winter-quarters of the army at Moguntiacum .Mayence) upon the Rhine, Tiberius walking all the way as chief mourner.
The troops wished the funeral to be celebrated there, but Tiberius brought the body to Italy.
It was burnt in the field of Mars, and the ashes deposited in the tomb of Augustus, who composed the verses that were inscribed upon his sepulchral monument, and wrote in prose a memorial of his life.
In a funeral oration, delivered by Augustus in the Flaminian Circus, he exclaimed, " I pray the gods to make my adopted sons, Caius and Lucius, like Drusus, and to vouchsafe to me as honourable a death as his."</p>
<p>Among the honours paid to Drusus the cognomen Germanicus was decreed to him and his posterity.
A marble arch with trophies was erected to his memory on the Appian Way, and the representation of this arch may be seen upon extant coins.
He had a cenotaph on the Rhine, an altar near the Lippe, and Eusebius speaks of a Drusus, the nephew of the Emperor Claudius, who had a monument at Mayence; but here Drusus Senior seems to be meant, and there is probably a confusion between the son and the father of Germanicus.
It is to the latter that the antiquaries of Mayence refer the Eichelstein and the Drusiloch.</p>
<p>The misery that Drusus must have occasioned among the German tribes was undoubtedly excessive.
Some antiquaries have imagined that the German imprecation "Das dich der Drus hole" may be traced to the traditional dread of this terrible conqueror.
The country was widely devastated, and immense multitudes were carried away from their homes and transplanted to the Gallic bank of the Rhine.
Such was the horror occasioned by the advance of the Romans, that the German women often dashed their babes against the ground, and then flung their mangled bodies in the faces of the soldiers.
Drusus himself possessed great animal courage.
In battle he endeavoured to engage in personal combat with the chieftains of the enemy, in order to earn the glory of the spolia opima.
He had no contemptible foe to contend against, and though he did not escape unscathed-though, as Varus soon had occasion to feel, the Germanic spirit was not quelled-he certainly accomplished an important work in subjugating the tribes between the Rhine and the Weser, and erecting fortresses to preserve his conquests.
According to Florus, he erected upwards of fifty fortresses along the banks    of the Rhine, besides building two bridges across that river, and establishing garrisons and guards on the Meuse, the Weser, and the Elbe.
He impressed the Germans not leas by the opinion of his intellect and character than by the terror of his arms.
They who resisted had to dread his unflinching firmness and severity, but they who submitted might rely on his good faith.
He did not, like his successor, Varus, rouse and inflame opposition by tyrannous insolence or wanton cruelty to the conquered.
Whether, educated as he was in scenes of bloodshed, he would have fulfilled the expectations of the people, had he lived to attain the empire, it is impossible to pronounce.
He was undoubtedly, in his kind, one of the great men of his day.
It is not fair to view the characters of one age by the light of another; for he who has lived, says Schiller, so as to satisfy the best of his own time, has lived for all times.

<p>ANTONIA, the wife of Drusus, lived to see the accession of her grandson Caligula to the throne.

<head>Germanicus</head>
<div2 type="chapter" n="1">
<p>GERMANICUS Caesar, the elder, a son of Nero Claudius Drusus, was nephew of the Emperor Tiberius, and brother of the Emperor Claudius.
His birth was most illustrious.
From his father and paternal grandmother (the Empress Livia), he inherited the honours of the Claudii and the Drusi, while his mother, the younger Antonia, was the daughter of the triumvir Antony, and the niece of the Emperor Augustus.
He was born in <date value="-15">B. C. 15</date>, probably in September, for his son Caligula named that month Germanicus, in honour of his father.
His prsenomen is unknown, nor can his original cognomen be ascertained, for the imperial family began now to be above the ordinary rules of hereditary name.
By a decree of the Senate, the elder Drusus, after his death, received the honourable appellation Germanicus, which was also granted to his posterity.
It seems at first to have been exclusively assumed by the
elder son, who afterwards earned an independent title to it by his.
own achievements.
When Augustus, in <date value="4">A. D. 4</date>, adopted Tiberius, and appointed him successor to the empire, the young Germanicus had already, by his promising qualities, gained the favour of the Emperor, who recommended Tiberius to take him as a son.
In subsequent inscriptions and coins he is styled Germanicus Caesar, and in history the relationships which he acquired by adoption are often spoken of in place of the natural relationships of blood and birth.
Upon his adoption into the Julia gens, whatever may have been his formal legal designation, he did not lose the title Germanicus, though his brother Claudius, as having now become the sole legal representative of his father, chose also to assume that cognomen.</p>
<p>In <date value="7">A. D. 7</date>, five years before the legal age, he obtained the quaestorship, and in the same year was sent to assist Tiberius in the war against the Pannonians and Dalmatians.
After a distinguished commencement of his military career, he returned to Rome in A. D. xo, to announce in person the victorious termination of the war, whereupon he was honoured with triumphal insignia (without an actual triumph), and the rank (not the actual office) of praetor, with permission to be a candidate for the consulship before the regular time.</p>
<p>The successes in Pannonia and Dalmatia were followed by the destruction of Varus and his legions.
In <date value="11">A. D. 11</date>, Tiberius was despatched to defend the empire against the Germans, and was accompanied by Germanicus as proconsul.
The two generals crossed the Rhine, made various incursions into the neighbouring territory, and at the beginning of autumn recrossed the river.
Germanicus returned to Rome in the winter, and in the following year discharged the office of consul, though he had never been zedile nor pi zetor.
In the highest magistracy, he did not scruple to appear as an advocate for the accused in courts of justice, and thus increased that popularity which he had formerly earned by pleading for defendants before Augustus.
Nor was he above ministering to the more vulgar pleasures of the people, for at the games of Mars, he let loose two hundred lions in the Circus, and Pliny mentions hib gladiatorial shows.
On the 16th of January, in <date value="13">A. D. 13</date>, Tiberius, having returned to Rome, celebrated that triumph over the Pannonians and Dalmatians, which had been postponed on account of the calamity of Varus; and Germanicus appears to have taken a distinguished part in the celebration.</p>
<p>Germanicus was next sent to Germany with the command of the eight legions stationed on the Rhine; and from this point of his life his history is taken up by the masterly hand of Tacitus.
Upon the death of Augustus, in August, <date value="14">A. D. 14</date>, an alarming mutiny broke out among the legions in Germany and Illyricum.
In the former country the mutiny commenced among the four legions of the Lower Rhine (the
5th, 21st, 1st, and 20th), who were stationed in summer quarters upon
the borders of the Ubii, under the charge to A. Caecina. The time
was come, they thought, to raise the pay of the soldier, to shorten his
period of service, to mitigate the hardships of his military tasks, and to
take revenge on his old enemy, the centurion. Germanicus was in
Gaul, employed in collecting the revenue, when the tidings of the disturbance reached him. He hastened to the camp, and exerted all his
influence to allay discontent and establish order. He was the idol of
the army. His open and affable manners contrasted remarkably with
the hauteur and reserve of Tiberius; and like his father, Drusus, he was
supposed to be an admirer of the ancient republican liberty. Some of
the troops interrupted his harangue, by declaring their reidiness to
place him at the head of the empire; whereupon, as if contaminated
by the guilty proposal, he jumped down from the tribunal whence he
was speaking, declared that he would rather die than forfeit his allegiance, and was about to plunge his sword into his breast, when his
attempt was forcibly stayed by the bystanders.</p>
<p>It was known that the army of the Upper Rhine (consisting of four
legions, the 2d, 13th, 16th, and 14th, which were left in the charge of
Silius), was tainted with the disaffection of the troops under Caecina,
and from motives of policy it was thought necessary to comply with the
demands of the sold;ers. A council was held, and a feigned letter from
Tiberius was concocted, in which, after twenty years of service, a full
discharge was given; and, after sixteen years, an immunity from military tasks, other than the duty of taking part in actions. The legacy
left by Augustus to the troops was to be doubled and discharged. To
satisfy the requisition of the 2ist and 5th legions, who demanded immediate payment, Germanicus exhausted his own purse, and his friends
were equally liberal. Having thus quelled the disturbances in the lower
army by almost unlimited concession, he repaired to the four legions
on the Upper Rhine; and, though they voluntarily took the military
oath of obedience, he prudently granted them the same indulgence
which had been conferred on their disorderly comrades.</p>
<p>The calm was of short duration. Two legions of the Lower Rhine
(the 1st and 20th) had been stationed for the winter at Ara Ubiorum
(between Bonn and Cologne). Hither two deputies from the Senate
arrived with despatches from Germanicus; and the conscience-stricken
soldiers imagined that they were come to revoke the concessions which
had been extorted by fear.
A formidable tumult again arose, and (according to the account of Tacitus) it was only on the departure of Agrippina, the wife of Germanicus, carrying in her bosom her young boy, Caligula, the darling of the camp, and attended by the wives of her husband's friends, that the refiactory legions were smitten with pity and shame.
They could not bear to see so many high-born ladies seek in the foreign protection of the Treveri that security which was denied to them in the camp of their own general; and were so far worked upon by the feelings which this incident occasioned as to inflict summary punishment themselves on the leaders of the revolt.</p>
<p>The other two legions of the Lower Rhine, the 5th and 21st, with whom the mutiny began, remained in a state of discontent and ferment in their winter-quarters at Castra Vetera (Xanten). Germanicus sent word to Cacina, that he was coming with a strong force, and would slaughter them indiscriminately, unless they anticipated his purpose by themselves punishing the guilty.
This object was accomplished in an effectual, but revolting manner, by a secret nocturnal massacre of the disaffected ringleaders.
Germanicus entered the camp while it was still reeking with carnage, ordered the corpses to be buried, and shed many teals on witnessing the sad spectacle.
His emotion at sight of the result was accompanied by disapprobation of the means, which he designated as more befitting the rudeness of the butcher than the skill of the physician.</p>
<p>The soldiers were now anxious to be led to the field, that by the wounds they received in battle they might appease the manes of their brethren in arms; and their general was not unwilling to satisfy this desire.
He crossed the Rhine, and fell upon the villages of the Marsi, whom he surprised and slaughtered by night, during a festive celebration.
He then laid waste the country for fifty miles round, sparing neither age nor sex, levelled to the ground the celebrated temple of Tanfana, and, on his way back to winter-quarters, pushed his troops successfully through the opposing tribes (Bructeri, Tubantes, Usipetes), between the Marsi and the Rhine.</p>
<p>The intelligence of these proceedings affected Tiberius with mingled feelings-pleasure at the suppression of the mutiny among the German legions, anxiety on account of the indulgences by which it was bought, and the glory and popularity acquired by Germanicus.
While he regarded his nephewand adopted son with suspicion and dislike, he commemorated his services in the Senate in terms of elaborate, but manifestly insincere praise.
The Senate, in the absence of Germanicus, and during the continuance of the war, voted that he should have a triumph.</p>
<p>In the beginning of spring, <date value="15">A. D. 15</date>, he fell upon the Catti, burned their chief town Mattium (Maden, near Gudensberg), devastated the country, slaughtered the inhabitants, sparing neither woman nor child, and then returned to the Rhine.
Soon afterwards a deputation arrived from Segestes applying for the assistance of the Roman general.
Segestes had always espoused the cause of the Romans, and had quarreled with his son-in-law, Arminius, the conqueror of Varus.
He was now blockaded by his own people, who despised him for his servile truckling to foreign domination.
Germanicus hastened to his rescue, overcame the besiegers, and not only liberated Segestes, but gained possession of his daughter, Thusnelda, a woman of lofty spirit, who sympathized with the patriotic feelings of her husband, Arminius.
Again Germanicus conducted the army victoriously back to its quarters, and, at the direction of Tiberius, took the title of Imperator.</p>
<p>Arminius, enraged beyond endurance at the captivity of his wife, who was then pregnant, roused to war not only the Cherusci, but all the adjoining tribes.
Germanicus made a division of his forces, in order to divide the force of the enemy.
The infantry were conducted by Cecina through the Bructeri, the cavalry by Pedo through the borders of Friesland, while Germanicus himself, with four legions, embarked in a flotilla, and sailed by the Lacus Flevus (the Zuydersee) to the ocean, and thence up the Ems.
In the vicinity of this river the three divisions formed a junction.
Germanicus ravaged the country between the Ems and the Lippe, and penetrated to the Saltus Teutobergiensis, which was situate between the sources of those two rivers.
In this forest the unburied remains of Varus and his legions had lain for six years bleaching in the air.
With feelings of sorrow and resentment, the Roman army gathered up the bones of their ill-fated comrades, and paid the last honours to their memory.
Germanicus took part in the melancholy solemnity, and laid the first sod of the funeral mound.</p>
<p>Arminius, in the meantime, had assembled his forces, and, retiring into a difficult country, turned upon the pursuing troops of the Romans, who would have sustained a complete defeat had not the legions of Germanicus checked the rout of the cavalry and subsidiary cohorts.
As it was, the general thought it prudent to retreat in the same three-fold division in which he had advanced.
Pedo, with the cavalry, was ordered to keep the coast, and Cacina, with all speed, to get across the Pontes Longi, a mounded causeway leading over the marshes between Cosfeld and Velen, and along the banks of the Yssel.
Caecina, in whose division Agrippina travelled, was obliged to fight his way hardly.
Germanicus himself returned to the station on the Rhine bywater, and,
in a gusty night, was well nigh losing the 2d and T4th legions, who, under the command of P. Vitellius, marched along a dangerous shore, exposed to the wind and tide, for the sake of lightening the burden of the transport vessels.
The greater part, nevertheless, after many difficulties and adventures, succeeded in making their way to the river Unsingis (Hunse), where they rejoined the flotilla, and were taken on board.
When the army arrived at its destination, Germanicus visited the sick and wounded, and contributed from his own purse to the wants of the soldiers.</p>
<p>In the next year (<date value="16">A. D. 16</date>), warned by the losses he had recently sustained from the deficiency of his fleet, he gave orders for the building of a thousand vessels, and appointed as the place of rendezvous that part of the Batavian island where the Vahalis (Waal) diverges from the Rhine.
With such aid, he hoped to facilitate the transport of men and provisions, and to avoid the dangerous necessity of marching through bogs and forests.
In the meantime, hearing that Aliso, a castle bn the Lippe, was besieged, he hastened to its defence; but on his arrival, found that the besiegers had dispersed.
However, he was not left without employment.
The mound erected to the memory of the legions of Varus had been thrown down by the Germans; and an ancient altar, built in honour of his father, was in a state of dilapidation.
These he restored and repaired.
The causeways between Aliso and the Rhine were in want of new moats and landmarks.
These works he completed.</p>
<p>The fleet being now ready he entered the canal of his father, Drusus, whom he invoked to favour his enterprise; and after sailing through the Zuydersee to the ocean, landed at Amisia, a place near the mouth of the river Amisia (Ems), on the left bank.
He then marched upward along the course of the river, leaving his fleet behind.
Arminius was on the further side of the Weser, in command of the Cherusci; and in order to get to the Weser it was necessary to cross the Ems.
The delay occasioned by the necessity of forming a bridge across the Ems, and the difficulty of the passage, made Germanicus feel his error in landing on the left bank, and leaving his galleys at Amisia  He had still greater difficulty in effecting the passage of the Weser ii the face of the enemy.
Seeing now that an important action was at hand, he determined to ascertain for himself the temper and feelings of the troops.
Accordingly, in the beginning of the night, accompanied by a single attendant, he went secretly into the camp, listened by the side of the tents, and enjoyed his own fame.
He heard the praise of his graceful form, his noble birth, his patience, his courtesy, his steady consistency of con   duct.
He found that his men were eager to show their loyalty and gratitude to their general, and to slake their vengeance in the field of battle.
His sleep that night was blessed by a dream of happy omen, and on the next day, when the troops were all ready for action, eight eagles were seen to enter the woods.
Germanicus cried out to the legions, "Come on, follow the Roman birds, your own divinities."
A great victory was gained with little loss to the Romans, Arminius having barely escaped, after smearing his face with his own blood, in order to disguise his features.
His uncle, Inguiomar, had an equally narrow escape.
This battle was fought upon the plain of Idistavisus (between Rinteler and Hausberg), and was celebrated by a trophy of arms erected upon the spot.
A second engagement took place soon afterwards, in a position where the retreat of both parties was cut off by the nature of the ground in their rear, so that the only hope consisted in valour-the only safety in victory.
The result was equally successful to the Romans. In the heat of action, Germanicus, that he might be better known, uncovered his head, and cried out to the troops "to keep on killing, and take no prisoners, since the only way to end the war was to exterminate the race."
It was late at night before the legions ceased from their bloody task.
In honour of this second victory a trophy was erected, with the inscription: "The army of Tiberius Casar, having subdued the nations between the Rhine and the Elbe, dedicates this monument to Mars, and Jupiter, and Augustus."
No mention was made of the name of Germanicus.</p>
<p>The summer was already far advanced, when Germanicus, with the greater part of the troops, sailed back by the Ems to the ocean.
During the voyage a terrific storm occurred: several of the ships were sunk; and Germanicus, whose vessel was stranded on the shore of the Chauci, bitterly accused himself as the author of so gross a disaster, and could scarcely be prevented by his friends from flinging himself into the sea, where so many of his followers perished.
However, he did not yield to inactive grief.
Lest the Germans should be encouraged by the Roman losses, he sent Silius on an expedition against the Catti, while he himself attacked the Marsi; and, by the treacherous information of their leader, Malovendus, recovered one of the eagles which had belonged to the legion of Varus.
Emboldened by success, he carried havoc and desolation into the country of the enemy, who were struck with dismay when they saw that shipwreck, and hardship, and loss, only increased the ferocity of the Romans.</p>
<p>Germanicus had, some time previously, received intimation of the wish of Tiberius to remove him from Germany, and to give him command in the East, where Parthia and Armenia were in commotion on account of the dethronement of Vonones.
Knowing that his time was short, he hastened his operations; and upon his return to winter-quarters, felt convinced that another campaign would suffice for the successful termination of the war.
But the summons of Tiberius now grew pressing.
He invited Germanicus to come home, and take the triumph which had been voted to him, offered him a second consulship, suggested that more might now be gained by address than by force of arms, reminded him of the severe losses with which his successes were purchased, and appealed to his modesty by hinting that he ought to leave an opportunity to his adoptive brother, Drusus, of acquiring laurels in the only field where they could now be gathered.
This touched-one of the true reasons of his recall, for the Emperor, though willing to play him off against Drusus, had no desire that his popularity should throw Drusus completely into the shade.
Germanicus had petitioned for another year, in order to complete what he had begun, but he could not resist the mandate of Tiberius, though he saw that envy was the real cause of withdrawing from his grasp an honour which he had already earned.</p>
<p>On his return to Rome he was received with warm and enthusiastic greeting, the whole population pouring forth to meet him twenty miles from the city, and on the 26th of May, <date value="17">A. D. 17</date>, he celebrated his triumph over the Cherusci, Catti, Angrivarii, and other tribes, as far as the Elbe.
His five children adorned his car, and many of the most illustrious Germans ministered to the pomp of their conqueror.
Among others, Thusnelda, the wife of Arminius, followed in the procession of captives.</p>
<p>The whole of the Eastern provinces were assigned, by a decree of the Senate, to Germanicus, with the highest imperium; but Tiberius placed Cn. Piso in command of Syria, and was supposed to have given him secret instructions to check and thwart Germanicus, though such instructions were scarcely wanted, for Piso was naturally of a proud and rugged temper, unused to obedience.
His wife, Plancina, too, was of a haughty and domineering spirit, and was encouraged by Livia, the empress-mother, to vie with and annoy Agrippina.</p>
<p>In <date value="18">A. D. 18</date>, Germanicus entered upon his second consulship at Nicopolls, a city of Achaia, whither he had arrived by coasting the Illyrian shore, after a visit to Drusus in Dalmatia.
He then surveyed the scene of the battle of Actium, which was peculiarly interesting to him, from his family connection with Augustus and Antony.
He had an anxious desire to view the renowned sites of ancient story and classic lore.
At Athens he was welcomed with the most distinguished honour, and, in    compliment to the city, went attended with a single lictor.
At Ilium, his memory reverted to Homer's poem, and to the origin of the Roman race.
At Colophon he landed, to consult the oracle of the Clarian Apollo, and it is said that the priest darkly foreboded his early fate.</p>
<p>At Rhodes he fell in with Plso, whom he saved from danger of shipwreck, but Piso, not appeased by his generosity, hurried on to Syria, and, by every artifice and corruption, endeavoured to acquire favour for himself, and to heap obloquy on Germanicus.
Plancina, in like manner, cast insult and reproach on Agrippina.
Though this conduct did not escape the knowledge of Germanicus, he hastened to fulfill the object of his mission, and proceeded to Armenia, placed the crown upon the head of Zeno, reduced Cappadocia to the form of a province, and gave Q. Srvaeu; the command of Comragene.
He then spent the winter in Syria, where, without any open and violent rupture, he and Piso scarcely attempted to conceal in each other's presence their mutual feelings of displeasure and hatred.
In compliance with the request of Artabanus, king of the Parthians, Germanicus removed Vonones, the deposed monarch, to Pompeiopolis, a maritime town of Cilicia.
This he did with the greater pleasure, as it was mortifying to Piso, with whom Vonones was an especial favourite, from his presents and obsequious attention to Plancina.</p>
<p>In the following year, <date value="19">A. D. 19</date>, Germanicus visited Egypt, induced by his love of travel and antiquity, and ignorant of the offence which he was giving to Tiberius; for it was one of the arcana of state, established by Augustus, that Egypt was not to be entered by any Roman of high rank without the special permission of the Emperor.
From Canopus, he sailed up the Nile, gratifying his taste for the marvellous and the old.
The ruins of Thebes, the hieroglyphical inscriptions, the vocal statue of Memnon, the pyramids, the reservoirs of the Nile, excited and rewarded his curiosity.
He consulted Apis as to his own fortunes, and received the prediction of an untimely end.</p>
<p>On his return to Syria, he found that every thing had gone wrong during his absence.
His orders, military and civil, had been neglected or positively disobeyed.
Hence arose a bitter interchange of reproaches between him and Piso, whom he ordered to depart from Egypt.
Being soon afterward seized with an attack of illness, he attributed his distemper to the sorcery practiced against him by Piso.
In accordance with an ancient Roman custom, which required a denunciation of hostility between private individuals as well as between states, in order that they might be fair enemies, Germanicus sent Piso a letter renouncing his friendship.
It is remarkable that a similar custom existed in the
middle ages, in the diffidatio or defiance of feudal chivalry, preparatory to private war.
Whether there were real ground for the suspicion of poisoning which Germanicus himself entertained against Piso and Plan.
cina, it is impossible now to decide with certainty.
Germanicus seems to have been of a nervous and credulous temperament.
He could not bear the sight of a cock, nor the sound of its crow.
Wherever he met with the sepulchres of illustrious men, he offered sacrifices to their manes.
The poisoning, which he now sp ected, was not of a natural kind; it was a veneficum, partaking "&gt; magic, if we may judge from the proofs by which it was supposed to be evidenced :-pieces of human flesh, charms, and maledictions, leaden plates inscribed with the name of Germanicus, half burnt ashes moistened with putrid blood, and other sorceries by which lives are said to be devoted to the infernal deities, were found imbedded in the walls and foundations of his house.
Feeling his end approaching, he summoned his friends, and called upon them to avenge his foul murder.
Soon after he breathed his last, on the 9th of October, <date value="19">A. D. 19</date>, in the thirty-fourth year of his age, at Epidaphne near Antioch.
His corpse was exposed in the forum at Antioch, before it was burnt, and Tacitus candidly admits that it bore no decisive marks of poison, though Suetonius speaks of livid marks over the whole body, and foam at the mouth, and goes on to report that, after the burning, the heart was found unconsumed among the bones,a supposed symptom of death by poison.</p>
<p>Germanicus, as he studiously sought popularity by such compliances as lowering the price of corn, walking abroad without military guard, and conforming to the national costume, so he possessed in an extraor dinary degree the faculty of winning human affection.
The savageness of his German wars fell heavily upon the barbarians, with whom he had no community of feeling.
To those who came in personal communication with him, he was a mild-mannered man.
In governing his own army his discipline was gentle, and he was evidently averse to harsh measures.
He had not that ambition of supreme command which often accompanies the power of commanding well, nor was he made of that stern stuff which would have enabled him to cope with and control a refractory subordinate officer with the cleverness and activity of Piso.
He was a man of sensitive feeling, chaste and temperate, and possessed all the amiable virtues which spread a charm over social and family intercourse.
His dignified person, captivating eloquence, elegant and refined taste, cultivated understanding, high sense of honour, unaffected courtesy, frank munificence, and polished manners, befitted a Roman prince of his exalted station, and seemed: to, justify the general hope    that he might live to dispense, as emperor, the blessings of his government over the Roman world.
He shines with fairer light from the dark atmosphere of crime and tyranny which shrouds the time that succeeded his death.</p>
<p>The sorrow that was felt for the death of Germanicus was intense.
Foreign potentates shared the lamentation of the Roman people, and in token of mourning abstained from their usual amusements.
At home unexampled honours were decreed to his memory.
It was ordered that his name should be inserted in the Salian hymns, that his curule chair, mounted with crowns of oak leaves, should always be set in the public shows, in the space reserved for the priests of Apollo, that his statue in ivory should be carried in procession at the opening of the games of the Circus, and that the flamines and augurs who succeeded him should be taken from the Julian gens.
A public tomb was built for him at Antioch.
A  triumphal arch was erected in his honour on mount Amanus, in Syria, with an inscription recounting his achievements, and stating that he had died for his country, and other monuments to his memory were constructed at Rome, and on the banks of the Rhine.
The original grief broke out afresh when Agrippina arrived in Italy with his ashes, which were deposited in the tomb of Augustus.
But the Roman people were dissatisfied with the stinted obsequies with which, on this occasion, the ceremony was conducted by desire of Tiberius.</p>
<p>By Agrippina he had nine children, three of whom  died young, while the others survived him.
Of those who survived, the most notorious were the Emperor Caius Caligula and Agrippina, the mother of Nero.</p>
<p>Germanicus was an author of some repute, and not only an orator, but a poet.
Of the Greek comedies (mentioned by Suetonius) which he composed, we have no fragments left, but the remains of his Latin translation of the Pheanomena of Aratus evince considerable skill in versification, and are superior in merit to the similar work of Cicero.
By some critics the authorship of this work has been, without sufficient cause, denied to Germanicus.
We have also fragments of his Diosemeia or Prognostica, a physical poem, compiled frim Greek sources.
Of the epigrams ascribed to him, that on the Thracian boy has been much admired.</p>
<p>The eventful life and tragic death of Germanicus, embellished by the picturesque narrative of Tacitus, have rendered him a favourite hero of the stage.  There is an English play with the title, "Germanicus, a tragedy, by a Gentleman of the University of Oxford, London, <date value="1775">1775</date>."
Germanicus also gives name to several French tragedies.</p>
<p>Popular belief in the guilt of Piso was so strong that Tiberius could not refuse an investigation into the matter, which was conducted by the Senate.
As it proceeded, the Emperor seemed to have made up his mind to sacrifice his tool to the general indignation; but.
before the investigation came to an end, Piso was found one morning in his room with his throat cut, and his sword lying by his side.
It was generally supposed that, despairing of the Emperor's protection, he had put an end to his own life; but others believed that Tiberius dreaded his revealing his secrets, and had accordingly caused him to be put to death.

<div1 type="life" n="agrippina1">
<head>Agrippina I</head>
<div2 type="chapter" n="1">
<p>AGRIPPINA I., the youngest daughter of M. Vipsanius Agrippa and of Julia, the daughter of Augustus, was born some time before <date value="-12">B. C. 12</date>. She married Csesar Germanicus, the son of Drusus Nero Germanicus, by whom  she had nine children.
Agrippina was gifted with great powers of mind, a noble character, and all the moral and physical qualities that constituted the model of a Roman matron: her love for her husband was sincere and lasting, her chastity was spotless, her fertility was a virtue in the eyes of the Romans, and her attachment to her children was an eminent feature of her character.
She yielded to one dangerous passion, ambition.
Augustus showed her particular attention and attachment.
At the death of Augustus, in <date value="14">A. D. 14</date>, she was on the Lower Rhine with Germanicus, who commanded the legions there.
Her husband was the idol of the army, and the legions on the Rhine, dissatisfied with the accession of Tiberius, manifested their intention of proclaiming Germanicus master of the state.
Tiberius hated and dreaded Germanicus, and he showed as much antipathy to Agrippina as he had love to her elder sister, his first wife.
In this perilous situation Germanicus and Agrippina saved themselves by their prompt energy; he quelled the outbreak, and pursued the war against the Germans.
In the ensuing year his lieutenant, Caecina, after having made an invasion into Germany, returned to the Rhine.
The campaign was not inglorious for the Romans, but they were worn out by hardships, and perhaps harassed on their march by some bands of Germans.
Thus the rumour was spread that the main body of the Germans %as approaching to invade Gaul.
Germanicus was absent, and it was proposed to destroy the bridge over the Rhine.
If this had been done, the retreat of Cacina's army would have been cut off, but it was saved by the firm
opposition of Agrippina.
When the troops approached, she went to the bridge, acting as a general, and receiving the soldiers as they crossed it; the wounded among them were presented by her with clothes, and they received from her own hands everything necessary for the cure of their wounds.</p>
<p>Germanicus having been recalled by Tiberius, she accompanied her husband to Asia (<date value="17">A. D. 17</date>), and after his death, or rather murder, she returned to Italy.
She stayed some days at the island of Corcyra to recover from her grief, and then landed at Brundlsium, accompanied by two of her children, and holding in her arms the urn with the ashes of her husband.
At the news of her arrival, the port, the walls, and even the roofs of the houses were occupied by crowds of people who were anxious to see and salute her.
She was solemnly received by the officers of two praotorian cohorts, which Tiberius had sent to Brundisium for the purpose of accompanying her to Rome.
The urn containing the ashes of Germanicus was borne by tribunes and centurions, and the funeral procession was received on its march by the magistrates of Calabria, Apulia, and Campania; by Drusus, the son of Tiberius; Claudius, the brother of Germanicus; by the other children of German icus; and, at last, in the environs of Rome, by the consuls, the Senate, and crowd, of the Roman people.
During some years Tiberius disguised his hatred of Agrippina; but she soon became exposed to secret accusations and intrigues, and was finally banished to the island of Pandataria (<date value="30">A. D. 30</date>), where her mother, Julia, had died in exile.  Her sons Nero and.
Drusus were banished, and both died an unnatural death.  She lived
three years on that barren island; at last she refused to take any food,
and died, most probably, by voluntary starvation. Her death took
place in <date value="33">A. D. 33</date>. The ashes of Agrippina, and those of her son Nero,
were afterwards brought to Rome by order of her son, the Emperor
Caligula, who struck various medals in honour of his mother.

<div1 type="life" n="sallust">
<head><rs key="Sallust">C. Sallustius Crispus</rs></head>
<div2 type="chapter" n="1">
<p>CAIUS SALLUSTIUS CRISPUS, commonly known as SALLUST, was born in <date value="-86">B. C. 86</date>, in the seventh consulship of Marius, at Amiternum, a town in the country of the Sabines, near the sources of the Aternus.
He was of a plebeian family; but his parents seem to have been in affluent circumstances.
He received instruction from  the grammarian Atteius Philologus, who is said to have supplied him with an epitome of Roman
history, from which he might choose subjects for his own composition.
The year in which he obtained the quastorship is not known, but he was tribune of the plebs in <date value="-52">B. C. 52</date>, in which year Clodius was killed by Milo.</p>
<p>Sallust was a strong opponent of the aristocratical party, and accordingly ia hi, tribuneship took an active part in the proceedings instituted against Milo.
In <date value="-50">B. C. 50</date>, he was expelled from the Senate by the censors Appius Claudius and Piso, in consequence, it is said, of his immoral life, but there is no good authority for this statement of the grounds of his expulsion, while we know that Appius Claudius belonged to the Pompeian party, and that Sallut only shared the general fate of all Caesar's friends.
After his expulsion from the Senate, Sallust seems to have repaired to Caesar's camp in Gaul, and to have accompanied him in his invasion of Italy.
According to some accounts he was made questor again after the battle of Pharsalia (<date value="-48">B. C. 48</date>); but we know for certain that he was praetor in the following year (<date value="-47">B. C. 47</date>), and was present at the mutiny of Caesar's troops in Campania, on which occasion he narrowly escaped with his life.
He accompanied Caesar the same year into Africa, where he was actively employed in the war, and when Caesar quitted Africa in the following year (<date value="-46">B. C. 46</date>), he left Sallust governor of the province, where, according to Dion Cassius, he acquired immense wealth by the plunder of the country.
On his return home, Sallust built the famous palace at Rome, which was afterwards used by the emperors, and was not destroyed till the time of Alaric.
About this time he is said to have married Terentia, the divorced wife of Cicero.
He died <date value="-34">B. C. 34</date>, four years before the battle of Actium.</p>
<p>The moral character of Sallust has been drawn in the darkest colours by many writers.
He has been accused of the most unbounded profligacy, which has been represented as the more inexcusable on account of the praises he has bestowed in his works upon virtue and temperance.
These accusations, however, do not rest upon any sufficient authority, unless we accept the tale told by Varro, that Sallust was detected in adultery with Milo's wife, and severely punished by the husband, to which circumstance the words of Horace (' Sat.,' i. 2, 41), " ille flagellis ad mortem caesis," refer, according to one of the ancient scholiasts.</p>
<p>Sallust was a strong party man.
He thoroughly despised and hated the aristocratical party, and took no pains to conceal his opinion He had designated Pompey, the leader of the aristocracy, as a man <foreign lang="la">"oris improbi, animo inverecundo,"</foreign> and accordingly it was only to be expected that his own character should be attacked and traduced in every possible manner.
Lenaeus, the freedman of Pompey, wrote a work expressly against Sallust; and a rhetorician under the early emperors, when it had become the fashion to praise the old Pompeian party, wrote a declamation against the character of Sallust, which is still extant, and falsely ascribed to Cicero.
That Sallust was not better than his contemporaries may easily be believed, and there seems no reason for doubting the statement of Dion Cassius, that he followed the example of his contemporaries in plundering the province of which he was governor.</p>
<p>Sallust wrote a history of Catiline's conspiracy, and of the war with Jugurtha, and also a general history of Roman affairs from the death of Sulla (<date value="-78">B. C. 78</date>) to the appointment of Pompey to the command of the Mithridatic war (<date value="-67">B. C. 67</date>). The first two works have come down to us entire; but of the latter we have only fragments; and its loss is the more to be regretted as it contained an account of one of the most important periods of Roman history, respecting which our information is very meagre and unsatisfactory.
It was written in five or six books, addressed to Lucullas, and appears to have contained an introduction, in which an account was given of the civil wars between Sulla and Marius.
It connected his histories of the Jugurthine war and the Catilinarian conspiracy.
The only fragments of it of any length are four orations and two letters, which are characterised by Sallust's usual style.</p>
<p>The merits of Sallust, both as a historian and a philosopher, have been rated very low by many modern critics.
The objections which have been made to the moral reflections and dissertations in Sallust's writings, as unsuitable to the nature of historical compositions, have arisen from a want of due attention to the object which the historian had in view.
This does not appear to have been so much the narration of the particular events which he chose as the subjects of his history, as the elucidation of certain great political facts.
In his " Jugurtha" his object was to show the venality and total want of principle in the aristocratical party, and how both their private and public profligacy at length deprived them of the power which they had possessed since the time of the Gracchi.
In his " Catiline" he had the same object to a certain extent in view, though here it was not to show how the vices of the aristocratical party occasioned their loss of power, but rather to describe the consequences to which those vices had at length led ; for it must be remembered that Catiline and his associates had been brought up in the school of Sulla, and belonged to the aristocracy.</p>
<p>In estimating the value of Sallust's writings, it should also be borne in mind that the Romans possessed no works worthy of the name of histories before his time.
Preceding writers merely narrated events   	 according to the order of the years in which they happened, without any attempt to trace the causes and results of the events which they recorded.
Sallust studiously avoided the annalistic style of his predecessors, and appears to have made Thucydides his model, to whom he is sometimes compared by the ancients themselves.</p>
<p>Besides the works already mentioned, two epistles have come down to us under the name of Sallust, addressed to Julius Caesar, on the management of the state (" De Republica Ordinanda "); but these are evidently not the work of Sallust, and are supposed by Niebuhr to have been written, at the latest, in the second century of the Christian era.
There is also extant a declamation against Cicero, falsely ascribed to Sallust.</p>
<p>His language is generally concise and perspicuous: perhaps his love of brevity may have caused the ambiguity that is sometimes found in his sentences.
He also affected archaic words. Though he has considerable merit as a writer, his art is always apparent.
Hie had no pretensions to great research or precision about facts; and, probably, the grammarian, Atteius Philologus, may have helped his indolence by collecting materials for him.
His reflections have often something of the same artificial and constrained character as his expressions.
One may judge that style was what he thought of more than matter.</p>
<p>We have no means of judging how far Sallustius was superior, as a writer, to Sulla, L. Lucullus, and Sisenna.
He was not above his contemporaries as a politician: he was a party man, and there are no indications of any comprehensive views which had a whole nation for their object.
He hated the nobility, as a man may do, without loving the people.

<head>Cornelius Nepos</head>
<div2 type="chapter" n="1">
<p>CORNELIUS NEPOS, a native of Hostilia (now Ostiglia) on the Po, was a Roman writer and a friend of Cicero, who speaks of Nepos in several of his letters.
Macrobius quotes the second book of Cicero's Epistles to Cornelius Nepos, which have not come down to us. Lactantius mentions Nepos's Letters to Cicero, and Aulus Gellus speaks of Nepos's "Life of Cicero."
Catullus dedicated his poems to him. Nepos, however, was most intimate with Pomponius Atticus, whom he survived a few years, and whose life he wrote.
He also wrote a short notice of Cato the Censor, in which he says that, at the particular request of T. Pomponius Atticus, he had written a more extended biography of Cato, which however has been lost.
According to the old scholiasts, the lives of Atticus and Cato formed part of a larger work of Nepos, <title lang="la">"De Historicis Latinis."</title>
In a passage in the Life of Dion in the <title lang="la">"Vitae Imperatorum,"</title> attributed to Nepos, the author mentions a work which he had written <title>"On the Greek Historians,"</title> and the Grammarian Charisius quotes a sentence of the sixteenth book <title lang="la">"Illustrium Virorum"</title> of Cornelius Nepos.</p>
<p>The work styled <title lang="la">"Vitae Imperatorum,"</title> not being mentioned by any ancient writer, was for a long time attributed to Aemilius Probus, who lived in the fourth century, and who in the manuscripts appears as having presented a copy of the book to the Emperor Theodosius I., and prefixed to it some verses in which he stems to claim the authorship.
Accordingly the earlier editions of the <title lang="la">"Vitae Imperatorum,"</title> the first by Janson, <date value="1471">1471</date>, that of <date value="1506">1506</date>, and others, were entitled <title lang="la">"Probi Aemilii Excellentium Imperatorum Vitae."</title>
But afterwards the critics began to question the claims of Probus to the authorship of the work.
The style and especially the sentiments of the lives certainly appear not suited to a writer of the age of Theodosius, such as the manifest disapprobation of a monarchical government, which is exhibited in many passages.
It is remarkable that the author in his preface addresses the work to Atticus; and yet at the end of the last life, that of Hannibal, when speaking of the uncertainty about the date of that great commander's death, he says that "Atticus, in his 'Annals,' had left it written that Hannibal died under the consulship of M. C. Marcellus and Q. F. Labeo"; speaking thus of Atticus as of a person dead.
After the first editions of the <title lang="la">"Vitae Imperatorum"</title> were published, Petrus Comerus found in an old manuscript containing the letters of Cicero to Atticus, the life of Atticus, and the short notice of Cato the Censor above mentioned. These two biographies were published together with the <title lang="la">"Vitae Imperatorum,"</title> and the whole under the name of Aemilius Probus, contrary to all evidence, as the author of those two biographies speaks of Atticus as a personal acquaintance.
At last Lambini, in the commentary to his edition of the <title lang="la">"Imperatorum Vitae,"</title> <date value="1568">1568</date>, asserted the claims of Nepos as author of the whole.
But several solecisms and barbarisms which occur in the <title lang="la">"Vitae"</title> appearing to invalidate Lambini's supposition, as not being likely to occur in a writer of the Augustan age, Barth and some other critics have supposed that Probus abridged the original work of Nepos in the same manner as Justin has epitomised the history of Trogus Pompeius.
Vossius, however, Funccius, and others, maintain that there is nothing in the <title lang="la">"Vitae Imperatorum"</title> which could not have
been written by the Cornelius Nepos of the Augustan age, and that neither Probus nor any writer of the Theodosian age could have written in so pure a Roman style.</p>
<p>The <title lang="la">"Vitae Imperatorum"</title> are short biographies of twenty Greek and of two Carthagenian (Hamilcar Barcas and Hannibal) commanders.
From a passage at the end of the last it appears that the author intended to write also the lives of the great Roman commanders, "that their exploits might be compared with those of the Greek, in order to judge which were the greatest."
These lives of the Roman commanders, if ever written, have not come down to us, but it seems that some of them at least were written, and, it would appear, by Nepos, as Plutarch quotes the authority of Nepos for facts concerning the lives of Marcellus and Lucullus.
The <title lang="la">"Vitae Imperatorum,"</title> besides the faults in language which are pointed out by Tzschucke, contain many erroneous statements of facts, such as mistaking Miltiades, the son of Cypselus, for the great Miltiades, the son of Cimon; confounding the battle of Mycale with that of the Eurymedon, and others which are noticed by Tzschucke and Schoell.
The author, however, gives many details of private life and manners, which are curious, as in the life of Epaminondas.  The sentiments expressed by the author of the <title lang="la">"Vitae"</title> are generous and virtuous, though often puerile and trifling.
The sketch of the character of Alcibiades has been admired for its graphic touches; but the life of Pomponius Atticus is much better both for the matter and manner than any of the rest, and, although too panegyrical, gives a lively description of his character.
It has been translated into English by Sir Matthew Hale, <date value="1677">1677</date>, and by the Rev. E. Berwick, <date value="1813">1813</date>.

<div1 type="head" n="livy">
<head>T. Livius</head>
<div2 type="chapter" n="1">
<p>TITUS Livius may be ranked among the most celebrated historians the world has ever produced.
He composed a history of Rome from the foundation of the city to the conclusion of the German war conducted by Drusus in the time of the Emperor Augustus.
This great work consisted originally of one hundred and forty books, of which there now remain only thirty-five, viz., the first ten, and the whole from book twenty-one to book forty-five, both inclusive.
Of the other hundred and five books, nothing more has survived the ravages of time and barbarians than their general contents.
In a perspicuous arrangement of his subject, in a full and circumstantial account of transactions,
in the delineation of characters and other objects of description, in justness and aptitude of sentiment, and in an air of majesty pervading the whole composition, this author may be regarded as one of the best models extant of historical narrative.
His style is splendid without meretricious ornament, and copious without being redundant; a fluency to which Quinlilian gives the expressive appellation of " lactea ubertas."
Amongst the beauties which we admire in his writings, besides the animated  speeches frequently interspersed, are  those concise and peculiarly applicable eulogiurhs, with which he characterizes every eminent person mentioned at the close of their life.
Of his industry in collating, and his judgment in deciding upon the preference due to dissentient authorities in matters of testimony the work affords numberless proofs.
Of the freedom and impartiality with which he treated even of the recent periods of history, there cannot be more convincing evidence than that he was rallied by Augustus as a favourer of Pompey; and that, under the same emperor, he not only bestowed upon Cicero the tribute of warm approbation, but dared to ascribe, in an age when their names were obnoxious, even to Brutus and Cassius the virtues of consistency and patriotism.
If in anything the conduct of Livy violates our sentiments of historical dignity, it is the apparent complacency and reverence with which he everywhere mentions the popular belief in omens and prodigies; but this was the general superstition of the times; and totally to renounce the prejudices of superstitious education is the last heroic sacrifice to philosophical scepticism.
In general, however, the credulity of Livy appears to be rather affected than real.</p>
<p>Livy was born at Patavium (Padua), <date value="-59">B. C. 59</date>, and has been charged by Asinius Polllo, and others, with the provincial dialect of his country.
The objections to his Pativinity, as it is called, relate chiefly to the spelling of some words; in which, however, there seems to be nothing so peculiar as either to occasion any obscurity or merit reprehension.
Livy and Sallust being the only two existing rivals in Roman history, it may not be improper to draw a short comparison between them, in respect of their principal qualities as writers.
With regard to language, there is less apparent affectation in Livy than in Sallust.
The narrative of both is distinguished by an elevation of style: the elevation of Sallust seeming to be often supported by the dignity of assumed virtue; that of Livy by a majestic air of historical, and sometimes national, importance   In delineating characters, Sallust infuses more expression, and Livy more fulness.
into the features. In the speeches ascribed to particular persons, these writers are equally elegant and animated.</p>
<p>So great was the fame of Livy in his own lifetime that people came from the extremity of Spain and Gaul, for the purpose only of beholding so celebrated a historian, who was regarded, for his abilities, as a prodigy.
This affords a strong proof, not only of the literary taste which then prevailed over the most extensive of the Roman provinces, but of the extraordinary pains with which so great a work must have been propagated, when the art of printing was unknown.
In the fifteenth century, on the revival of learning in Europe, the name of this great writer recovered its ancient veneration; and Alphonso of Arragon, with a superstition characteristic of that age, requested of the people of Padua, where Livy was born, and was believed to be buried, to be favoured by them with the hand which had written so admirable a work.</p>
<p>(The following paragraph is from the pen of Prof. William Ramsay.) The memoirs of most men terminate with their death; but this is by no means the case with our historian, since some circumstances closely connected with what may be fairly termed his personal history, excited no small commotion in his native city many centuries after his decease.
About the year <date value="1360">1360</date> a tablet was dug up at Padua, within the monastery of St. Justina, which occupied the site of an ancient temple of Jupiter, or of Juno, or of Concordia, according to the conflicting hypotheses of local antiquaries.
The stone bore the following inscription: <foreign lang="la">V. F. T. LIVIUS. LIVIAE. T. F. QUARTAE. L. HALYS. CONCORDIALIS. PATAVI. SIBI.
ET. SUIS.
OMNIBUS</foreign>, which was at first interpreted to mean <foreign lang="la">Vivus fecit Titus Livius Liviae Titi filii quartae (sc. uxori), Lucii Halys Concordialis Patavi sibi et suis ominbus.</foreign>
Some imagined that QUARTE. L. HALYS denoted Quarte legionis Halys, but this opinion was overthrown without difficulty, because even at that time it was well known that L. is seldom if ever used in inscriptions as an abbreviation of LEGIO; and, secondly, because the fourth legion was entitled Scythica and not Halys.
It was then decided that QUARTAE must indicate the fourth daughter of Livius, and that L. HALYS must be the name of her husband; and  ingenious persons endeavoured  to show  that in all probability he was identical with the L. Magius mentioned by Seneca.
They also persuaded themselves that Livy, upon his return home, had been installed by his countrymen in the dignified office of priest of the goddess Concord, and had erected this monument within the walls of her sanctuary, marking the place of sepulture of himself and family.
Accordingly, the Benedictine fathers of the monastery transported the tablet to the vestibule of their chapel, and caused a portrait of Livy to be painted beside it. In <date value="1413">1413</date>, about fifty years after this discovery, in digging the foundations for the erection of new
buildings in connection with the monastery, the workmen reached an ancient pavement composed of square bricks cemented with lime.
This having been broken through, a leaden coffin became visible, which was found to contain human bones.
An old monk declared that this was the very spot above which the tablet had been found, when immediately the cry rose that the remains of Livy had been brought to light, a report which filled the whole city with extravagant joy.
The new-found treasure was deposited in the town hall, and to the ancient tablet a modern epitaph was affixed.
At a subsequent period a costly monument was added as a further tribute to his memory.
In the lapse of time, however, it was perceived, upon comparing the tablet dug up in the monastery of St. Justina, with others of a similar description, that the contractions had been erroneously explained, and consequently the whole tenor of the words misunderstood.
It was clearly proved that L. did not stand for Lucius, but for LIBERTUS, and that the principal person named was Titus Livius Halys, freedman of Livia, the fourth daughter of a Titus Livius; that he had, in accordance with the usual custom, adopted the designation of his former master; that he had been a priest of Concord at Padua, an office which it appeared from other records had often been filled by persons in his station, and that he had set up this stone to mark the burying-ground of himself and his kindred.
Now since the supposition that the skeleton in the leaden coffin was that of the historian rested solely upon the authority of the inscription, when this support was withdrawn, the whole fabric of conjecture fell to the ground, and it became evident that the relics were those of an obscure freedman.

<div1 type="life" n="pollio">
<head>C. Asinius Pollio</head>
<div2 type="chapter" n="1">
<p>CAIUS ASINIUS POLLIO was born <date value="-76">B. C. 76</date>, and appears to have been descended from a family of no great consequence.
He is called by Catullus a Marrucinian, and was probably a descendant of Herius Asinius, who commanded the Marrucini in the Marsic war, and was killed in battle.
We first read of Pollio as the public accuser of C. Cato (B. C.
54), who was acquitted through the influence of Pompey. On the
breaking out of the civil war between Casar and Pompey, Pollio took
the side of Casar, and accompanied him in the passage of the Rubicon.
He was afterwards sent by Casar, under the command of Curio, to
Sicily and Africa, and after the defeat of Curio by Juba, he escaped
with a few of the forces to the neighbourhood of Utica, and thence
passed over to Italy to join Caesar.
He was present at the battle of Pharsalia, and two years afterwards (<date value="-46">B. C. 46</date>) he accompanied Caesar into Africa and Spain, and on the return of Caesar to Italy appears to have been made one of the fourteen praetors who were appoiited by Caesar at that time.
Pollio probably did not return to Italy with Caesar, since we find him  in the following year (<date value="-45">B. C. 45</date>) acting as Casar's lieutenant in Spain, where he carried on the war against Sextus Pompeius.
On the death of Caesar (<date value="-44">B. C. 44</date>), he appears, if his letters to Cicero contain his real sentimei 's, to have been inclined to support the senatorial party; but after Octavianus united himself to Antony, Pollio no longer hesitated to support the latter.
He soon afterwards received from Antony ;he government of the province of Gallia Transpadana, and was nominated by the triumvirs as one of the consuls for B c. 40. During his consulship, Virgil addressed to him the fourth Eclogue.
In the following year, Pollio was sent by Antony against the Dalmatians, whom he conquered, and thereby obtained the honour of a triumph He appears to have retired about this time from public affairs.
He took no part in the war between Augustus and Antony, and when asked by the former to accompany him to the Actian war, he declined doing so on account of his early friendship with Antony.
He died <date value="4">A. D. 4</date>, at his Tusculan villa.</p>
<p>Asinius Pollio deserves a distinguished place in the history of Roman literature, not so much on account of his works, as of the encouragement which he gave to literature.
He was not only a patron of Virgil, Horace, and other great poets and writers, but he has the honour of having been the first person to establish a public library at Rome, upon which he expended the money he obtained in his Illyrian campaign.
He also introduced the practice of which Martial and other later writers so frequently complain, of reading all his works before a large circle of friends and critics, in order to obtain their judgment and opinion before making them public.
None of Pollio's own works have come down to us, but they possessed sufficient merit to lead his contemporaries and successors to class his name with those of Cicero, Virgil and Sallust, as an orator, a poet, and a historian.
It was, however, as an orator that he possessed the greatest reputation.
Belonging, as he did, both to the Ciceronian and the Augustan age, the orations of Pollio partook somewhat of the character of each period.
They possessed the fertility of invention and the power of thought of the earlier period, but at the same time somewhat of the artificial and elaborate rhetoric which began to characterize the style of the empire.</p>
<p>As a historian, Pollio was celebrated for his history of the civil wars
in seventeen books.
It commenced with the consulship of Metellus and Afranius, <date value="-60">B. C. 60</date>, in which year the first triumvirate was formed, and appears to have come down to the time when Augustus obtained the undisputed supremacy of the Roman world.
As a poet Pollio was best known for his tragedies, which are spoken of in high terms by Virgil and Horace, but which probably did not possess any great merit, as they are hardly mentioned by subsequent writers, and only one fragment of them is preserved by the grammarians.</p>
<p>Pollio also enjoyed great reputation as a critic, but he is chiefly known in this capacity for the severe judgment which he passed upon his great contemporaries.
Thus he pointed out many mistakes in the speeches of Cicero, censured the Commentaries of Casar for their want of historical fidelity, and found fault with Sallust for affectation in the use of antiquated words and expressions, a fault with which Pollio is himself charged by other writers.
He also complained of a certain Patavinity in Livy.</p>
<p>Pollio had a son, C. Asinius Gallus Saloninus, who married Vipsania, the daughter of Agrippa and Pomponia, the former wife of Tiberius, by whom he had several children.

<div1 type="life" n="virgil">
<head><rs key="Vergil">P. Vergilius Maro</rs></head>
<div2 type="chapter" n="1">
<p>VIRGIL was born at Andes, a village near Mantua, on the 15th of October, <date value="-70">B. C. 70</date>. His parents were of moderate condition; but by their industry acquired some territorial possessions, which descended to their son.
The first seven years of his life were spent at Cremona, whence he went to Mediolanum, now Milan, at that time the seat of the liberal arts, denominated, as we learn from Pliny the Younger, Nova Athenae.
From this place he afterwards moved to Naples, where he applied himself with great assiduity to Greek and Roman literature, particularly to the physical and mathematical sciences, for which he expresses a strong predilection in the second book of his Georgics:
<cit><quote lang="la"><l>Me vero primum dulces ante omnia Musae,</l>

<l>Why wintry suns in ocean swiftly fade,</l>
<l>Or what delays night's slow-descending shade.</l></quote>  <bibl>Sotheby.</bibl></cit></p>
<p>When, by a proscription of the Triumvirate, the lands of Cremona and Mantua were distributed amongst the veteran soldiers, Virgil had the good fortune to recover his possessions, through the favour of Asinius Pollio, the deputy of Augustus in those parts; to whom, as well as to the Emperor, he has testified his gratitude in beautiful eclogues.</p>
<p>The first production of Virgil was his Bucolics, consisting of ten eclogues, written in imitation of the Idyllia or pastoral poems of Theocritus.
It may be questioned whether any language which has its provincial dialects, but is brought to perfection, can ever be well adapted, in that state, to the use of pastoral poetry.
There is such an apparent incongruity between the simple ideas of the rural swain and the polished language of the courtier, that it seems impossible to reconcile them together by the utmost art of composition.
The greater part of the Bucolics of Virgil may be regarded as poems of a peculiar nature, into which the author has happily transfused, in elegant versification, the native manners and ideas, without any mixture of the rusticity of pastoral life.</p>
<p>Virgil engaged in bucolic poetry at the request of Asinius Pollio, whom he highly esteemed, and for one of whose sons in particular, with Cornelius Gallus, a poet likewise, he entertained the warmest affection.
He has celebrated them all in these poems, which were begun, we are told, in the twenty-ninth year of his age, and completed in three years.
They were held in so great esteem amongst the Romans, immediately after their publication, that it is said they were frequently recited upon the stage for the entertainment of the audience.
Cicero, upon hearing some lines of them, perceived that they were written in no common strain of poetry, and desired that the whole eclogue might be recited: which being done, he exclaimed, "Magna spes altera Roma."  Another hope of mighty Rome!</p>
<p>Virgil's next work was the Georgics, the idea of which is taken from the "Works and Days" of Hesiod, the poet of Ascra.
But between the productions of the two poets, there is no other similarity than that of their common subject.
The precepts of Hesiod, in respect of agriculture, are delivered with all the simplicity of an unlettered cultivator of the fields, intermixed with plain moral reflections, natural and apposite; while those of Virgil, equally precise and important, are embellished with all the dignity of sublime versification.
The work is addressed to Macenas, at whose request it appears to have been undertaken.
It is divided into four books.
The first treats of ploughing; the second, of planting; the third of cattle, horses, sheep, goats, dogs, and of things which are hurtful to cattle; the fourth is employed on bees, their proper habitations, food, polity, the diseases to which they are liable, and the remedies of them, with the method of making honey, and a variety of other considerations connected with the subject.
The Georgics were written at Naples, and employed the author during a period of seven years.
It is said that Virgil had concluded the Georgics with a laboured eulogium on his poetical friend Gallus; but the latter incurring about this time the displeasure of Augustus, he was induced to cancel it, and substitute the charming episode of Astaus and Eurydice.</p>
<p>These beautiful poems, considered merely as didactic, have the justest claim to utility.
In what relates to agriculture in particular, the precepts were judiciously adapted to the climate of Italy, and must have conveyed much valuable information to those who were desirous of cultivating that important art, which was held in great honour amongst the Romans.
The same remark may be made, with greater latitude of application, in respect of the other subjects.
But when we examine the Georgics as poetical compositions, when we attend to the elevated style in which they are written, the beauty of the similes, the emphatic sentiments interspersed, the elegance of diction, the animated strain of the whole, and the harmony of the versification, our admiration is excited at beholding subjects, so common in their nature, embellished with the most magnificent decorations of poetry.</p>
<p>During four days which Augustus passed at Atella, to refresh himself from fatigue, in his return to Rome, after the battle of Actium, the Georgics, just then finished, were read to him by the author, who was occasionally relieved in the task by his friend Macenas.
We may easily conceive the satisfaction enjoyed by the Emperor, at finding that while he himself had been gathering laurels in the achievements of war, another glorious wreath was prepared by the Muses to adorn his temples; and that an intimation was given of his being afterwards celebrated in a work more congenial to the subject of heroic renown.</p>
<p>It is generally supposed that the Aeneid was written at the particular
desire of Augustus, who was ambitious of having the Julian family represented as lineal descendants of the Trojan AEneas. In this celebrated
poem, Virgil has happily united the characteristics of the Iliad and
Odyssey, and blended them so judiciously together, that they mutually
contribute to the general effect of the whole. By the esteem and sympathy excited for the filial piety and misfortunes of AEneas at the catastrophe of Troy, the reader is strongly interested in his subsequent
adventures; and every obstacle to the establishment of the Trojans in
the promised land of Hesperia produces fresh sensations of increased
admiration and attachment. The episodes, characters, and incidents,
all concur to give beauty and grandeur to the poem. The picture of
Troy in flames can never be sufficiently admired. The incomparable
portrait of Priam, in Homer, is admirably accommodated to a different
situation, in the character of Anchises, in the AEneid. The prophetic
rage of the Cumaean Sibyl displays in the strongest colours the enthusiasm of the poet. For sentiment, passion, and interesting description,
the episode of Dido is a master-piece in poetry. But Virgil is not more
conspicuous for strength of description than propriety of sentiment;
and wherever he takes a hint from the Grecian bard, he prosecutes the
idea with a judgment peculiar to himself.</p>
<p>Whether the Iliad or the AEneid be the more perfect composition, is
a question which has often been agitated, but, perhaps, will never be
determined to general satisfaction. In comparing the genius of the
two poets, however, allowance ought to be made for the difference of
circumstances under which they composed their respective works
Homer wrote in an age when mankind had not as yet made any great
progress in the exertion of either intellect or imagination, and he was
therefore indebted for his resources to the vast capacity of his own
mind. To this we must add, that he composed both his poems in a
situation of life extremely unfavourable to the cultivation of poetry.
Virgil, on the contrary, lived at a period when literature had attained
to a high state of improvement. He had likewise not only the advantage of finding a model in the works of Homer, but of perusing the
laws of epic poetry, which had been digested by Aristotle, and the
various observations made on the writings of the Greek bard by critics
of acuteness and taste; amongst the chief of whom was his friend
Horace, who remarks that
E'en sometimes the good Homer naps.
Virgil, besides, composed his poem in a state remote from indigence,
where he was roused to exertion by the example of several contemporary
poets; and what must have animated him beyond every other consider
ation, he wrote both at the desire, and under the patronage of the
Emperor and his minister Maecenas. In what time Homer composed
either of his poems, we know not; but the AEneid, we are informed,
was the employment of Virgil during eleven years. For some years,
the repeated entreaties of Augustus could not extort from him the smallest specimen of the work; but at length, when considerably advanced
in it, he condescended to recite three books-the second, the fourth,
and the sixth-in the presence of the Emperor and his sister Octavia,
to gratify the latter of whom, in particular, the recital of the last book
now mentioned, was intended. When the poet came to the words, <quote lang="la">Tu
Marcelius eris</quote>, alluding to Octavia's son, a youth of great hopes, who
had lately died, the mother fainted. After she had recovered from this
fit, by the care of her attendants, she ordered ten sesterces to be given
to Virgil for every line relating to that subject; a gratuity which
amounted to about two thousand pounds sterling.</p>
<p>In the composition of the AEneid, Virgil scrupled not to introduce
whole lines of Homer, and of the Latin poet Ennius; many of whose
sentences he admired. In a few instances he has borrowed from Lucretius. He is said to have been at extraordinary pains in polishing his
numbers; and when he was doubtful of any passage, he would read it
to some of his friends, that he might have their opinion. On such occasions, it was usual with him to consult in particular his freedman and
librarian Erotes, an old domestic, who, it is related, supplied extempore
a deficiency in two lines, and was desired by his master to write them in
the manuscript.</p>
<p>When this immortal work was completed, Virgil resolved on retiring
into Greece and Asia for three years, that he might devote himself entirely to polishing it, and have leisure afterwards to pass the remainder
of his life in the cultivation of philosophy. But meeting at Athens
with Augustus, who was on his return from the East, he determined on
accompanying the Emperor back to Rome. Upon a visit to Megara, a
town in the neighbourhood of Athens, he was seized with a languor,
which increased during the ensuing voyage; and he expired a few days
after landing at Brundisium, on the 22d of September, in the fifty-second year of his age. He desired that his body might be carried
to Naples, where he had passed many happy years; and that the
following distich, written in his last sickness, should be inscribed
upon his tomb:
<quote lang="la"><l>Mantua me genuit: Calabri rapuere: tenet nunc</l>
<l>Parthenope: cecini pascua, rura, duces.</l></quote>
(I was born at Mantua, died in Calabria, and my tomb is at Parthenope: pastures, rural affairs, and heroes are the themes of my poems.)
He was accordingly interred, by the order of Augustus, with great pomp,
within two miles of Naples, near the road to Puteoli, where his tomb
still exists. Of his estate, which was very considerable by the liberality
of his friends, he left the greater part to Valerius Proculus and his brother, a fourth to Augustus, a twelfth to Maecenas, besides legacies to L.
Varius and Plotius Tucca, who, in consequence of his own request, and
the command of Augustus, revised and corrected the AEneid after his
death. Their instructions from the Emperor were, to expunge whatever
they thought improper, but upon no account to make any addition.
This restriction is supposed to be the reason why many lines in the
AEneid are imperfect.</p>
<p>Virgil was of large stature, had a dark complexion, and his features
are said to have been such as expressed no uncommon abilities. He
was subject to complaints of the stomach and throat, as well as to headache, and had frequent discharges of blood upwards: but from what
part, we are not informed. He was very temperate both in food and
wine. His modesty was so great, that at Naples they commonly gave
him the name of Parthenias, "the modest man." On the subject of his
modesty, the following anecdote is related.</p>
<p>Having written a distich, in which he compared Augustus to Jupiter,
he placed it in the night-time over the gate of the Emperor's palace.
It was in these words:
<quote lang="la"><l>Nocte pluit tota, redeunt spectacula mane:</l>
<l>Divisum imperium cum Jove Caesar habet.</l></quote>
<quote lang="en"><l>All night it rained, with morn the sports appear,</l>
<l>Caesar and Jove between them rule the year.</l></quote>
By order of Augustus, an inquiry was made after the author; and
Virgil not declaring himself, the verses were claimed by Bathyllus, a
contemptible poet, but who was liberally rewarded on the occasion.
Virgil, provoked at the falsehood of the impostor, again wrote the verses
on some conspicuous part of the palace, and under them the following
line:
<quote lang="la"><l>Hos ego versiculos feci, tulit alter honores;</l></quote>
<quote lang="en"><l>I wrote the verse, another filched the praise;</l></quote>
with the beginning of another line in these words:
<quote lang="la"><l part="I">Sic vos, non vobis,</l></quote>
<quote lang="en"><l part="I">Not for yourselves, you- </l></quote>
repeated four times. Augustus expressing a desire that the lines should
be finished, and Bathyllus proving unequal to the task, Virgil at last
filled up the blanks in this manner:
<quote lang="la"><l>Sic vos, non vobis, nidificatis, aves;</l>
<l>Sic vos, non vobis, vellera fertis, oves;</l>
<l>Sic vos, non vobis, mellificatis, apes;</l>
<l>Sic vos, non vobis, fertis aratra, boves.</l></quote>
<quote lang="en"><l>Not for yourselves, ye birds, your nests ye build;</l>
<l>Not for yourselves, ye sheep, your fleece ye yield;</l>
<l>Not for yourselves, ye bees, your cells ye fill;</l>
<l>Not for yourselves, ye beeves, ye plough and till.</l></quote>
The expedient immediately evinced him to be the author of the distich,
and Bathyllus became the theme of public ridicule.</p>
<p>When at any time Virgil came to Rome, if the people, as was
commonly the case, crowded to gaze upon him, or pointed at
him with the finger in admiration, he blushed, and stole away
from them, frequently taking refuge in some shop.  When he went to
the theatre, the audience universally rose up at his entrance, as they
did to Augustus, and received him with the loudest plaudits; a compliment which, however highly honourable, he would gladly have declined.</p>
<p>In his fortunes and his friends, Virgil was a happy man. Munificent
patronage gave him ample means of enjoyment and of leisure, and he
had the friendship of all the most accomplished men of the day, among
whom Horace entertained a strong affection for him. He was an amiable, good-tempered man, free from the mean passions of envy and
jealousy. His fame, which was established in his lifetime, was cherished after his death, as an inheritance in which every Roman had a
share; and his works became schoolbooks even before the death of
Augustus, and continued such for centuries after. Virgil was the great
poet of the middle ages too. To him Dante paid the homage of his
superior genius, and owned him for his master and his model. Among
the vulgar he had the reputation of a conjurer, a necromancer, a worker
of miracles; it is the fate of a great name to be embalmed in fable.

<head><rs key="Horace">Q. Horatius Flaccus</rs><rs key="Horace&apos;s Villa"></rs></head>
<div2 type="chapter" n="1">
<p>HORACE was born at Venusia, on the tenth of December, in the consulship of L. Cotta and L. Torquatus (<date value="-65">B. C. 65</date>). According to his own
acknowledgment, his father was a freedman; by some it is said that he
was a collector of the revenue, and by others, a fishmonger, or a dealer
in salted meat. Whatever he was, he paid particular attention to the
education of his son, for, after the latter had received instruction from
the best masters in Rome, he sent him to Athens, to study philosophy.
From this place, Horace followed Brutus, in the quality of a military
tribune, to the battle of Philippi, where, by his own confession, being
seized with timidity, he abandoned the profession of a soldier, and returning to Rome, applied himself to the cultivation of poetry. In a
short time he acquired the friendship of Virgil and Valerius, whom he
mentions in his Satires in terms of the most tender affection:
<cit><quote lang="la"><l>Postera lux oritur multo gratissima: namque</l>
<l>Plotius et Varius Sinuessae, Virgiliusque,</l>
<l>Occurrunt; animae, quales neque candidiores</l>
<l>Terra tulit, neque queis me sit devinctior alter.</l>
<l>O qui complexus, et gaudia quanta fuerunt!</l>
<l>Nil ego contulerim jucundo sanus amico.</l></quote> <bibl n="Hor. S. 1.5">Sat. 1. 5.</bibl></cit>
<cit><quote lang="en"><l>Next rising morn with double joy we greet,</l>
<l>For Plotius, Varius, Virgil, here we meet:</l>
<l>Pure spirits these; the world no purer knows,</l>
<l>For none my heart with more affection glows:</l>
<l>How oft did we embrace, our joys how great!</l>
<l>For sure no blessing in the power of fate</l>
<l>Can be compared, in sanity of mind,</l>
<l>To friends of such companionable kind.</l></quote> <bibl>Francis.</bibl></cit></p>
<p>By the two friends above mentioned, he was recommended to the
patronage not only of Maecenas, but of Augustus, with whom he, as
well as Virgil, lived on a footing of the greatest intimacy. Satisfied
with the luxury which he enjoyed at the first tables in Rome, he was so
unambitious of any public employment, that when the Emperor offered
him the place of his secretary, he declined it. But as he lived in an
elegant manner, having, besides his house in town, a cottage on his
Sabine farm, and a villa at Tibur, near the falls of the Anio, he enjoyed,
beyond all doubt, a handsome establishment, from the liberality of
Augustus. He indulged himself in indolence and social pleasure, but
was at the same time much devoted to reading; and enjoyed a tolerable
state of health, although often incommoded with a fluxion of rheum
upon the eyes.</p>
<p>Horace, in the ardour of youth, and when his bosom beat high with
the raptures of fancy, had, in the pursuit of Grecian literature, drunk
largely at the source, of the delicious springs of Castalia; and it seems
to have been ever after his chief ambition to transplant into the plains
of Latium the palm of lyric poetry. Nor did he fail of success:
<quote>More durable than brass a monument I've raised.</quote>  Carm iii. 30.</p>
<p>Horace, by adopting, in the multiplicity of his subjects, almost all
the various measures of the different Greek poets, and frequently combining different measures in the same composition, has compensated for
the dialects of that tongue, so happily suited to poetry, and given to a
language less distinguished for soft inflexions all the tender and delicate
modulations of the Eastern song    While he moves in the measures of
the Greeks with an ease and gracefulness which rivals their own
acknowledged excellence, he ha; enriched the fund of lyric harmony
with a stanza peculiar to himself. In the artificial construction of the
Ode, he may justly be regarded as the first of lyric poets. In beautiful
imagery he is inferior to none: in variety of sentiment and felicity of
expression, superior to every existing competitor in Greek or Roman
poetry. He is elegant without affectation; and, what is more remarkable, in the midst of gaiety he is moral. We seldom meet in his Odes
with the abrupt apostrophes of passionate excursion; but his transitions
are conducted with ease, and every subject introduced with propriety.</p>
<p>The Carmen Seculare was written at the express desire of Augustus,
for the celebration of the Secular Games, performed once in a hundred
years, and which continued during three days and three nights, whilst
all Rome resounded with the mingled effusions of choral addresses to
gods and goddesses, and of festive joy. An occasion which so much
interested the ambition of the poet, called into exertion the most
vigorous efforts of his genius. More concise in mythological attributes
than the hymns ascribed to Homer, this beautiful production, in variety
and grandeur of invocation, and in pomp of numbers, surpasses all that
Greece, melodious but simple in the service of the altar, ever poured
forth from her vocal groves in solemn adoration. Of the praises of gods
and heroes, there is not now extant a more beautiful composition than
the 12th Ode of the first book of Horace:
<quote lang="la"><l>Quem virum aut heroa lyra vel acri</l>
<l>Tibia sumes celebrare, Clio ?</l>
<l>Quem Deum ? cujus recinet jocosa</l>
<l>Nomen imago,</l>
<l>Aut in umbrosis Heliconis oris, etc.</l></quote>
<quote lang="en"><l>What man, what hero, on the tuneful lyre,</l>
<l>Or sharp-toned flute, will Clio choose to raise,</l>
<l>Deathless, to fame? What God? whose hallowed name</l>
<l>The sportive image of the voice</l>
<l>Shall in the shades of Helicon repeat, etc.</l></quote></p>
<p>The Satires of Horace are far from being remarkable for poetical harmony, as he himself acknowledges. It was not his object in those compositions, to soothe the ear with the melody of polished numbers, but
to rally the frailties of the heart, to convince the understanding by
argument, and thence to put to shame both the vices and follies of mankind. Satire is a species of composition, of which the Greeks furnished
no model; and the preceding Roman writers of this class, though they
had much improved it from its original rudeness and licentiousness, had
still not brought it to that degree of perfection which might answer the
purpose of moral reform in a polished state of society. It received the
most essential improvement from Horace, who has dexterously combined
wit and argument, raillery and sarcasm, on the side of morality and
virtue, of happiness and truth.</p>
<p>The Epistles of this author may be reckoned amongst the most valuable productions of antiquity. Except those of the second book, and
one or two in the first, they are in general of the familiar kind, abounding in moral sentiments and judicious observations on life and manners.</p>
<p>The poem De Arte Poetica comprises a system of criticism, in justness of principle and extent of application, correspondent to the various
exertions of genius on subjects of invention and taste. That in composing this excellent production, he availed himself of the most approved
works of Grecian original, we may conclude from the advice which he
there recommends:
<quote lang="la"><l part="F">Vos exemplaria Graeca</l>
<l>Nocturna versate manu, versate diurna.</l></quote>
<cit><quote lang="en"><l>Make the Greek authors your supreme delight;</l>
<l>Read them by day, and study them by night.</l></quote> <bibl>Francis.</bibl></cit></p>
<p>In the writings of Horace there appears a fund of good sense,
enlivened with pleasantry, and refined by philosophical reflection. He
had cultivated his judgment with great application, and his taste was
guided by intuitive perception of moral beauty, aptitude and propriety.
The few instances of indelicacy which occur in his compositions, we
may ascribe rather to the manners of the times, than to any blameable
propensity in the author. Horace died in the fifty-seventh year of his
age, surviving his beloved Maecenas only three weeks; a circumstance
which, added to the declaration in an ode (Carm. i. 17) to that
personage, supposed to have been written in Maecenas's last illness, has
given rise to a conjecture that Horace ended his days by a violent
death, to accompany his friend. But it is more natural to conclude
that he died of excessive grief, as, had he literally adhered to the affirmation contained in the ode, he would have followed his patron more
closely. This seems to be confirmed by a fact immediately preceding
his death; far, though he declared Augustus heir to his whole estate, he
was not able, on account of weakness, to put his signature to the will;
a failure which it is probable that he would have taken care to obviate,
had his death been premeditated. He was interred, at his own desire,
near the tomb of Maecenas.</p>
<p>Horace has described his own person. He was of short stature, with
dark eyes and dark hair, but early tinged with gray. In his youth he
was tolerably robust, but suffered from a complaint in his eyes. In
more advanced life he grew fat, and Augustus jested about his protuberant belly. His health was not always good. He was not only
weary of the fatigue of war, but unfit to bear it, and he seems to have
inclined to be a valetudinarian. When young he was irascible in
temper, but easily placable. In dress he was rather careless. His
habits, even after he became richer, were generally frugal and abstemious, though on occasions, both in youth and in mature age, he seems
to have indulged in conviviality. He liked choice wine, and in the
society of friends scrupled not to enjoy the luxuries of his time.</p>
<p>Horace was never married; he seems to have entertained that aristocratic aversion to legitimate wedlock, against which, in the higher
orders, Augustus strove so vainly, both by the infliction of civil disabilities and the temptation of civil privileges. In his various amours
he does not appear to have had any children. The religion of Horace
was that of his age. He maintains the poetic and conventional faith in
the gods with decent respect, but with no depth of devotion. There is
more sincerity in a sort of vague sense of the providential government to which he attributes his escape from some of the perils of his
life, his flight from Philippi, his preservation from a wolf in the Sabine
wood, and from the falling of a tree in his own grounds. He also professes to have been startled into religious emotion, and to have renounced
a godless philosophy, from hearing thunder in a cloudless sky.</p>
<p>The philosophy of Horace was, in like manner, that of a man of the
world.  He playfully alludes to his Epicureanism, but it was practical
rather than speculative Epicureanism. His mind, indeed, was not in
the least speculative. Common life wisdom was his study, and to this
he brought a quickness of observation, a sterling common sense, and a
passionless judgment, which have made his works the delight and the
unfailing treasure of felicitous quotation to practical men.</p>
<p>According to Quintilian, Horace was almost the only lyric poet worth
reading. As a satirist he is without the lofty moral indignation, the
fierce vehemence of invective, which characterized the later satirists.
In the Epodes there is bitterness provoked, it would seem, by some personal hatred or sense of injury, and the ambition of imitating Archilocus; but in these he seems to have exhausted all the malignity and violence of his temper.
In the Satires it is the folly rather than the wickedness of vice which he touches with such playful skill.
Nothing can surpass the keenness of his observation, or his ease of expression: it is the finest comedy of manners in a descriptive instead of a dramatic form.
If the Romans had been a theatrical people, and the age of Augustus a dramatic age, Horace, as far at least as the perception of character, would have been an exquisite dramatic writer.</p>
<p>The love of Horace for the country, and his intercourse with the sturdy and uncorrupted Sabine peasantry, seems to have kept alive an honest freedom and boldness of thought; while his familiarity with the great, his delight in good society, maintained that exquisite urbanity, that general amenity, that ease without forwardness, that respect without servility, which induced Shaftesbury to call him the most gentlemanlike of the Roman poets.</p>
<p>The works of Horace became popular very soon.
In the time of Juvenal they were, with the poems of Virgil, the common-school book.

<div1 type="life" n="gallus">
<head>C. Cornelius Gallus</head>
<div2 type="chapter" n="1">
<p>C. CORNELIUS GALLUS, a contemporary of Augustus, distinguished himself as a general, and still more as a poet and an orator.
He was a native of Forum Julii (Frejus), in Gaul, and of very humble origin, perhaps the son of some freedman either of Sulla or Cinna.
Hieronymus, in Eusebius, states that Gallus died at the age of forty (others read forty-three); and, as we know from Dion Cassius that he died in <date value="-26">B. C. 26</date>,
he must have been born either in <date value="-66">B. C. 66</date> or 69. He appears to have gone to Italy at an early age, and it would seem that he was instructed by the Epicurean Syron, together with Varus and Virgil, both of whom became greatly attached to him.  He began his career as a poet about the age of twenty, and seems thereby to have attracted the attention and won the friendship of such men as Asinius Pollio. When Octavianus, after the murder of Caesar, came to Italy from Apollonia,</p>
<p>Gallus must have embraced his party at once, for henceforth he appears as a man of great influence with Octavianns, and in <date value="-41">B. C. 41</date>
he was one of the triumviri appointed by Octavianus to distribute the land in the north of Italy among his veterans, and on that occasion he distinguished himself by the protection he afforded to the inhabitants of Mantua and
to Virgil.
Gallus afterwards accompanied Octavianus to the battle of Actium, <date value="-31">B. C. 31</date>, when he commanded a detachment of the army.
After the battle, when Octavianus was obliged to go from Samos to Italy, to suppre s the insurrection among the troops, he sent Gallus with the army to Egypt, in pursuit of Antony.
In the neighbourhood of Cyrene, Pinarius Scarpus, one of Antony's lieutenants, in despair, surrendered, with four legions, to Gallus, who then took possession of the island of Pharus, and attacked Paraetonium.
When this town and all its treasures had fallen into the hands of Gallus, Antony hastened thither, hoping to recover what was lost, either by bribery or by force; but Gallus thwarted his schemes, and, in an attack which he made on Antony's fleet in the harbour of Paraetonium, he sunk and burnt many of the enemy's ships, whereupon Antony withdrew.
After the death of Cleopatra, Octavianus constituted Egypt a Roman province, with peculiar regulations, and appointed Gallus its first prefect.
He remained in that country for nearly four years, and seems to have made various useful regulations in his province; but his elevated position appears to have rendered him giddy and insolent, whereby he drew upon himself the hatred of Augustus.
The exact nature of his offence is not certain. According to Dion Cassius, he spoke of Augustus in an offensive and insulting manner; he erected numerous statues of himself in Egypt, and had his own exploits inscribed on the pyramids.
This excited the hostility of Valerius Largus, who had before been his intimate friend, but now denounced him to the Emperor.
Augustus deprived him of his post, and forbade him to stay in any of his provinces.
One accuser after another now came forward against him, and the charges were referred to the Senate for investigation.
That body deplived Gallus of his estates, and sent him into exile; but, unable to bear up against these reverses of fortune, he put an end to his life by throwing himself upon his sword, <date value="-26">B. C. 26</date>. Other writers mention as the cause of his fall mertly the disrespectful way in which he spoke of Augustus, or that he was suspected of forming a conspiracy, or that he was accused of extortion in his province.</p>
<p>The intimate friendship existing between Gallus and the most eminent men of the time, as Asinius Pollio, Virgil, Varus, and Ovid, and the high praise they bestow upon him sufficiently attest that Gallus was a man of great intellectual powers and acquirements.
Ovid assigns to him the first place among the Roman elegiac poets; and we know that he wrote a collection of elegies in four books, the principle subject of which was his love of Lycoris.
But all his productions have perished, and we can judge of his merits only by what his contemporaries say about him.
Some critics attribute to him the poem Ciris, usually printed among the works of Virgil; but the arguments do not appear satisfactory.
Of his oratory, too, not a trace has come down to us. The Greek Anthology contains two epigrams under the name of Gallus' but who their author was is altogether uncertain.

<div1 type="life" n="tibullus">
<head>Albius Tibullus</head>
<div2 type="chapter" n="1">
<p>ALBIUS TIBULLUS lived in the time of Augustus, and was a friend and contemporary of Horace.
He was of equestrian rank, and originally possessed considerable property, of which he lost the greater part, probably, as it is conjectured, in consequence of the assignments of lands among the veterans of Augustus, and this -aupposition is rendered still more probable by the circumstance that tibullus never celebrates the praises of Augustus, like the other poets of his time.
He was not, however, reduced to absolute poverty; the estate on which he resided at Pedum, a town between Praeneste and Tibur, appears to have been his own, and to have descended to him from his ancestors.
Here he passed the greater part of his time in the enjoyment of a quiet country life, which had for him the greatest charms.
He left it, however, to accompany his patron, Valerius Messalla, into Aquitania, and was present with him through the campaign, either in <date value="-28">B. C. 28</date> or 27. He afterwards set out with him to Asia, but was taken ill at Corcyra; but that he died at Corcyra, as is stated by some modern writers, is only a conjecture, unsupported by any ancient authority, and is directly contradicted by what Ovid says.
It appears from an epigram of Domitius Marsus, who lived in the age of Augustus, that Tibullus died soon after Virgil, and as Virgil died in <date value="-19">B. C. 19</date>, we may, perhaps, place the death of Tibullus in the following year, <date value="-18">B. C. 18</date>. It has been already mentioned that Tibullus was the friend of Horace; two poems have come down to us addressed to him by the latter.
Ovid, too, laments his death in a beautiful elegy, from which it appears that his mother and sister were present at his death.</p>
<p>It is difficult to determine precisely at what time Tibullus was born.
In the epigram of Domitius Marsus, already referred to, he is called juvenis, and Ovid deplores his untimely death.
We must not, however, be misled by the expression juvenis into supposing that he was quite a young man, in our sense of the word, at the time of his death,
since the ancients extended the meaning of juvenis to a time which we consider to be that of mature manhood.
Several circumstances tend to show that he could not have been much less than forty at his death.
Ovid speaks of Tibullus as preceding Propertius, and of Propertius as preceding himself, and as Ovid was born B. . 43, we must place the birth of Tibullus a few years at least before that time.
Again, Horace in the first book of his Odes, addressed Tibullus as an intimate friend, which hardly allows us to suppose that Tibullus was a mere youth at the time.
If Bentley's supposition is correct, that the first book of the Odes was published about <date value="-30">B. C. 30</date> or 28, Horace was then about 35, and Tibullus may have been a few years younger.
Moreover, he does not appear to have been a very young man when he accompanied Messalla into Aquitania in <date value="-28">B. C. 28</date> or 27. We may therefore, perhaps, place his birth at about B. C 57. There are, indeed, two lines in Tibullus (iii. 5, 17, 18), which expressly assign his birth to <date value="-43">B. C. 43</date>, the same year in which Ovid was born; but these are, without doubt, an interpolation derived from one of Ovid's poems.</p>
<p>We have thirty-six poems of Tlbullus, written, with one exception, in elegiac metre, and divided into four books.
The first two books are admitted by all critics to have been written by Tibullus, but of the genuineness of the last two, considerable doubts have been raised.
J. H. Voss and others attribute the third book to a poet of the name of Lygdamis, but the style and mode of treating the subjects resemble the other elegies of Tibullus, and there does not appear sufficient reason for doubting that it is his composition.
There are, however, stronger grounds for supposing the first poem in the fourth book, written in hexameters, not to be genuine.
It differs considerably in style and expression from the other.
poems, and is attributed by some writers to Sulpicia, who lived under Domitian, by others to a Sulpicia of the age of Augustus; but we know nothing with certainty respecting its author.
Of the other poems in this book, almost all bear traces of being the genuine works of Tibullus.</p>
<p>The elegies of Tibullus are chiefly of an amatory kind.
In the earlier period of his life, Delia seems to have been his favourite, and afterwards Nemesis, and their names occur most frequently in his poems.
Besides these two mistresses, Tibullus was enamoured of a certain Glycera, and he wrote elegies to soften that cruel beauty.
Glycera, however, is not known to us from the poetry of Tibullus, but from an ode of Horace, which gently reproves him for dwelling so long in his plaintive elegies on the pitiless Glycera.
Several of his elegies are devoted more or less to celebrating the praises of his patron Messalla, but these are the least
pleasing parts of his works, for he does not appear to have excelled in panegyric.</p>
<p>Tibullus is placed by Quintilian at the head of the Roman elegiac poets.
His poems are distinguished by great tenderness of feeling, which sometimes degenerates into effeminacy, but they at the same time excite our warmest sympathies.
He seems to have been of a melancholy temperament, and to have looked at things from a gloomy point of view, hence we find the subject of death frequently introduced, and the enjoyment of the present interrupted by dark forebodings of the future.
He constantly describes the pleasures of a country life and the beauties of nature, for which he had the most exquisite relish; and there is in these descriptions a naturalness and truthfulness which place him above his contemporary, Propertius.
Tibullus was beautiful in person, and the poetry of his contemporaries shows him to have been a gentle and singularly amiable man.
To Horace especially he was an object of warm attachment.
Besides the ode which alludes to his passion for Glycera, the epistle of Horace to Tibullus gives the most full and pleasing view of his poetical retreats and of his character; it is written by a kindred spirit.
Horace does homage to that purity of taste which distinguishes the poetry of Tibullus; he takes pride in the candid but favourable judgment of his own satires.
The time of Tibullus he supposes to be shared between the finishing his exquisite small poems which were to surpass even those of Cassius of Parma, up to that time the models of that kind of composition, and the enjoyment of the country.
Tibullus possessed, according to his friends' notions, all the blessings of life-a competent fortune, favour with the great, fame, wealth, and seemed to know how to enjoy all those blessings.
</p></div2></div1>
<div1 type="life" n="propertius">
<head>Sex. Aurelius Propertius</head>
<div2 type="chapter" n="1">
<p>THE materials for a life of Propertius are meagre and unsatisfactory.
We know neithel the precise place nor date of his birth.
He tells us that he was a native of Umbria, where it borders on Etruria, but nowhere mentions the exact spot.
Conjecture has assigned it, among other towns, to Mevania, Ameria, Hispellum, and Asisium; of which one of the two last seems entitled to the preference.
The date of his birth has been variously placed <dateRange from="-57" to="-46">between the years <date value="-57">B.C. 57</date> and 46</dateRange>. He was not descended from a family of any distinction; the paternal estate, however, seems to have been sufficiently ample; but of this he was deprived by an agrarian division, probably that in <date value="-36"><date value="-36">B. C. 36</date></date>, after the Sicilian war, and thus thrown into comparative poverty.
At the time of this misfortune he had not yet assumed the toga virilis, and was therefore under sixteen years of age.
He had already lost his father, who, it has been conjectured, was one of the victims sacrificed after the taking of Perusia; but this notion does not rest on any satisfactory grounds.
We have no accoant of Propertius's education; but it would seem that he was destined to be an advocate, but abandoned the profession for that of poetry.</p>
<p>That he was carefully instructed appears from the learning displayed in his writings, which was probably acquired altogether at Rome; the smallness of his means having prevented him from finishing his education at Athens, as was then commonly done by the wealthier Romans.
At all events, it is plain from the sixth elegy of the first book, written after his connection with Cynthia had begun, that he had not then visited Greece.</p>
<p>The history of Propertius's life, so far as it is known to us, is the history of his amours, nor can it be said how much of these is fiction.
He was, what has been called in modem  times, "a man of wit and pleasure about town " ; nor in the few particulars of his life which he communicates in the first elegy of the fourth book, does he drop the slightest hint of his ever having been engaged in any serious or useful employment.
He began to write poetry at a very early age, and the merit of his productions soon attracted the attention and patronage of Maecenas.
This was most probably shortly after the final discomfiture and death of Antony in B C. 30, when, according to the computation adopted in this notice, Propertius was about one-and-twenty.
This inference is. drawn from the opening elegy of the second book, from which it appears that Maecenas had requested him to describe the military achievements of Octavianus.
At that important epoch it formed part of that minister's policy to engage the most celebrated wits of Rome in singing Caesar's praises; his object being to invest his master's successes with all those charms of popularity which would necessarily prove so conducive to the great object which lay nearest to his heart-the establishment of Caesar's absolute empire.
An earlier, and perhaps more disinterested, patron was Tullus, the nephew, probably, of L. Volcatius Tullus, the fellow-consul of Octavianus, in <date value="-33">B. C. 33</date>.</p>
<p>It was probably in <date value="-32">B. C. 32</date> or 31, that Propertius first became acquainted with his Cynthia.
He had previously had an amour with a certain Lycinna, to which we must assign the space of a year or two.
This connection, however, was a merely sensual one, and was
not, therefore, of a nature to draw out his poetical powers.
In Cynthia, though by no means an obdurate beauty, he found incitement enough, as well as sufficient obstacles to the gratification of his passion, to lend it refinement, and to develop the genius of his muse.
The biographers of Propertius make him a successful lover at once.
They neither allow time for courtship, nor assign any of his elegies to that period.
It is plain, however, from several passages, that his suit must have been for a length of time an unsuccessful one, and several of his pieces were probably written during its progress.
Cynthia was a native of Tibur, and her real name was Hostia.
As Propertius (iii. 20, 8) alludes to her doctus avus, it is probable that she was a grand-daughter of Hostius, who wrote a poem on the Histric war.
She seems to have inherited a considerable portion of the family talent, and was herself a poetess, besides being skilled in music, dancing, and needle woik.
From these accomplishments, Paldamus, in the introduction to his edition of Propertius, inferred that she was a woman of rank, and some have even absurdly derived her genealogy from Hostus Hostilius.
But the truth seems to be that she belonged to that higher class of courtezans, or rather kept women, then sufficiently numerous at Rome.
We cannot reconcile the whole tenor of the poems with any other supposition.
Thus it appears that Propertius succeeded a lover who had gone to Africa for the purpose of gain, perhaps after having been well stripped by Cynthia.
Propertius is, in turn, displaced by a stupid praetor, returning from Illyricum with a well-filled purse, and whom the poet advises his mistress to make the most of. We are led to the same conclusion by the fifth elegy of the fourth book, before alluded to, as written during his courtship, which is addressed to Acanthis, a lena, or procuress, who had done all she could to depreciate Propertius and his poems with Cynthia, on account of his want of wealth.
Nor can we draw any other inference from the seventh elegy of the second book, which expresses the alarm felt by the lovers lest they should be separated by the Lex Julia de maritandis ordinibus, and the joy of Cynthia at its not having been passed.
What should have prevented Propertius, then apparently a bachelor, from marrying his mistress? It was because women who had exercised the profession of a courtezan were forbidden by that law to marry an ingenus.<note anchored="yes">Freemen (<foreign lang="la">liberi</foreign>) were either ingenui or libertini.
Ingenui were those free men who were born free.
Libertini were those who were manumitted from legal slavery.
Though freedmen (libertini) were not
ingenui, the sons of libertini were ingenui.
A libertinus could not by adoption become ingenuus.
</note> There was no other disqualification,
except that libertini were not permitted to marry a man of senatorial dignity.
Such an arrangement, or condtio, as that between Propertius and his mistress, did not take place without some previous stipulations, and even solemnities, which the poet has described in the twentieth elegy of the third book, and which he does not hesitate to call satra marita.</p>
<p>The precise date and duration of this connection cannot be accurately determined.
The seventh elegy of the fourth book seems to show that the lovers were separated only by the death of Cynthia.
That Propertius married, probably after Cynthia's death, and left legitimate issue, may be inferred from the Younger Pliny twice mentioning Passienus Paulus a splendidus eques Romanus, as descended from him.
The year of Propertius's death is altogether unknown   Masson placed it in B. C. rg, and he has been followed by Barth and other critics.</p>
<p>Propertius resided in the Esquiline, near the gardens of Mecenas.
He seems to have cultivated the friendship of his brother poets, as Ponticus, Bassus, Ovid, and others.
He mentions Virgil in a way that shows he had heard parts of the AEneid privately recited.
But though he belonged to the circle of Maecenas, he never once mentions Horace.
He is equally silent about Tibullus.
His not mentioning Ovid is best explained by the difference in their ages; for Ovid alludes more than once to Propertius, and with evident affection.</p>
<p>As an elegiac poet, a high rank must be awarded to Propertius, and among the ancients it was a moot point whether the preference should be given to him or to Tibullus.
His genius, however, did not fit him for the sublimer flights of poetry, and he had the good sense to refrain from attempting them.
Though he excels Ovid in warmth of passion, he never indulges in the grossness which disfigures some of the latter's compositions.
It must, however, be confessed that, to the modern reader, the elegies of Propertius are not nearly so attractive as those of Tibullus.
This arises partly from their obscurity, but in a great measure also from a certain want of nature in them.
The fault of Propertius was too pedantic an imitation of the Greeks.
His whole ambition was to become the Roman Callimachus, whom, as well as Philetas and other of the Greek elegiac poets, he made his model.

<div1 type="life" n="ovid">
<head>P. Ovidius Naso</head>
<div2 type="chapter" n="1">
<p>OVID was born at Sulmo, in the country of the Peligni, <date value="-43">B. C. 43</date>, in the same year in which Cicero was murdered, and on the very day in which the consuls Hirtius and Pansa died.
The events of his life are chiefly known from his own writings, and more particularly from the tenth elegy of the fourth book of the "Tristia."
Ovid was of an equestrian family.
le had a brother exactly twelve months older than himself, and the two brothers were sent to Rome for an education at an early age.
From his boyhood Ovid was fond of writing verses, but his father discouraged his poetic aspirations on the ground that poverty was the condition of poets, and the youth accordingly tried to prepare himself for the career of the bar.
The two brothers were educated under the care of some of the best teachers then in Rome-Plotius Grippus, whom  Quintilian considered one of the first teachers of eloquence; Arellius Fuscus, the friend of Horace; Messala; and Portius Latro, the friend and companion of Seneca.
Seneca says that he had seen Ovid practising declamation before Fuscus.
His brother Lucius died after completing his twentieth year, an event which Ovid most affectionately lamented.
On attaining the suitable age, Ovid became one of the T-riumviri Capitales, a sort of magistrates whose office it was to decide petty causes between slaves and persons of inferior rank, and to superintend the prisons and the execution of criminals.
Subsequently he was made one of the Centumvir, or judges who tried testamentary or even criminal cases.
In due time he was promoted to be one of the Decemvir, who assembled and presided over the court of the Centumviri.
But neither his bodily strength nor his disposition was suited to public or active life; poetry was his delight, and he resolved to dedicate himself to it. He accordingly sought the society of his contemporary poets, whose names he has himself recorded.
He was acquainted with Macer, Propertius, Ponticus, Bassus, and Horace, who was about twenty-two years older than himself.
He only just saw Virgil and Tibullus, both of whom died about B c. I8. He was married to his first wife when he was very young; the match was not a suitable one, and the wife was soon divorced.
A second wife was in like manner put away, though the poet had no serious charge to make against her.
Ovid's amours with Corinna, whom he celebrates under
this fictitious name, and with other women, may have tended to interrupt his conjugal felicity; however this may be, he ventured to take a third wife, with whom he lived happily to the time of his exile.
He had a daughter, probably by his third wife; the daughter was twice married.
His father died at the advanced age of ninety, and his mother shortly after; but neither of them lived to see their son's disgrace and exile.</p>
<p>Ovid spent an easy life at Rome in the enjoyment of the society of his friends, and in the possession of a competent income.
He visited Asia and Sicily, but it does not appear at what period of his life; probably when he was a young man.
His residence at Rome was near the Capitol and he had some gardens near the junction of the Flamrnian and Claudian roads; he had also a patrimony in the couritry of the Peligni.
Ovid was intimately acquainted with the family of Augustus Caesar; and an "Epicedion on the death of Drusus" (<date value="-9">B. C. 9</date>), addressed to Livia, the mother of that prince, which is still extant, is attributed to him.
Among his various poetical works which were written and  ublished before his exile, his three books "Artis Amatoriae," appeared in the year 2 B. C., the same year in which Augustus banished his daughter Julia.
Previous to the "Ars Amatoria " he had published his three books of "Amores," which were originally in five books, and also his "Heroides."</p>
<p>At the close of the year <date value="8">A. D. 8</date>, when he had just completed his fiftieth year, he was banished from Rome by Augustus.
The sentence was altogether unexpected; it fell on the astonished poet like a thunderbolt The place of his exile was Tomi, a Milesian colony in the country of the Geta, on the banks of the Euxine.
Ovid has described in a most touching manner the last night which he spent in Rome, and his eternal separation from his wife and friends; his daughter was absent in Libya.
His property was not confiscated, but his exile was for life.
The cause of the banishment of Ovid is not distinctly stated by himself, nor by any other writer, a circumstance which has led to various conjectures, all of which, however, are devoid of any historical foundation.
The supposition that Ovid was banished for an amour with the Emperor's daughter Julia rests on no evidence, and is inconsistent with the fact ' that Julia was banished ten years before Ovid.
He admits that his offence deserved a severer punishment than the Emperor inflicted.
His sentence was not Exsilium, but Relegatio; and the difference was not unimportant.
Exstlium was followed by a loss of fortune and citizenship; Relegatio was not followed by loss of citizenship, and only accompanied with loss of property, so far as such loss was comprehended in the sentence of Relegatio.
The poet himself has expressed this with
strict technical accuracy in one of his elegies addressed to his wife, in which he tells her that she cannot be truly upbraided as being the wife of an exile, inasmuch as his sentence was only Relegatio (Trist.	 v., El. Ii). In other passages, however, he calls himself Exsul, but doubtless in the general sense of that term; for Relegatio was one of the species of which Exsilium was the genus.</p>
<p>He admits that there were two charges against him, the character of his amatory verses and some fault (error) which he never mentions.
The whole of the second book of the "Tristia," which is addressed to Augustus, is an apology for his erotic poetry, and he complains that though written long before the date of his banishment it was made the ground or pretext of his punishment.
In various other passages he refers to his poetry as one cause of his misfortunes.
It may be conjectured that he was punished under the provisions of the Julian Law, De Adulteriis coercendis, which was passed about <date value="-17">B. C. 17</date>; for though the provisions of this law, as known to us, make no mention of obscene poetry, it is clear from the title in the " Digest," that the law extended beyond punishing the direct parties to an act of adultery, for it punished, among others, those who lent their houses for adulterous purposes.
Ovid himself says that of the two charges brought against him one should be nameless, but the other was founded on his amatory poetry as encouraging to adultery:
<cit><quote lang="la"><l>Altera pars superest qua turpi crimine tactus,</l>
<l>Arguor obscoeni doctor adulterii."</l></quote> <bibl n="Ov. Tr. 2.211">Trist. ii. 211.</bibl></cit></p>
<p>At the time of his banishment the fifteen books of the "Metamorphoses" were unfinished; the poet had burned them, as being incomplete, at the time of his leaving Rome, but there were other copies in existence.
The twelve books of the " Fasti," of which the first six only have been preserved, were also written before his exile, and, as the poet tells us. inscribed to Augustus Caesar.
They were finished during his exile, and, as we now have them, inscribed to Caesar Germanicus.</p>
<p>The works of Ovid written during his banishment are, "Tristia" and the four books of his "Letters from  Pontus."
The letters are addressed to his wife, to Maximus, Pedo  Albinovanus, Gracinus, Rufinus, and others of his friends.
The "Ibis" also was written in his banishment, and apparently soon after his arrival at Tomi.
Notwithstanding the most abject entreaties of the poet and the interest of his friends, Augustus never recalled him from banishment.
He died at Tomi, <date value="18">A. D. 18</date>, in the sixtieth year of his age and the tenth of his banishment.
Augustus died four years before him.  The cir
cumstance of his not being recalled by Tiberius renders it probable, as has been conjectured, that he had incurred the anger of Livia Augusta.
The poet who had enjoyed all the pleasures of a luxurious capital and the society of all his most distinguished contemporaries, spent the last years of his life among a barbarous people and in an inhospitable climate, worn out with grief and mental anxiety.
His only consolation in exile was to address his wife and absent friends, and his letters were all poetical.
The muses who were the cause of his calamity, were also his consolation in misfortune.
Though the " Tristia " and the " Letters from Pontus" have no other topic than the poet's sorrows, his exquisite taste and fruitful invention have redeemed them from the imputation of being tedious, and they are read with pleasure and even with sympathy.</p>
<p>It shows the versatility of his talent that he wrote a poem during his exile in the Getic language; the subject was the praises of Augustus Caesar and his family.
The rude barbarians to whom Ovid recited this poem  were surprised  and delighted: their uncivilized  minds acknowledged the power of "immortal verse."
They applauded and anticipated the poet's recall; but the stern master of the Roman world was inexorable.</p>
<p>The works of Ovid form one of the most valuable parts of the literature of Rome.
With the exception of the " Metamorphoses," they are all written in the elegiac measure, the restraint of which would have been ill-suited to such long compositions as the " Fasti" in the hands of almost any other Roman poet.
But Ovid was a perfect master of the technical part of poetry, and it is surprising with what consummate skill he has contrived to include in each consecutive pair of verses a full and complete sense.
It is rarely necessary to go beyond each pair of verses.
in order to obtain the meaning of the poet, each couplet is generally complete in itself.
And yet the whole of a long poem written in this measure is so artfully and skilfully combined that it exhibits a faultless unity.
It is a necessary consequence, however, of this restraint, that the elegiac poems of Ovid are sometimes expressed with such an epigrammatic brevity as to be obscure, and the antithesis, which seems to be in some measure inseparable from  this kind of measure, and certainly was rather sought after than avoided by the poet, is sometimes too frequent.</p>
<p>If we estimate the character of Ovid by his erotic poetry, we must admit that he is without excuse.
The pleasure of the sex seems to have been the uppermost thought of his mind, and the tendencies of his " Amores" and "Ars Amatoria" must be considered injurious to the morals of apeople.</p>
<p>The " Remedia Aroris" can hardly be viewed, as some are inclined to view it, as a kind of Palinodia, or recantation of his amatory poetry.
If we estimate the character of the poet by that of the licentious age in which he lived we shall judge him more favourably: though a man of pleasure he was temperate in eating and drinking, humane and generally beloved.
There are no passages in the extant works of Ovid which approach the gross obscenity of many passages in Catullus, Horace, and other Roman writers; and this is a merit, at least viewed as a matter of taste.
In a moral point of view his poetry may be more dangerous.
The voluptuous pictures of Ovid are only covered with a transparent veil; and even this is sometimes withdrawn.
It is rather singular that the " Heroides," which abound in obscure allusions and in voluptuous imagery, and are often difficult to understand, should have been so much used as an elementary school-book in modern times.</p>
<p>The two great works of Ovid are his "Metamorphoses" and his " Fasti."
The " Metamorphoses" consists of such legends and fables as involved a transformation, from the Creation down to the time of Julius Caesar, the last being that emperor's change into a star.
It is thus a sort of cyclic poem made up of distinct episodes, but connected into one cofttinuous narrative.
The rich mythology of Greece furnished Ovid with materials for his art.
With exquisite taste, simplicity, and pathos, he has given to the fabulous traditions of early ages, an appearance of reality which only a master-hand could impart.
His pictures of nature are striking and true; he selects with care that which is appropriate; he rejects the superfluous; and when he has completed his work, it is neither defective nor redundant.</p>
<p>The art of the rhetorician, as well as that of the poet, is perceptible in all the works of Ovid, but particularly in the "Metamorphoses."
The two speeches of Ajax and Ulysses, in the beginning of the thirteenth book, are in their kind models of oratory.
He who could write the speech of Ulysses might himself become an orator.
The " Metamorphoses" are read with pleasure by youth, and are re-read in more advanced age with still greater delight.
The poet ventured to predict that his poem would survive him, and be read wherever the Roman name was known.</p>
<p>The "Fasti" of Ovid are in fact a valuable historical monument.
He has preserved to us the Roman calendar, with all the ancient stories attached to it, collected from the traditions of the people and the old chroniclers and antiquarians.
His own explanations may often be of little value, but they are easily separated from the ancient story or tradition which he relates.
He begins with January, and, following the
days of the month in order, he assigns to each its appropriate festival or solemnities.
It shows no small art in a poet to convert the calendar of his country into a pleasing and instructive poem, rich in historical facts, and enlivened and relieved by true poetry.
A complete commentary on the " Fasti " would be a valuable commentary on Roman history.
The last six books are unfortunately lost.</p>
<p>In forming an estimate of Ovid's poetical character, we must never forget that his great poem (the "Metamorphoses ") had not the benefit of his last corrections; and that by the loss of his tragedy, the " fedea," we are deprived, according to the testimony of antiquity, of his most perfect work; and that, too, in a species of composition which demanda the highest powers of human genius.
The loss which we have thus sustained may be in some measure inferred from the intimate knowledge which Ovid displays of the female heart; as in the story of Byblis in the Metamorphoses, and in the soliloquy of Medea in the same work, in which the alternations of hope and fear, reason and passion, are depicted with the greatest force.</p>
<p>A great part of Ovid's merit, moreover, consists in his language; and it is impossible to render the meaning of the original, except by periphrasis and paraphrase, which hardly convey the meaning, and most certainly destroy the beauty, of that which is a work of consummate art.

<div1 type="life" n="seneca">
<head>L. Annaeus Seneca</head>
<div2 type="chapter" n="1">
<p>SENECA was born about six years before the Christian era, and gave early indication of uncommon talents.
His father, who had come from Corduba to Rome, was a man of letters, particularly fond of declamation, in which he instructed his son, and placed him, for the acquisition of philosophy, under the most celebrated stoics of that age.
Young Seneca, imbibing the precepts of the Pythagorean doctrine, religiously abstained from eating the flesh of animals, until Tiberius having threatened to punish some Jews and Egyptians, who abstained from certain meats, he was persuaded by his father to renounce the Pythagorean practice.
Seneca displayed the talents of an eloquent speaker; but dreading the jealbusy of Caligula, who aspired to the same excellence, he thought proper to abandon that pursuit, and apply himself towards suing for the honours and offices of the state.
He accordingly obtained the place of quaestor, in which office incurring the imputation of a
scandalous amour with Julia Livia, he removed from Rome, and was banished by the Emperor Claudius to Corsica.</p>
<p>Upon the marriage of Claudius with Agrippink, Seneca was re-called from his exile, in which he had remained near eight years, and was appointed to superintend the education of Nero, now destined to become the successor to the throne.
In the character of preceptor he appears to have acquitted himself with ability and credit; though he has been charged by his enemies with having initiated his pupil in those detestable vices which disgraced the reign of Nero.
Could he have indeed been guilty of such immoral conduct, it is probable that he would not so easily have forfeited the favour of that Emperor; and it is more reasonable to suppose that his disapprobation of Nero's conduct was the real cause of that odium which soon after proved fatal to him.
By the enemies whom distinguished merit and virtue never fail to excite at a profligate court, Seneca was accused of having maintained a criminal correspondence with Agrippina in the life-time of Claudius; but the chief author of this calumny was Suilius, who had been banished from Rome at the instance of Seneca.
He was likewise charged with having amassed exorbitant riches, with having built magnificent houses, and formed beautiful gardens, during the four years in which he had acted as preceptor to Nero.
This charge he considered as a prelude to his destruction; which to avoid, if possible, he requested of the Emperor to accept of the riches and possessions which he had acquired in his situation at court, and to permit him to withdraw himself into a life of studious retirement.
Nero, dissembling his secret intentions refused this request; and Seneca, that he might obviate all cause of suspicion or offence, kept himself at home for some time, under the pretext of indisposition.</p>
<p>Upon the breaking out of the conspiracy of Piso, in which some of the principal senators were concerned, Natalis, the discoverer of the plot, mentions Seneca's name as an accessory.
There is, however, no satisfactory evidence that Seneca had any knowledge of the plot.
Nero, however, glad of such an occasion of sacrificing the philosopher to his secret jealousy, sent him an order to destroy himself.
When the messenger arrived with this mandate.
Seneca was sitting at table, with his wife Paulina and two of his friends.
He heard the message not only with philosophical firmness, but even with symptoms of joy, and observed that such an honour might long have been expected from a man who had assassinated all his friends, and even murdered his own mother.
The only request which he made, was,'that he might be permitted to dispose of his possessions as he pleased; but this was refused him.
Immediately turning himself to his friends, who were weeping at his melancholy fate, he said to them, that, since he could not leave them what he considered as his own property, he should leave at least his own life for an example; an innocence of conduct which they might imitate, and by which they might acquire immortal fame.
He remonstrated with composure against their unavailing tears and lamenta.ions, and asked them, whether they had not learnt better to sustain the shocks of fortune, and the violence of tyranny?</p>
<p>The emotions of his wife he endeavoured to allay with philosophical consolation; and when she expressed a resolution to die with him, he said, that he was glad to find his example imitated with so much fortitude.
The veins of both were opened at the same time; but Nero's command extending only to Seneca, the life of Paulina was preserved; and, according to some authors, she was not displeased at being prevented from carrying her precipitate resolution into effect.
Seneca's veins bleeding but slowly, an opportunity was offered him of displaying in his last moments a philosophical magnanimity similar to that of Socrates; and it appears that his conversation during this solemn period was maintained with dignified composure.
'Io accelerate his lingering fate, he drank a dose of poison; but this producing no effect, he ordered his attendants to carry him into a warm bath, for the purpose of rendering the haemorrhage from his veins more copious.
This expedient proving likewise ineffectual, and the soldiers who witnessed the execution of the Emperor's order being clamorous for its accomplishment, he was removed into a stove, and suffocated by the steam.
He underwent his fate on the 12th of April, in the sixty-fifth year of the Christian era, and the fifty-third year of his age.
His body was burnt, and his ashes deposited in a private manner, according to his will, which had been made during the period when he was in the highest degree of favour with Nero.</p>
<p>Seneca's first composition is on Anger, and continued through three books.
After giving a lively description of this passion, the author discusses a variety of questions concerning it; he argues strongly against its utility, in contradiction to the peripatetics, and recomnends its restraint, by many just and excellent considerations.
This treatise may be regarded, in its general outlines, as a philosophical amplification of the passage in Horace:
<cit><quote lang="la"><l>Ira furor brevis est: animum rege: qui, nisi paret,</l>
<l>Imperat: hunc franis, hunc tu compesce catena.</l></quote> <bibl n="Hor. Ep. 1.2.62">Epist. 1.2.62"</bibl></cit>
<quote lang="en"><l>Anger's a fitful madness: rein thy mind,</l>
<l>Subdue the tyrant, and in letters bind,</l>
<l>Or be thyself the slave.</l></quote></p>
<p>The next treatise is on Consolation, addressed to his mother, Helvia, and was written during his exile.
He there informs his mother that he bears his banishment with fortitude, and advises her to do the same.
He observes that, in respect to himself, change of place, poverty, ignominy, and contempt, are not real evils; that there may be two reasons for her anxiety on his account; first, that by his absence she is deprived of his protection; and in the next place, of the satisfaction arising from his company; on both which heads he suggests a variety of pertinent observations.
Immediately subsequent to the preceding, is another treatise on Consolation, addressed to one of Claudius's freedmen, named Polybius, perhaps after the learned historian.
In this tract, which is in several parts mutilated, the author endeavours to console Polybius for the loss of a brother who had lately died.
The sentiments and admonitions are well suggested; but they are intermixed with such fulsome encomiums on the imperial domestic, as degrade the dignity of the author.
A fourth treatise on Consolation is addressed to Marcia, a respectable and opulent lady, the daughter of Cremutius Cordus, by whose death she was deeply affected.</p>
<p>These consolatory addresses are followed by a treatise on Providence, which evinces the author to have entertained the most just and philosophical sentiments on that subject.
He infers the necessary existence of a Providence from the regularity and constancy observed in the government of the universe: but his chief object is to show, why, upon the principle that a Providence exists, good men should be liable to evils.
The next treatise, which is on Tranquillity of Mind, appears to have been written soon after his return from exile.
There is a confusion in the arrangement of this tract; but it contains a variety of just ob. servations.
Then follows a discourse on the Constancy of a Wise Man. This has by some been considered as a part of the preceding treatise; but they are evidently distinct.
It is one of the author's best productions, in regard both of sentiment and composition, and contains a fund of moral observations, suited to fortify the mind under the oppression of accidental calamities.
We next meet with a tract on Clemency, in two books, addressed to Nero.
This appears to have been written in the beginning of the reign of Nero, on whom the author bestows some high encomiums, which, at that time, seem not to have been destitute of foundation.
The  discourse  which  succeeds is on the Shortness of Life, addressed  to  Paulinus.
In  this  excellent treatise the author endeavours to show  that the complaint of the shortness of life is not founded in truth:  that it is men who make life short, either by passing it in indolence, or otherwise improperly.
He inveighs against indolence, luxury, and every unprofitable avocation.</p>
<p>Next follows a discourse on a Happy Life, addressed to Gallio.
Seneca seems to have intended this as a vindication of himself, against those who calumniated him on account of his riches and manner of living.
He maintained that a life can only be rendered happy by its conformity to the dictates of virtue, but that such a life is perfectly compatible with the possession of riches, where they happen to accrue.
The author pleads his own cause with great ability, as well as justness of argument.
His vindication is in many parts highly beautiful, and accompanied with admirable sentiments respecting the moral obligations to a virtuous life.
The preceding discourse is followed by one upon the Retirement of a Wise Man.
The beginning of this tract is wanting; but in the sequel the author discusses a question which was much agitated amongst the Stoics and Epicureans, viz., whether a wise man ought to concern himself with the affairs of the public.
Both these sects of philosophers maintained that a life of retirement was most suitable to a wise man, but they differed with respect to the circumstances in which it might be proper to deviate from this conduct; one party considering the deviation as prudent, when there existed a just motive for such conduct, and the other, when there was no forcible reason against it. Seneca regards both these opinions as founded upon principles inadequate to the advancement both of public and private happiness, which ought ever to be the ultimate object of moral speculation.
The last of the author's discourses, addressed to £Ebucius, is on Benefits, and continued through seven books.
He begins with lamenting the frequency of in. gratitude amongst mankind, a vice which he severely censures.
After some preliminary considerations respecting the nature of benefits, he proceeds to show in what manner, and on whom, they ought to be conferred.</p>
<p>The Epistles of Seneca consist of one hundred and twenty-four, all on moral subjects.
His Natural Questions extend through seven books, in which he has collected the hypotheses of Aristotle and other ancient writers.
These are followed by a whimsical effusion on the death of Caligula.
The remainder of his works comprises seven Persuasive discourses, five books of Controversies, and ten books containing Extracts of Declamations.</p>
<p>From the multiplicity of Seneca's productions, it is evident that, notwithstanding the luxurious life he is said to have led, he was greatly devoted to literature, a propensity which, it is probable, was confirmed by his banishment during almost eight years in the island of Corsica,
where he was in a great degree secluded from every other resource.
But with whatever splendour Seneca's domestic economy may have been supported, it seems highly improbable that he indulged himself in luxurious enjoyment in any vicious excess.
His situation at the Roman court, being honourable and important, could not fail of being likewise advantageous, not only from the imperial profusion common at that time, but from many contingent emoluments which his extensive interest and patronage would naturally afford him.
He was born of a respectable rank, lived in habits of familiar intercourse with persons of the first distinction, and if, in the course of his attendance upon Nero, he had acquired a large fortune, no blame could justly attach to his conduct in maintaining an elegant hospitality.
The Imputation of luxury was thrown upon him from two quarters, viz., by the dissolute companions of Nero, to whom the mention of such an example served as an apology for their own extreme dissipation; and by those who envied him for the affluence and dignity which he had acquired.
The charge, however, is supported only by vague assertion, and is discredited by every consideration which ought to have weight in determining the reality of human characters  It seems totally inconsistent with his habits of literary industry, with the virtuous sentiments which he everywhere strenuously maintains, and the esteem with which he was regarded by a numerous acquaintance as a philosopher and a moralist.</p>
<p>The judgments on Seneca's writings have been as various as the opinions about his character, and both in extremes.
His philosophy, so far as he adopted a system, was the stoical, but it was rather an eclecticism of stoicism than pure stoicism.
His style is antithetical, and apparently laboured.
People will judge of Seneca, as they do of most moral writers, by the measure of their own opinions.
The less a man cares for the practical, the real, the less will he value Seneca.
The more a man envelopes himself in words and ideas without exact meaning the less will he comprehend a writer who does not merely deal in words, but has ideas with something to correspond to them.</p>
<p>Seneca, like other educated Romans, rejected the superstition of his country; he looked upon the ceremonials of religion as a matter of custom and fashion, and nothing more.
His religion is simple Deism; the Deity acts in man and in all things, which is the same thing that Paul said when he addressed the Athenians, " for in him (God) we live, and move, and have our being."
Indeed, there have been persons who, with the help of an active imagination, have made Seneca a Christian, and to have been acquainted with Paul, which is a possible thing, but cannot be proved.</p>
<p>Besides the works which have been enumerated there are extant ten tragedies, which are attributed to Seneca; Quintilian, and other Latin writers, quote these plays as the works of Seneca.
They are entitled, Hercules Furens, Thyestes, Thebais or Phanissae, Hippolytus or Phaedra, Oedipus, Troades or Hecuba, Medea, Agamemnon, Hercules Oetatus, and Octavia.
The titles themselves, with the exception of the Octavia, indicate sufficiently what the tragedies are: Greek mythological subjects treated in a peculiar manner.
The subject of the Octavia is Nero's ill-treatment of his wife, his passion for Poppaea, and the exile of Octavia.
Seneca himself is one of the personages of the drama, and he is introduced in the second act, deploring the vices of the age and his own unhappiness in his elevated station.
There seems no reason why this tragedy should not be attributed to the same author as the other nine, except the fact that it is not found in the oldest Florentine MS. of the tragedies, nor is there any such difference between this and the other tragedies in character and expression as to make it a probable conclusion that it is not by the same hand.</p>
<p>These tragedies are not adapted, and certainly were never intended, for the stage.
They were designed for reading, or for recitation, after the Roman fashion, and they bear the stamp of a rhetorical age.
Moral sentiments and maxims abound, and the style and character of Seneca are as conspicuous here as in his prose works.
But there is a wonderful difference between the Latin tragic writer and the Greek dramatists.
These Roman tragedies are, in fact, little more than dramas in name and in form; the form, indeed, is precisely Greek, but there is no substance under the form.
The study of the tragedies of Seneca has had some influence on the French drama.

<head>C. Petronius</head>
<div2 type="chapter" n="1">
<p>PETRONIUS was a Roman knight, apparently of considerable fortune, who in his youth seems to have given close application to polite literature, in which he acquired a just taste and an elegance of composition.
Early initiated in the gaieties of fashionable life, he contracted a habit of voluptuousness which rendered him an accommodating companion to the dissipated and the luxurious.
The court of Claudius, entirely governed for some time by Messalina, was then the residence of pleasure; and here Petronius failed not of making a conspicuous appearance.
More delicate, however, than sensual, he rather joined inl the dissipation, than indulged in the vices of the palace.
To interrupt a course of hfe too uniform to afford him perpetual satisfaction, he accepted the proconsulship of Bithynia, and went to that province, where he discharged the duties of his office with credit.
Upon his return to Rome, Nero, who had succeeded Claudius, made him consul.
This new dignity, by giving him frequent and easy access to the Emperor, created an intimacy between them, which was-increased by the elegant entertainments often given to Nero by Petronius.
In a short time, this gay voluptuary became so much a favourite at court, that nothing was agreeable but what was approved by Petronius: and the authority which he acquired, by being umpire in whatever related to gay dissipation, procured him the title of Arbiter elegantiarum.
Things continued in this state whilst the Emperor kept within the bounds of moderation; and Petronius acted as intendant of his pleasures, ordering him shows, games, comedies, music, feats, and all that could contribute to make the hours of relaxation pass agreeably; seasoning, at the same time, the innocent delights which he procured for the Emperor with every possible charm, to prevent him from seeking after such as might prove pernicious both to morals and the republic.
Nero, however, giving way to his own disposition, which was naturally vicious, at length changed his conduct, not only in regard to the government of the empire, but of himself: and listening to other counsels than those of Petronius.
gave the entire reins to his passions, which afterwards plunged him in ruin.
The Emperor's new favourite was Tigellinus, a man of the most profligate morals, who omitted nothing that could gratify the inordinate appetites of his prince, at the expense of all decency and virtue.
During this period, Petronius gave vent to his indignation, in the satire entitled Satyricon.
But his retirement from court did not secure him from the artifices of Tigellinus, who laboured with all his power to destroy the man whom he had supplanted in the Emperor's favour.
With this view he insinuated to Nero, that Petronius was too intimately connected with Scevinus not to be engaged in Piso's conspiracy; and, to support his calumny, caused the Emperor to be present at the examination of one of Petronius's slaves, whom he had secretly suborned to swear against his master.
Nero embraced with joy the opportunity of removing a man, to whom he knew the present manners of the court were utterly obnoxious, and he soon after issued orders for arresting Petronius.
As it required, however, some time to deliberate whether they should put a person of his consideration to death, without more evident proofs of the charges preferred against him, such was the poet's disgust at living in the power of
so detestable and capricious a tyrant, that he resolved to die.
For this purpose, making choice of the same expedient which had been adopted by Seneca, he caused his veins to be opened, but he closed them again, for a little time, that he might enjoy the conversation of his friends, who came to see him in his last moments.
He desired them, it is said, to entertain him, not with discourses on the immortality of the soul, or the consolation of philosophy, but with agreeable tales and poetic gallantries.
Disdaining to imitate the servility of those who, dying by the orders of Nero, yet made him their heir, and filled their wills with encomiums of the tyrant and his favourites, he broke to pieces a goblet of precious stones, out of which he had commonly drank, that Ncro, who he knew would seize upon it after his death, might not have the pleasure of using it. As the only present suitable to such a prince, he sent him, under a sealed cover, his Satyricon, written purposely against him; and then broke his signet; that it might not, after his death, become the means of accusation against the person in whose custody it should be found.</p>
<p>The Satyricon of Petronius is one of the most curious productions in the Latin language.
Some of the scenes, incidents, and characters, are of so extraordinary a nature, that the description of them, without a particular application, must have been regarded as extremely whimsical, and the work, notwithstanding its ingenuity, has been doomed to oblivion: but history justifies the belief, that in the court of Nero, the extravagancies mentioned by Petronius were realized to a degree which authenticates the representation given of them.
The inimitable character of Trimalchio, which exhibits a person sunk in the most debauched effeminacy, was drawn for Nero; and we are assured, that there were formerly medals of that emperor, with these words, C. Nero August.
Imp., and on the reverse, Trimalchio.
The various characters are well discriminated, and supported with admirable propriety.
Never was such licentiousness of description united to such delicacy of colouring.
The force of the satire consists not in poignancy of sentiment, but in the ridicule which arises from the whimsical, but characteristic and faithful exhibition of the objects introduced.
That Nero was struck with the justness of the representation, is evident from the displeasure which he showed, at finding Petronius so well acquainted with his infamous excesses.
After levelling his suspicion on all who could possibly have betrayed him, he at last fixed on a senator's wife, named Silia, who bore a part in his revels, and was an intimate friend of Petronius: upon which she was immediately sent into banishment.
Amongst the miscellaneous materials in this work, are some pieces of. poetry, written in   	 an elegant taste.
A poem on the civil war between Caesar and Pompey, is beautiful and animated.</p>
<p>Though the Muses appear to have been mostly in a quiescent state from the time of Augustus, we find from Petronius Arbiter, who exhibits the manners of the capital during the reign of Nero, that poetry still continued to be a favourite pursuit amongst the Romans, and one to which, indeed, they seem to have had a national propensity.

It was cultivated as a kind of fashionable exercise, in short and desultory attempts, in which the chief ambition was to produce verses extempore.
They were publicly recited by their authors with great ostentation; and a favourable verdict from an audience, however partial, and frequently obtained either by intrigue or bribery, was construed by those frivolous pretenders into a real adjudication of poetical fame.
</p></div2></div1>
<div1 type="life" n="lucan">
<head>M. Annaeus Lucanus</head>
<div2 type="chapter" n="1">
<p>LUCAN was the son of Annaeus Mela, the brother of Seneca, the philosopher.
He was born at Cordoba, the original residence of the family, but came early to Rome, where his promising talents, and the patronage of his uncle, recommended him  to the favour of Nero; by whom he was raised to the dignity of an augur and quaestor before he had attained the usual age.
Prompted by the desire of displaying his political abilities, he had the imprudence to engage in a competition with his imperial patron.
The subject chosen by Nero was the tragical fate of Niobe; and that of Lucan was Orpheus.
The ease with which the latter obtained the victory in the contest, excited the jealousy of the Emperor, who resolved upon depressing his rising genius.
With this view, he exposed him daily to the mortification of fresh insults, until at last the poet's resentment was so much provoked, that he entered into the conspiracy of Piso for cutting off the tyrant.
The plot being discovered, there remained for the unfortunate Lucan no hope of pardon: and choosing the same mode of death which was employed by his uncle, he had his
veins opened, while he sat in a warm bath, and expired in pronouncing with great emphasis the following lines in his Pharsalia:
<cit><quote lang="en"><l>Asunder flies the man.</l>
<l>No single wound the gaping rupture seems,</l>
<l>Where trickling crimson flows in tender streams;</l>
<l>But from an opening horrible and wide</l>
<l>A thousand vessels pour the bursting tide;</l>
<l>At once the winding channel's course was broke,</l>
<l>Where wandering life her mazy journey took.</l></quote> <bibl>Lib. iii. Rowe.</bibl></cit></p>
<p>Some authors have said that he betrayed pusillanimity at the hour of death; and that, to save himself from  punishment, he accused his mother of being involved in the conspiracy.
This circumstance, however, is not mentioned by other writers, who relate, on the contrary, that he died with philosophical fortitude.
He was then only in the twenty-sixth year of his age.</p>
<p>Lucan had scarcely reached the age of puberty when he wrote a poem on the contest between Hector and Achilles.
He also composed in his youth a poem on the burning of Rome; but his only surviving work.is a poem, in ten books, entitled Pharsala, in which the progress of the struggle between Caesar and Pompey is fully detailed, the events, commencing with the passage of the Rubicon, being arranged in regular chronological order.
In the earlier portions we find liberal sentiments expressed in very moderate terms, accompanied by open and almost fulsome flattery of Nero; but, as we proceed, the .blessings of freedom are more and more loudly proclaimed, and the invectives against tyranny are couched in language the most offensive, evidently aimed directly at the Emperor.
Whether this remarkable change of tone is to-be ascribed to the gradual development of the evil passions of the prince, or whether it arose from the personal bitterness of a disgraced favourite, must be left to conjecture; but, whichever explanation we may adopt, it is impossible to believe that the work was published entire during the lifetime of the author, and it appears almost certain that it never received his last corrections.</p>
<p>"With regard to the story of the public defeat sustained by Nero, which has been repeated again and again without.any expression of distrust, and has afforded the subject of a glowing picture to a French critic, we may observe," says Prof.
Ramsay, "that it is passed over in silence by all our classical authorities, that it is at variance with the account given by the compiler of the life attributed to Suetonius, that priori it is highly improbable that any literary man at that period, however vain and headstrong, much less a court favourite, whose near
est kinsmen were courtiers, would ever have formed the project of engaging seriously in a combat where success was ruin.
That no such event took place under the circumstances represented above, can be proved from history, for the quiquennial competition instituted by Nero, and called Neronia, was held for the first time <date value="60">A.D. 60</date>, when, as we are expressly told by Suetonius, several persons of the greatest merit contended, but they unanimously yielded to the Emperor.
The second celebration did not take place till after the death of Piso and his confederates.
In all probability the fable arose from an obscure expression in the Geneltliacon of Statius, which, although hard to explain, certainly affords no sufficient foundation for the structure which has been reared upon it."</p>
<p>A remarkable diversity of opinion exists with regard to the merits of Lucan.
The eailier critics, assuming the attitude of contending advocates, absurdly exaggerate and unreasonably depreciate his powers, and yet great defects and great beauties are obvious to the impartial observer.
We distinctly perceive throughout vigorous genius strggling, but in vain, against the paralysing influence of a corrupt system of mental culture and a depraved standard of national taste.

<div1 type="life" n="persius">
<head>A. Persius Flaccus</head>
<div2 type="chapter" n="1">
<p>THE poet Persius, a Roman knight connected by blood and marriage with persons of the highest rank, was born at Volaterrae in Etruria, on the 4th of December, <date value="34">A. D. 34</date>. His father, Flaccus, died six years afterwards; his mother, Fulvia Sisennia, married as her second husband a certain Fusins, belonging to the equestrian order, and within a few years again became a widow.
Young Persius received the first rudiments of education in his native town, remaining there until the age of twelve, and then removed to Rome, where he studied grammar under the celebrated Remmius Palaemon, and rhetoric under Vergnius Flavius.
When approaching the verge of manhood he became the pupil of Cornutus the Stoic, who opened up to him the first principles of mental science, and speedily impressed upon his plastic mind a stamp which gave a character to his whole subsequent career.
To this master he attached himself so closely that he never quitted his side, and the warmest reciprocal attachment was cherished to the last by the instructor and his disciple.
By the high-minded and virtuous Paetus
Thrasea, the husband of his kinswoman, the younger Alria, Persius was tenderly beloved, and seems to have been worthy of such affection, for he is described as a youth of pleasing aspect, of most gentle manners, of maiden modesty, pure and upright, exemplary in his conduct as a son, a brother, and a nephew.
He died of a disease of the stomach, <date value="62">A. D. 62</date>, before he had completed his twenty eighth year.</p>
<p>The extant works of Persius, who, we are told, wrote seldom and slowly, consist of six short satires, extending in all to 650 hexameter lines, and were left in an unfinished state.
They were slightly corrected after his death by Cornutus, while Caesius Bassus was permitted, at his own earnest request, to be the editor.
In boyhood be composed a comedy, and a few verses upon Arria, the mother-in-law of Thrasea, that Arria whose death has been rendered so celebrated by the narratives of Pliny and Dion Cassius.<note anchored="yes">When the husband of this Arria was ordered by the Emperor Claudius to put an end to his life, <date value="42">A. D. 42</date>, and hesitated to do so, Arria stabbed herself, handed the dagger to her husband, and said, "Petus, it does not pain me."
</note> The whole of these juvenile effusions were by the advice of Cornutus destroyed.</p>
<p>Few productions have ever enjoyed more widely diffused and more enduring popularity than the Satires.
When read over to Lucan, he could scarcely refrain from shouting with delight; when first given to the world, they were devoured with eager admiration, and a long, unbroken chain of testimonies, direct or implied, to their merits, might be linked together, reaching from  the period of their publication through the darkest portion of the middle ages down to the revival of literature.
How far this reputation has been fairly earned, may admit of question.
His delineations of men and manners are immeasurably inferior to those of Horace and Juvenal, nor can his cold formalism and rough, ungainly style stand for a moment in competition with the lively practical good sense and easy grace of the one, or with the fiery indignation and sonorous rhetoric of the other.
His pictures, although skillfully drawn, grouped with dexterity and often finished with patient minuteness, are deficient in reality; they are not sketched from human beings actually living and moving in the business of the world, but are highly coloured fancy pieces, imagined by the student in his seclusion, created for the purpose of illustrating some abstract general principle or subtle philosophical paradox.
In fact, the last five satires .may be regarded as so many scholastic exercises, each being devoted to the exhibition of a doctrine propounded by the Stoics, stated and developed according to their discipline.
We must not, at the same time, withhold from Persius the praise of great ingenuity in moulding to his purpose the most refractory materials, of calling up a crowd of images by a few skillful touches, and concentrating a multitude of thoughts within the compass of a few pregnant words.
He is, unquestionably, the most dramatic of the ancient satirists; his dialogues are in the highest degree spirited and effective, conveying a very distinct notion of the element which formed the staple of the original Satura.

<div1 type="life" n="messalina">
<head>Valeria Messalina</head>
<div2 type="chapter" n="1">
<p>VALERIA MESSALINA, daughter of M. Valerius Messala Barbatus and of Domitia Lepida, was the third wife of the Emperor Claudius I. She married Claudius, to whom she was previously related, before his accession to the empire.
Her character is drawn in the darkest colours by the almost contemporary pencils of Tacitus and the elder Pliny, by the satirist Juvenal, who makes her the exemplar of female profligacy, and by the historian Dion Cassius, who wrote long after any motive remained for exaggerating her crimes.
That the reign of Claudius owed some of its worst features to the influence of his wives and freedmen is beyond doubt; and it is equally certain that Messalina was faithless as a wife, and implacable where her fears were aroused, or her passions or avarice weie to be gratified.
The freedmen of Claudius, especially Polybius and Narcissus, were her confederates; the Emperor was her instrument
and her dupe; the most illustrious families of Rome were polluted by
her favour, or sacrificed to her cupidity or hate, and the absence of
virtue was not concealed by a lingering sense of shame or even by a
specious veil of decorum. Among her most eminent victims were the
two Julias, one the daughter of Germanicus, the other the daughter of
Drusius, the son of Tiberius, whom she offered up, the former to her
jealousy, the latter to her pride; C. Appius Silanus, who had rejected
her advances and spurned her favourite Narcissus: Justus Catonius,
whose impeachment of herself she anticipated by accusing him; M.
Vincius, who had married a daughter of Germanicus, and whose illustrious birth and affinity to Claudius she dreaded; and Valerius Asiaticus,
whose mistress Poppaea she envied, and whose estates she coveted.</p>
<p>The conspiracy of Annius Vinicianus and Camillus Scribonianus in
A, D. 42 afforded Messalina the means of satiating her thirst for gold,
vengeance, and intrigue. Claudius was timid, and timidity made him
cruel.
Slaves were encouraged to inform against their masters; members of the noblest houses were subjected to the ignominy of torture and a public execution; their-heads were exposed in the forum; their bodies were flung down the steps of the Capitol; the prisons were filled with a crowd of both sexes; even strangers were not secure from her suspicions or solicitations; and the only refuge from her love or hate was the surrender of an estate or a province, an office or a purse, to herself or her satellites.
The rights of citizenship were sold by Messalina and the freedmen with shameless indifference to any purchaser, and it was currently said that the Roman civitas might be purchased for two cracked drinking cups.
Nor was the ambition of Messalina inferior to her other passions.
She disposed of legions and provinces without consulting either Claudius or the Senate; she corrupted or intimidated the judicial tribunals; her creatures filled the lowest as well as the highest public offices; and their incompetency for the posts they had bought led in <date value="43">A. D. 43</date> led to a scarcity and tumult.</p>
<p>The charms, the arts, or the threats of Messalina were so potent with the stupid Claudius that he thought her worthy of the honours which Livia, the wife of Augustus, had enjoyed; he alone was ignorant of her infidelities, and sometimes-even the unconscious minister of her pleasures.
At his triumph for the campaign in Britain (<date value="44">A. D. 44</date>), Messalina followed his chariot in a carpentum or covered carriage,-a privilege requiring a special grant from the Senate.
The adulteress received the title of Augusta and the right of precedence at all assemblies; her lover, Sabinus, once praefect of Gaul, but for his crimes degraded to a gladiator, was, at her request, reprieved from death in the arena, and the Emperor caused a serious riot at Rome by withholding the popular pantomime Mnester from the stage while Messalina detained him in the palace.
Messalina was safe so long as the freedmen felt themselves secure; butwhen her malice or her rashness endangered her accomplices, her doom was inevitable.
She had procured the death of Polybius, and Narcissus perceived the frail tenure of his own station and life.
The insane folly of Messalina, in <date value="48">A. D. 48</date>, furnished the means of her own destruction.
Hitherto she had been content with the usual excesses of a profligate age, with the secrecy of the palace, or the freedom of the brothel.
But in <date value="47">A. D. 47</date> she had conceived a violent passion for a handsome Roman youth, C. Silius.
She compelled him to divorce his wife, Junia Silana, and in return discarded her favourite Mnester.
In 48, her passion broke through the last restraints of decency and prudence, and, during the absence of Claudius at Ostia, she publicly married Silius with all the rites of a legal connubium. Messalina had
wrought upon the fears of Claudius for the destruction of others; those fears were now turned against herself.
Narcissus persuaded the feeble Emperor that Silius and Messalina would not have dared such an outrage had they not determined also to deprive him of empire and life.
Claudius wavered long, and at length Narcissus himself issued Messalina's death-warrant, which he committed to his freedman Euodus, and to a tribune of the guards.
She perished by the tribune's hand in the garden of Lucullus, a portion of the demesne of her victim Valerius Asiaticus.
Her name, titles and statues were removed from the palace and the public buildings of Rome by a decree of the Senate.
She left two children by Claudius, Britannicus and Octavia.

<div1 type="life" n="agrippina2">
<head>Agrippina II</head>
<div2 type="chapter" n="1">
<p>AGRIPPINA II. was the daughter of Germanicus and Agrippina the elder, daughter of M. Vipsanius Agrippa.
She was born between A. D.
superior talents over the old Emperor, that, in prejudice of his own son, Britannicus, he adopted Domitius, the son of Agrippina by her first husband, Cn. Domitius Ahenobarbus (<date value="51">A. D. 51</date>). Agrippina was assisted in her secret plans by Pallas, the perfidious confidant of Claudius.
By his intrigues, L. Junius Silanus, the husband of Octavia, the daughter of Claudius, was put to death, and in <date value="53">A. D. 53</date> Octavia was married to young Nero.
Lollia Paullina, once the rival of Agrippina for the hand of the Emperor, was accused of high treason and condemned to death; but she put an end to her own life.
Domitia Lepida, the sister of Cn. Domitius Ahenobarbus, met with a similar fate.
After having thus removed those whose rivalship she dreaded, or whose virtues she envied, Agrippina resolved to get rid of her husband, and to govern the empire through her ascendancy over her son Nero, his successor.
A vague rumour of this reached the Emperor; in a state of drunkenness he forgot prudence, and talked about punishing his ambitious wife.
Having no time to lose, Agrippina, assisted by Locusta and Xenophon, a Greek physician, poisoned the old Emperor, in <date value="54">A. D. 54</date>, at Sinuessa, a watering place to which he had retired for the sake of his health.
Nero was proclaimed Emperor, and presented to the troops by Burrus, whom Agrippina had appointed prefectus prsetorio.
Narcissus, the rich freedman of Claudius, M. Junius Silanus, and a great-grandson of Augustus, lost their lives at the instigation of Agrippina.
Meanwhile, the young Emperor took some steps to shake off the insupportable ascendancy of his mother.
To reconquer his affection, Agrippina employed, but in vain, most daring and most revolting means.
She threatened to oppose Britannicus as a rival to the Emperor; but Britannicus was poisoned by Nero; and she even solicited her son to an incestuous intercourse.
At last her death was resolved upon by Nero.
He invited her under the pretext of a reconciliation to visit him at Baise, on the coast of Campania.
She went thither by sea. In their conversation hypocrisy was displayed on both sides.
She left Baise by the same way; but the vessel was so contrived that it was to break to pieces when out at sea.
It only partly broke, and Agrippina saved herself by swimming to the shore.
Agrippina fled to her villa near the Lucrine lake, and informed her son of her happy escape.
Now, Nero charged Burrus to murder his mother; but Burrus declining it, Anecitus, who had invented the stratagem of the ship, was compelled by Nero and Burrus to undertake the task.
Anecitus went to her villa with a chosen band, and his men surprised her in her bedroom, where she expired under their blows.
It was told, that Nero went to the villa, and that he admired the beauty of the dead body of his mother.

<div1 type="life" n="quintilian">
<head>Quintilian</head>
<div2 type="chapter" n="1">
<p>If we view Domitian in the different lights in which he is represented, during his lifetime and after his decease, his character and conduct discover a greater diversity than is commonly observed in the objects of historical detail.
But as posthumous character is always the most just, its decisive verdict affords the surest criterion by which this variegated emperor must be estimated by impartial posterity.
According to this rule, it is beyond a doubt that his vices were more predominant than his virtues: and when we follow him into his closet, for some time after his accession, when he was thirty years of age, the frivolity of his daily employment, in the killing of flies, exhibits an instance of dissipation, which surpasses all that has been recorded of his imperial predecessors.
The encouragement, however, which the first Vespasian had shown to literature, continued to operate during the present reign; and we behold the first fruits of its auspicious influence in the valuable treatise of QUINTILIAN.</p>
<p>Of the life of this celebrated writer, little is known upon any authority that has a title to much credit.
We learn, however, that he was the son of a lawyer in the service of some of the preceding emperors, and was born at Rome, though in what consulship, or under what emperor, it is impossible to determine.
He married a woman of a noble family, by whom he had two sons.
The mother died in the flower of her age, and the sons, at the distance of some time from each other, when their father was advanced in years.
The precise time of Quintilian's own death is equally inauthenticated with that of his birth; nor can we rely upon an author of suspicious veracity, who says that he passed the latter part of his life in a state of indigence, which was alleviated by the liberality of his pupil, Pliny the Younger.
Quintilian opened a school of rhetoric at Rome, where he not only discharged that laborious employment with great applause during more than twenty years, but pleaded at the bar, and was the first who obtained a salary from the state, for executing the office of a public teacher.
He was also appointed by Domitian preceptor to the two young princes who were intended to succeed him on the throne.</p>
<p>After his retirement from the situation of a teacher, Quintilian devoted his attention to the study of literature, and composed a treatise on the Causes of the Corruption of Eloquence.
At the earnest solicitation of his friends, he was afterwards induced to undertake his Institutiones Oratonr, the most elaborate system of oratory extant in any language.
This work is divided into twelve books, in which the author treats with great precision of the qualities of a perfect orator; explaining not only the fundamental principles of eloquence, as connected with the constitution of the human mind, but pointing out, both by argument and observation, the most successful method of exercising that admirable art, for the accomplishment of its purpose.
So minutely, and upon so extensive a plan, has he prosecuted the subject, that he delineates the education suitable to a perfect orator, from the stage of infancy in the cradle, to the consummation of rhetorical fame, in the pursuits of the bar, or those, in general, of any public assembly.
It is sufficient to say, that in the execution of this elaborate work, Quintilian has called to the assistance of his own acute and comprehensive understanding, the profound penetration of Aristotle, the exquisite graces of Cicero; all the stores of observation, experience, and practice; and in a word, the whole accumulated exertions of ancient genius on the subject of oratory.</p>
<p>It may justly be regarded as an extraordinary circumstance in the progress of scientific improvement, that the endowments of a perfect orator were never fully exhibited to the world, until it had become dangerous to exercise them for the important purposes for which they were originally cultivated.
And it is no less remarkable, that, under all the violence and caprice of imperial despotism which the Romans had now experienced, their sensibility to the enjoyment of poetical compositions remained still unabated; as if it served to console the nation for the irretrievable loss of public liberty.
From this source of entertainment, they reaped more pleasure during the present reign, than they had done since the time of Augustus.
The poets of this period were Juvenal, Statius, and Martial.

<head>Cn. Julius Agricola (abridged)</head>
<div2 type="chapter" n="4">
<p>CNAEUS JULIUS AGRICOLA was born at the ancient and respectable colony of Forojulium.
His grandfather, by the maternal as well as the paternal line, served the office of imperial procurator, a trust of importance, which always confers the equestrian dignity.
His father, Julius Grsecinus, was a member of the Senate, distinguished by his eloquence and philosophy.
His merit gave umbrage to  Caligula. Being commanded by that emperor to undertake the prosecution of Marcus Silanus, he refused to comply, and was put to death.
Julia Procilla, Agricola's mother, was respected for the purity of her manners.
Under her care and, as it were, in her bosom, the tender mind of the son was trained to science and every liberal accomplishment.
His own ingenuous disposition guarded him against the seductions of pleasure.
To that happy temperament was added  the advantage of pursuing his studies at Marseilles, that seat of learning, where the refinements of Greece were happily blended with the sober manners of provincial economy.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="5">
<p>His first rudiments of military knowledge were acquired in Britain, under the conduct of Suetonius Paulinus, that experienced officer, active, vigilant, yet mild in command.
Agricola was soon  distinguished by his general, and selected to live with him at head-quarters.
Honoured in this manner, he did not, as is usual with young men, mix riot and dissipation with actual service; nor did he avail himself of his rank of military tribune to obtain leave of absence, in order to pass his time in idle pleasures and ignorance of his duty.
To know the province, and make himself known to the army; to learn from men of experience, and to emulate the best examples; to seek no enterprise with a forward spirit, and to decline none with timid caution, were the rules he laid down to himself; prudent with valour, and brave without ostentation.
A more active campaign had never been known, nor was Britain at any time as fiercely disputed.
Our veteran forces were put to the sword; our colonies smoked on the ground; and the legions were intercepted on their march.
The struggle was then for life; we fought afterwards for fame and victory.
In a juncture so big with danger, though the conduct of the war was in other hands, and the glory    of recovering the province was justly ascribed to the commander-inchief, yet so fair an opportunity did not fail to improve a young officer, and plant in his mind the early seeds of military ambition.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="6">
<p>He returned from Britain to enter on the gradations of the civil magistracy, and married Domitia Decidiana, a lady of high rank and splendid descent.
By that alliance he gained an accession of strength and credit, that served to forward him in the road to public honours.
The conjugal state proved a source of domestic happiness.
They lived in perfect harmony, endeared by the tenderest affection, and each ascribing to the other the felicity which they enjoyed.
Agricola obtained the office of quaestor, and the province of Asia, of which Salvius Titianus was proconsul, fell to his lot.
Neither the place nor the governor could warp his integrity.
The wealth of the inhabitants invited ihe hand of rapacity; and Titianus, by the bias of his nature prone to acts of avarice, was ready, on terms of mutual connivance, to cooperate in any scheme of guilt and plunder; but Agricola maintained his honour and his principles.
During his stay in As a, his family was increased by the birth of a daughter, who proved soon after, when he lost his infant son, a source of consolation.
The intermediate space between the expiration of his quaestorship and his advancement to the post of tribune of the people, he had the prudence to pass in calm tranquillity.
Even during the year of his tribuneship he acted with the same reserve, aware of those disastrous times when, under the tyranny of Nero's reign, the want of exertion was the truest wisdom.
He discharged the office of praetor with the same moderation and silent dignity, having no occasion, as his good fortune would have it, to sit in judicature.
The pageantry of public spectacles, which belonged to his department, he conducted with economy and magnificence, short of profusion, yet with due regard to popularity.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="7">
<p>In the course of the following year (<date value="69">A. D. 69</date>), a dreadful misfortune happened in his family, and proved to him a severe stroke of affliction.
A descent, from Otho's fleet, which roved about in quest of depredation, was made on the coast of Liguria.
The freebooters plundered the city of Intemelium, and in their fury, murdered Agricola's mother, then residing upon her own estate.
They laid waste her lands, and went off with a considerable booty.
Agricola set out immediately to pay the last tribute of filial piety, and being informed on his way, that Vespasian aspired to the imperial dignity, he declared at once in favour of that party.
In the beginning of the new reign, the government of Rome, and the whole administration, centred in Mucianus, Dornitian being, at that
time, too young for business, and from the elevation of his father claiming no other privilege than that of being debauched and profligate without control.
Agricola was despatched to raise new levies. He executed that commission with so much zeal and credit to himself, that Mucianus advanced him to the command of the twentieth legion, then quartered in Britain, and for some time unwilling to swear fidelity to Vespasian.
Their commander was of pretoran rank; but either on account of his own disaffection, or the turbulent spirit of the soldiers, his authority was too feeble.
Agricola succeeded to the command of the legion, and to the task of punishing the guilty.
He acquitted himself with consummate address and singular moderation.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="8">
<p>The government of Britain was at that time committed to Vettius Bolanus, a man of milder disposition than consisted with the genius of those ferocious islanders.
Agricola, that he might not seem to eclipse his superior officer, restrained his martial ardour, submitting with deference to his commander-in-chief, and, in every part of his conduct, uniting to his love of glory, a due regard for the service.
Bolanus was soon recalled, and Petilius Cerealis, an officer of consular rank.
succeeded to the command.
The field of warlike enterprise was laid open to Agricola  Under the new commander, he was, at first, no more than a common sharer m the dangers of the campaign; but in a short time his talents had their free career.
The general to make his experiment, sent him at the head of detached parties, and afterwards, encouraged by the event, employed him in more important operations.
Agricola never betrayed a symptom of vainglory.
From the issue of his expeditions, however successful, he assumed no merit.
By this conduct, vigorous in action, but modest in the report of his exploits, he gained a brilliant reputation, secure from the envy that attends it.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="9">
<p>On his return to Rome, Vespasian advanced him to the patrician rank, and soon after to the government of the province of Aquitania; an appointment of the first importance, leading directly to the honours of the consulship, to which he then aspired with the concurrence of the prince  The military mind, trained up in the school of war, is generally supposed to want the power of nice discrimination.
Agricola, however, indebted to nature for a certain rectitude of understanding, was not out of his sphere even among men versed in questions of jurisprudence.
In the council of the province, or on the tribunal of justice, he discharged the duties of his station with awful gravity, intent to inquire, often severe, but more inclined to soften the rigour of the law.
In less than three years he was recalled from his province, to take upon him the consular dignity.
During his consulship, though I    was then very young, he agreed to a marriage between me and his daughter, who certainly might have looked for a prouder connection.
The nuptial ceremony was not performed till the term of his consulship expired.
In a short time after, he was appointed governor of Britain, with the additional honour of a seat in the pontifical college.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="18">
<p>When Agricola arrived, about the middle of the summer (<date value="78">A. D. 78</date>), to take upon him the command, he found an army lulled in indolence and security, as if the campaign was at an end, while the enemy was on the watch to seize the first opportunity.
The Ordovicians, not long before his arrival, had fallen upon a party of horse that happened to be quartered in their district, and put them almost all to the sword.
By this blow the courage of the Britons was once more revived; the bold and resolute declared for open war, while others less sanguine, were against unsheathing the sword till the character and genius of the new governor should be better known.
Many things conspired to embarrass Agricola: the summer was far advanced; the troops were stationed at different quarters, expecting a cessation of arms during the remainder of the year; and to act on the defensive, content with strengthening the weakest stations, was in the opinion of the best officers the most prudent measure.
These were circumstances unfavourable to a spirit of enterprise; but the general resolved to put his army in motion, and face the danger without delay.
For this purpose he drew together val ious detachments from the legions, and, with the addition of a body of auxiliaries, marched against the enemy.
The Ordovicians continuing to decline an engagement on the open plain, he determined to seek them on their heights, and, to animate his men by his own example, he advanced at the head of the line.
A battle ensued, and the issue was the destruction of the Ordovician state.
Knowing of what moment it is to follow the first impressions of fame, Agricola formed a plan for the reduction of the Isle of Mona.
For the execution of an enterprise so sudden and important, no measures had been concerted, and by consequence no vessels were ready to transport the troops.
The genius and resolution of the general supplied all deficiencies.
He draughted from the auxiliaries a chosen band well acquainted with the fordable places, and inured to the national practice of swimming across lakes and rivers with such dexterity, that they could manage their arms and guide their horses at the same time.
This select corps, free from the incumbrance of their baggage, dashed into the water, and made their way with vigour towards the island.
This mode of attack astonished the enemy, who expected nothing less than a fleet of transports, and a regular embarkation.
Struck with consternation, they thought nothing impregnable to men who waged so unusual a war.
Ih despair they sued for peace, and surrendered the island.
The event added a new lustre to the name of Agricola, who had thus crowded so much glory into that part of the year which is usually trifled away m vain parade.
The moderation with which he enjoyed his victory was remarkable.
In his despatches to Rome he assumed no merit, nor were his letters, according to custom, decorated with sprigs of laurel: but this self-denial served only to enhance his fame.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="19">
<p>Agricola knew by the experience of past events, that conquest, while it loads the vanquished with injury and oppression, can never be secure and permanent.
He determined, therefore, to suppress the seeds of future hostility.
He began a reform in his own household. He removed his slaves and freedmen from every department of public business.
Promotions in the army no longer went by favour; merit decided, and the man of worth, Agricola knew, would be the most faithful soldier.
To know everything, and yet overlook a great deal; to forgive slight offences, and treat matters of importance with due severity, was the rule of his conduct; never vindictive, and in many instances disarmed by penitence.
The exigencies of the army called for large contributions of corn and other supplies, and yet he lightened the burden by just and equal assessments, providing at the same time against the extortion of the tax-gatherer, more odious and intolerable than even the tax itself.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="20">
<p>The consequence was, that peace, which, through the neglect or connivance of former governors was no less terrible than war itself, began to diffuse its blessings, and to be relished by all.
As soon as the summer opened, he assembled his army and marched in quest of the enemy.
Having spread a general terror through the country, he then suspended his operations, that, in the interval of repose, the barbarians might taste the sweets of peace.
In consequence of these measures, several states, which till then had breathed a spirit of independence, were induced to lay aside their hostile intentions, and to give hostages for their pacific behaviour.
Along the frontier of the several districts which had submitted, a chain of posts was established with so much care and judgment, that no part of the country could think itself secure from the vigour of the conqueror.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="21">
<p>To introduce a system of new and wise regulations was the business of the following winter.
To establish a plan of education, and give the sons of the leading chiefs a tincture of letters, was part of his policy.
By way of encouragement, he praised their talents, and already saw them, by the force of their natural genius, rising superior to the attainments of the Gauls.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="22">
<p>In the course of the third year the progress of the Roman arms discovered new nations, whose territories were laid waste as far as the estuary called the Firth of Tay.
The legions had to struggle with all the difficulties of a tempestuous season, and yet the Barbarians, struck with a general panic, never dared to hazard an engagement.
The country, as far as the Romans advanced, was secuied by forts and garrisons.
No officer knew better than Agricola, how to seize the most advantageous situation; and, accordingly, not one of the stations, fortified by his direction, was taken by storm; not one was reduced to capitulate; not one was surrendered or abandoned to the enemy.
The enemy who had been accustomed to retrieve in the winter what they lost in the antecedent summer, now saw no difference of seasons; they were defeated everywhere, and reduced to the last despair.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="24">
<p>In the fifth summer Agricola made an expedition by sea.
He embarked in the first Roman vessel that ever crossed the estuary of the Clyde, and having penetrated into regions till then unknown, he defeated the inhabitants in several engagements, and lined the coast.
which lies opposite to Ireland, with a body of troops; not so much from an apprehension of danger, as with a view to future projects.
He saw that Ireland, lying between Britain and Spain, and at the same time convenient to the ports of Gaul, might prove a valuable acquisition, capable of giving an easy communication, and, of course, strength and union to provinces disjoined by nature.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="25">
<p>In the campaign which began in the sixth summer, having reason to apprehend a general confederacy of the nations beyond the Firth of Bodotria, and fearing, in a country not yet explored, the danger of a surprise, Agricola ordered his ships to sail across the gulf, and gain bome knowledge of those new regions.
The fleet, now acting, for the first time, in concert with the land forces, proceeded in sight of the army, forming a magnificent spectacle, and adding terror to the war.
At the sight of the Roman fleet, the Britons, according to intelligence gained from the prisoners, were struck with consternation, convinced that every resource was cut off since the sea, which had always been their shelter, was now laid open to the invader.
In this distress, the Caledonians resolved to try the issue of a battle.
Without waiting for the commencement of hostilities, they stormed the Roman forts and cas les, and by provoking danger, made such an impression Ihat several officers in Agricola's army recommended a sudden retreat to avoid the disgrace of being driven back to the other side of the Firth.
Meanwhile Agricola received intelligence that the enemy meditated an attack in various quarters at once, and thereupon, lest superior numbers, in a country where he was a stranger to the defiles and passes, should be able to surround him, he divided his army, and marched forward in three columns.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="26">
<p>The Caledonians, informed of this arrangement, changed their plan, and in the dead of night fell with their united force upon the ninth legion, then the weakest of the Roman army.
They surprised the advanced guard, and having, in the confusion of sleep and terror, put ihe sentinels to the sword, they forced their way through the entrenchments.
The conflict was in the very camp when Agricola, who had been informed that the Barbarians were on their march, and instantly pursued their steps, came up to the relief of the legion.
He ordered the swiftest of the horse and light infantry to advance with expedition, and charge the enemy in the rear, while his whole army set up a general shout.
At break of day the Roman banners glittered in view of the Barbarians, who found themselves hemmed in by two armies, and began to relax their vigour.
The spirit of the legion revived. Acting no longer on the defensive, they rushed on to the attack.
The Caledonians were put to the rout, and if the woods and marshes had not favoured their escape, that single action had put an end to the war.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="27">
<p>By this victory, so complete and glorious, the Roman army was inspired with confidence to such a degree, that they now pronounced themselves invincible.
The Caledonians, notwithstanding their defeat, abated nothing from their ferocity.
They listed the young men of their nation; they sent their wives and children to a place of safety; they held public conventions of the several states, and with solemn rites and sacrifices formed a league in the cause of liberty.
The campaign ended in this manner, and the two armies, inflamed with mutual animosity, retired into winter quarters.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="29">
<p>In the beginning of the following summer Agricola met with a stroke of affliction, by the loss of a son about a year old.
He did not upon this occasion affect, like many others, the character of a man superior to the feelings of nature; nor yet did he suffer his grief to sink him down into unbecoming weakness.
In the opening of the campaign, he despatched his fleet, with orders to annoy the coast with frequent descents in different places.
and spread a general alarm.
He put himself, in the meantime, at the head of his army equipped for expedition, and, taking with him a select band of the bravest Britons, of known and approved fidelity, he advanced as far as the Grampian hills, where the enemy was already posted in force.
Undismayed by their former defeat, the Barbarians expected no other    issue than a total overthrow, or a brave revenge.
By treaties of alliance, and by deputations to the several cantons, they had drawn together the strength of their nation.
Upwards of thirty thousand men appeared in arms, and their force was increasing every day.
Among the chieftains distinguished by their birth and valour, the most renowned was Galgacus.
The multitude gathered around him, eager for action, and burning with uncommon ardour.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="30">
<p>He harangued them to the following effect: "All that can inspire the human heart, every motive that can excite us to deeds of valour, is on our side The Romans have no wives in the field to animate their drooping spirit; no parents to reproach their want of courage.
They are not listed in the cause of their country,their country, if any they have, lies at a distance.
In me behold your general; behold an army of freeborn men.
Your enemy is before you, and, in his train, heavy tributes, drudgery in the mines, and all the horrors of slavery.
Are those calamities to be entailed upon us? Or shall this day relieve us by a brave revenge ? There is the field of battle, and let that determine.
Let us seek the enemy, and as we rush upon him, remember the glory delivered down to us by our ancestors; and let each man think that upon his sword depends the fate of all posterity."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="33">
<p>This speech was received with war songs, with savage howlings, and a wild uproar of military applause.
Their battalions began to form a line of battle; the brave and warlike rushed forward to the front, and the field glittered with the blaze of arms.
The Romans on their side burned with equal ardour.
Agricola saw the impatient spirit of his men, but did not think proper to begin the engagement till he confirmed their courage by a speech in which he said:</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="34">
<p>"If our present struggle were with nations wholly unknown; if we had to do with an enemy new to our swords, I should call to mind the example of other armies.
At present what can I propose so bright and animating as your own exploits?  I appeal to your own eyes: behold the men drawn up against you: are they not the same, who last year, under the covert of the night, assaulted the ninth legion, and, upon the first shout of our army, fled before you? A band of dastards ! who have subsisted hitherto, because of all the Britons they are the most expeditious runaways.
Benumbed with fear they stand motionless on yonder spot, which you will render forever memorable by a glorious victory.
Here you may end your labours, and close a scene of fifty years by one great, one glorious day.
Let your country see, and let the commonwealth bear witness, if the conquest of Britain has been a lingering work, if the seeds of rebellion have not been crushed, that we at
least have done our duty."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="35">
<p>As soon as the general ended, the field rung with shouts of applause.
Impatient for the onset, the soldiers grasped their arms. Agricola restrained their violence, till he formed his order of battle. The auxiliary infantry, in number about eight thousand, occupied the centre.
The wings consisted of three thousand horse. The legions were stationed in the rear, at the head of the intrenchments as a body of reserve
to support the ranks, if necessary, but otherwise to remain inactive, that
a victory, obtained without the effusion of Roman blood might be of
higher value. The Caledonians kept possession of the rising grounds,
extending their ranks as wide as possible, to present a formidable show
of battle. Their first line was ranged on the plain, the rest in a gradual
ascent on the acclivity of the hill. The intermediate space between
both armies was filled with the charioteers and cavalry of the Britons,
rushing to and fro in wild career, and traversing the plain with noise
and tumult.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="36">
<p>The battle began, and at first was maintained at a distance. The
Britons wanted neither skill nor resolution. With their long swords,
and targets of small dimension, they had the address to elude the missive
weapons of the Romans, and at the same time to discharge a thick volley of their own. To bring the conflict to a speedy decision, Agricola
ordered three Batavian and two Tungarian cohorts to charge the enemy
sword in hand. To this mode of attack those troops had been long
accustomed, but to the Britons it was every way disadvantageous. Their
small targets afforded no protection, and their unwieldy swords, not
sharpened to a point, could do but little execution in a close engagement. The Batavians rushed to the attack with impetuous fury. Incited by their example, the other cohorts advanced with a spirit of emulation, and cut their way with terrible slaughter.  Eager in pursuit
of victory, they pressed forward with determined fury, leaving behind them numbers wounded, but not slain, and others not so much as
hurt.</p>
<p>The Roman cavalry, in the mean time, was forced to give ground.
The Caledonians, in their armed chariots, rushed at full speed into the
thick of the battle, where the infantry were engaged. Their first impression struck a general terror, but their career was soon checked by
the inequalities of the ground and the close ranks of the Romans. Pent
up in narrow places, the Barbarians crowded upon each other, and were
driven or dragged along by their own horses. A scene of confusion
followed. Chariots without a guide, and horses without a rider, broke
from the ranks in wild disorder, and flying every way, as fear and consternation urged, they overwhelmed their own files and trampled down
all who came in their way.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="37">
<p>Meanwhile, the Britons who had hitherto kept their post on the hills,
began to quit their station. Descending slowly, they hoped, by wheeling round the field of battle, to attack the victors in the rear. To
counteract their design, Agricola ordered four squadrons of horse, which
he had kept as a body of reserve, to advance to the charge. The Britons poured down with impetuosity, and retired with equal precipitation.
At the same time, the cavalry, by the directions of the general, wheeled
round from the wings, and fell with great slaughter on the rear of the
enemy, who now perceived that their own stratagem was turned against
themselves.</p>
<p>The field presented a dreadful spectacle of carnage and destruction.
The Britons fled; the Romans pursued; they wounded, gashed, and
mangled the runaways; they seized their prisoners, and to be ready for
others, butchered them on the spot. Swords and bucklers, mangled
limbs and dead bodies, covered the plain. The field was red with
blood. The vanquished Britons had their moments of returning courage, and gave proofs of virtue and of brave despair. They fled to the
woods, and rallying their scattered numbers, surrounded such of the
Romans as pursued with too much eagerness.</p>
<p>Agricola was everywhere present. He saw the danger, and if he had
not in the instant taken due precaution, the victorious army would have
had reason to repent of too much confidence in success. Night coming
on, the Romans weary of slaughter, desisted from the pursuit. Ten
thousand of the Caledonians fell in this engagement; on the part of
the Romans, the number of slain did not exceed three hundred and
forty.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="38">
<p>The Roman army, elated with success, and enriched with plunder,
passed the night in exultation. The Britons, on the other hand,
wandered about, uncertain which way to turn, helpless and disconsolate. The mingled cries of men and women filled the air with lamentations. It is a fact well authenticated, that some laid violent hands
upon their wives and children, determined with savage compassion to
end their misery.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="39">
<p>The account of these transactions, sent to Rome by Agricola, was
plain and simple, without any decoration of language to heighten the
narrative. Domitian received it in the true spirit of his character,
with a smile on his countenance, and malignity at his heart. He began
to fear that the name of a private citizen might overshadow the imperial
title. The reflection planted thorns in his breast. He resolved, however, to nourish resentment in sullen silence, till the tide of popularity
which attended the general should ebb away, and the affection of the
army had time to cool. Agricola was still in Britain, and had the command of the army and the province.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="40">
<p>Domitian, in the meantime, caused a decree to pass the Senate, by
which triumphal ornaments, the honour of a statue crowned with laurel,
and all other marks of distinction usually substituted in the place of a
real triumph were granted to Agricola. The Emperor had also the art
to circulate a report, that the province of Syria, at that time vacant by
the death of Atilius Rufus, an officer of consular rank, was intended for
Agricola, in order to do him honour by an appointment always given
to men of the highest eminence. However that may be, Agricola resigned the command (<date value="85">A. D. 85</date>), and delivered to his successor, Sallustius
Lucullus, a quiet and well ordered government.</p>
<p>Lest his arrival at Rome should draw together too great a concourse,
he concealed his approach from his friends, and entered the city privately in the dead of night. With the same secrecy, and in the night
also, he went, as commanded, to present himself to the Emperor. Domitian received him with a cold salute, and, without uttering a word,
left the conqueror of Britain to mix with the servile creatures of the
court.</p>
<p>To soften prejudices, Agricola resolved to shade the lustre of his
name in the mild retreat of humble virtues. With this view he resigned
himself to the calm enjoyments of domestic life. Plain in his apparel,
easy of access, and never attended by more than one or two friends, he
was remarkable for nothing but the simplicity of his appearance.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="41">
<p>But in the distress of public affairs which soon after followed, the name of
Agricola could not be suffered to remain in obscurity. By the rashness
or inactivity of the commanders-in-chief, the armies of the empire were
lost in Moesia, Dacia, Germany, and Pannonia. Every day brought an
account of some new misfortune; forts besieged and taken; garrisons
stormed, and whole cohorts with their commanding officers made prisoners of war. In times like those, when calamity followed calamity,
and every successive year was marked by the defeat and slaughter of
armies, the voice of the people called aloud for Agricola to be employed
in the public service.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="42">
<p>The year was now at hand in which Agricola was to have by lot the
proconsulship of Asia or of Africa; but the death of Civica, who had
been lately murdered in his government, gave at once a warning to
Agricola. and a precedent to Domitian. At this point of time, the spies
of the court thought proper to pay their visits to Agricola. The design
of those pretended friends was to discover whether the government of
a province would be acceptable. They contented themselves, in their
first approaches, with suggesting to him the value of tranquillity in a
private station, and then obligingly undertook, by their interests at
court, to obtain permission for him to decline the office. At length
the mask fell off: by adding menaces to their insidious advice, they
gained their point, and hurried him away to the presence of the Emperor. Domitian knew the part he had to act; with a concerted
countenance, and an air of distant pride, he heard Agricola's apology,
and complied with his request, conscious of his own treachery, yet receiving thanks for it without a blush.</p>
<p>The proconsular salary, which had been usually granted in such cases,
was withheld upon this occasion; perhaps in resentment, because it was
not solicited, or the better reason might be, that the prince might not
seem to gain by compromise what he had a right to command.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="43">
<p>The death of Agricola (<date value="93">A. D. 93</date>) was felt by his family with the
deepest sorrow, by his friends with tender concern, and even by
foreigners with universal regret. During his illness, the common people were constantly at his door, making their inquiries. In the forum,
and all circular meetings, he was the subject of conversation. When
he breathed his last, no man was so hardened as to rejoice at the news.
He died lamented, and not soon forgotten. What added to the public affliction, was a report that so valuable a life was ended by a dose
of  poison. No proof of the fact appearing, I leave the story to shift
for itself. Thus much is certain, during his illness, instead of formal
messages, according to the usual practice of courts, the freedmen most
in favour, and the principal physicians of the Emperor, were assiduous
in their visits. Was this the solicitude of friendship, or were these
men the spies of state?</p>
<p>On the day that closed his life, while he was yet in the agony
of death, the quickest intelligence of every symptom was conveyed to
Domitian by messengers in waiting for the purpose. That so much
industry was exerted to hasten news which the Emperor did not wish
to hear, no man believed. As soon as the event was known Domitian
put on an air of sorrow, and even affected to be touched with real
regret. The will of the deceased gave him entire satisfaction; he was
named joint heir with Agricola's excellent wife and his most dutiful
daughter, and this the tyrant considered as a voluntary mark of
the testator's love and esteem. A mind like his, debauched and
blinded by continued flattery, could not perceive that by a good
father, none but an evil prince is ever called to a share in the
succession.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="44">
<p>Agricola was born on the ides of June, in the third consulship of
Caligula; he died on the tenth before the calends of September,
during the consulship of Collega and Priscus, in the fifty-sixth year
of his age.<note anchored="yes">There seems, in this place, to be some mistake, not, however, imputable to Tacitus, but, more probably, to the transcribers, who, in their
manuscript, might easily write LVI. instead of LIV.  Caligula's third
consulship was A. U. C. 793, <date value="40">A. D. 40</date>. Agricola was born on the
thirteenth of June in that year: he died on the ioth of the calends of
September, that is the 23d of August, in the consulship of Pompeius
Collega and Cornelius Priscus, A. U. C, 846, <date value="93">A. D. 93</date>. According to
this account, Agricola, on the 13th of June, A. U. C. 846, entered on the
fifty-fourth year of his age, and died in the month of August following.
It is, therefore, probable, that the copyists, as already observed, inserted
in their manuscript fifty-six for fifty-four.</note> [His life extended through the reigns of nine emperors,
from Caligula to Domitian.] As to his person, about which in future
times there may be some curiosity, he was of that make and stature
which may be said to be graceful, not majestic. His countenance had
not that commanding air which strikes with awe; a sweetness of
expression was the prevailing character.</p>
<p>Though he was snatched away in the vigour of life, yet if we consider
the space his glory filled in the eyes of mankind, he might be said to
have died full of years. Possessing all the best enjoyments that spring
from virtue, and from virtue only; adorned with every dignity, which
either the consular rank or triumphal honours could bestow; what further
advantage could he derive from fortune? Immoderate riches he never
desired, content with an honourable independence.  His wife and
daughter left in a state of security, his honours blooming around him,
his fame unblemished, his relations flourishing, and every tie of friendship preserved to the last, he may be considered as supremely happy,
that he did not live to see the tempestuous times that soon after followed.
To counterbalance his untimely end, it is at least some consolation, that
he escaped that black and horrible period, in which Domitian no longer
broke out in sudden fits and starts of cruelty, but, throwing off all restraint, proceeded in one continued course of unrelenting fury, as if
determined to crush the commonwealth at a blow.

<div1 type="life" n="apollonius">
<head>Apollonius of Tyana</head>
<div2 type="chapter" n="1">
<p>APOLLONIUS, the Pythagorean philosopher, was born at Tyana, in
Cappadocia, about four years before the Christian era. Much of his
reputation is to be attributed to the belief in his magical or supernatural
powers, and the parallel which modern and ancient writers have
attempted to draw between his character and supposed miracles, and
those of the author of our religion. His life, by Philostratus, is a mass
of incongruities and fables.</p>
<p>Apollonius, according to his biographer, was of noble ancestry, and
claimed kindred with the founders of the city of Tyana. At the age of
fourteen he was placed under the care of Euthydemus, a rhetorician of
Tarsus; but, being disgusted at the luxury of the inhabitants, he
obtained leave of his father and instructor to retire to the neighbouring
town of Aegae. Here he is said to have studied the whole circle of the
Platonic, Sceptic, Epicurean, and Peripatetic philosophy, and ended
by giving his preference to the Pythagorean, in which he had been
trained by Euxenus of Heraclea. Immediately, as if the idea of treading in the footsteps of Pythagoras had seized him in his earliest youth, he
began to exercise himself in the severe asceticism of the sect; abstained
from animal food and woollen clothing, foreswore wine and the company of women, suffered his hair to grow, and betook himself to the
temple of AEsculapius at AEgae, who was supposed to regard him with
peculiar favour. He was recalled to Tyana in the twentieth year of his
age by his father's death; after dividing his inheritance with a brother
whom he is said to have reclaimed from dissolute living, and giving
the greater part of what remained to his poorer relatives, he returned
to the discipline of Pythagoras, and for five years preserved the mystic
silence, during which alone the secret truths of philosophy were disclosed. At the end of the five years, he travelled in Asia Minor, going
from city to city, and everywhere disputing, like Pythagoras, upon
divine rites. There is a blank in his biography, at this period of his
life, of about twenty years, during which we must suppose the same
employment to have continued, unless, indeed, we have reason to
suspect that the received date of his birth has been anticipated twenty
years. He was between forty and fifty years old when he set out on
his travels to the East, and here Philostratus sends forth his hero on a
voyage of discovery, in which we must be content rapidly to follow him.
From  Egae he went to Nineveh, where he met Damis, the future chronicler of his actions, and proceeding on his route to India, he discoursed at Babylon with Bardanes, the Parthian king, and consulted the magi and Brahmins, who were supposed to have imparted to him some theurgic secrets.
He next visited Taxila, the capital of Phraortes, an Indian prince, where he met Iarchas, the chief of the Brahmins, and disputed with Indian Gymnosophists already versed in Alexandrian philosophy.</p>
<p>This eastern journey lasted five years: at its conclusion, he returned to the Ionian cities, where we first hear of his pretensions to miraculous power, founded, as it would seem, on the possession of some divine knowledge derived from the East.
If it be true that the honouis of a god were decreed to him at this period of his life, we are of course led to suspect some collusion with the priests, who ale said to have referred the sick to him for relief.
From Ionia he crossed over into Greece, visited the temples and oracles which lay in his way, everywhere disputing about religion, and assuming the authority of a divine legislator.
At the Eleusinian mysteries he was rejected as a magician, and did not obtain admission to them until a later period of his life: the same cause excluded him at the cave of Trophonius (from whence he pretended to have obtained the sacred books of Pythagoras, and which he entered by force.
After visiting Lacedzemon, Corinth, and the other towns of Greece, he bent his course towards Rome, and arrived there just after an edict against magicians had been issued by Nero.
He was immediately brought before Telesinus the consul, and Tigellinus, the favourite of the Emperor, the first of whom dismissed him, we are told, from the love of philosnphy, and the latter from the fear of a magic power, which could make the letters vanish from the indictment.
On his acquittal, he went to Spain, Africa, and Athens, where, on a second application, he was admitted to the mysteries; and from Athens proceeded to Alexandria, where Vespasian, who was maturing his revolt, soon saw the use which might be made of such an ally.
The story of their meeting may be genuine, and is certainly curious as exhibiting Apollonlus in the third of the three-fold characters assumed by Pythagoras-philosopher, mystic, and politician.
Vespasian was met at the entrance of the city by a body of magistrates, praefects, and philosophers, and hastily asked whether the Tyanean was among the number.
Being told that he was philosophizing in the Serapeum, he proceeded thither, and begged Apollonus to make him emperor: the philosopher replied that "he had already done so, in praying the god° for a just and venerable sover
eign"; upon which Vespasian declared that he resigned himself entirely into his hands.
The last journey of Apollonius was to Ethiopia, whence he returned to settle in the Ionian cities.
The same friendship which his father had shown was continued towards him by the Emperor Titus.
On the accession of Domitian, Apollonius endeavoured to excite the provinces of Asia Minor against the tyrant.
An order was sent to bring him to Rome, which he thought proper to anticipate by voluntarily surrendering himself, to avoid bringing suspicion on his companions.
On being conducted into the Emperor's presence, he launched forth into the praise of Nerva, and was hurried to prison, loaded with chains.
As destruction seemed impending, it was time to display his miraculous powers: he vanished from his persecutors; and after appearing to Darius at Puteoli at the same hour he disappeared from Rone, he passed over into Greece, where he remained two years, having given out that the Emperor had publicly acquitted him.
The last years of his life were probably spent at Ephesus, where he is said to have proclaimed the death of the tyrant Domitian at the instant it took place.
Three places -- Ephesus, Rhodes, and Crete -- laid claim to the honour of being his last dwelling-place.
Tyana, where a temple was dedicated to him, became henceforth one of the sacred cities, and possessed the privilege of electing its own magistrates.</p>
<p>However impoasible it maybe to separate truth from falsehood in the narrative of Philostratus, we cannot conceive that a professed history, appealed to as such by contemporary authors, and written about a hundred years after the death of Apollonius himself, should be simply the invention of a writer of romance.
It must be allowed, that all the absurd fables of Ctesias, the confused falsehoods of all mythologies, easteln fairy tales, and perhaps a parody of some of the Christian miracles, are all pressed into the service by Philostratus to adorn the life of his hero.
Still we cannot account for the reception of the narrative by the ancients, and even among the fathers themselves, unless there had been some independent tradition of the character of Apollonius on which it rested.
Eusebius of Caesarea seems to allow the truth of Philostratus's narrative in the main, with the exception of what is miraculous.
And the parody, if it may be so termed, of the life of Pythagoras, may be rather traceable to the impostor himself than to the ingenuity of his biographer.
Statues and temples still existed in his honour; his letters and supposed writings were extant; the manuscript of his life by Damis the Assyrian was the original work which was dressed out by the rhetoric of Philostratus; and many notices of his visits and acts might be found in the public records of Asiatic cities, which would have at once dis
proved the history, if inconsistent with it. The conclusion we seem to come to on the whole is, that at a period when there was a general belief in magical powers, Apollonius did attain great influence by pretending to them, and that the history of Philostratus gives a just idea of his character and reputation, however inconsistent in its facts and absurd in its marvels.</p>
<p>We have purposely omitted the wonders with which Philostratus has garnished his narrative.
Many of these are curiously coincident with the Christian miracles.
The proclamation of the birth of Apollonius to his mother by Proteus, and the incarnation of Proteus himself, the chorus of swans which sang for joy on the occasion, the casting out of devils, raising the dead, and healing the sick, the sudden disappearances and reappearances of Apollonius, his adventures in the cave of Trophonius, and the sacred voice which called him at his death, to which may be added his claim as a teacher having authority to reform the world-cannot fail to suggest the parallel passages in the Gospel history.
We know, too, that Apollonius was one among many rivals set up by the Eclectics (as, for instance, by Hierocles of Nicomedia in the time of Diocletian) to our Saviour-an attempt, it may be worth remarking, renewed by the English free-thinkers, Blount and Lord Herbert.
Still, it must be allowed that the resemblances are very general, -that where Philostratus has borrowed from the Gospel narrative, it is only as he has borrowed from all other wonderful history, and that the idea of a controversial aim is inconsistent with the account which makes the life written by Damis the groundwork of the more recent history.</p>
<p>The character of Apollonius, as well as the facts of his life, bear a remarkable resemblance to those of Pythagoras, whom he professedly followed.
Travel, mysticism, and disputation are the three words in which the earlier half of both their lives may be summed up. There can be no doubt that Apollonius pretended to supernatural powers, and was variously regarded by the ancients as a magician and a divine being.
The object of his scheme, as far as it can be traced, was twofold-partly philosophical and partly religious.
As a philosopher, he is to be considered as one of the middle terms between the Greek and Oriental systems, which he endeavoured to harmonize in the symbolic lore of Pythagoras.
His aim was to purify the worship of Paganism from the corruptions which he said the fables of the poets had introduced, and restore the rites of the temples in all their power and meaning.
In his works on divination by the stars, and on offerings, he rejects sacrifices as impure in the sight of God.
In the miracles attributed
to him we see the same trace of a Pythagorean character; they are chiefly prophecies, and it is not the power of controlling the laws of nature which Apollonius lays claim to, but rather a wonder-working secret which gives him a deeper insight into them than is possessed by ordinary men.
Upon the whole, we may place Apollonius midway between the mystic philosopher and the mere impostor, between Pythagoras and Lucian's Alexander; and in this double character he was regarded by the ancients themselves.

<head>M. Valerius Martialis</head>
<div2 type="chapter" n="1">
<p>WHATEVER information we possess regarding the personal history of MARTIAL is derived almost exclusively from his works; for although he often boasts of his own far-spread popularity, and although Aelius Verus was wont to term him "his Virgil," he is not spoken of by any contemporary author except the younger Pliny, nor by any of those who followed after him, except Spartianus, Lampridius, and perhaps Sldonius Apollinaris, until we reach the period of the grammarians, by whom he is frequently quoted.
By collecting and comparing the incidental notices scattered through his pages, we are enabled to determine that he was a native of Bilbilis in Spain, that he was born upon the first of March, in the third year of Claudius, <date value="43">A. D. 43</date>, that he came to Rome in the thirteenth year of Nero, <date value="66">A. D. 66</date>, that after residing in the metropolis for a space of thirty-five years, he again repaired to the place of his birth, in the third year of Trajan, A. D. Ioo, and lived there for upwards of three years at least, on the property of his wife, a lady named Marcella, whom he seems to have married after his return to the banks of the Salo, and to whose graces and mental charms he pays a warm tribute.
His death, which cannot have taken place before A. . D04, is mentioned by the younger Pliny, but we are unable to fix the date of the epistle in which the event is recorded.
His fame was extended and his books were eagerly sought for, not only in the city, but also in Gaul, Germany, Britain, Getica, and the wild regions of the north; he secured the special patronage of the emperors Titus and Domitian, obtained by his influence the freedom of the state for several of his friends, and received for himself, although apparently without family if not unmarried, the highly-valued privileges accorded to those who were the fathers of three children, together with the rank of tribunus and the rights of the equestrian order, distinctions which in his case were probably merely honorary, not implying the discharge of any particular duties, nor the possession of any considerable fortune.
His circumstances, however, must have been at one time easy; for he had a mansion in the city whose situation he describes, and a suburban villa near Nomentum, to which he frequently alludes with pride.
It is true that Pliny, in the letter to which we have referred above, states that he made
Martial a pecuniary present to assist in defraying the expenses of his journey, but when he adds that the gift was presented as an acknowledgment for a complimentary address, he gives no hint that the poverty of the bard was such as to render this aid an act of charity.</p>
<p>The extant works of Martial consist of an assemblage of short poems, all included under the general appellation Eptgrammata, upwards of <date value="1500">1500</date> in number, divided into fourteen books. Those which form the two last books, usually distinguished respectively as Xenia and Apophoreta, amounting to 350, consist, with the exception of the introductions, entirely of distichs, descriptive of a vast variety of small objects, chiefly articles of food or clothing, such as were usually sent as presents among friends during the Saturnalia, and on other festive occasions. In addition to the above, nearly all the printed copies include 33 epigrams, forming a book apart from the rest, which, ever since the time of Gruter, has been commonly known as Liber de Spectaculis, because the contents relate entirely to the shows exhibited by Titus and Domitian, but there is no ancient authority for the title, and hence the most recent editor restores the proper and simple form Liber Epigrammaton. The "De Spectaculis" is altogether wanting in most of the best MSS., and of those which embrace it two only, both derived from the same archetype, are older than the fifteenth century; but the most judicious critics are of opinion that the greater number of the pieces are genuine, although it is not unlikely that spurious matter may have found its way both into this and the other books, for we find a remonstrance (x. 100) addressed to an unscrupulous pretender, who was attempting to palm his own progeny on the public under the cover of Martial's reputation.</p>
<p>The "Liber de Spectaculis" and the first nine books of the regular series involve a great number of historical allusions, extending from the games of Titus (<date value="80">A. D. 80</date>) down to the return of Domitian from the Sarmatian expedition, in January, <date value="94">A. D. 94</date>. The second book could not have been written until after the commencement of the Dacian war, that is, not before <date value="86">A. D. 86</date>, nor the sixth until after the triumph over the Dacians and Germans (<date value="9">A. D. 9</date>I); the seventh was written while the Sarmatian war, which was begun in <date value="93">A. D. 93</date>, was still in progress, and reaches to the end of that year. The eighth book opens in January, <date value="94">A. D. 94</date>, the ninth also refers to the same epoch, but may, as Chriton supposes, have been written in <date value="95">A. D. 95</date>. The whole of these were composed at Rome, except the third, which was written during a tour in Gallia Togata.
The tenth  book was published twie: the first edition was given hastily to the world; the second, that which we now read, celebrates the arrival of Trajan at Rome, after his accession to the throne.
Now, since this event took place <date value="99">A. D. 99</date>, and since the twenty-fourth epigram of this book was written in honour of the author's fifty-seventh birthday, we are thus supplied with data for fixing the epoch of his birth; and since at the close of the book he had been thirty-four years at Rome, we can hence calculate the time when he left Spain.
The eleventh book seems to have been published at Rome early in A. D. ioo, and at the close of the year he returned to Bilbilis.
After keeping silence for three years, the twelfth book was despatched from Bilbilis to Rome, and in this he refers to the two preceding books, published, as we have seen, in <date value="99">A. D. 99</date> and ioo.
Allowing, therefore, for the interval of repose, the twelfth book must be assigned to <date value="104">A. D. 104</date>.
It must be observed, however, that if the Parthenius, to whom book xi. is dedicated, and who is again addressed in book xii.
be the "Palatinus Parthenius," the chamberlain of Domitian, and if the statement of Victor, that this Parthenius was murdered by the soldiery (<date value="97">A. D. 97</date>) soon after the elevation of Nerva, can be depended upon, it is evident that some pieces belonging to earlier years were included in the later books.</p>
<p>It is well known that the word Epigram, which originally denoted simply an inscription, was, in process of time, applied to any brief metrical effusion, whatever the subject might be, or whatever the form under which it was presented, and in this sense the heterogeneous mass which constitutes the Greek anthology, and all the'lighter effusions of Catullus, are called epigrams.
In many of these, it is true, the sentiments are pithily worded, and a certain degree of emphasis is reserved for the conclusion; but Martial first placed the epigram upon the narrow basis which it now occupies, and from his time the term has been in a great measure restricted to denote a short poem, in which all the thoughts and expressions converge to one sharp point, which forms the termination of the piece.
It is impossible not to be amazed by the singular fertility of imagination, the prodigious flow of wit, and the delicate felicity of language everywhere developed in this extraordinary collection, and from no source do we derive more copious information on the national customs and social habits of the Romans during the first century of the empire.
But however much we may admire the
genius of the author, we feel no respect for the character of the man.
The inconceivable servility of adulation with which he loads Domitian, proves that he was a courtier of the lowest class, and his name is crushed by a load of cold-blooded filth spread ostentatiously over the whole surface of his writings, too clearly denoting habitual impurity of thought, combined with habitual impurity of expression.

<div1 type="life" n="statius">
<head>P. Papinius Statius</head>
<div2 type="chapter" n="1">
<p>OUR information with regard to the personal history of this celebrated poet is miserably defective.
He is named by no ancient author, except Juvenal, so that any knowledge we possess of his family or career has been gleaned from  incidental notices in his own writings, and many of these are couched in very ambiguous language.
It appears that under the skilful tuition of his father he speedily rose to fame, and became peculiarly renowned for the brilliancy of his extemporaneous effusions, so that he gained the prize three times in the Alban contests; but having, after a long career of popularity, been vanquished in the quinquennial games he retired to Naples.
the place of his nati vty, along with his wife Claudia, whom he married in early life, to whom he was tenderly attached, and whose virtues he frequently commemnorates.
From some lines of Juvenal (s. vii. 82), we should infer that Statius, in his earlier years at least, was forced to struggle with poverty; but he appears to have profited by the patronage of Domitian, whom in common with Martial and other contemporary bards he addresses in strains of the most fulsome adulation.
The tale that the Emperor, in a fit of passion, stabbed him with a stilus, seems to be as completely destitute of foundation as the notion that he was a Christian.
Dodwell fixes upon <date value="6">A. D. 6</date>r and A. ). 96, as the epoch of his birth and of his death, but these conclusions are drawn from very uncertain premises.
Those dates which can be ascertained with precision will be noted as we review his productions in succession.
The extant works of Statius are:-I. <title lang="la">Silvarum Libri</title>, a collection of thirty-two occasional poems, many of them of considerable length, divided into five books.
To each book is prefixed a dedication in prose, addressed to some friend.
The first book was written about <date value="90">A. D. 90</date>, the third after the commencement of <date value="94">A. D. 94</date>, the first piece in the fourth book was composed expressly to celebrate the kalends of January, <date value="95">A. D. 95</date>, when Domitian
entered upon his 17th consulship, and the fifth book appears to have been brought to a close in the following year.
II. <title lang="la">Thebaidos Libri</title>, an heroic poem in twelve books, embodying the ancient legends with regard to the expedition of the Seven against Thebes.
It occupied the author for twelve years, and was not finished until after the Dacian war, which commenced in <date value="86">A. D. 86</date>. III. <title lang="la">Achilleidos Libri</title>, an heroic poem breaking off abruptly.
According to the original plan, it would have comprised a complete history of the exploits of Achilles, but was probably never finished.</p>
<p>Statius may justly claim the praise of standing in the foremost rank among the heroic poets of the Silver Age, and when we remember how few of the extant specimens of the Roman muse belong to this department, we do not feel surprised that Dante and Scaliger should have assigned to him a place immediately after Virgil, provided always we regard them as separated by a wide, impassable gulf.
While by no means deficient in dignity, and not unfrequently essaying lofty flights, he is in a great measure free from extravagance and pompous preten sions; but, on the other hand, in no portion of his works do we find the impress of high natural talent and imposing power.
Those passages which have been most frequently quoted, and most generally admired, di-play a great command of graceful and appropriate language, a liveli ness of imagination which occasionally oversteps the limits of correct taste, brilliant imagery, pictures designed with artistic skill, and glowing with the richest colours, a skilful development of character, and a complete knowledge of the mechanism of verse; but they are not vivified and lighted up by a single spark of true inspiration.
The rules of art are observed with undeviating accuracy, and the most intricate combinations are formed without the introduction of a disturbing element; but there is a total absence of that simple energy which is the surest mark of true genius.</p>
<p>The pieces which form the Silvae, although evidently thrown off in haste, and probably regarded by their author as trifles of comparatively little importance, produce a much more pleasing effect than either the Thebaid or the Achilleid, in which the original strength of expression seems to have been worn away by repeated polishing, and the native freedom of the verse to have been shackled and cramped by a laborious process of correction.

<div1 type="life" n="juvenal">
<head>D. Junius Juvenalis</head>
<div2 type="chapter" n="1">
<p>THE small amount of direct information which we possess with regard to the personal history of JUVENAL is derived almost exclusively from a very meagre memoir, which bears the name of Suetonius, but which is by most critics ascribed, with greater probability, to Valerius Probus, or some later grammarian.
We are here told that the poet was either the son or the " alumnus" of a rich freedman; that he occupied himself, until he had nearly reached the term of middle life, in declaiming, more, however, for the sake of amusement than with any view to professional exertion; that, having subsequently composed some clever lines upon Paris the pantomime, he was induced to cultivate assiduously satirical composition; that for a considerable period he did not venture to publish his essays; but that having eventually attracted numerous audiences, and gained great applause, he inserted in one of his new pieces the verses which had formed a portion of his first effort, those, namely, which we now read in <bibl n="Juv. 7.86">Sat. vii. 86-91</bibl>, where, speaking of the popularity of Statius, he adds:
<quote lang="la"><l>Quod non dant proceres, dabit, histrio, tu Camerinos,</l>
<l>Et Bareas, tu nobilium magna atria curas.</l>

whose avarice prevented them from becoming the patrons of poets.</note> court,</l>

of Thyestes; the "Philomela," a tragedy on the fate of Itys, whose
remains were served to his father at a banquet by Philomela and her
sister Progne.
</note></l></quote>  That the actor (or an actor) being at that time in high favour at
court, and enjoying extensive influence, Juvenal became an object of suspicion, as one who had indirectly censured the corrupt practices of the day; and although now  an old man of eighty, was forthwith, under the semblance of honourable distinction, appointed to the command of a body of troops quartered in a remote district of Egypt, where he died within a very brief space, the victim of disgust and grief.</p>
<p>Several other biographies are found in the MSS., but all certainly of a later date than that of which we have given an abstract.
These agree, in many points, almost word for word, with the above narrative, but differ much from it and from each other in various details connected with the misfortune and fate of the satirist.
Thus one of these declares that the events happened in the reign of Nero ; that Juvenal returned to the city, and, being filled with grief in consequence of the absence of his friend Martial, died in his eighty-first year.
In another we are told, that having been exiled towards the close of Domitian's career, and not recalled by the successors of that prince, he died of old age, under Antoninus Pius.
In a third it is stated that Trajan, incensed by an attack upon his favourite, Paris, despatched the author of the libel upon an expedition against the Scotch.</p>
<p>Before going further, we must remember that there were two favourite pantomimes who  bore the name of Paris, one contemporary with Nero, the other with Domitian, and that each was put to death by the emperor under whom  he flourished; but it is evident, from the transactions with Statius alluded to in the lines quoted above, that the second of these is the Paris of the seventh satire.
This being premised, we shall find that the older annotators, taking the words of the pseudo-Suetonius in what certainly appears at first sight to be their natural and obvious acceptation, agree in believing that Juvenal, on account of his insolent animadversions on the all-powerful minion of the court, was banished at the age of eighty by Domitian to Egypt, where he very soon afterwards sunk under the pressure of age and sorrow.
But a careful examination of the available data will at once prove that this opinion is untenable.
i. We know from Dion Cassius that Paris was killed in <date value="83">A. D. 83</date>, upon suspicion of an intrigue with the Empress Domitia.
2. The fourth satire, as appears from the concluding lines, was written after the death of Domitian, that is, not earlier than <date value="96">A. D. 96</date>. 3. The first satire, as we learn from the forty-ninth line, was written after the condemnation of Marius Priscus, that is, not earlier than A. D. Ioo.
These positions admit of no doubt or cavil, and hence it is established that Juvenal was alive at least seventeen years after the death of Paris, and that some of his most spirited productions were written after the death of Domitian.
Hence, if the powerful " histrio " in the biography of the pseudo-Suetonius be, as we should naturally conclude, the same person as the Paris named in the preceding sentence, it is impossible that Juvenal could have been banished later than <date value="83">A. D. 83</date>; it is impossible that he could have died immediately afterwards, since he was alive In A D. ioo; and it Is incredible that if he had pined for a long series of years at a distance from his country, his works should contain no allusion to a destiny so sad, while, on the other hand, they bear the most evident marks of having been conceived and brought forth in the metropolis, amid the scenes so graphically described.</p>
<p>Salmasius was much too acute not to perceive this difficulty; but clinging to the idea that Juvenal actually was banished to Egypt at the age of 80 and there died, he endeavoured to escape from the embarrassment by supposing that the seventh satire, containing the lines composed originally against Paris, was not published until the accession of Hadrian; that the word " histrio " does not refer to Paris at all, but to some player of that epoch protected by the sovereign, who, taking offence at the passage in question, disgraced the author of what he considered as a scarcely hidden attack upon his abuse of patronage.
But although the words both in the satire and in the memoir might, without much violence, be accommodated to some such explanation, yet the hypothesis, taken a, a whole, is so fanciful and so destitute of all external support, that it has been adopted by few scholars.</p>
<p>Without pretending to embrace the views of this or of any previous critic to their full extent, we may safely assume a sceptical position, and doubt every point which has been usually assumed as true.
The only facts with regard to Juvenal upon which we can implicitly rely ale, that he flourished towards the close of the first century, that Aquinum, if not the place of his nativity, was at least his chosen residence, and that he is in all probability the friend whom Martial addresses in three epigrams.</p>
<p>There is, perhaps, yet another circumstance which we may admit without suspicion.
We are told that he occupied himself for many years of his life in declaiming; and assuredly every page in his writings bears evidence to the accuracy of this assertion.
Each piece is a finished rhetorical essay, energetic, glowing and sonorous; the successive attacks upon vice are all planned with systematic skill; the arguments are marshalled in imposing array; they advance supported by a heavy artillery of powerful and well-aimed illustrations, and sweeping impetuously onward, carry by assault each position as in turn assailed.
But although the impression produced at first is overwhelming, the results are not permanent.
The different poems are too obviously formal works of art; and while the figures in each picture are selected with anxious care, grouped with all attention to effect, and rich with the most brilliant colouring, the composition as a whole is deficient in the graceful ease and reality which impart such a matchless charm to the less regular and less elaborate sketches of Horace.
The means by which the two great satirists seek to achieve their object are as widely different as the tempers and habits of the men  It is impossible to imagine a contrast more striking than is presented by the playful, goodhumoured gaiety with which the one would laugh his hearers out of their follies and their guilt, and by the uncompromising sternness with which the other seeks to scare them, calling to his aid frightful images and terrific denunciations.
In the one case, however, we are fully convinced of the absolute sincerity of our monitor; we feel that his precepts are the fruit of long experience, proceeding from one who, having mingled much with the world, and encountered its perils, is filled with kindly sympathies for the difficulties and dangers of those whom he warns to avoid the rocks and shoals on which he had himself well nigh been wrecked, while the stately well-measured indignation of the other belongs to the eloquence of the head rather than of the heart; and the obvious tone of exaggeration which pervades all his thundering invectives leaves us in doubt how far this sustained passion is real, and how far assumed for show.
But while the austere and misanthropic gloom of Juvenal touches less deeply than the warm-hearted social spirit of his rival, we must not forget the difference of their position.
Horace might look with admiration upon the high intellect of his prince, and the generous protection extended by him to literature, and he might feel grateful to the prudent firmness which had restored peace after long years of civil bloodshed, while a decent show of freedom was still left.
But the lapse of half a century had wrought a fearful change.
Galling to the proud spirit filled with recollections of ancestral glory, must have been the chains with which the coarse tyranny of Nero and Domitian ostentatiously loaded their dependents; deep must have been the humiliation of the moralist who beheld the utter degradation and corruption of his countrymen: the canker was perchance too deeply seated even for the keenest knife, but delicate and gentle palliatives would have been worse than mockery.</p>
<p>The extant works of Juvenal consist of 16 satires, the last being a fragment of very doubtful authenticity, all composed in heroic hexameters and divided in several MSS.
into five books, an arrangement which, although as old as the time of Priscian, is altogether arbitrary and unmeaning.

<head>Sex. Julius Frontinus</head>
<div2 type="chapter" n="1">
<p>FRONTINUS, a man respected in his own times, honoured for the dignity with which he held several high posts, and now esteemed for the works he left behind him, first appears in history under Vespasian, at the beginning of <date value="70">A. D. 70</date>, as prator urbanus, an office which he speedily resigned in order to make way for Domitian; and it is probable that he was one of the consules suffecti in <date value="74">A. D. 74</date>. In the course of the following year he succeeded Cerealis as governor of Britain, where he distinguished himself by the conquest of the Silures, and maintained the Roman power unbroken until superseded by Agricola in <date value="78">A. D. 78</date>. In the third consulship of Nerva (<date value="97">A. D. 97</date>), Frontinus was appointed Superintendent of Aqueducts, an appointment never conferred, as he himself tells us, except upon the leading men of the state.
He also enjoyed the high dignity of augur, and his death must have occurred about <date value="106">A. D. 106</date>, since his seat in the college was bestowed upon the younger Pliny soon after that period.
From an epigram in Martial we might conclude that he was twice elevated to the consulship; but since his name does not appear in the Fasti, we are unable to determine the dates, although we may infer that the honoulr was bestowed upon him, for the first time at least before his journey to Britain, since the generals dispatched to command that province were generally consulars [men who had held the office of consul].</p>
<p>Frontinus was a man of sound sense and judgment, ever careful to do his duty well, and glad to be able to add reading and study to experience.
To that disposition of his we owe his writings, which consist chiefly of treatises on Military Strategy and on Aqueducts.
In his preface to the latter, he says:  "The Emperor Nerva having appointed me superintendent of the aqueducts of Rome, I thought it ought tu be my first care to inform myself of what related to my office, for the proper foundation of every administration must be a thorough khowledge of what is fit to be done or to be let alone.
In effect, can anything be more shameful for a man of sense, or more unpardonable in him, than to be directed how to do his duty by those that are under him ? Their ministry is necessary, without doubt, but then they ought to be made use of as helps only, and instruments under the guidance of their chief."
Pliny praises Frontinus's probity, and ranks him among the most valuable men in Rome.</p></div2></div1></div0>
