<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But these rules of style, while part of the
student's theoretical knowledge, are not in themselves sufficient to give him oratorical power. In
addition he will require that assured facility which
the Greeks call <foreign lang="greek">e(/cis</foreign> I know that many have raised
the question as to whether this is best acquired by
writing, reading or speaking, and it would indeed
be a question calling for serious consideration, if we
could rest content with any one of the three.<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But
they are so intimately and inseparably connected,
that if one of them be neglected, we shall but waste
the labour which we have devoted to the others.
For eloquence will never attain to its full development or robust health, unless it acquires strength
by frequent practice in writing, while such practice
without the models supplied by reading will be like
a ship drifting aimlessly without a steersman.
Again, he who knows what he ought to say and
how he should say it, will be like a miser brooding
over his hoarded treasure, unless he has the weapons
of his eloquence ready for battle and prepared to
deal with every emergency.<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But the degree in

<pb id="p.5"/>

which a thing is essential does not necessarily make
it of immediate and supreme importance for the
formation of the ideal orator. For obviously the
power of speech is the first essential, since therein
lies the primary task of the orator, and it is obvious
that it was with this that the art of oratory began,
and that the power of imitation comes next, and
third and last diligent practice in writing.<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But as
perfection cannot be attained without starting at
the very beginning, the points which come first in
time will, as our training proceeds, become of quite
trivial importance. Now we have reached a stage in
our enquiry where we are no longer considering the
preliminary training of our orator; for I think the
instructions already given should suffice for that;
they are in any case as good as I could make them.
Our present task is to consider how our athlete who
has learnt all the technique of his art from his
trainer, is to be prepared by actual practice for the
contests in which he will have to engage. Consequently, we must assume that our student has
learned how to conceive and dispose his subject
matter and understands how to choose and arrange
his words, and must proceed to instruct him how to
make the best and readiest use of the knowledge
which he has acquired.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>There can then be no doubt that he must accumulate a certain store of resources, to be employed
whenever they may be required. The resources of
which I speak consist in a copious supply of words
and matter.<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But while the matter is necessarily
either peculiar to the individual case, or at best
common to only a few, words must be acquired to
suit all and every case. Now, if there were special

<pb id="p.7"/>

words adapted to each individual thing, they would
require less care, since they would automatically be
suggested by the matter in hand. But since some
words are more literal, more ornate, more significant
or euphonious than others, our orator must not
merely be acquainted with all of them, but must
have them at his fingers' ends and before his very
eyes, so that when they present themselves for his
critical selection, he will find it easy to make the
appropriate choice.<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> I know that some speakers
make a practice of learning lists of synonyms by
heart, in order that one word out of the several
available may at once present itself to them, and
that if, after using one word, they find that it is
wanted again after a brief interval, they may be
able to select another word with the same meaning
and so avoid the necessity of repetition. But this
practice is childish and involves thankless labour,
while it is really of very little use, as it merely
results in the assembly of a disorderly crowd of
words, for the speaker to snatch the first that comes
to hand.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>On the contrary, discrimination is necessary in
the acquisition of our stock of words; for we are
aiming at true oratory, not at the fluency of a
cheapjack. And we shall attain our aim by reading
and listening to the best writers and orators, since
we shall thus learn not merely the words by which
things are to be called, but when each particular
word is most appropriate.<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> For there is a place in
oratory for almost every word, with the exception
only of a very few, which are not sufficiently seemly.
Such words are indeed often praised when they
occur in writers of iambics<note>See &sect;&sect; 59 and 96.</note> or of the old comedy,

<pb id="p.9"/>

but we need do no more than consider our own
special task. All words, with these exceptions,
may be admirably employed in some place or
other. For sometimes we shall even require low
and common words, while those which would
seem coarse if introduced in the more elegant
portions of our speech may, under certain circumstances, be appropriate enough.<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Now to acquire a
knowledge of these words and to be acquainted not
merely with their meaning, but with their forms and
rhythmical values, so that they may seem appropriate
wherever employed, we shall need to read and listen
diligently, since all language is received first through
the ear. It was owing to this fact that the children
who, by order of a king, were brought up by a dumb
nurse in a desert place, although they are said to
have uttered certain words, lacked the power of
speech.<note>See Herodot. ii. 2. The children were alleged to have
cried <quote>bekos,</quote> Phrygian for bread.</note><milestone unit="section" n="11"/> There are, however, some words of such
a nature that they express the same sense by
different sounds, so that it makes no difference to
the meaning which we use, as, for instance, <hi rend="italics">gladius</hi>
and <hi rend="italics">ensis,</hi> which may be used indifferently when we
have to speak of a sword. Others, again, although
properly applied to specific objects, are used by
means of a <hi rend="italics">trope</hi> to express the same sense, as, for
example, <hi rend="italics">ferrum</hi> (steel) and muro (point), which are
both used in the sense of sword.<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Thus, by the
<hi rend="italics">figure</hi> known as <hi rend="italics">abuse,</hi><note>or <hi rend="italics">catachresis.</hi> See viii. ii. 5 and vi. 34.</note> we call all those who commit
a murder with any weapon whatsoever <hi rend="italics">sicarii</hi> (poniarders). In other cases we express our meaning
periphrastically, as, for instance, when Virgil<note><hi rend="italics">Ecl. i.</hi> 81.</note>
describes cheese as

<quote rend="blockquote">
<l><quote>Abundance of pressed milk.</quote></l></quote>

<pb id="p.11"/>

On the other hand, in a number of instances we
employ <hi rend="italics">figures</hi><note>See i. viii. 16; ix. i. 11.</note> and substitute one expression for
another. Instead of <quote>I know,</quote> we say <quote>I am not
ignorant,</quote> or <quote>the fact does not escape me,</quote> or <quote>I
have not forgotten,</quote> or <quote>who does not know?</quote> or
<quote>it can be doubted by none.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="13"/> But we may also
borrow from a word of cognate meaning. For <quote>I
understand,</quote> or <quote>I feel</quote> or <quote>I see</quote> are often
equivalent to <quote>I know.</quote> Reading will provide us
with a rich store of expressions such as these,
and will enable us not merely to use them when
they occur to us, but also in the appropriate manner.
For they are not always interchangeable:<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> for
example, though I may be perfectly correct in
saying, <quote>I see</quote> for <quote>I understand,</quote> it does not
follow that I can say <quote>I understand</quote> for <quote>my eyes
have seen,</quote> and though <hi rend="italics">mucro</hi> may be employed to
describe a sword, a sword does not necessarily mean
the same as <hi rend="italics">mucro</hi> (point).<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> But, although a store
of words may be acquired by these means, we must
not read or listen to orators merely for the sake of
acquiring words. For in everything which we teach
examples are more effective even than the rules
which are taught in the schools, so long as the
student has reached a stage when he can appreciate
such examples without the assistance of a teacher,
and can rely on his own powers to imitate them.
And the reason is this, that the professor of rhetoric
lays down rules, while the orator gives a practical
demonstration.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="16"/>But the advantages conferred by reading and
listening are not identical. The speaker stimulates
us by the animation of his delivery, and kindles the
imagination, not by presenting us with an elaborate

<pb id="p.13"/>

picture, but by bringing us into actual touch with
the things themselves. Then all is life and movement, and we receive the new-born offspring of his
imagination with enthusiastic approval. We are
moved not merely by the actual issue of the trial,
but by all that the orator himself has at stake.<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Moreover his voice, the grace of his gestures, the adaptation of his delivery (which is of supreme importance
in oratory), and, in a word, all his excellences in
combination, have their educative effect. In reading,
on the other hand, the critical faculty is a surer
guide, inasmuch as the listener's judgment is often
swept away by his preference for a particular speaker,
or by the applause of an enthusiastic audience.<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> For
we are ashamed to disagree with them, and an unconscious modesty prevents us from ranking our own
opinion above theirs, though all the time the taste
of the majority is vicious, and the <hi rend="italics">claque</hi> may
praise even what does not really deserve approval.
<milestone unit="section" n="19"/>On the other hand, it will sometimes also happen
that an audience whose taste is bad will fail to award
the praise which is due to the most admirable utterances. Reading, however, is free, and does not hurry
past us with the speed of oral delivery; we can reread a passage again and again if we are in doubt
about it or wish to fix it in the memory. We must
return to what we have read and reconsider it with
care, while, just as we do not swallow our food till
we have chewed it and reduced it almost to a state
of liquefaction to assist the process of digestion, so
what we read must not be committed to the memory
for subsequent imitation while it is still in a crude
state, but must be softened and, if I may use the
phrase, reduced to a pulp by frequent re-perusal.</p>

<pb id="p.15"/>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="20"/>For a long time also we should read none save the
best authors and such as are least likely to betray our
trust in then, while our reading must be almost as
thorough as if we were actually transcribing what we
read. Nor must we study it merely in parts, but
must read through the whole work from cover to
cover and then read it afresh, a precept which applies
more especially to speeches, whose merits are often
deliberately disguised.<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> For the orator frequently
prepares his audience for what is to come, dissembles
and sets a trap for them and makes remarks at the
opening of his speech which will not have their full
force till the conclusion. Consequently what he
says will often seem comparatively ineffective where
it actually occurs, since we do not realise his motive
and it will be necessary to re-read the speech after
we have acquainted ourselves with all that it contains.<milestone unit="section" n="22"/> Above all, it is most desirable that we should
familiarise ourselves with the facts of the case with
which the speech deals, and it will be well also,
wherever possible, to read the speeches delivered on
both sides, such as those of Aeschines and Demosthenes in the case of Ctesiphon, of Servius Sulpicius
and Messala for and against Aufidia,<note>See iv. ii. 106 and VI i. 20.</note> of Pollio<note>See &sect; 113.</note> and
Cassius<note>See &sect; 116.</note> in the case of Asprenas,<note>C. Nonius Asprenas, a friend of Augustus, accused by
Cassius and defended by Pollio on a charge of poisoning.</note> and many others.
<milestone unit="section" n="23"/>And even if such speeches seem unequal in point of
merit, we shall still do well to study them carefully
with a view to understanding the problems raised by
the cases with which they deal: for example, we
should compare the speeches delivered by Tubero
against Ligarius and by Hortensius in defence of
Verres with those of Cicero for the opposite side,
while it will also be useful to know how different
orators pleaded the same case. For example,

<pb id="p.17"/>

Calidius<note>Probably before some other tribunal. Cicero's <hi rend="italics">de Domo
Sua</hi> was delivered before the <hi rend="italics">pontifices.</hi></note> spoke on the subject of Cicero's house,
Brutus wrote a declamation in defence of Milo, which
Cornelius Celsus wrongly believes to have been
actually delivered in court,<note><hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> III. vi. 93. Cornelius Celsus was an encyclopedic
writer of the early empire, whose treatise on medicine has
survived.</note> and Pollio and Messalla
defended the same clients,<note>Liburnia. See IX. ii. 34.</note> while in my boyhood
remarkable speeches delivered by Domitius Afer,<note>See &sect; 118.</note>
Crispus Passienus<note>Stepfather of Nero. See VI. i. 50.</note> and Decimis Laelius<note>Probably the Laelius Balbus of Tac. <hi rend="italics">Ann,.</hi> VI. 47, 48.</note> in defence of Volusenus were in circulation.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="24"/>The reader must not, however, jump to the conclusion that all that was uttered by the best authors is
necessarily perfect. At times they lapse and stagger
beneath the weight of their task, indulge their bent
or relax their efforts. Sometimes, again, they give
the impression of weariness: for example, Cicero<note>In a lost letter: <hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> Plut. <hi rend="italics">Cic.</hi> 24.</note>
thinks that Demosthenes sometimes nods, and Horace<note><hi rend="italics">A. P.</hi> 359.</note>
says the same of Homer himself.<milestone unit="section" n="25"/> For despite their
greatness they are still but mortal men, and it will
sometimes happen that their reader assumes that
anything which he finds in them may be taken as a
canon of style, with the result that he imitates their
defects (and it is always easier to do this than to
imitate their excellences) and thinks himself a
perfect replica if he succeeds in copying the
blemishes of great men.<milestone unit="section" n="26"/> But modesty and circumspection are required in pronouncing judgment on
such great men, since there is always the risk of
falling into the common fault of condemning what
one does not understand. And, if it is necessary to
err on one side or the other, I should prefer that
the reader should approve of everything than that
he should disapprove of much.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="27"/>Theophrastus<note>In one of his lost rhetorical treatises.</note> says that the reading of poets is
of great service to the orator, and has rightly been
followed in this view by many. For the poets will

<pb id="p.19"/>

give us inspiration as regards the matter, sublimity
of language, the power to excite every kind of
emotion, and the appropriate treatment of character,
while minds that have become jaded owing to the
daily wear and tear of the courts will find refreshment in such agreeable study. Consequently Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">Pro Arch.</hi> 12.</note>
recommends the relaxation provided by the reading
of poetry.<milestone unit="section" n="28"/> We should, however, remember that the
orator must not follow the poets in everything, more
especially in their freedom of language and their
license in the use of figures. Poetry has been compared to the oratory of display, and further aims
solely at giving pleasure, which it seeks to secure by
inventing what is not merely untrue, but sometimes
even incredible.<milestone unit="section" n="29"/> Further, we must bear in mind
that it can be defended on the ground that it is tied
by certain metrical necessities and consequently cannot always use straightforward and literal language,
but is driven from the direct road to take refuge in
certain by-ways of expression; and compelled not
merely to change certain words, but to lengthen,
contract, transpose or divide them, whereas the
orator stands armed in the forefront of the battle,
fights for a high stake and devotes all his effort to
winning the victory.<milestone unit="section" n="30"/> And yet I would not have his
weapons defaced by mould and rust, but would have
them shine with a splendour that shall strike terror
to the heart of the foe, like the flashing steel that
dazzles heart and eye at once, not like the gleam of
gold or silver, which has no warlike efficacy and is
even a positive peril to its wearer.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="31"/>History, also, may provide the orator with a nutriment which we may compare to some rich and
pleasant juice. But when we read it, we must

<pb id="p.21"/>

remember that many of the excellences of the historian
require to be shunned by the orator. For history
has a certain affinity to poetry and may be regarded
as a kind of prose poem, while it is written for the
purpose of narrative, not of proof, and designed from
beginning to end not for immediate effect or the
instant necessities of forensic strife, but to record
events for the benefit of posterity and to win glory
for its author. Consequently, to avoid monotony of
narrative, it employs unusual words and indulges in
a freer use of figures.<milestone unit="section" n="32"/> Therefore, as I have already
said,<note>IV. ii. 45.</note> the famous brevity of Sallust, than which
nothing can be more pleasing to the leisured ear of
the scholar, is a style to be avoided by the orator in
view of the fact that his words are addressed to a
judge who has his mind occupied by a number of
thoughts and is also frequently uneducated, while,
on the other hand, the milky fullness of Livy is
hardly of a kind to instruct a listener who looks not
for beauty of exposition, but for truth and credibility.
<milestone unit="section" n="33"/>We must also remember that Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">Or.</hi> 30 <hi rend="italics">sq.</hi></note> thinks that not
even 'Thucydidcs or Xenophon will be of much service to an orator, although he regards the style of
the former as a veritable call to arms and considers
that the latter was the mouthpiece of the Muses.
It is, however, occasionally permissible to borrow the
graces of history to embellish our digressions, provided always that we remember that in those portions
of our speech which deal with the actual question
at issue we require not the swelling thews of the
athlete, but the wiry sinews of the soldier, and that
the cloak of many colours which Demetrius of
Phalerum<note><hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> &sect; 80.</note> was said to wear is but little suited to
the dust and heat of the forum.<milestone unit="section" n="34"/> There is, it is true,

<pb id="p.23"/>

another advantage which we may derive from the
historians, which, however, despite its great importance, has no bearing on our present topic; I refer to
the advantage derived from the knowledge of historical facts and precedents, with which it is most desirable that our orator should be acquainted; for such
knowledge will save him from having to acquire all
his evidence from his client and will enable him to
draw much that is germane to his case from the
careful study of antiquity. And such arguments will
be all the more effective, since they alone will be
above suspicion of prejudice or partiality.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="35"/>The fact that there is so much for which we must
have recourse to the study of the philosophers is
the fault of orators who have abandoned<note><hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> I <hi rend="italics">Pref.</hi> 11.</note> to them
the fullest portion of their own task. The Stoics
more especially discourse and argue with great
keenness on what is just, honourable, expedient
and the reverse, as well as on the problems of
theology, while the Socratics give the future orator
a first-rate preparation for forensic debates and
the examination of witnesses.<milestone unit="section" n="36"/> But we must use the
same critical caution in studying the philosophers
that we require in reading history or poetry; that
is to say, we must bear in mind that, even when we
are dealing with the same subjects, there is a wide
difference between forensic disputes and philosophical
discussions, between the law-courts and the lecture-room, between the precepts of theory and the perils
of the bar.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="37"/>Most of my readers will, I think, demand that,
since I attach so much importance to reading, I
should include in this work some instructions as to
what authors should be read and what their special

<pb id="p.25"/>

excellences may be. To do this in detail would be
an endless task.<milestone unit="section" n="38"/> Remember that Cicero in his
<hi rend="italics">Brutus,</hi> after writing pages and pages on the subject
of Roman orators alone, says nothing of his own contemporaries with the exception of Caesar and Marcellus. What limit, then, would there be to my
labours if I were to attempt to deal with them and
with their successors and all the orators of Greece as
well?<milestone unit="section" n="39"/> No, it was a safer course that Livy adopted
in his letter to his son, where he writes that he should
read Cicero and Demosthenes and then such orators
as most resembled them. Still,<milestone unit="section" n="40"/> I must not conceal
my own personal convictions on this subject. I believe
that there are few, indeed scarcely a single one of
those authors who have stood the test of time who will
not be of some use or other to judicious students, since
even Cicero himself admits that he owes a great debt
even to the earliest writers, who for all their talent
were totally devoid of art.<milestone unit="section" n="41"/> And my opinion about
the moderns is much the same. For how few of them
are so utterly crazy as not to have the least shadow
of hope that some portion or other of their work may
have claims upon the memory of posterity? If there
is such an one, he will be detected before we have
perused many lines of his writings, and we shall
escape from him before the experiment of reading
him has cost us any serious loss of time.<milestone unit="section" n="42"/> On the
other hand, not everything that has some bearing on
some department of knowledge will necessarily be of
service for the formation of style, with which we are
for the moment concerned.</p>
<p>Before, however, I begin to speak of individual
authors, I must make a few general remarks about
the variety of judgments which have been passed

<pb id="p.27"/>

upon them.<milestone unit="section" n="43"/> For there are some who think that only
the ancients should be read and hold that they are
the sole possessors of natural eloquence and manly
vigour; while others revel in the voluptuous and
affected style of to-day, in which everything is designed to charm the ears of the uneducated majority.
<milestone unit="section" n="44"/>And even if we turn to those who desire to follow
the correct methods of style, we shall find that some
think that the only healthy and genuinely Attic style
is to be found in language which is restrained and
simple and as little removed as possible from the
speech of every day, while others are attracted by a
style which is more elevated and full of energy and
animation. There are, too, not a few who are devoted to a gentle, elegant and harmonious style. Of
these different ideals I shall speak in greater detail,
when I come to discuss the question of the particular
styles best suited to oratory.<note>XI. x. 63 <hi rend="italics">sqq.</hi></note> For the moment I
shall restrict myself to touching briefly on what the
student who desires to consolidate his powers of
speaking should seek in his reading and to what kind
of reading he should devote his attention. My design is merely to select a few of the most eminent
authors for consideration.<milestone unit="section" n="45"/> It will be easy for the
student to decide for himself what authors most
nearly resemble these: consequently, no one will
have any right to complain if I pass over some of his
favourites. For I will readily admit that there are
more authors worth reading than those whom I propose to mention. But I will now proceed to deal
with the various classes of reading which I consider
most suitable for those who are ambitious of becoming
orators.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="46"/>I shall, I think, be right in following the principle

<pb id="p.29"/>

laid down by Aratus<note>Arat. <hi rend="italics">Phaen. 1.</hi></note> in the line, <quote>With Jove let
us begin,</quote> and in beginning with Homer. He is like
his own conception of Ocean,<note><hi rend="italics">Il.</hi> xxi. 196.</note> which he describes as
the source of every stream and river; for he has
given us a model and an inspiration for every
department of eloquence. It will be generally admitted that no one has ever surpassed him in the
sublimity with which he invests great themes or the
propriety with which he handles small. He is at
once luxuriant and concise, sprightly and serious,
remarkable at once for his fullness and his brevity,
and supreme not merely for poetic, but for oratorical
power as well.<milestone unit="section" n="47"/> For, to say nothing of his eloquence,
which he shows in praise, exhortation and consolation, do not the ninth book containing the embassy
to Achilles, the first describing the quarrel between
the chiefs, or the speeches delivered by the counsellors in the second, display all the rules of art
to be followed in forensic or deliberative oratory?
<milestone unit="section" n="48"/>As regards the emotions, there can be no one so illeducated as to deny that the poet was the master of all,
tender and vehement alike. Again, in the few lines
with which he introduces both of his epics, has he
not, I will not say observed, but actually established
the law which should govern the composition of the
exordium? For, by his invocation of the goddesses
believed to preside over poetry he wins the goodwill
of his audience, by his statement of the greatness
of his themes he excites their attention and renders
them receptive by the briefness of his summary.
<milestone unit="section" n="49"/>Who can narrate more briefly than the hero<note>Antilochus, <hi rend="italics">Il.</hi> xviii. 18.</note> who
brings the news of Patroclus' death, or more vividly
than he<note>Phoenix, <hi rend="italics">Il.</hi> ix. 529.</note> who describes the battle between the
Curetes and the Aetolians? Then consider his

<pb id="p.31"/>

similes, his amplifications, his illustrations, digressions, indications of fact, inferences, and all the
other methods of proof and refutation which he
employs. They are so numerous that the majority
of writers on the principles of rhetoric have gone to
his works for examples of all these things.<milestone unit="section" n="50"/> And as
for perorations, what can ever be equal to the prayers
which Priam addresses to Achilles<note><hi rend="italics">Il.</hi> xxiv. 486 <hi rend="italics">sqq.</hi></note> when he comes
to beg for the body of his son? Again, does he not
transcend the limits of human genius in his choice
of words, his reflexions, figures, and the arrangement
of his whole work, with the result that it requires a
powerful mind, I will not say to imitate, for that is
impossible, but even to appreciate his excellences?
<milestone unit="section" n="51"/>But he has in truth outdistanced all that have come
after him in every department of eloquence, above
all, he has outstripped all other writers of epic, the
contrast in their case being especially striking owing

deal.<milestone unit="section" n="52"/> Hesiod rarely rises to any height, while a

words and structure merit our approval, and he
is assigned the first place among writers of the

a Thebaid.</note>
deserves praise for the vigour, dignity and elevation of his language. But although practically all
teachers of literature rank him second among epic
poets, he is deficient in emotional power, charm, and
arrangement of matter, and totally devoid of real
art. No better example can be found to show what
a vast difference there is to being near another
writer and being second to him.<milestone unit="section" n="54"/> Panyasis<note>Uncle of Herodotus, author of a Heracleia.</note> is

<pb id="p.33"/>

regarded as combining the qualities of the last two

surpassing Hesiod in the choice of his subject and
Antimachus in its arrangement. Apollonius<note>Apollonius of Rhodes, author of the Argonautica. The
list to which reference is made consisted of the four poets
just mentioned, with the addition of Pisandros, for whom
see &sect; 56.</note> is not
admitted to the lists drawn up by the professors
of literature, because the critics, Aristarchus and
Aristophanes,<note>Aristophanes of Byzantium.</note> included no contemporary poets.
None the less, his work is by no means to be
despised, being distinguished by the consistency
with which he maintains his level as a representative of the intermediate type.<milestone unit="section" n="55"/> The subject
chosen by Aratus is lifeless and monotonous, affording no scope for pathos, description of character,
or eloquent speeches. However, he is adequate for
the task to which he felt himself equal. Theocritus
is admirable in his own way, but the rustic and
pastoral muse shrinks not merely from the forum,
but from town-life of every kind.<milestone unit="section" n="56"/> I think I hear
my readers on all sides suggesting the names of
hosts of other poets. What? Did not Pisandros<note>A Rhodian poet of the seventh century B.C.</note>
tell the story of Hercules in admirable style?
Were there not good reasons for Virgil and Macer
taking Nicander<note>Nicander of Colophon (second century B.C.), author of

Euphorion?<note>Euphorion of Chalcis (220 B.C. ) wrote elaborate short

Homer?<milestone unit="section" n="57"/> To which I reply, that there is no one so
ignorant of poetic literature that he could not, if he
chose, copy a catalogue of such poets from some

<pb id="p.35"/>

library for insertion in his own treatises. I can
therefore assure my readers that I am well aware
of the existence of the poets whom I pass over in
silence, and am far from condemning them, since I
have already said that some profit may be derived
from every author.<note>&sect; 45.</note><milestone unit="section" n="58"/> But we must wait till our
powers have been developed and established to the
full before we turn to these poets, just as at banquets
we take our fill of the best fare and then turn
to other food which, in spite of its comparative
inferiority, is still attractive owing to its variety.
Not until our taste is formed shall we have leisure
to study the elegiac poets as well. Of these, Callimachus is regarded as the best, the second place
being, according to the verdict of most critics,
occupied by Philetas.<note>Philetas of Cos (290 B.C.).</note><milestone unit="section" n="59"/> But until we have acquired
that assured facility of which I spoke,<note>x. i. 1.</note> we must
familiarise ourselves with the best writers only and
must form our minds and develop an appropriate tone
by reading that is deep rather than wide. Consequently, of the three writers of iambics<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> invective. The other two writers are Simonides of
Amorgos and Hipponax of Ephesus. Archilochus (<hi rend="italics">fl.</hi>
686 B.C.).</note> approved by
the judgment of Aristarchus, Archilochus will be far
the most useful for the formation of the facility in
question.<milestone unit="section" n="60"/> For he has a most forcible style, is full of
vigorous, terse and pungent reflexions, and overflowing with life and energy: indeed, some critics
think that it is due solely to the nature of his
subjects, and not to his genius, that any poets are to
be ranked above him.<milestone unit="section" n="61"/> Of the nine lyric poets<note>The five not mentioned here are Aleman, Sappho, Ibycus,
Anacreon and Bacchylides.</note>
Pindar is by far the greatest, in virtue of his inspired
magnificence, the beauty of his thoughts and figures,
the rich exuberance of his language and matter,
and his rolling flood of eloquence, characteristics
which, as Horace<note><hi rend="italics">Od.</hi> IV. ii. 1.</note> rightly held, make him

<pb id="p.37"/>

themes connected with the Trojan war.</note>
is shown by his choice of subject: for he sings of the
greatest wars and the most glorious of chieftains,
and the music of his lyre is equal to the weighty
themes of epic poetry. For both in speech and
action he invests his characters with the dignity
which is their due, and if he had only been capable
of exercising a little more restraint, he might,
perhaps, have proved a serious rival to Homer.
But he is redundant and diffuse, a fault which,
while deserving of censure, is nevertheless a defect
springing from the very fullness of his genius.
<milestone unit="section" n="63"/>Alcaeus has deserved the compliment of being said

of his works in which he attacks the tyrants of his
day and shows himself a real moral force. He is,
moreover, terse and magnificent in style, while the
vigour of his diction resembles that of oratory. But
he also wrote poetry of a more sportive nature and
stooped to erotic poetry, despite his aptitude for
loftier themes.<milestone unit="section" n="64"/> Simonides<note>Simondes of Ceos. 556&ndash;468 B.C., famous for all forms of
lyric poetry, especially funeral odes.</note> wrote in a simple style,
but may be recommended for the propriety and
charm of his language. His chief merit, however,
lies in his power to excite pity, so much so, in fact,
that some rank him in this respect above all writers
of this class of poetry.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="65"/>The old comedy is almost the only form of poetry
which preserves intact the true grace of Attic
diction, while it is characterized by the most eloquent freedom of speech, and shows especial power
in the denunciation of vice; but it reveals great
force in other departments as well. For its style
is at once lofty, elegant and graceful, and if we
except Homer, who, like Achilles among warriors,

<pb id="p.39"/>

is beyond all comparison, I am not sure that there
is any style which bears a closer resemblance to
oratory or is better adapted for forming the orator.
<milestone unit="section" n="66"/>There are a number of writers of the old comedy,
but the best are Aristophanes, Eupolis and Cratinus.<note>Contemporaries: Cratinus (519&ndash;422), Aristophanes (448&ndash;
380), Eupolis (446&ndash;410).</note> Aeschylus was the first to bring tragedy into
prominence: he is lofty, dignified, grandiloquent
often to a fault, but frequently uncouth and inharmonious. Consequently, the Athenians allowed
later poets to revise his tragedies and to produce
them in the dramatic contests, and many succeeded
in winning the prize by such means.<milestone unit="section" n="67"/> Sophocles
and Euripides, however, brought tragedy to far
greater perfection: they differ in style, but it is
much disputed as to which should be awarded the
supremacy, a question which, as it has no bearing
on my present theme, I shall make no attempt to
decide. But this much is certain and incontrovertible, that Euripides will be found of far greater service
to those who are training themselves for pleading in
court.<milestone unit="section" n="68"/> For his language, although actually censured
by those who regard the dignity, the stately
stride and sonorous utterance of Sophocles as being
more sublime, has a closer affinity to that of oratory,
while he is full of striking reflexions, in which,
indeed, in their special sphere, he rivals the
philosophers themselves, and for defence and attack may be compared with any orator that has
won renown in the courts. Finally, although admirable in every kind of emotional appeal, he is
easily supreme in the power to excite pity.
<milestone unit="section" n="69"/>Menander, as he often testifies in his works, had
a profound admiration for Euripides, and imitated
him, although in a different type of work. Now,

<pb id="p.41"/>

the careful study of Menander alone would, in my
opinion, be sufficient to develop all those qualities
with the production of which my present work
is concerned; so perfect is his representation of
actual life, so rich is his power of invention and
his gift of style, so perfectly does he adapt himself
to every kind of circumstance, character and emotion.<milestone unit="section" n="70"/> Indeed, those critics are no fools who think
the speeches attributed to Charisius<note>A contemporary of Demosthenos; his speeches have not
survived, but were considered to resemble those of Lysias.</note> were in reality
written by Menander. But I consider that he shows
his power as an orator far more clearly in his
comedies; since assuredly we can find no more
perfect models of every oratorical quality than the
judicial pleadings of his Epitrepontes,<note>The greater portion of the Epitrepontes has been recovered from a papyrus. The other plays are lost. The
names may be translated: <quote>The Arbitrators,</quote> <quote>The Heiress,</quote>
<quote>The Locri,</quote> <quote>The Timid Man,</quote> <quote>The Lawgiver,</quote> <quote>The
Changeling.</quote></note> Epicleros
and Locri, or the declamatory speeches in the Psophodes, Nomothetes. and Hypobolimaeus.<milestone unit="section" n="71"/> Still, for
my own part, I think that he will be found even more
useful by declaimers, in view of the fact that they
have, according to the nature of the various controversial themes, to undertake a number of different
roles and to impersonate fathers, sons, soldiers,
peasants, rich men and poor, the angry man and
the suppliant, the gentle and the harsh. And all
these characters are treated by this poet with
consummate appropriateness.<milestone unit="section" n="72"/> Indeed, such is his
supremacy that he has scarce left a name to other
writers of the new comedy, and has cast them into
darkness by the splendour of his own renown.
Still, you will find something of value in the other
comic poets as well, if you read them in not too
critical a spirit; above all, profit may be derived
from the study of Philemon,<note>Philemon of Soli (360&ndash;262); Menader of Athens (342&ndash;
290).</note> who, although it was

<pb id="p.43"/>

a depraved taste which caused his contemporaries
often to prefer him to Menander, has none the
less deserved the second place which posterity has
been unanimous in awarding him.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="73"/>If we turn to history, we shall find a number of
distinguished writers; but there are two who must
undoubtedly be set far above all their rivals: their
excellences are different in kind, but have won
almost equal praise. Thucydides is compact in
texture, terse and ever eager to press forward: Herodotus is pleasant, lucid and diffuse: the former
excels in vigour, speeches and the expression of the
stronger passions; the latter in charm, conversations
and the delineation of the gentler emotions.<milestone unit="section" n="74"/> Theopompus<note>Theopompus of Chios, born about 378 B.C., wrote a
history of Greece (<hi rend="italics">Hellenica</hi>) from close of Peloponnesian war
to 394 B.C., and a history of Greece in relation to Philip of
Macedon (<hi rend="italics">Philippica</hi>). His master, Isocrates, urged him to
write history.</note> comes next, and though as a historian he
is inferior to the authors just mentioned, his style
has a greater resemblance to oratory, which is not
surprising, as he was an orator before he was urged
to turn to history. Philistus<note>Philistus of Syracuse, born about 430 B.C., wrote a
history of Sicily.</note> also deserves special
distinction among the crowd of later historians, good
though they may have been: he was an imitator of
Thucydides, and though far his inferior, was somewhat more lucid. Ephorus,<note>Ephorus of Cumae, <hi rend="italics">flor. circ.</hi> 340 B.C., wrote a universal
history. He was a pupil of Isocrates. <hi rend="italics">Cp.</hi> II. viii. 11.</note> according to Isocrates,
needed the spur.<milestone unit="section" n="75"/> Clitarchus<note>Clitarchus of Megara wrote a history of Persia and of

his talent, but his accuracy has been impugned.
Timagenes<note>Timagenes, a Syrian of the Augustan age, wrote a
history of Alexander and his successors.</note> was born long after these authors, but
deserves our praise for the very fact that he revived
the credit of history, the writing of which had fallen
into neglect. I have not forgotten Xenophon, but
he will find his place among the philosophers.</p>

<pb id="p.45"/>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="76"/>There follows a vast army of orators, Athens alone
having produced ten remarkable orators<note>Antiphon, Andocides, Lysias (flor. 403&ndash;380), Isocrates
(435&ndash;338), Isacus, Demosthenes, Aeschines, Lycargus,
Hyperides and Dinarchus.</note> in the
same generation. Of these Dermosthenes is far the
greatest: indeed he came to be regarded almost as
the sole pattern of oratory. Such is the force and
compactness of his language, so muscular his style,
so free from tameness and so self-controlled, that
you will find nothing in him that is either too much
or too little.<milestone unit="section" n="77"/> The style of Aesehines is fuller and
more diffuse, while his lack of restraint gives an
appearance of grandeur. But he has more flesh and
less muscle. Hyperides has extraordinary charm and
point, but is better qualified, not to say more useful,
for cases of minor importance.<milestone unit="section" n="78"/> Lysias belongs to an
earlier generation than those whom I have just
mentioned. He has subtlety and elegance and, if
the orator's sole duty were merely to instruct, it
would be impossible to conceive greater perfection.
For there is nothing irrelevant or far-fetched in his
speeches. None the less I would compare him to a
clear spring rather than to a mighty river.<milestone unit="section" n="79"/> Isocrates
was an exponent of a different style of oratory: he is
neat and polished and better suited to the fencingschool than to the battlefield. He elaborated all the
graces of style, nor was he without justification. For
lie had trained himself for the lecture-room and not
the law-courts. He is ready in invention, his moral
ideals are high and the care which he bestows upon
his rhythm is such as to be a positive fault.<milestone unit="section" n="80"/> I do
not regard these as the sole merits of the orators of
whom I have spoken, but have selected what seemed
to me their chief excellences, while those whom I
have passed over in silence were far from being
indifferent. In fact, I will readily admit that the

<pb id="p.47"/>

famous Demetrius of Phalerum,<note>Governed Athens as Cassander's vicegerent 317&ndash;307:
then tied to Egypt, where he died in 283.</note> who is said to
have been the first to set oratory on the downward path, was a man of great talent and eloquence
and deserves to be remembered, if only for the
fact that he is almost the last of the Attic
school who can be called an orator: indeed Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">de Or.</hi> ii. 95. <hi rend="italics">Orat. 92.</hi> The <quote>intermediate</quote> style is
that which lies between the <quote>grand</quote> and the <quote>plain</quote>
styles.</note>
prefers him to all other orators of the intermediate
school.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="81"/>Proceeding to the philosophers, from whom Cicero
acknowledges that he derived such a large portion
of his eloquence, we shall all admit that Plato is
supreme whether in acuteness or perception or in
virtue of his divine gift of style, which is worthy of
Homer. For he soars high above the levels of
ordinary prose or, as the Greeks call it, pedestrian
language, and seems to me to be inspired not by
mere human genius, but, as it were, by the oracles
of the god of Delphi.<milestone unit="section" n="82"/> Why should I speak of the
unaffected charm of Xenophon, so far beyond the
power of affectation to attain? The Graces themselves seem to have moulded his style, and we may
with the utmost justice say of him, what the writer
of the old comedy<note>Eupolis, <foreign lang="greek">peiqw/ tis e)peka/qizen e)pi\ toi=s xei/lesin.</foreign></note> said of Pericles, that the goddess
of persuasion sat enthroned upon his lips.<milestone unit="section" n="83"/> Why
should I dwell on the elegance of the rest of the
Socratics? or on Aristotle,<note><quote>Sweet</quote> is the last epithet to be applied to the
surviving works of Aristotle. But Dionysius of Halicarnassus
and Cicero praise him no less warmly, referring, no doubt,
to works that are lost.</note> with regard to whom I
hesitate whether to praise him more for his knowledge, for the multitude of his writings, the sweetness of his style, the penetration revealed by his
discoveries or the variety of the tasks which he

<pb id="p.49"/>

essayed? In Theophrastus<note>Theophrastus, Aristotle's successor as head of his school
(322&ndash;287). Diogenes Laertius (v. 38) says that his real name
was Tyrtamus, but that Aristotle called him Theophrastus
because of the <quote>divine qualities of his style</quote> (<foreign lang="greek">fra/sis</foreign>).</note> we find such a superhuman brilliance of style that his name is said to be
derived therefrom.<milestone unit="section" n="84"/> The ancient Stoics indulged
their eloquence comparatively little. Still, they
pleaded the cause of virtue, and the rules which
they laid down for argument and proof have been of
the utmost value. But they showed themselves
shrewd thinkers rather than striking orators, which
indeed they never aimed at being.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="85"/>I now come to Roman authors, and shall follow
the same order in dealing with them. As among
Greek authors Homer provided us with the most
auspicious opening, so will Virgil among our own.
For of all epic poets, Greek or Roman, he, without
doubt, most nearly approaches to Homer.<milestone unit="section" n="86"/> I will
repeat the words which I heard Domitius Afer use
in my young days. I asked what poet in his opinion
came nearest to Homer, and he replied, <quote>Virgil
comes second, but is nearer first than third.</quote> And
in truth, although we must needs bow before the
immortal and superhuman genius of Homer, there
is greater diligence and exactness in the work
of Virgil just because his task was harder. And
perhaps the superior uniformity of the Roman's excellence balances Homer's pre-eminence in his outstanding passages.<milestone unit="section" n="87"/> All our other poets follow a long
way in the rear. Macer and Lucretius are, it is true,
worth reading, but not for the purpose of forming
style, that is to say, the body of eloquence: both
deal elegantly with their themes, but the former is
tame and the latter difficult. The poems by which
Varro of Atax<note>Varro of Atax in Gaul (82&ndash;37 B.C. ) was specially famous
for his translation of the <hi rend="italics">Argontautica</hi> of Apollonius Rhodius.
he also wrote didactic poetry and historical epic.</note> gained his reputation were translations, but he is by no means to be despised, although
his diction is not sufficiently rich to be of much

<pb id="p.51"/>

service in developing the resources of eloquence.
<milestone unit="section" n="88"/>Ennius deserves our reverence, but only as those
groves whose age has made them sacred, but whose
huge and ancient trunks inspire us with religious
awe rather than with admiration for their beauty.
There are other poets who are nearer in point of
time and more useful for our present purpose. Ovid
has a lack of seriousness even when he writes epic
and is unduly enamoured of his own gifts, but
portions of his work merit our praise.<milestone unit="section" n="89"/> On the other
hand, although Cornelius Severus<note>Friend and contemporary of Ovid. A considerable fragment is preserved by Sen. <hi rend="italics">Suas.</hi> vi. 26. The Sicilian War
was the war with Sextus Pompeius (38&ndash;36) and perhaps
formed a portion of a larger work on the Civil War. The
surviving fragment deals with the death of Cicero. The
<hi rend="italics">priunus liber</hi> may therefore perhaps be the first book of this
larger work.</note> is a better versifier
than poet, yet if, as has been said, he had written his
poem on the Sicilian war in the same style throughout
as his first book, he would have had a just claim to the
second place. A premature death prevented the
powers of Serranus<note>Nothing is known of this poet except the name.</note> from ripening to perfection, but
his youthful works reveal the highest talent and a
devotion to the true ideal of poetry, which is remarkable in one so young.<milestone unit="section" n="90"/> We have suffered serious loss
in the recent death of Valerius Flaccus. Saleius
Bassus<note>Nothing is known of this poet save that he is highly
praised by Tacitus in his <hi rend="italics">Diblogues,</hi> and was patronized by
Vespasian. The unfinished Argonautica of Valerius Flaccus

genius, but, like that of Serranus, it was not
mellowed by years. Rabirius<note>A contemporary of Ovid, believed to be the author of a

to be studied by those who have the time. Lucan
is fiery and passionate and remarkable for the
grandeur of his general reflexions, but, to be frank,
I consider that he is more suitable for imitation by
the orator than by the poet.<milestone unit="section" n="91"/> I have restricted my
list of poets to these names, because Germanicus

<pb id="p.53"/>

Augustus<note>Domitian.</note> has been distracted from the study of
poetry on which he had embarked by his care for
the governance of the world, and the gods have
thought it scarce worthy of his powers that he
should be the greatest of poets. But what can be
more sublime, more learned, more perfect in every
detail than those works to which he devoted himself
in the seclusion to which he retired after conferring
the supreme power upon his father and his brother?
Who could sing of war better than he who wages it
with such skill? To whom would the goddesses
that preside over literature sooner lend an ear? To
whom would Minerva, his familiar deity,<note>He claimed to be the son of Minerva. It is doubtful if
he ever wrote any poetry. Cp. Tac <hi rend="italics">Hist.</hi> iv. 86, Suet. <hi rend="italics">Dom.</hi>

readily reveal her secrets?<milestone unit="section" n="92"/> Future ages shall tell of
these things more fully; to-day his glory as a poet
is dimmed by the splendour of his other virtues.
But you will forgive us, Caesar, who worship at the
shrine of literature, if we refuse to pass by your
achievements in silence and insist on testifying at
least that, as Virgil sings,</p>

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>The ivy creeps amid your victor bays</l></quote><bibl><hi rend="italics">Ecl.</hi> viii. 13.</bibl></cit></quote>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="93"/>We also challenge the supremacy of the Greeks in
elegy. Of our elegiac poets Tibullus seems to me
to be the most terse and elegant. There are, however, some who prefer Propertius. Ovid is more
sportive than either, while Gallus<note>Cornelius (Gallus, the friend of Virgil, and the first distinguished writer of elegy at Rome.</note> is more severe.
Satire, on the other hand, is all our own. The first
of our poets to win renown in this connexion was
Lucilius, some of whose devotees are so enthusiastic
that they do not hesitate to prefer him not merely
to all other satirists, but even to all other poets.
I disagree with them as much as I do with Horace,<note><hi rend="italics">Sat.</hi> I. iv. 11.</note><milestone unit="section" n="94"/>
who holds that Lucilius' verse has a <quote>muddy flow,

<pb id="p.55"/>

and that there is always something in him that
might well be dispensed with.</quote> For his learning is
as remarkable as his freedom of speech, and it is
this latter quality that gives so sharp an edge and
such abundance of wit to his satire. Horace is far
terser and purer in style, and must be awarded the
first place, unless my judgment is led astray by my
affection for his work. Persius also, although he
wrote but one book, has acquired a high and
well-deserved reputation, while there are other
distinguished satirists still living whose praises will
be sung by posterity.<milestone unit="section" n="95"/> There is, however, another
and even older type of satire which derives its
variety not merely from verse, but from an admixture of prose as well. Such were the satires
composed by Terentius Varro,<note>His Menippean Satires, of which only fragments survive.
Although ostensibly an imitation of the work of the Greek
Menippus of Gadara, they can still be said to belong to the
older type of satire, the <quote>medley</quote> or <quote>hotch-potch.</quote></note> the most learned
of all Romans. He composed a vast number of
erudite works, and possessed an extraordinary knowledge of the Latin language, of all antiquity and
of the history of Greece and Rome. But he is
an author likely to contribute more to the knowledge of the student than to his eloquence.<milestone unit="section" n="96"/> The
iambic has not been popular with Roman poets as a
separate form of composition, but is found mixed up
with other forms of verse.<note>The meaning is not clear. The words may mean (i that

below.</note> It may be found in all

although in the last-named the iambic is interrupted
by the epode.<note><hi rend="italics">i.</hi> e. the short iambic line interposed between the trimeters.</note> Of our lyric writers Horace is almost
the sole poet worth reading: for he rises at times to
a lofty grandeur and is full of sprightliness and
charm, while there is great variety in his figures, and
his boldness in the choice of words is only equalled
by his felicity. If any other lyric poet is to be
mentioned, it will be Caesius Bassus, who has but

<pb id="p.57"/>

lately passed from us. But he is far surpassed in
talent by poets still living.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="97"/>Among writers of tragedy Accius and Pacuvius<note>Accius (170 90), Pacuvius (220&ndash;132).</note>
are most remarkable for the force of their general
reflexions, the weight of their words and the dignity
of their characters. But they lack polish, and filed
to put the finishing touches on their works, although
the fault was perhaps rather that of the times in
which they lived than of themselves. Accius is
generally regarded as the most vigorous, while those
who lay claim to learning regard Pacuvius as the
more learned of the two.<milestone unit="section" n="98"/> The Thyestes of Varius<note>L. Varius Rufus, friend of Virgil and Horace, editor of

of Ovid shows, in my opinion, to what heights that
poet might have risen if he had been ready to curb
his talents instead of indulging them. Of the
tragic writers whom I myself have seen, Pomponius
Secundus<note>Pomponius Secundus, died 60 A.D.; wrote a tragedy
entitled <hi rend="italics">Aeneas.</hi></note> is by far the best: his older critics thought
him insufficiently tragic, but admitted his eminence as
far as learning and polish were concerned.<milestone unit="section" n="99"/> Comedy
is our weakest point. Although Varro quotes Aelius
Stilo<note>The first Roman philologist (141&ndash;70 B.C.).</note> as saying that if the Muses wished to speak
Latin, they would use the language of Plautus,
although the ancients extol Caecilius,<note>Caecilils (219&ndash;166), Terence (194159), Afranius (flor.
circ. 150). Only fragments of Caecilius and Afranius remain.</note> and although
Scipio Africanus is credited with the works of
Terence (which are the most elegant of their kind,
and would be still more graceful if the poet had
confined himself to the iambic trimeter),<milestone unit="section" n="100"/> we still
scarcely succeed in reproducing even a faint shadow
of the charm of Greek comedy. Indeed, it seems
to me as though the language of Rome were incapable of reproducing that graceful wit which was

<pb id="p.59"/>

granted to Athens alone, and was beyond the reach
of other Greek dialects to achieve. Afranius<note>Caecilils (219&ndash;166), Terence (194&ndash;159), Afranius (flor.
cire. 150) Only fragments of Caecilius and Afanius survive.</note> excels
in the purely Roman comedy, but it is to be regretted
that he revealed his own character by defiling his
plots with the introduction of indecent paederastic
intrigues.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="101"/>In history, however, we hold our own with the
Greeks. I should not hesitate to match Saillst
against Thucydides, nor would Herodotus resent
Titus Livius being placed on the same level as himself. For the latter has a wonderful charm and
transparency in narrative, while his speeches are
eloquent beyond description; so admirably adapted
is all that is said both to the circumstances and the
speaker; and as regards the emotions, especially
the more pleasing of them, I may sum him up by
saying that no historian has ever depicted them to
greater perfection.<milestone unit="section" n="102"/> Thus it is that, although by
different means, he has acquired no less fame than
has been awarded to the immortal rapidity of Sallust.
For I strongly approve of the saying of Servilius
Nonianus,<note>Friend of Persius, and famous as orator, reciter and
historian; died 60 A.D.</note> that these historians were equal rather
than alike. Servilius, whom I myself have heard,
is himself remarkable for the force of his intellect,
and is full of general reflexions, but he is less restrained than the dignity of history demands.<milestone unit="section" n="103"/> But
that dignity is admirably maintained, thanks to his
style, by Aufidius Bassus,<note>He wrote a history of the empire down to the death of
Claudius. The work on the German war was probably a
separate work.</note> a slightly earlier writer,
especially in his work on the German war: he is
always praiseworthy, though at times he fails to do
his powers full justice.<milestone unit="section" n="104"/> But there still survives to

young at this time to be mentioned in such terms.</note> worthy to be
remembered through all time: he is appreciated today, but after generations shall declare his name

aloud. The bold utterances of Crenutius<note>Crenutius Cordus wrote a history of the Civil wars
and reign of Augustus. He was accused for his praise of
Brutus and Cassius, and committed suicide in A.D. 25. It
was he who called Cassius <quote>the last of all the Romans.</quote></note> also have
their admirers, and deserve their fame, though the
passages which brought him to his ruin have been
expurgated; still that which is left reveals a rich
store of lofty animation and fearless reflexions upon
life. There are other good writers as well, but I am
merely selecting from the different departments of
literature, not reviewing complete libraries.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="105"/>But it is our orators, above all, who enable us to
match our Roman eloquence against that of Greece.
For I would set Cicero against any one of their
orators without fear of refutation. I know well
enough what a storm I shall raise by this assertion,
more especially since I do not propose for the
moment<note>See XII. i. 14 <hi rend="italics">sqq.</hi>, also XII x. 12 <hi rend="italics">sqq.</hi></note> to compare him with Demosthenes; for
there would be no point in such a comparison, as I
consider that Demosthenes should be the object of
special study, and not merely studied, but even committed to memory.<milestone unit="section" n="106"/> I regard the excellences of these
two orators as being for the most part similar, that
is to say, their judgment, their gift of arrangement,
their methods of division, preparation and proof, as
well as everything concerned with invention. In
their actual style there is some difference. Demosthenes is more concentrated, Cicero more diffuse;
Demosthenes makes his periods shorter than Cicero,
and his weapon is the rapier, whereas Cicero's periods
are longer, and at times he employs the bludgeon as
well: nothing can be taken from the former, nor
added to the latter; the Greek reveals a more
studied, the Roman a more natural art.<milestone unit="section" n="107"/> As regards
wit and the power of exciting pity, the two most
powerful instruments where the feelings are concerned, we have the advantage. Again, it is possible

<pb id="p.63"/>

that Demosthenes was deprived by national custom<note><hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> xvi. 4; vi i 7 Quintilian refers to an alleged
law at Athens forbidding appeals to the emotion.</note>
of the opportunity of producing powerful perorations, but against this may be set the fact that the
different character of the Latin language debars us
from the attainment of those qualities which are
so much admired by the adherents of the Attic
school. As regards their letters, which have in
both cases survived, and dialogues, which Demosthenes never attempted, there can be no comparison
between the two.<milestone unit="section" n="108"/> But, on the other hand, there is
one point in which the Greek has the undoubted
superiority: he comes first in point of time, and it
was largely due to him that Cicero was able to attain
greatness. For it seems to me that Cicero, who
devoted himself heart and soul to the imitation of
the Greeks, succeeded in reproducing the force of
Demosthenes, the copious flow of Plato, and the
charm of Isocrates.<milestone unit="section" n="109"/> But he did something more
than reproduce the best elements in each of these
authors by dint of careful study; it was to himself
that he owed most of, or rather all his excellences,
which spring from the extraordinary fertility of his
immortal genius. For he does not, as Pindar<note>The quotation is not found in Pindar's extant works.</note> says,
<quote>collect the rain from heaven, but wells forth with
living water,</quote> since Providence at his birth conferred
this special privilege upon him, that eloquence should
make trial of all her powers in him.<milestone unit="section" n="110"/> For who can
instruct with greater thoroughness, or more deeply
stir the emotions? Who has ever possessed such a
gift of charm? He seems to obtain as a boon what
in reality he extorts by force, and when he wrests
the judge from the path of his own judgment, the
latter seems not to be swept away, but merely to
follow.<milestone unit="section" n="111"/> Further, there is such weight in all that he

<pb id="p.65"/>

says that his audience feel ashamed to disagree with
him, and the zeal of the advocate is so transfigured
that it has the effect of the sworn evidence of a
witness, or the verdict of a judge. And at the same
time all these excellences, of which scarce one could
be attained by the ordinary man even by the most
concentrated effort, flow from him with every appearance of spontaneity, and his style, although no fairer
has ever fallen on the ears of men, none the less
displays the utmost felicity and ease.<milestone unit="section" n="112"/> It was not,
therefore, without good reason that his own contemporaries spoke of his <quote>sovereignty</quote> at the bar, and
that for posterity the name of Cicero has come to be
regarded not as the name of a man, but as the name
of eloquence itself. Let us, therefore, fix our eyes on
him, take him as our pattern, and let the student realise
that he has made real progress if he is a passionate
admirer of Cicero.<milestone unit="section" n="113"/> Asinius Pollio<note>Asinius Pollio (75 B.C.&mdash;A.D. 4), the friend of Virgil,
distinguished as poet, historian and orator.</note> had great gifts of
invention and great precision of language (indeed,
some think him too precise), while his judgment
and spirit were fully adequate. But he is so far from
equalling the polish and charm of Cicero that he
might have been born a generation before him.
Messala,<note>M. Valerius Corvinus (64 B.C.&mdash;A.D. 8), the friend of
Tibullus and distinguished as an orator.</note> on the other hand, is polished and transparent and displays his nobility in his utterance,
but he fails to do his powers full justice.<milestone unit="section" n="114"/> As
for Gaius Caesar, if he had had leisure to devote
himself to the courts, he would have been the one
orator who could have been considered a serious rival
to Cicero. Such are his force, his penetration and
his energy that we realise that he was as vigorous in
speech as in his conduct of war. And yet all these
qualities are enhanced by a marvellous elegance of
language, of which he was an exceptionally zealous

<pb id="p.67"/>

student.<milestone unit="section" n="115"/> Caelius<note>M. Rufus Caelius, defended by Cicero in the <hi rend="italics">pro Catlio.</hi>
Killed in 48 B.C. <hi rend="italics">Cp.</hi> IV. ii. 123.: VII. i. 53.</note> has much natural talent and much
wit, more especially when speaking for the prosecution, and deserved a wiser mind and a longer life.
I have come across some critics who preferred
Calvus<note>Calvus ((Gaius Licinius), a distinguish poet and. with
Brutus, the leading orator of the Attic School. He died
at the age of 34 in 48 B.C.</note> to all other orators, and others again who
agreed with Cicero that too severe self-criticism had
robbed him of his natural vigour. But he was the
possessor of a solemn, weighty and chastened style,
which was also capable at times of genuine vehemence. He was an adherent of the Attic school and
an untimely death deprived him of his full meed of
honour, at least if we regard him as likely to have
acquired fresh qualities.<milestone unit="section" n="116"/> Servius Sulpicius<note>Servius Sulpicius Rufus, the greatest jurist of the
Ciecronian age.</note> acquired
a great and well-deserved reputation by his three
speeches. Cassius Severus,<note>assius Severus (<hi rend="italics">d.</hi> A.D. 34) banished by Augustus on
account of his scurrilous lampoons.</note> if read with discrimination, will provide much that is worthy of imitation:
if to his other merits he had added appropriateness
of tone and dignity of style,<milestone unit="section" n="117"/> he would deserve a
place among the greatest. For his natural talents
are great, his gift of bitterness, wit and passion
remarkable, but he allowed the sharpness of his
temper to prevail over his judgment. Moreover,
though his jests are pungent enough, this very
pungency often turned the laugh against himself.
<milestone unit="section" n="118"/>There are many other clever speakers, but it
would be a long task to deal with them all. Domitius
Afer<note>Domitius Afer (<hi rend="italics">d.</hi> 59 A.D.), the leading orator of the
reigns of Tiberius and his successors.</note> and Julius Africanus<note>Iulius Africanus, a Gaul, who flourished in the reign of
Nero.</note> are by far the most distinguished. The former is superior in art and in
every department of oratory, indeed he may he
ranked with the old orators without fear of

<pb id="p.69"/>

contradiction. The latter shows greater energy, but is too
great a precisian in the choice of words, prone to
tediously long periods and somewhat extravagant in
his metaphors. There have been distinguished
talents even of more recent date.<milestone unit="section" n="119"/> For example,
Trachalus<note>M. Galerius Trachalus (cos. (18 A.D.) <hi rend="italics">Cp</hi> XII v. 5</note> was, as a rule, elevated and sufficiently
clear in his language: one realised that his aims
were high, but he was better to listen to than to
read. For his voice was, in my experience, unique
in its beauty of tone, while his delivery would have
done credit to an actor, his action was full of grace
and he possessed every external advantage in profusion. Vibius Crispus,<note>Vibius Crispus, a <hi rend="italics">delator</hi> under Nero, died about A.D.
90, after acquiring great wealth. <hi rend="italics">Cp. Juv.</hi> iv. 81&ndash;93.</note> again, was well-balanced,
agreeable and born to charm, though he was better
in private than in public cases.<milestone unit="section" n="120"/> Julius Secundus,<note>Julius Secundus, a distinguished orator of the reign of
Vespasian. One of the characters in the <hi rend="italics">Dialogus</hi> of Tacitus.</note>
had he lived longer, would undoubtedly have attained
a great and enduring reputation. For he would have
acquired, as he was actually acquiring, all that was
lacking to his qualities, namely, a far greater
pugnacity and a closer attention to substance as well
as form.<milestone unit="section" n="121"/> But, in spite of the untimeliness of his end,
he occupies a high place, thanks to his fluency, the
grace with which he set forth whatever he desired,
the lucidity, smoothness and beauty of his speech,
the propriety revealed in the use of words, even
when employed figuratively, and the point which
characterises even his most hazardous expressions.
<milestone unit="section" n="122"/>Subsequent writers on the history of oratory will
find abundant material for praise among the orators
who flourish to-day: for the law courts can boast
a glorious wealth of talent. Indeed, the consummate advocates of the present day are serious
rivals of the ancients, while enthusiastic effort
and lofty ideals lead many a young student

<pb id="p.71"/>

to tread in their footsteps and imitate their
excellence.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="123"/>I have still to deal with writers on philosophy,
of whom Rome has so far produced but few who are
distinguished for their style. But Cicero, who is
great in every department of literature, stands out
as the rival of Plato in this department as well.
Brutus<note>Brutus, omitted from Qauintilian's list of orators, was a
follower of the Stoic and Academic schools. He is known
to have written treatises on Virtue, Duty and Patience.</note> was an admirable writer on such themes, in
which he distinguished himself far more than in his
speeches: he is equal to the serious nature of his
subject, and the reader realises that he feels what
he says.<milestone unit="section" n="124"/> Cornelius Celsus,<note>An encyclopedic writer under Augustus and Tiberius.
His medical treatises have survived. He wrote on oratory
also, and is not infrequently quoted by Quintilian.</note> a follower of the Sextii,<note>The Sextii, father and son, were Pythagorean philosophers of the Augustan age, with something of a Stoic
tendency as well.</note>
wrote a number of philosophical works, which have
considerable grace and polish. Among the Stoics
Plautus<note>123</note> is useful as giving a knowledge of the
subject.<milestone unit="section" n="125"/> Among the Epicureans Catius<note>A contemporary of Cicero, who speaks of him somewhat
contemptuously. He wrote four books <hi rend="italics">de rerum matura et
de summo bono.</hi></note> is agreeable to read, though lacking in weight. I have
deliberately postponed the discussion of Seneca in
connexion with the various departments of literature
owing to the fact that there is a general, though
false, impression that I condemn and even detest
him. It is true that I had occasion to pass censure upon him when I was endeavouring to recall
students from a depraved style, weakened by every
kind of error, to a severer standard of taste.<milestone unit="section" n="126"/> But
at that time Seneca's works were in the hands
of every young man, and my aim was not to ban his
reading altogether, but to prevent his being preferred to authors superior to himself, but whom he
was never tired of disparaging; for, being conscious
of the fact that his own style was very different

<pb id="p.73"/>

from theirs, he was afraid that he would fail to
please those who admired them. But the young
men loved him rather than imitated him, and fell
as far below him as he fell below the ancients.<milestone unit="section" n="127"/> For
I only wish they had equalled or at least approached
his level. But he pleased them for his faults alone,
and each individual sought to imitate such of those
faults as lay within his capacity to reproduce: and
then brought reproach on his master by boasting
that he spoke in the genuine Senecan manner.
<milestone unit="section" n="128"/>Seneca had many excellent qualities, a quick and
fertile intelligence with great industry and wide
knowledge, though as regards the last quality he
was often led into error by those whom he had
entrusted with the task of investigating certain
subjects on his behalf.<milestone unit="section" n="129"/> He dealt with almost every
department of knowledge; for speeches, poems,
letters and dialogues all circulate under his name.
In philosophy he showed a lack of critical power,
but was none the less quite admirable in his
denunciations of vice. His works contain a number
of striking general reflexions and much that is
worth reading for edification; but his style is for
the most part corrupt and exceedingly dangerous,
for the very reason that its vices are so many and
attractive.<milestone unit="section" n="130"/> One could wish that, while he relied on
his own intelligence, he had allowed himself to be
guided by the taste of others. For if he had only
despised all unnatural expressions and had not been
so passionately fond of all that was incorrect, if he
had not felt such affection for all that was his own,
and had not impaired the solidity of his matter by
striving after epigrammatic brevity, he would have
won the approval of the learned instead of the

<pb id="p.75"/>

enthusiasm of boys.<milestone unit="section" n="131"/> But even as it is, he deserves
to be read by those whose powers have been formed
and firmly moulded on the standards of a severer
taste, if only because he will exercise their critical
faculties in distinguishing between his merits and
his defects. For, as I have said, there is much in
him which we may approve, much even that we may
admire. Only we must be careful in our selection:
would he had been as careful himself. For his
genius deserved to be devoted to better aims, since
what it does actually aim at, it succeeds in achieving.</p>

<p>II. It is from these and other authors worthy of
our study that we must draw our stock of words, the
variety of our figures and our methods of composition,
while we must form our minds on the model of every
excellence. For there can be no doubt that in art
no small portion of our task lies in imitation, since,
although invention came first and is all-important, it
is expedient to imitate whatever has been invented
with success.<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And it is a universal rule of life that
we should wish to copy what we approve in others.
It is for this reason that boys copy the shapes of
letters that they may learn to write, and that
musicians take the voices of their teachers, painters
the works of their predecessors, and peasants the
principles of agriculture which have been proved in
practice, as models for their imitation. In fact, we
may note that the elementary study of every branch
of learning is directed by reference to some definite
standard that is placed before the learner.<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> We
must, in fact, either be like or unlike those who
have proved their excellence. It is rare for nature
to produce such resemblance, which is more often
the result of imitation. But the very fact that in

<pb id="p.77"/>

every subject the procedure to be followed is so
much more easy for us than it was for those who
had no model to guide them, is a positive drawback,
unless we use this dubious advantage with caution
and judgment.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The first point, then, that we must realise is that
imitation alone is not sufficient, if only for the reason
that a sluggish nature is only too ready to rest
content with the inventions of others. For what
would have happened in the days when models were
not, if men had decided to do and think of nothing
that they did not know already? The answer is
obvious: nothing would ever have been discovered.
<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Why, then, is it a crime for us to discover something
new? Were primitive men led to make so many
discoveries simply by the natural force of their
imagination, and shall we not then be spurred on to
search for novelty by the very knowledge that those
who sought of old were rewarded by success?<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And
seeing that they, who had none to teach them anything, have handed down such store of knowledge
to posterity, shall we refuse to employ the experience
which we possess of some things, to discover yet
other things, and possess nought that is not owed to
the beneficent activity of others? Shall we follow
the example of those painters whose sole aim is to
be able to copy pictures by using the ruler and the
measuring rod?<note>The reference is to copying by dividing the surface of
the picture to be copied, and of the material on which the
copy is to be made, into a number of equal squares.</note><milestone unit="section" n="7"/> It is a positive disgrace to be
content to owe all our achievement to imitation.
For what, I ask again, would have been the result
if no one had done more than his predecessors?
Livius Andronicus<note>Livius Andronicus, a slave from Tareotum, was the
founder of Latin poetry. He translated the <hi rend="italics">Odyssey,</hi> and
produced the first Latin comedy and tragedy composed in
Greek metres (240 B.C.)</note> would mark our supreme
achievement in poetry and the annals of the <hi rend="italics">Pontifices</hi><note>The Annales Maximi kept by the Pontifex Maximus,
containing the list of the consul and giving a curt summary
of the events of each consulate.</note> would be our <hi rend="italics">ne plus ultra</hi> in history. We

<pb id="p.79"/>

should still be sailing on rafts, and the art of painting
would be restricted to tracing a line round a shadow
thrown in the sunlight.<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Cast your eyes over the
whole of history; you will find that no art has
remained just as it was when it was discovered, nor
come to a standstill at its very birth, unless indeed
we are ready to pass special condensation on our
own generation on the ground that it is so barren of
invention that no further development is possible;
and it is undoubtedly true that no development is
possible for those who restrict themselves to imitation.<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But if we are forbidden to add anything to
the existing stock of knowledge, how can we ever
hope for the birth of our ideal orator? For of all
the greatest orators with whom we are as yet acquainted, there is not one who has not some
deficiency or blemish. And even those who do
not aim at supreme excellence, ought to press
toward the mark rather than be content to follow
in the tracks of others.<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> For the man whose aim
is to prove himself better than another, even if he
does not surpass him, may hope to equal him. But
he can never hope to equal him, if he thinks it his
duty merely to tread in his footsteps: for the mere
follower must always lag behind. Further, it is
generally easier to make some advance than to
repeat what has been done by others, since there
is nothing harder than to produce an exact likeness,
and nature herself has so far failed in this endeavour
that there is always some difference which enables
us to distinguish even the things which seem most
like and most equal to one another.<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Again, whatever is like another object, must necessarily be
inferior to the object of its imitation, just as the

<pb id="p.81"/>

shadow is inferior to the substance, the portrait to
the features which it portrays, and the acting of the
player to the feelings which he endeavours to reproduce. The same is true of oratory. For the models
which we select for imitation have a genuine and
natural force, whereas all imitation is artificial and
moulded to a purpose which was not that of the
original orator.<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> This is the reason why declamations
have less life and vigour than actual speeches, since
the subject is fictitious in the one and real in the
other. Again, the greatest qualities of the orator
are beyond all imitation, by which I mean, talent,
invention, force, facility and all the qualities which
are independent of art.<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Consequently, there are
many who, after excerpting certain words from
published speeches or borrowing certain particular
rhythms, think that they have produced a perfect
copy of the works which they have read, despite
the fact that words become obsolete or current
with the lapse of years, the one sure standard being
contemporary usage; and they are not good or
bad in virtue of their inherent nature (for in themselves they are no more than mere sounds), but
solely in virtue of the aptitude and propriety (or
the reverse) with which they are arranged, while
rhythmical composition must be adapted to the
theme in hand and will derive its main charm from
its variety.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="14"/>Consequently the nicest judgment is required in
the examination of everything connected with this
department of study. First we must consider whom
to imitate. For there are many who have shown a
passionate desire to imitate the worst and most
decadent authors. Secondly, we must consider what

<pb id="p.83"/>

it is that we should set ourselves to imitate in the
authors thus chosen.<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> For even great authors have
their blemishes, for which they have been censured
by competent critics and have even reproached each
other. I only wish that imitators were more likely
to improve on the good things than to exaggerate
the blemishes of the authors whom they seek to
copy. And even those who have sufficient critical
acumen to avoid the faults of their models will not
find it sufficient to produce a copy of their merits,
amounting to no more than a superficial resemblance,
or rather recalling those sloughs which, according to
Epicurus, are continually given off by material things.<note>Epicurus held that all sense-perception was caused by
the impact of such atomic sloughs: <hi rend="italics">cp. Lucret.</hi> iv. 42 sqq.</note>
<milestone unit="section" n="16"/>But this is just what happens to those who mould
themselves on the first impressions derived from the
style of their model, without devoting themselves to
a thorough investigation of its good qualities, and,
despite the brilliance of their imitation and the close
resemblance of their language and rhythm, not only
fail absolutely to attain the force of style and invention
possessed by the original, but as a rule degenerate
into something worse, and achieve merely those faults
which are hardest to distinguish from virtues: they
are turgid instead of grand, bald instead of concise,
and rash instead of courageous, while extravagance
takes the place of wealth, over-emphasis the place of
harmony and negligence of simplicity.<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> As a result,
those who flaunt tasteless and insipid thoughts,
couched in an uncouth and inharmonious form, think
that they are the equals of the ancients; those who
lack ornament and epigram, pose as Attic; those
who darken their meaning by the abruptness with
which they close their periods, count themselves the
superiors of Sallust and Thucydides; those who are

<pb id="p.85"/>

dreary and jejune, think that they are serious rivals
to Pollio, while those who are tame and listless, if
only they can produce long enough periods, swear
that this is just the manner in which Cicero would
have spoken.<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> I have known some who thought that
they had produced a brilliant imitation of the style
of that divine orator, by ending their periods with
the phrase <hi rend="italics">esse videatur.</hi><note><hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> ix. iv. 73. <hi rend="italics">Tac.</hi> <hi rend="italics">Dial.</hi> 23.</note> Consequently it is of the
first importance that every student should realise
what it is that he is to imitate, and should know
why it is good.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="19"/>The next step is for each student to consult his
own powers when he shoulders his burden. For
there are some things which, though capable of
imitation, may be beyond the capacity of any given
individual, either because his natural gifts are insufficient or of a different character. The man whose
talent is for the plain style should not seek only
what is bold and rugged, nor yet should he who has
vigour without control suffer himself through love of
subtlety at once to waste his natural energy and
fail to attain the elegance at which he aims: for
there is nothing so unbecoming as delicacy wedded
to ruggedness.<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> True, I did express the opinion
that the instructor whose portrait I painted in my
second book,<note>Ch. 8.</note> should not confine himself to teaching
those things for which he perceived his individual
pupils to have most aptitude. For it is his further
duty to foster whatever good qualities he may perceive in his pupils, to make good their deficiencies
as far as may be, to correct their faults and turn
them to better things. For he is the guide and
director of the minds of others. It is a harder task
to mould one's own nature.<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> But not even our

<pb id="p.87"/>

ideal teacher, however much he may desire that
everything that is correct should prevail in his
school to the fullest extent, will waste his labour in
attempting to develop qualities to the attainment of
which he perceives nature's gifts to be opposed.</p>
<p>It is also necessary to avoid the fault to which the
majority of students are so prone, namely, the idea
that in composing speeches we should imitate the
poets and historians, and in writing history or poetry
should copy orators and declaimers.<milestone unit="section" n="22"/> Each branch
of literature has its own laws and its own appropriate
character. Comedy does not seek to increase its
height by the buskin and tragedy does not wear
the slipper of comedy. But all forms of eloquence
have something in common, and it is to the imitation
of this common element that our efforts should be
confined.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="23"/>There is a further fault to which those persons
are liable who devote themselves entirely to the
imitation of one particular style: if the rude vigour
of some particular author takes their fancy, they
cling to it even when the case on which they are
engaged calls for an easy and flowing style; if, on
the other hand, it is a simple or agreeable style that
claims their devotion, they fail to meet the heavy
demands of severe and weighty cases. For not only
do cases differ in their general aspect, but one part
of a case may differ from another, and some things
require a gentle and others a violent style, some
require an impetuous and others a calm diction, while
in some cases it is necessary to instruct and in others
to move the audience, in all these instances dissimilar and different methods being necessary.<milestone unit="section" n="24"/> Consequently I should be reluctant even to advise a

<pb id="p.89"/>

student to select one particular author to follow
through thick and thin. Demosthenes is by far the
most perfect of Greek orators, yet there are some
things which others have said better in some contexts
as against the many things which he has said better
than others. But it does not follow that because we
should select one author for special imitation, he
should be our only model. What then?<milestone unit="section" n="25"/> Is it not
sufficient to model our every utterance on Cicero?
For my own part, I should consider it sufficient, if
I could always imitate him successfully. But what
harm is there in occasionally borrowing the vigour of
Caesar, the vehemence of Caelius, the precision of
Pollio or the sound judgment of Calvus?<milestone unit="section" n="26"/> For quite
apart from the fact that a wise man should always,
if possible, make whatever is best in each individual
author his own, we shall find that, in view of the
extreme difficulty of our subject, those who fix their
eyes on one model only will always find some one
quality which it is almost impossible to acquire therefrom. Consequently, since it is practically impossible
for mortal powers to produce a perfect and complete
copy of any one chosen author, we shall do well to
keep a number of different excellences before our
eyes, so that different qualities from different authors
may impress themselves on our minds, to be adopted
for use in the place that becomes them best.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="27"/>But imitation (for I must repeat this point again
and again) should not be confined merely to words.
We must consider the appropriateness with which
those orators handle the circumstances and persons
involved in the various cases in which they were
engaged, and observe the judgment and powers of
arrangement which they reveal, and the manner

<pb id="p.91"/>

in which everything they say, not excepting those
portions of their speeches which seem designed
merely to delight their audience, is concentrated on
securing the victory over their opponents. We must
note their procedure in the exordium, the method
and variety of their statement of facts, the power
displayed in proof and refutation, the skill revealed
in their appeal to every kind of emotion, and the
manner in which they make use of popular applause
to serve their case, applause which is most honourable when it is spontaneous and not deliberately
courted. If we have thoroughly appreciated all these
points, we shall be able to imitate our models with
accuracy.<milestone unit="section" n="28"/> But the man who to these good qualities
adds his own, that is to say, who makes good deficiencies and cuts down whatever is redundant, will
be the perfect orator of our search; and it is now
above all times that such perfection should be
attained when there are before us so many more
models of oratorical excellence than were available
for those who have thus far achieved the highest
success. For this glory also shall be theirs, that
men shall say of them that while they surpassed
their predecessors, they also taught those who came
after.</p>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Such are the aids which we may derive from
external sources; as regards those which we must
supply for ourselves, it is the pen which brings at
once the most labour and the most profit. Cicero is
fully justified in describing it as the best producer
and teacher of eloquence, and it may be noted
that in the <hi rend="italics">de Oratore</hi><note><hi rend="italics">De Or.</hi> i. 150.</note> he supports his own
judgment by the authority of Lucius Crassus, in
whose mouth he places this remark.<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> We must

<pb id="p.93"/>

therefore write as much as possible and with the
utmost care. For as deep ploughing makes the soil
more fertile for the production and support of crops,
so, if we improve our minds by something more than
mere superficial study, we shall produce a richer
growth of knowledge and shall retain it with greater
accuracy. For without the consciousness of such
preliminary study our powers of speaking extempore
will give us nothing but an empty flow of words,
springing from the lips and not from the brain.<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> It
is in writing that eloquence has its roots and foundations, it is writing that provides that holy of holies
where the wealth of oratory is stored, and whence it
is produced to meet the demands of sudden emergencies. It is of the first importance that we should
develop such strength as will not faint under the
toil of forensic strife nor be exhausted by continual
use.<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For it is an ordinance of nature that nothing
great can be achieved in a moment, and that all the
fairest tasks are attended with difficulty, while on
births as well she has imposed this law, that the
larger the animal, the longer should be the period of
gestation.</p>
<p>There are, however, two questions which present
themselves in this connexion, namely, what should
be our method and what the subjects on which
we write, and I propose to treat them in this
order.<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> At first, our pen must be slow yet sure: we
must search for what is best and refuse to give a
joyful welcome to every thought the moment that
it presents itself; we must first criticise the fruits of
our imagination, and then, once approved, arrange
them with care. For we must select both thoughts
and words and weigh them one by one. This done,

<pb id="p.95"/>

we must consider the order in which they should be
placed, and must examine all the possible varieties
of rhythm, refusing necessarily to place each word in
the order in which it occurs to us.<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> In order to do
this with the utmost care, we must frequently revise
what we have just written. For beside the fact that
thus we secure a better connexion between what
follows and what precedes, the warmth of thought
which has cooled down while we were writing is
revived anew, and gathers fresh impetus from going
over the ground again. We may compare this protess with what occurs in jumping matches. The
competitors take a longer run and go at full speed
to clear the distance which they aim at covering;
similarly, in throwing the javelin, we draw back our
arms, and in archery pull back the bow-string to
propel the shaft.<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> At times, however, we may
spread our sails before the favouring breeze, but we
must beware that this indulgence does not lead us
into error. For we love all the offspring of our
thought at the moment of their birth; were that
not so, we should never commit them to writing.
But we must give them a critical revision, and go
carefully over any passage where we have reason to
regard our fluency with suspicion.<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> It is thus, we
are told, that Sallust wrote, and certainly his works
give clear evidence of the labour which he expended
on them. Again, we learn from Varius that Virgil
composed but a very small number of verses every
day.<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> It is true that with orators the case is somewhat different, and it is for this reason that I
enjoin such slowness of speed and such anxious care
at the outset. For the first aim which we must fix
in our minds and insist on carrying into execution

<pb id="p.97"/>

is to write as well as possible; speed will come with
practice. Gradually thoughts will suggest themselves with increasing readiness, the words will
answer to our call and rhythmical arrangement will
follow, till everything will be found fulfilling its
proper function as in a well-ordered household.
The sum of the whole matter is this:<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> write quickly
and you will never write well, write well and you
will soon write quickly. But it is just when we
have acquired this facility that we must pause awhile
to look ahead and, if I may use the metaphor, curb
the horses that would run away with us. This will
not delay our progress so much as lend us fresh
vigour. For I do not think that those who have
acquired a certain power in writing should be condemned to the barren pains of false self-criticism.
<milestone unit="section" n="11"/>How can anyone fulfil his duties as an advocate if he
wastes his time in putting unnecessary finish on each
portion of his pleadings? There are some who are
never satisfied. They wish to change everything
they have written and to put it in other words.
They are a diffident folk, and deserve but ill of their
own talents, who think it a mark of precision to cast
obstacles in the way of their own writing.<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Nor is it
easy to say which are the most serious offenders, those
who are satisfied with everything or those who are
satisfied with nothing that they write. For it is
of common occurrence with young men, however
talented they may be, to waste their gifts by superfluous elaboration, and to sink into silence through
an excessive desire to speak well. I remember in
this connexion a story that Julius Secundus, my contemporary, and, as is well known, my very dear friend,
a man with remarkable powers of eloquence, but

<pb id="p.99"/>

with an infinite passion for precision, told me of the
words once used to him by his uncle,<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Julius Florus,
the leading orator of Gaul, for it was there that he
practised, a man eloquent as but few have ever
been, and worthy of his nephew. He once noticed
that Secundus, who was still a student, was looking
depressed, and asked him the meaning of his frowns.
The youth made no concealment of the reason:<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> he
had been working for three days, and had been unable, in spite of all his efforts, to devise an exordium
for the theme which he had been given to write,
with the result that he was not only vexed over
his immediate difficulty, but had lost all hope of
future success. Florus smiled and said, <quote>Do you
really want to speak better than you can?</quote><milestone unit="section" n="15"/> There
lies the truth of the whole matter. We must aim
at speaking as well as we can, but must not try to
speak better than our nature will permit. For to
make any real advance we need study, not selfaccusation. And it is not merely practice that will
enable us to write at greater length and with
increased fluency, although doubtless practice is
most important. We need judgement as well. So
long as we do not he back with eyes turned up to the
ceiling, trying to fire our imagination by muttering
to ourselves, in the hope that something will present
itself, but turn our thoughts to consider what the
circumstances of the case demand, what suits the
characters involved, what is the nature of the occasion and the temper of the judge, we shall acquire
the power of writing by rational means. It is thus
that nature herself bids us begin and pursue our
studies once well begun.<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> For most points are of a
definite character and, if we keep our eyes open,

<pb id="p.101"/>

will spontaneously present themselves. That is the
reason why peasants and uneducated persons do not
beat about the bush to discover with what they
should begin, and our hesitation is all the more
shameful if it is simply the result of education.
We must not, therefore, persist in thinking that
what is hard to find is necessarily best; for, if it
seems to us that there is nothing to be said except
that which we are unable to find, we must say
nothing at all.<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> On the other hand, there is a fault
which is precisely the opposite of this, into which
those fall who insist on first making a rapid draft
of their subject with the utmost speed of which
their pen is capable, and write in the heat and
impulse of the moment. They call this their rough
copy. They then revise what they have written,
and arrange their hasty outpourings. But while
the words and the rhythm may be corrected, the
matter is still marked by the superficiality resulting
from the speed with which it was thrown together.
<milestone unit="section" n="18"/>The more correct method is, therefore, to exercise
care from the very beginning, and to form the
work from the outset in such a manner that it
merely requires to be chiselled into shape, not
fashioned anew. Sometimes, however, we must
follow the stream of our emotions, since their
warmth will give us more than any diligence can
secure.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="19"/>The condemnation which I have passed on such
carelessness in writing will make it pretty clear what
my views are on the luxury of dictation which
is now so fashionable. For, when we write, however
great our speed, the fact that the hand cannot follow
the rapidity of our thoughts gives us time to think,

<pb id="p.103"/>

whereas the presence of our amanuensis hurries us
on, and at times we feel ashamed to hesitate or
pause, or make some alteration, as though we were
afraid to display such weakness before a witness.
<milestone unit="section" n="20"/>As a result our language tends not merely to be
haphazard and formless, but in our desire to produce
a continuous flow we let slip positive improprieties
of diction, which show neither the precision of the
writer nor the impetuosity of the speaker. Again, if
the amanuensis is a slow writer, or lacking in intelligence, he becomes a stumbling-block, our speed is
checked, and the thread of our ideas is interrupted
by the delay or even perhaps by the loss of
temper to which it gives rise.<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> Moreover, the
gestures which accompany strong feeling, and sometimes even serve to stimulate the mind, the waving
of the hand, the contraction of the brow, the
occasional striking of forehead or side, and those
which Persius<note>i. 106.</note> notes when he describes a trivial
style as one that

<quote rend="blockquote">
<l><quote>Thumps not the desk nor smacks of bitten nails,</quote></l></quote>

all these become ridiculous, unless we are alone,
Finally,<milestone unit="section" n="22"/> we come to the most important consideration of all, that the advantages of privacy are lost
when we dictate. Everyone, however, will agree
that the absence of company and deep silence are
most conducive to writing, though I would not go
so far as to concur in the opinion of those who think
woods and groves the most suitable localities for
the purpose, on the ground that the freedom of
the sky and the charm of the surroundings produce
sublimity of thought and wealth of inspiration.
<milestone unit="section" n="23"/>Personally I regard such an environment as a

<pb id="p.105"/>

pleasant luxury rather than a stimulus to study.
For whatever causes us delight, must necessarily
distract us from the concentration due to our work.
The mind cannot devote its undivided and sincere
attention to a number of things at the same time,
and wherever it turns its gaze it must cease to
contemplate its appointed task.<milestone unit="section" n="24"/> Therefore, the
charm of the woods, the gliding of the stream, the
breeze that murmurs in the branches, the song of
birds, and the very freedom with which our eyes
may range, are mere distractions, and in my opinion
the pleasure which they excite is more likely to
relax than to concentrate our attention.<milestone unit="section" n="25"/> Demosthenes took a wiser view; for he would retire to
a place<note>An underground room. See Plut. <hi rend="italics">Dem.</hi> vii.</note> where no voice was to be heard, and no
prospect greeted the sight, for fear that his eyes
might force his mind to neglect its duty. Therefore, let the burner of the midnight oil seclude
himself in the silence of night, within closed doors,
with but a solitary lamp to light his labours.<milestone unit="section" n="26"/> But
for every kind of study, and more especially for
night work, good health and its chief source, simple
living, are essential; for we have fallen into the
habit of devoting to relentless labour the hour which
nature has appointed for rest and relaxation. From
those hours we must take only such time as is superfluous for sleep, and will not be missed.<milestone unit="section" n="27"/> For fatigue
will make us careless in writing, and the hours of
daylight are amply sufficient for one who has no
other distractions. It is only the busy man who
is driven to encroach on the hours of darkness.
Nevertheless, night work, so long as we come to it
fiesh and untired, provides by far the best form of
privacy.</p>

<pb id="p.107"/>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="28"/>But although silence and seclusion and absolute
freedom of mind are devoutly to be desired, they
are not always within our power to attain. Consequently we must not fling aside our book at once,
if disturbed by some noise, and lament that we
have lost a day: on the contrary, we must make
a firm stand against such inconveniences, and train
ourselves so to concentrate our thoughts as to rise
superior to all impediments to study. If only you
direct all your attention to the work which you
have in hand, no sight or sound will ever penetrate
to your mind.<milestone unit="section" n="29"/> If even casual thoughts often occupy
us to such an extent that we do not see passers-by,
or even stray from our path, surely we can obtain
the same result by the exercise of our will. We
must not give way to pretexts for sloth. For unless
we make up our mind that we must be fresh, cheerful and free from all other care when we approach our
studies, we shall always find some excuse for idleness.
<milestone unit="section" n="30"/>Therefore, whether we be in a crowd, on a journey,
or even at some festive gathering, our thoughts should
always have some inner sanctuary of their own to
which they may retire. Otherwise what shall we
do when we are suddenly called upon to deliver
a set speech in the midst of the forum, with lawsuits in progress on every side, and with the sound
of quarrels and even casual outcries in our ears, if
we need absolute privacy to discover the thoughts
which we jot down upon our tablets? It was for
this reason that Demosthenes, the passionate lover
of seclusion, used to study on the seashore amid the
roar of the breakers that they might teach him not
to be unnerved by the uproar of the public assembly.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="31"/>There are also certain minor details which deserve

<pb id="p.109"/>

our attention, for there is nothing too minute for the
student. It is best to write on wax owing to the
facility which it offers for erasure, though weak
sight may make it desirable to employ parchment
by preference. The latter, however, although of
assistance to the eye, delays the hand and interrupts
the stream of thought owing to the frequency with
which the pen has to be supplied with ink.<milestone unit="section" n="32"/> But
whichever we employ, we must leave blank pages
that we may be free to make additions when we
will. For lack of space at times gives rise to a
reluctance to make corrections, or, at any rate, is
liable to cause confusion when new matter is
inserted. The wax tablets should not be unduly
wide; for I have known a young and over-zealous
student write his compositions at undue length,
because he measured them by the number of lines,
a fault which persisted, in spite of frequent admonition, until his tablets were changed, when it
disappeared.<milestone unit="section" n="33"/> Space must also be left for jotting
down the thoughts which occur to the writer out
of due order, that is to say, which refer to subjects
other than those in hand. For sometimes the most
admirable thoughts break in upon us which cannot
be inserted in what we are writing, but which, on
the other hand, it is unsafe to put by, since they are
at times forgotten, and at times cling to the memory
so persistently as to divert us from some other line
of thought. They are, therefore, best kept in
store.</p>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The next point which we have to consider is
the correction of our work, which is by far the most
useful portion of our study: for there is good reason
for the view that erasure is quite as important a

<pb id="p.111"/>

function of the pen as actual writing. Correction
takes the form of addition, excision and alteration.
But it is a comparatively simple and easy task to
decide what is to be added or excised. On the
other hand, to prune what is turgid, to elevate
what is mean, to repress exuberance, arrange what
is disorderly, introduce rhythm where it is lacking,
and modify it where it is too emphatic, involves a
twofold labour. For we have to condemn what had
previously satisfied us and discover what had escaped
our notice.<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There can be no doubt that the best
method of correction is to put aside what we have
written for a certain time, so that when we return
to it after an interval it will have the air of novelty
and of being another's handiwork; for thus we may
prevent ourselves from regarding our writings with
all the affection that we lavish on a newborn child.
<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>But this is not always possible, especially in the case
of an orator who most frequently has to write for
immediate use, while some limit, after all, must be
set to correction. For there are some who return
to everything they write with the presumption that
it is full of faults and, assuming that a first draft
must necessarily be incorrect, think every change
an improvement and make some alteration as often
as they have the manuscript in their hands: they
are, in fact, like doctors who use the knife even
where the flesh is perfectly healthy. The result of
their critical activities is that the finished work is
full of scars, bloodless, and all the worse for their
anxious care.<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> No! let there be something in all our writing which, if it does not actually please us,
at least passes muster, so that the file may only
polish our work, not wear it away. There must

<pb id="p.113"/>

also be a limit to the time which we spend on its
revision. For the fact that Cinna<note>C. Helvius Cinna, the friend of Catullus. The Smyrna
was a short but exceptionally obscure and learned epic.</note> took nine years
to write his Smyrna, and that Isocrates required
ten years, at the lowest estimate, to complete his
Panegyric does not concern the orator, whose
assistance will be of no use, if it is so long
delayed.</p>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>My next task is to indicate what those should
write whose aim is to acquire facility.<note>See x. i. 1.
Ch. ix.</note> At this part
of my work there is no necessity for me to set forth
the subjects which should be selected for writing,
or the order in which they should be approached,
since I have already done this in the first book,<note>Ch. iv.</note>
where I prescribed the sequence of studies for boys,
and in the second book, where I did the same for
young men. The point which concerns me now is
to show from what sources copiousness and facility
may most easily be derived.</p>
<p>Our earlier orators thought highly of translation
from Greek into Latin.<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> In the <hi rend="italics">de Oratore</hi><note>i. 155.</note> of
Cicero, Lucius Crassus says that he practised this
continually, while Cicero himself advocates it again
and again, nay, he actually published translations
of Xenophon and Plato,<note>The (<hi rend="italics">Economicus of</hi> Xenophon, the <hi rend="italics">Proutayorus</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Timaeus</hi>
of Plato.</note> which were the result of
this form of exercise. Messala likewise gave it his
approval, and we have a number of translations of
speeches from his hand; he even succeeded in
coping with the delicacy of Hyperides' speech in
defence of Phryne, a task of exceeding difficulty for
a Roman.<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The purpose of this form of exercise is
obvious. For Greek authors are conspicuous for the
variety of their matter, and there is much art in
all their eloquence, while, when we translate them,
we are at liberty to use the best words available,

<pb id="p.115"/>

since all that we use are our very own.<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> we shall not borrow from our models, as we do in
paraphrasing Latin.</note> As regards
figures, too, which are the chief ornament of oratory,
it is necessary to think out a great number and variety
for ourselves, since in this respect the Roman idiom
differs largely from the Greek.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>But paraphrase from the Latin will also be of
much assistance, while I think we shall all agree that
this is specially valuable with regard to poetry;
indeed, it is said that the paraphrase of poetry was
the sole form of exercise employed by Sulpicius.
For the lofty inspiration of verse serves to elevate
the orator's style and the bold license of poetic
language does not preclude<note><hi rend="italics">Lit.</hi> <quote>forestall the power of using the language of
ordinary prose.</quote></note> our attempting to
render the same words in the language natural to
prose. Nay, we may add the vigour of oratory
to the thoughts expressed by the poet, make good
his omissions, and prune his diffuseness.<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But I
would not have paraphrase restrict itself to the
bare interpretation of the original: its duty is
rather to rival and vie with the original in the
expression of the same thoughts. Consequently,
I disagree with those who forbid the student to
parahrase speeches of our own orators, on the
ground that, since all the best expressions have
already been appropriated, whatever we express
differently must necessarily be a change for the
worse. For it is always possible that we may discover expressions which are an improvement on
those which have already been used, and nature
did not make eloquence such a poor and starveling
thing, that there should be only one adequate
expression for any one theme.<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> It can hardly be
argued that, while the gestures of the actor are
capable of imparting a wealth of varied meaning

<pb id="p.117"/>

to the same words, the power of oratory is restricted
to a narrower scope, so that when a thing has once
been said, it is impossible to say anything else on
the same theme. Why, even if it be granted that
no new expression we discover can be better than
or even equal to the old, it may, at any rate, be
a good second.<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Do we not often speak twice, or
even more frequently, on the same subject, sometimes even to the extent of a number of sentences
in succession? It will scarce be asserted that we
must not match ourselves against others when
we are permitted to match ourselves against ourselves. For if there were only one way in which
anything could be satisfactorily expressed, we
should be justified in thinking that the path to
success had been sealed to us by our predecessors.
But, as a matter of fact, the methods of expression
still left us are innumerable, and many roads lead
us to the same goal.<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Brevity and copiousness each
have their own peculiar grace, the merits of metaphor are one thing and of literalness another, and,
while direct expression is most effective in one case,
in another the best result is gained by a use of
figures. Further, the exercise is valuable in virtue
of its difficulty; and again, there is no better way of
acquiring a thorough understanding of the greatest
authors. For, instead of hurriedly running a careless
eye over their writings, we handle each separate
phrase and are forced to give it close examination,
and we come to realise the greatness of their excellence from the very fact that we cannot imitate
them.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Nor is it only the paraphrase of the works of
others that we shall find of advantage: much may

<pb id="p.119"/>

be gained from paraphrasing our own words in a
number of different ways: for instance, we may
specially select certain thoughts and recast them
in the greatest variety of forms, just as a sculptor
will fashion a number of different images from the
same piece of wax.<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> But it is the simplest subjects
which, in my opinion, will serve us best in our
attempt to acquire facility. For our lack of talent
may easily shelter itself behind the complicated
mass of detail presented by persons, cases, circumstances of time and place, words and deeds, since
the subjects which present themselves on all sides
are so many that it will always be possible to lay
hold of some one or other.<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> True merit is revealed
by the power to expand what is naturally compressed, to amplify what is small, to lend variety
to sameness, charm to the commonplace, and to
say a quantity of good things about a very limited
number of subjects.</p>
<p>For this purpose indefinite questions,<note>See III. v. 5 <hi rend="italics">.sq.</hi></note> of the kind
we call <hi rend="italics">theses,</hi> will be found of the utmost service:
in fact, Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">Ad Att.</hi> IX. iv. 1.</note> still exercised himself upon such
themes after he had become the leading man in
the state.<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Akin to these are the proof or refutation of general statements. For such statements
are a kind of decree or rule, and whatever problem
may arise from the thing, may equally arise from the
decision passed upon the thing. Then there are
commonplaces,<note>See II. i 9&ndash;11 and iv. 22.</note> which, as we know, have often been
written by orators as a form of exercise. The man
who has practised himself in giving full treatment
to such simple and uncomplicated themes, will
assuredly find his fluency increased in those subjects
which admit of varied digression, and will be

<pb id="p.121"/>

prepared to deal with any case that may confront him,
since all cases ultimately turn upon general questions.<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> For what difference is there between the
special case where Cornelius,<note>See IV. iv. 8; v. xiii. 26; VI. v. 10; II. iii. 3, 35.</note> the tribune of the
people, is charged with reading the text of a proposed law, and the general question whether it is
<hi rend="italics">l&eacute;se-majest&egrave;</hi> for a magistrate himself to read the
law which he proposes to the people; what does it
matter whether we have to decide whether Milo was
justified in killing Clodius, or whether it is justifiable to kill a man who has set an ambush for his
slayer, or a citizen whose existence is a danger to
the state, even though he has set no such ambush?
What difference is there between the question
whether it was an honourable act on the part of
Cato to make over Marcia to Hortensius, or whether
such an action is becoming to a virtuous man? It is
on the guilt or innocence of specific persons that
judgement is given, but it is on general principles
that the case ultimately rests.<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> As for declamations
of the kind delivered in the schools of the rhetoricians, so long as they are in keeping with actual
life and resemble speeches, they are most profitable
to the student, not merely while he<note>profectus, <hi rend="italics">lit.</hi> <quote>progress,</quote> abstract for concrete.</note> is still immature,
for the reason that they simultaneously exercise the
powers both of invention and arrangement, but even
when he has finished his education and acquired a
reputation in the courts. For they provide a richer
diet from which eloquence derives nourishment and
brilliance of complexion, and at the same time afford
a refreshing variety after the continuous fatigues
of forensic disputes.<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> For the same reason, the wealth
of language that marks the historian should be from
time to time imported into portions of our written

<pb id="p.123"/>

exercises, and we should indulge in the easy freedom of dialogue. Nay, it may even be advantageous
to amuse ourselves with the writing of verse, just as
athletes occasionally drop the severe regime of diet
and exercise to which they are subjected and refresh
themselves by taking a rest and indulging in more
dainty and agreeable viands.<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Indeed, in my opinion,
one of the reasons why Cicero was enabled to shed
such glory upon the art of speaking is to be found
in his excursions to such bypaths of study. For if
all our material was drawn solely from actions at
law, our eloquence must needs lose its gloss, our
limbs grow stiff, and the keen edge of the intellect
be blunted by its daily combats.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="17"/>But although those who find their practice in the
contests of forensic warfare derive fresh strength
and repair their forces by means of this rich fare of
eloquence, the young should not be kept too long at
these false semblances of reality, nor should they be
allowed to become so familiar with these empty
shadows that it is difficult for them to leave them:
otherwise there is always the danger that, owing to
the seclusion in which they have almost grown
old, they will shrink in terror from the real perils
of public life, like men dazzled by the unfamiliar
sunlight.<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> Indeed it is recorded that this fate
actually befell Marcus Porcius Latro, the first professor of rhetoric to make a name for himself; for
when, at the height of his fame in the schools, he was
called upon to plead a case in the forum, he put
forward the most earnest request that the court
should be transferred to some public hall. He was
so unaccustomed to speak in the open air that all his
eloquence seemed to reside within the compass of a

<pb id="p.125"/>

roof and four walls.<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> For this reason a young man
who has acquired a thorough knowledge from his
instructors of the methods of invention and style
(which is not by any means an endless task, if those
instructors have the knowledge and the will to
teach), and who has also managed to obtain a
reasonable amount of practice in the art, should
follow the custom in vogue with our ancestors, and
select some one orator to follow and imitate. He
should attend as many trials as possible and be a
frequent spectator of the conflicts in which he is
destined to take part.<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> Next he should write out
speeches of his own dealing either with the cases
which he has actually heard pleaded or with others,
provided always they be actual cases, and should
argue them from both sides, training himself with
the real weapons of his warfare, just as gladiators do
or as Brutus did in that speech in defence of Milo
which I have already mentioned.<note>See III. vi. 93; x. i. 23.</note> This is better
than writing replies to old speeches, as Cestius did
to Cicero's defence of Milo in spite of the fact that,
his knowledge being confined to what was said for
the defence, he could not have possessed sufficient
acquaintance with the other side of the case.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="21"/>The young man, however, whom his instructor has
compelled to be as realistic as possible in declamation,
and to deal with every class of subject, instead of
merely selecting the easiest and most attractive cases,
as is done at present, will thus qualify himself much
more rapidly for actual forensic practice. Under existing circumstances the practice of the principle<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> <quote>per totas ire materias.</quote></note> which
I mentioned second is, as a rule, hampered by the
large size of the classes and the practice of allotting
certain days for recitation, to which must be added

<pb id="p.127"/>

the contributory circumstance that the boys' parents
are more interested in the number of their sons'
recitations than their quality.<milestone unit="section" n="22"/> But, as I think I said
in the first book,<note>I. ii. 15.</note> the really good teacher will not
burden himself with a larger number of pupils than
he can manage, and will prune any tendency to
excessive loquacity, limiting their remarks to the
actual points involved by the subject of the declamation and forbidding them to range, as some would
have them do, over every subject in heaven and
earth: further, he will either extend the period
within which he insists on their speaking, or will
permit them to divide their themes into several
portions.<milestone unit="section" n="23"/> The thorough treatment of one theme
will be more profitable than the sketchy and superficial treatment of a number of subjects. For the
latter practice has the result that nothing is put in
its proper place and that the opening of the declamation exceeds all reasonable bounds, since the
young orator crams all the flowers of eloquence
which belong to all the different portions of the
theme into that portion which he has to deliver,
and fearing to lose what should naturally come later,
introduces wild confusion into the earlier portions
of his speech.</p>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Having dealt with writing, the next point
which claims our attention is premeditation, which
itself derives force from the practice of writing and
forms an intermediate stage between the labours of
the pen and the more precarious fortunes of improvisation; indeed I am not sure that it is not more
frequently of use than either. For there are places
and occasions where writing is impossible, while both
are available in abundance for premeditation. For

<pb id="p.129"/>

but a few hours' thought will suffice to cover all the
points even of cases of importance; if we wake at
night, the very darkness will assist us, while even in
the midst of legal proceedings our mind will find
some vacant space for meditation, and will refuse to
remain inactive.<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Again, this practice will not merely
secure the proper arrangement of our matter without
any recourse to writing, which in itself is no small
achievement, but will also set the words which we
are going to use in their proper order, and bring the
general texture of our speech to such a stage of
completion that nothing further is required beyond
the finishing touches. And as a rule the memory is
more retentive of thoughts when the attention has
not been relaxed by the fancied security which
results from committing them to writing.</p>
<p>But the concentration which this requires cannot
be attained in a moment or even quickly.<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For, in
the first place, we must write much before we can
form that ideal of style which must always be
present to our minds even when engaged in premeditation. Secondly, we must gradually acquire
the habit of thought: to begin with, we shall content ourselves with covering but a few details, which
our minds are capable of reproducing with accuracy;
then by advances so gradual that our labour is not
sensibly increased we must develop our powers and
confirm them by frequent practice, a task in which
the most important part is played by the memory.
<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>For this reason I must postpone some of my remarks
to the portion of this work reserved for the treatment of that topic.<note>XI. ii. 1 <hi rend="italics">sqq.</hi></note> At length, however, our powers
will have developed so far that the man who is not
hampered by lack of natural ability will by dint of

<pb id="p.131"/>

persistent study be enabled, when it comes to speaking, to rely no less on what he has thought out than
what he has written out and learnt by heart. At
any rate, Cicero records that Metrodorus of Scepsis,<note>A philosopher of the Academic school, contemporary
with Cicero, <hi rend="italics">cp. de Or.</hi> ii. 360.</note>
Empylus of Rhodes,<note>Empylus is not mentioned elsewhere.</note> and our own Hortensius<note><hi rend="italics">Cp. Brut.</hi> 301.</note> were
able to reproduce what they had thought out word
for word when it came to actual pleading.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>If, however, some brilliant improvisation should
occur to us while speaking, we must not cling superstitiously to our premeditated scheme. For premeditation is not so accurate as to leave no room
for happy inspiration: even when writing we often
insert thoughts which occur to us on the spur of the
moment. Consequently this form of preparation
must be conceived on such lines that we shall find
no difficulty either in departing from it or returning
to it at will.<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> For, although it is essential to bring
with us into court a supply of eloquence which has
been prepared in advance in the study and on which
we can confidently rely, there is no greater folly
than the rejection of the gifts of the moment.
Therefore our premeditation should be such that
fortune may never be able to fool us, but may, on
the contrary, be able to assist us. This end will be
obtained by developing the power of memory so
that our conceptions may flow from us without fear
of disaster, and that we may be enabled to look
ahead without anxious backward glances or the
feeling that we are absolutely dependent on what
we can call to mind. Otherwise I prefer the rashness of improvisation to the coherence given by
premeditation.<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For such backward glances place us
at a disadvantage, because our search for our premeditated ideas makes us miss others, and we draw

<pb id="p.133"/>

our matter from our memory rather than from the
subject on which we are speaking. And even if we
are to rely on our memory and our subject alike,
there are more things that may be discovered than
ever yet have been.</p>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But the crown of all our study and the
highest reward of our long labours is the power of
improvisation. The man who fails to acquire this
had better, in my opinion, abandon the task of
advocacy and devote his powers of writing to other
branches of literature. For it is scarcely decent for
an honourable man to promise assistance to the
public at large which he may be unable to provide in
the most serious emergencies, or to attempt to enter
a harbour which his ship cannot hope to make save
when sailing before a gentle breeze.<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For there are
countless occasions when the sudden necessity may be
imposed upon him of speaking without preparation
before the magistrates or in a trial which comes on
unexpectedly. And if any such sudden emergency
befalls, I will not say any innocent citizen, but some
one of the orator's friends or connexions, is he to
stand tongue-tied and, in answer to those who seek
salvation in his eloquence and are doomed, unless
they secure assistance, to ask for delay of proceedings and time for silent and secluded study, till such
moment as he can piece together the words that fail
him, commit them to memory and prepare his voice
and lungs for the effort?<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> What theory of the duties
of an orator is there which permits him to ignore
such sudden issues? What will happen when he
has to reply to his opponent? For often the expected arguments to which we have written a reply
fail us and the whole aspect of the case undergoes

<pb id="p.135"/>

a sudden change; consequently the variation to
which cases are liable makes it as necessary for us
to change our methods as it is for a pilot to change
his course before the oncoming storm.<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Again, what
use is much writing, assiduous reading and long
years of study, if the difficulty is to remain as great
as it was in the beginning? The man who is always
faced with the same labour can only confess that his
past labour has been spent in vain. I do not ask
him to prefer to speak extempore, but merely that
lie should be able to do so. And this capacity is
best acquired by the following method.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>In the first place, we must note the direction which
the argument is likely to take, since we cannot run
our race unless we know the goal and the course.
It is not enough to know what are the parts<note>See III. ix. 1.</note> into
which forensic pleadings are divided or the principles determining the order of the various questions,
important though these points are. We must realise
what should come first, second, and so on, in the
several parts; for these points are so closely linked
together by the very nature of things that they
cannot be separated, nor their order changed, without giving rise to confusion.<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The orator, who speaks
methodically, will above all take the actual sequence
of the various points as his guide, and it is for this
reason that even but moderately trained speakers
find it easiest to keep the natural order in the <hi rend="italics">statement of facts.</hi> Secondly, the orator must know
what to look for in each portion of his case: he
must not beat about the bush or allow himself to be
thrown off the track by thoughts which suggest
themselves from irrelevant quarters, or produce a
speech which is a confused mass of incongruities,

<pb id="p.137"/>

owing to his habit of leaping this way and that, and
never sticking to any one point.<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Finally, he must
confine himself to certain definite bounds, and for
this <hi rend="italics">division</hi> is absolutely necessary. When to the
best of his ability he has dealt fully with all the
points which he has advanced, he will know that he
has reached his goal.</p>
<p>The precepts just given are dependent on theory.
Those to which I now come depend on individual
study. We must acquire a store of the best words
and phrases on lines that I have already laid down,
while our style must be formed by continuous and
conscientious practice in writing, so that even our
improvisations may reproduce the tone of our writing,
and after writing much, we must give ourselves
frequent practice in speaking.<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> For facility is mainly
the result of habit and exercise and, if it be
lost only for a brief time, the result will be
not merely that we fall short of the requisite
rapidity, but that our lips will become clogged
and slow to open. For although we need to
possess a certain natural nimbleness of mind to
enable us, while we are saying what the instant
demands, to build up what is to follow and to
secure that there will always be some thought formed
and conceived in advance ready to serve our voice,
none the less,<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> it is scarcely possible either for natural
gifts or for methodic art to enable the mind to
grapple simultaneously with such manifold duties,
and to be equal at one and the same time to the
tasks of invention, arrangement, and style, together
with what we are uttering at the moment, what we
have got to say next and what we have to look to
still further on, not to mention the fact that it

<pb id="p.139"/>

is necessary all the time to give close attention to
voice, delivery and gesture.<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> For our mental activities
must range far ahead and pursue the ideas which
are still in front, and in proportion as the speaker
pays out what he has in hand, he must make advances
to himself from his reserve funds, in order that, until
we reach our conclusion, our mind's eye may urge
its gaze forward, keeping time with our advance:
otherwise we shall halt and stumble, and pour forth
short and broken phrases, like persons who can only
gasp out what they have to say.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>There is, therefore, a certain mechanical knack,
which the Greeks call <foreign lang="greek">a)/logos tribh/,</foreign> which enables
the hand to go on scribbling, while the eye takes
in whole lines at once as it reads, observes the intonations and the stops, and sees what is coming
before the reader has articulated to himself what
precedes. It is a similar knack which makes possible
those miraculous tricks which we see jugglers and
masters of sleight of hand perform upon the stage,
in such a manner that the spectator can scarcely
help believing that the objects which they throw
into the air come to hand of their own accord, and
run where they are bidden.<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> But this knack will
only be of real service if it be preceded by the art
of which we have spoken,<note>&sect;&sect; 5&ndash;7.</note> so that what is irrational
in itself will nevertheless be founded on reason. For
unless a man speaks in an orderly, ornate and fluent
manner, I refuse to dignify his utterance with the
name of speech, but consider it the merest rant.
<milestone unit="section" n="13"/>Nor again shall I ever be induced to admire a continuous flow of random talk, such as I note streams in
torrents even from the lips of women when they
quarrel, although, if a speaker is swept away by

<pb id="p.141"/>

warmth of feeling and genuine inspiration, it frequently happens that he attains a success from improvisation which would have been beyond the reach of
the most careful preparation.<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> When this occurred, the
old orators, such as Cicero,<note>No such saying is found in Cicero's extant works.</note> used to say that some god
had inspired the speaker. But the reason is obvious.
For profound emotion and vivid imagination sweep
on with unbroken force, whereas, if retarded by the
slowness of the pen, they are liable to grow cold and,
it put off for the moment, may never return. Above
all, if we add to these obstacles an unhealthy tendency
to quibble over the choice of words, and check our
advance at each step, the vehemence of our onset
loses its impetus; while even though our choice of
individual words may be of the happiest, the style
will be a mere patchwork with no regular pattern.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="15"/>Consequently those vivid conceptions of which I
spoke<note>VI. ii. 29.</note> and which, as I remarked, are called <foreign lang="greek">fantasi/ai,</foreign>
together with everything that we intend to say,
the persons and questions involved, and the hopes
and fears to which they give rise, must be kept
clearly before our eyes and admitted to our hearts:
for it is feeling and force of imagination that make
us eloquent. It is for this reason that even the uneducated have no difficulty in finding words to express
their meaning, if only they are stirred by some strong
emotion.<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Further the attention of the mind must be
directed not to some one thing, but simultaneously to
a number of things in continuous sequence. The
result will be the same as when we cast our eyes
along some straight road and see at once all that is on
and near it, obtaining a view not merely of its end,
but of the whole way there. Dread of the shame
of failure is also a powerful stimulant to oratory,

<pb id="p.143"/>

and it may be regarded as a matter for wonder that,
whereas when writing we delight in privacy and
shrink from the presence of witnesses, in extempore
pleading a large audience has an encouraging effect,
like that which the sight of the massed standards
has on the soldier.<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> For the sheer necessity of speaking thrusts forward and forces out our labouring
thought, and the desire to win approbation kindles
and fosters our efforts. So true is it that there is
nothing which does not look for some reward, that
eloquence, despite the fact that its activity is in itself
productive of a strong feeling of pleasure, is influenced
by nothing so much as the immediate acquisition of
praise and renown.<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> Nor should any man put such
trust in his native ability as to hope that this power
will present itself to him at the outset of his career
as an orator; for the precepts which I laid down for
premeditation<note>Ch. vi. 3.</note> apply to improvisation also; we
must develop it by gradual stages from small beginnings, until we have reached that perfection which
can only be produced and maintained by practice.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="19"/>Moreover, the orator should reach such a pitch of
excellence that, while premeditation may still be the
safer method, it will not necessarily be the better,
since many have acquired the gift of improvisation not
merely in prose, but in verse as well, as, for example,
Antipater of Sidon and Licinius Archias (for whose
powers we have the unquestionable authority of
Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">De Or.</hi> iii. 194; <hi rend="italics">Pro Arch.</hi> viii. 18.</note>), not to mention the fact that there are
many, even in our own day, who have done this and
are still doing it. I do not, however, regard this
accomplishment as being particularly valuable in
itself, for it is both unpractical and unnecessary, but
mention it as a useful example to encourage students

<pb id="p.145"/>

training for the bar, in the hope that they may be
able to acquire this accomplishment.<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> Still our confidence in our power of speaking extempore should
never be so great that we should neglect to devote
a few minutes to the consideration of what we are
going to say. There will but rarely be occasions
when this is impossible, while in the lawsuits of
the courts there is always some time allowed for the
purpose. For no one can plead a cause with the
facts of which be is unacquainted.<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> Some declaimers,
it is true, are led by a perverse ambition to attempt
to speak the moment their theme has been given
them, and even ask for a word with which to start,
an affectation which is in the worst and most
theatrical taste. But eloquence has, in her turn,
nothing but derision for those that insult her thus,
and speakers who wish to seem learned to fools are
merely regarded as fools by the learned.<milestone unit="section" n="22"/> If, however, chance should impose the necessity upon us of
pleading a case at such short notice, we shall require
to develop special mental agility, to give all our
attention to the subject, and to make a temporary
sacrifice of our care for the niceties of language, if
we find it impossible to secure both. On such
occasions a slower delivery and a style of speaking suggestive of a certain indecision and doubt will
secure us time to think, but we must be careful to
do this in such a way as to give the impression of
thought, not of hesitation.<milestone unit="section" n="23"/> This precaution may be
employed while we are clearing harbour, if the wind
drive us forward before all our tackle is ready.
Afterwards, as we proceed upon our course, we shall
trim our sails, arrange our ropes, and pray that
the breeze may fill our sails. Such a procedure is

<pb id="p.147"/>

preferable to yielding ourselves to an empty torrent
of words, that the storm may sweep us where it will.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="24"/>But it requires no less careful study to maintain
than to acquire this facility. Theory once mastered
is not forgotten, and the pen loses but little of its
speed by disuse: but this promptitude and readiness
for action can be maintained by practice only. The
best form of exercise is to speak daily before an
audience of several persons, who should, as far as
possible, be selected from those whose judgement
and good opinion we value, since it is rare for anyone to be sufficiently critical of himself. It is even
better to speak alone than not at all.<milestone unit="section" n="25"/> There is yet
another method of exercising this faculty: it consists
in going over our subjects in their entirety in silent
thought, although we must all the time formulate
the words to ourselves: such practice is possible at
any moment or place that finds us unoccupied, and
is, in some respects, more useful than that which I
have just mentioned;<milestone unit="section" n="26"/> for we are more careful about
our composition than when we are actually speaking
and in momentary fear of interrupting the continuous
flow of our language. On the other hand, the first
method is more valuable for certain purposes, as it
gives strength to our voice, fluency to our tongue
and vigour to our gesture; and the latter, as I have
already remarked,<note>Ch. iii. 21.</note> in itself excites the orator and
spurs him on, as he waves his hand or stamps his
foot: he is, in fact, like the lion, that is said to lash
himself to fury with his tail. But we must study
always and everywhere.<milestone unit="section" n="27"/> For there is scarce a single
day in our lives that is so full of occupations that we
may not, at some moment or other, snatch a few
precious minutes, as Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">Or.</hi> 34.</note> records that Brutus was

<pb id="p.149"/>

wont to do, either for writing or reading or speaking;
Gaius Carbo,<note>A supporter of Tib. Graccllus, who went over to the
senatorial party and was consul 120 B.C. Committed suicide
in the following year. Cicero praises his eloquence and
industry; p. <hi rend="italics">Brut.</hi> 103&ndash;5,<hi rend="italics">de Or.</hi> I. &sect; 154.</note> for example, was in the habit of indulging in such exercises even in his tent.<milestone unit="section" n="28"/> I must also
mention the precept (which again has the approval
of Cicero<note>There is no trace of this.</note>) that we should never be careless about
our language. Whatever we say, under whatever
circumstances, should be perfect in its way. As regards writing, this is certainly never more necessary
than when we have frequently to speak extempore.
For it maintains the solidity of our speech and gives
depth to superficial facility. We may compare the
practice of husbandmen who cut away the uppermost
roots of their vines, which run close to the surface of
the soil, that the taproots may strike deeper and gain
in strength.<milestone unit="section" n="29"/> Indeed I am not sure that, if we practise both with care and assiduity, mutual profit will
not result, and writing will give us greater precision
of speech, while speaking will make us write with
greater facility. We must write, therefore, whenever possible; if we cannot write, we must meditate:
if both are out of the question, we must still speak in
such a manner that we shall not seem to be taken
unawares nor our client to be left in the lurch.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="30"/>It is, however, a common practice with those who
have many cases to plead to write out the most
necessary portions, more especially the beginnings of
their speeches, to cover the remainder of that which
they are able to prepare by careful premeditation
and to trust to improvisation in emergency, a practice regularly adopted by Cicero, as is clear from his
note-books. But the notes of other orators are also
in circulation; some have been discovered by
chance, just as they were jotted down previous to a
speech, while others have been edited in book form,

<pb id="p.151"/>

as in the case of the speeches delivered in the courts
by Servius Sulpicius, of whose works only three
speeches survive. These memoranda, however, of
which I am speaking are so carefully drawn up that
they seem to me to have been composed by himself
for the benefit of posterity.<milestone unit="section" n="31"/> But Cicero's notes were
originally intended merely to meet the requirements
of the moment, and were afterwards collected<note>Or perhaps <quote>abbreviated.</quote> Tiro was Cicero's friend,
freedman and secretary.</note> by
Tiro. In making this apology I do not mean to
imply that I disapprove of them, but merely wish
to make them more worthy of admiration. And in
this connexion I must state that I admit the use of
brief memoranda and note-books, which may even be
held in the hand and referred to from time to time.
<milestone unit="section" n="32"/>But I disapprove of the advice given by Laenas, that
we should set down in our note-books, duly tabulated under the appropriate headings, summaries of
what we propose to say, even in cases where we
have already written it out in full. For reliance on
such notes as these makes us careless in learning
what we have written and mutilates and deforms our
style. For my own part I think that we should
never write out anything which we do not intend to
commit to memory. For if we do, our thoughts will
run back to what we have elaborated in writing and
will not permit us to try the fortune of the moment.
<milestone unit="section" n="33"/>Consequently, the mind will waver in doubt between
the two alternatives, having forgotten what was
committed to writing and being unable to think of
anything fresh to say. However, as the topic of
memory will be discussed in the next book, I will
not introduce it here, as there are other points
which require to be dealt with first.</p></div1>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After acquiring the power of writing and thinking, as described in the preceding book, and also of
pleading extempore, if occasion demand, our next
task will be to ensure that appropriateness of speech,
which Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">De Or.</hi> III. x. 37.</note> shows to be the fourth department of
style, and which is, in my opinion, highly necessary.
<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>For since the ornaments of style are varied and
manifold and suited for different purposes, they will,
unless adapted to the matter and the persons concerned, not merely fail to give our style distinction,
but will even destroy its effect and produce a result
quite the reverse of that which our matter should
produce. For what profit is it that our words should
be Latin, significant and graceful, and be further
embellished with elaborate figures and rhythms,
unless all these qualities are in harmony with the
views to which we seek to lead the judge and mould
his opinions?<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> What use is it if we employ a lofty
tone in cases of trivial import, a slight and refined
style in cases of great moment, a cheerful tone when
our matter calls for sadness, a gentle tone when it
demands vehemence, threatening language when
supplication, and submissive when energy is required, or fierceness and violence when our theme is
one that asks for charm? Such incongruities are as
unbecoming as it is for men to wear necklaces and
pearls and flowing raiment which are the natural
adornments of women, or for women to robe

<pb id="p.157"/>

themselves in the garb of triumph, than which there can
be conceived no more majestic raiment.<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This topic
is discussed by Cicero in the third book of the <hi rend="italics">de
Oratore,</hi><note>III. lv. 210.</note> and, although he touches on it but lightly,
he really covers the whole subject when he says,
<hi rend="italics">One single style of oratory is not suited to every case, nor
to every audience, nor every speaker, nor every occasion.</hi>
And he says the same at scarcely greater length in
the <hi rend="italics">Orator.</hi><note>Ch. xxi. <hi rend="italics">sqq.</hi></note> But in the first of these works Lucius
Crassus, since he is speaking in the presence of men
distinguished alike for their learning and their eloquence, thinks it sufficient merely to indicate this topic
to his audience for their recognition;<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> while in the
latter work Cicero asserts that, as these facts are
familiar to Brutus, to whom that treatise is addressed,
they will be given briefer treatment, despite the fact
that the subject is a wide one and is discussed at
greater length by the philosophers. 1, on the other
hand, have undertaken the education of an orator,
and, consequently, am speaking not merely to those
that know, but also to learners; I shall, therefore,
have some claim to forgiveness if I discuss the topic
in greater detail.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>For this reason, it is of the first importance that
we should know what style is most suitable for conciliating, instructing or moving the judge, and what
effects we should aim at in different parts of our
speech. Thus we shall eschew antique, metaphorical and newly-coined words in our <hi rend="italics">exordium, statement of facts</hi> and <hi rend="italics">arguments,</hi> as we shall avoid flowing
periods woven with elaborate grace, when the case
has to be divided and distinguished under its various
heads, while, on the other hand, we shall not employ
mean or colloquial language, devoid of all artistic

<pb id="p.159"/>

structure, in the <hi rend="italics">peroration,</hi> nor, when the theme calls
for compassion, attempt to dry the tears of our audience with jests.<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For all ornament derives its effect
not from its own qualities so much as from the
circumstances in which it is applied, and the occasion
chosen for saying anything is at least as important a
consideration as what is actually said. But the whole
of this question of appropriate language turns on
something more than our choice of style, for it has
much in common with invention. For if words can
produce such an impression, how much greater must
that be which is created by the facts themselves.
But I have already laid down rules for the treatment
of the latter in various portions of this work.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Too much insistence cannot be laid upon the point
that no one can be said to speak appropriately who
has not considered not merely what it is expedient,
but also what it is becoming to say. I am well
aware that these two considerations generally go
hand in hand. For whatever is becoming is, as a
rule, useful, and there is nothing that does more to
conciliate the good-will of the judge than the
observance or to alienate it than the disregard of
these considerations.<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Sometimes, however, the two
are at variance. Now, whenever this occurs, expediency must yield to the demands of what is
becoming. Who is there who does not realise that
nothing would have contributed more to secure the
acquittal of Socrates than if he had employed the
ordinary forensic methods of defence and had
conciliated the minds of his judges by adopting a
submissive tone and had devoted his attention to
refuting the actual charge against him?<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> But such
a course would have been unworthy of his character,

<pb id="p.161"/>

and, therefore, he pleaded as one who would account
the penalty to which he might be sentenced as the
highest of honours. The wisest of men preferred to
sacrifice the remnant of his days rather than to cancel
all his past life. And since he was but ill understood by the men of his own day, he reserved his
case for the approval of posterity and at the cost of
a few last declining years achieved through all the
ages life everlasting.<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> And so although Lysias, who
was accounted the first orator of that time, offered
him a written defence, he refused to make use of
it, since, though he recognised its excellence, he
regarded it as unbecoming to himself. This instance alone shows that the end which the orator
must keep in view is not persuasion, but speaking
well, since there are occasions when to persuade
would be a blot upon his honour. The line adopted
by Socrates was useless to secure his acquittal, but
was of real service to him as a man; and that is by
far the greater consideration.<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> In drawing this distinction between what is expedient and what is
becoming, I have followed rather the usage of common speech than the strict law of truth; unless,
indeed, the elder Africanus<note>Falsely accused of having taken a bribe from King
Antiochus. See <hi rend="italics">Livy,</hi> XXXVIII. li. 16.</note> is to be regarded as
having failed to consult his true interests, when he
retired into exile sooner than wrangle over his own
innocence with a contemptible tribune of the people,
or unless it be alleged that Publius Rutilius<note>See <hi rend="italics">de Or.</hi> I. liii. 227 <hi rend="italics">sqq.</hi></note> was
ignorant of his true advantage both on the occasion
when he adopted a defence which may almost be
compared with that of Socrates, and when he preferred to remain in exile rather than return at Sulla's
bidding.<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> No, these great men regarded all those
trifles that the most abject natures regard as

<pb id="p.163"/>

advantageous, as being contemptible if weighed in the
balance with virtue, and for this reason they have
their reward in the deathless praise of all generations. Let not us, then, be so poor spirited as to
regard the acts, which we extol, as being inexpedient.
<milestone unit="section" n="14"/>However, it is but rarely that this distinction, such
as it is, is called into play. As I have said, the
expedient and the becoming will, as a rule, be
identical in every kind of case. Still, there are two
things which will be becoming to all men at all times
and in all places, namely, to act and speak as befits a
man of honour, and it will never at any time beseem
any man to speak or act dishonourably. On the
other hand, things of minor importance and occupying something like a middle position between the
two are generally of such a nature that they may be
conceded to some, but not to others, while it will
depend on the character of the speaker and the
circumstances of time, place and motive whether we
regard them as more or less excusable or reprehensible.<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> When, however, we are speaking of our
own affairs or those of others, we must distinguish
between the expedient and the becoming, while
recognising that the majority of the points which
we have to consider will fall under neither head.</p>
<p>In the first place, then, all kinds of boasting are a
mistake, above all, it is an error for an orator to praise
his own eloquence, and, further, not merely wearies,
but in the majority of cases disgusts the audience.
<milestone unit="section" n="16"/>For there is ever in the mind of man a certain
element of lofty and unbending pride that will not
brook superiority: and for this reason we take delight in raising the humble and submissive to their
feet, since such an act gives us a consciousness of our

<pb id="p.165"/>

superiority, and as soon as all sense of rivalry disappears, its place is taken by a feeling of humanity.
But the man who exalts himself beyond reason is
looked upon as depreciating and showing a contempt
for others and as making them seem small rather
than himself seem great.<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> As a result, those who are
beneath him feel a grudge against him (for those who
are unwilling to yield and yet have not the strength
to hold their own are always liable to this failing),
while his superiors laugh at him and the good
disapprove. Indeed, as a rule, you will find that
arrogance implies a false self-esteem, whereas those
who possess true merit find satisfaction enough in
the consciousness of possession.</p>
<p>Cicero has been severely censured in this connexion, although he was far more given to boasting
of his political achievements than of his eloquence,
at any rate, in his speeches.<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> And as a rule he had
some sound reason for his self-praise. For he was
either defending those who had assisted him to crush
the conspiracy of Catiline, or was replying to attacks
made upon him by those who envied his position;
attacks which he was so far unable to withstand
that he suffered exile as the penalty for having
saved his country. Consequently, we may regard
his frequent reference to the deeds accomplished
in his consulship as being due quite as much to the
necessities of defence as to the promptings of vainglory.<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> As regards his own eloquence, he never
made immoderate claims for it in his pleading, while
he always paid a handsome tribute to the eloquence
of the advocate, who opposed him. For example,
there are passages such as the following: <quote>If there
be aught of talent in me, and I am only too conscious

<pb id="p.167"/>

how little it is,</quote><note><hi rend="italics">Pro Arch.</hi> i. I.</note> and, <quote>In default of talent, I turned
to industry for aid.</quote><note><hi rend="italics">Pro Quint.</hi> i. 4.</note><milestone unit="section" n="20"/> Again, in his speech against
Caecilius on the selection of an accuser for Verres,
despite the fact that the question as to which was
the most capable pleader, was a factor of great
importance, he rather depreciated his opponent's
eloquence than exalted his own, and asserted that
he had done all in his power to make himself an
orator,<note><hi rend="italics">Div. in Caec.</hi> xii. 40.</note> though he knew he had not succeeded.<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> In
his letters to intimate friends, it is true, and occasionally in his dialogues, he tells the truth of his own
eloquence, though in the latter case he is careful
always to place the remarks in question in the
mouth of some other character. And yet I am not
sure that open boasting is not more tolerable, owing
to its sheer straightforwardness, than that perverted
form of self-praise, which makes the millionaire say
that he is not a poor man, the man of mark describe
himself as obscure, the powerful pose as weak,
and the eloquent as unskilled and even inarticulate.
<milestone unit="section" n="22"/>But the most ostentatious kind of boasting takes
the form of actual self-derision. Let us therefore
leave it to others to praise us. For it beseems us,
as Demosthenes says, to blush even when we are
praised by others. I do not mean to deny that
there are occasions when an orator may speak of
his own achievements, as Demosthenes himself does
in his defence of Ctesiphon.<note><hi rend="italics">De Cor.</hi> 128.</note> But on that occasion
he qualified his statements in such a way as to show
that he was compelled by necessity to do so, and to
throw the odium attaching to such a proceeding on
the man who had forced him to it.<milestone unit="section" n="23"/> Again, Cicero
often speaks of his suppression of the Catilinarian
conspiracy, but either attributes his success to the

<pb id="p.169"/>

courage shown by the senate or to the providence of
the immortal gods. If he puts forward stronger claims
to merit, it is generally when speaking against his
enemies and detractors; for he was bound to defend
his actions when they were denounced as discreditable.<milestone unit="section" n="24"/> One could only wish that he had shown
greater restraint in his poems, which those who love
him not are never weary of criticising. I refer to
passages such as:<note>From the poem on his consulship.</note>

<quote rend="blockquote">
<quote><l>Let arms before the peaceful toga yield,</l>
<l>Laurels to eloquence resign the field,</l></quote></quote>

or

<quote rend="blockquote">
<l><quote>O happy Rome, born in my consulship!</quote></l></quote>

together with that <quote>Jupiter, by whom he is
summoned to the assembly of the gods,</quote> and the
<quote>Minerva that taught him her accomplishments</quote>;
extravagances which he permitted himself in imitation of certain precedents in Greek literature.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="25"/>But while it is unseemly to make a boast of one's
eloquence, it is, however, at times permissible to
express confidence in it. Who, for instance, can
blame the following?<note><hi rend="italics">Phil.</hi> <milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>i. 2.</note> <quote>What, then, am I to think?
That I am held in contempt? I see nothing either
in my past life, or my position, or such poor talents
as I may possess, that Antony can afford to despise.</quote>
And a little later he speaks yet more openly:<milestone unit="section" n="26"/>
<quote>Or did he wish to challenge me to a contest of
eloquence? I could wish for nothing better. For
what ampler or richer theme could I hope to find
than to speak at once for myself and against
Antony?</quote></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="27"/>Another form of arrogance is displayed by those who
declare that they have come to a clear conviction of

<pb id="p.171"/>

the justice of their cause, which they would not
otherwise have undertaken. For the judges give
but a reluctant hearing to such as presume to
anticipate their verdict, and the orator cannot hope
that his opponents will regard his <hi rend="italics">ipse dixit</hi> with the
veneration accorded by the Pythagoreans to that of
their master. But this fault will vary in seriousness
according to the character of the orator who uses
such language.<milestone unit="section" n="28"/> For such assertions may to some
extent be justified by the age, rank, and authority
of the speaker. But scarcely any orator is possessed
of these advantages to such an extent as to exempt
him from the duty of tempering such assertions by
a certain show of modesty, a remark which also
applies to all passages in which the advocate draws
any of his arguments from his own person. What
could have been more presumptuous than if Cicero
had asserted that the fact that a man was the son
of a Roman knight should never be regarded as a
serious charge, in a case in which <hi rend="italics">he</hi> was appearing
for the defence? But he succeeded in giving this
very argument a favourable turn by associating his
own rank with that of the judges, and saying,<note><hi rend="italics">Pro Cael. ii.</hi> 4.</note>
<quote>The fact of a man being the son of a Roman knight
should never have been put forward as a charge by
the prosecution when these gentlemen were in the
jury-box and I was appearing for the defendant.</quote></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="29"/>An impudent, disorderly, or angry tone is always
unseemly, no matter who it be that assumes it; and
it becomes all the more reprehensible in proportion
to the age, rank, and experience of the speaker.
But we are familiar with the sight of certain brawling advocates who are restrained neither by respect
for the court nor by the recognised methods and

<pb id="p.173"/>

manners of pleading. The obvious inference from
this attitude of mind is that they are utterly reckless
both in undertaking cases and in pleading them.
<milestone unit="section" n="30"/>For a man's character is generally revealed and the
secrets of his heart are laid bare by his manner of speaking, and there is good ground for the Greek aphorism
that, <quote>as a man lives, so will he speak.</quote> The following vices are of a meaner type: grovelling flattery,
affected buffoonery, immodesty in dealing with things
or words which are unseemly or obscene, and disregard of authority on all and every occasion. They
are faults which, as a rule, are found in those who
are over-anxious either to please or amuse.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="31"/>Again, different kinds of eloquence suit different
speakers. For example, a full, haughty, bold and
florid style would be less becoming to an old man
than that restrained, mild and precise style to which
Cicero refers, when he says that his style is beginning
to grow grey-haired.<note><hi rend="italics">Brut.</hi> ii. 8.</note> It is the same with their style
as their clothes; purple and scarlet raiment goes ill
with grey hairs.<milestone unit="section" n="32"/> In the young, however, we can
endure a rich and even, perhaps, a risky style. On
the other hand, a dry, careful and compressed style
is unpleasing in the young as suggesting the affectation of severity, since even the authority of character
that goes with age is considered as premature in
young men. Soldiers are best suited by a simple
style.<milestone unit="section" n="33"/> Those, again, who make ostentatious profession, as some do, of being philosophers, would do
well to avoid most of the ornaments of oratory, more
especially those which consist in appeals to the
passions, which they regard as moral blemishes. So,
too, the employment of rare words and of rhythmical
structure are incongruous with their profession.<milestone unit="section" n="34"/> For

<pb id="p.175"/>

their beards and gloomy brows are ill-suited not
merely to luxuriance of style, such as we find in
Cicero's <quote>Rocks and solitudes answer to the voice,</quote><note><hi rend="italics">Pro Arch.</hi> viii. 19.</note>
but even to full-blooded passages as, <quote>For on you I
call, ye hills and groves of Alba; I call you to bear
me witness, and ye, too, fallen altars of the Albans,
that were once the peers and equals of the holy
places of Rome.</quote><note><hi rend="italics">Pro Mil.</hi> xxxi. 85.</note><milestone unit="section" n="35"/> But the public man, who is truly
wise and devotes himself not to idle disputations,
but to the administration of the state, from which
those who call themselves philosophers have withdrawn themselves afar, will gladly employ every
method that may contribute to the end which he
seeks to gain by his eloquence, although he will first
form a clear conception in his mind as to what aims
are honourable and what are not.<milestone unit="section" n="36"/> There is a form
of eloquence which is becoming in the greatest
men, but inadmissible in others. For example, the
methods of eloquence employed by commanders and
conquerors in their hour of triumph are to a great
extent to be regarded as in a class apart. The
comparison of the eloquence of Plompey and Cato
the younger, who slew himself in the civil war, will
illustrate my meaning. The former was extraordinarily eloquent in the description of his own
exploits, while the latter's powers were displayed
in debates in the senate.<milestone unit="section" n="37"/> Again, the same remark
will seem freedom of speech in one's mouth, madness
in another's, and arrogance in a third. We laugh at
the words used by Thersites<note><hi rend="italics">Il.</hi> ii. 225.</note> to Agamemnon; but
put them in the mouth of Diomede or some other
of his peers, and they will seem the expression of a
great spirit. <quote>Shall I regard you as consul,</quote> said
Lucius Crassus<note><hi rend="italics">De Or.</hi> iii. 1.</note> to Phililppus, <quote>when you refuse to

<pb id="p.177"/>

regard me as a senator?</quote> That was honourable
freedom of speech, and yet we should not tolerate
such words from everybody's lips.<milestone unit="section" n="38"/> One of the poets<note>Cat. 93.</note>
says that he does not care whether Caesar be white
or black. That is madness. But reverse the case.
Suppose that Caesar said it of the poet? That
would be arrogance. The tragic and comic poets
pay special attention to character, since they introduce a great number and variety of persons. Those
who wrote speeches<note><hi rend="italics">Cp. II.</hi> xv. 30; <milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>viii. 51.</note> for others paid a like attention
to these points, and so do the declaimers; for we do
not always speak as advocates, but frequently as
actual parties to the suit.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="39"/>But even in these cases in which we appear as
advocates, differences of character require careful
observation. For we introduce fictitious personages
and speak through other's lips, and we must therefore
allot the appropriate character to those to whom
we lend a voice. For example, Publius Clodius will
be represented in one way, Appius Caecus<note>Clodius, the unscrupulous enemy of Cicero. Appins
Caccus, his ancestor, the great senator, who secured the
rejection of the terms of Pyrrhus.</note> in
another, while Caecilius<note><hi rend="italics">See</hi> <hi rend="italics">Pro Cael.</hi> xvi.</note> makes the father in his
comedy speak in quite a different manner from the
father in the comedy of Terence.<milestone unit="section" n="40"/> What can be
more brutal than the words of Verres' lictor, <quote>To
see him you will pay so much</quote>?<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> to visit a relative in prison, <hi rend="italics">Verr.</hi> v. xlv. 118; <hi rend="italics">cp.
Quint.</hi> IX. iv. 71.</note> or braver than
those of the man from whom the scourge could
wring but one cry, <quote>I am a Roman citizen!</quote><note><hi rend="italics">Verr.</hi> V. lxii. 162.</note>
Again, read the words which Cicero places in the
mouth of Milo in his peroration: are they not
worthy of the man who to save the state had so
oft repressed a seditious citizen, and had triumphed
by his valour over the ambush that was laid for
him?<note><hi rend="italics">Cp.</hi> <milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>ii. 25; VI. v. 10.</note><milestone unit="section" n="41"/> Further, it is not merely true that the
variety required in impersonation will be in

<pb id="p.179"/>

proportion to the variety presented by the case, for
impersonation demands even greater variety, since
it involves the portrayal of the emotions of children,
women, nations, and even of voiceless things, all
of which require to be represented in character.
<milestone unit="section" n="42"/>The same points have to be observed with respect
to those for whom we plead: for our tone will vary
with the character of our client, according as he is
distinguished, or of humble position, popular or the
reverse, while we must also take into account the
differences in their principles and their past life.
As regards the orator himself, the qualities which
will most commend him are courtesy, kindliness,
moderation and benevolence. But, on the other
hand, the opposite of these qualities will sometimes
be becoming to a good man. He may hate the bad,
be moved to passion in the public interest, seek to
avenge crime and wrong, and, in fine, as I said at
the beginning,<note>See &sect; 14.</note> may follow the promptings of every
honourable emotion.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="43"/>The character of the speaker and of the person on
whose behalf he speaks are, however, not the only
points which it is important to take into account:
the character of those before whom we have to
speak calls for serious consideration. Their power
and rank will make no small difference; we shall
employ different methods according as we are speaking before the emperor, a magistrate, a senator, a
private citizen, or merely a free man, while a
different tone is demanded by trials in the public
courts, and in cases submitted to arbitration.<milestone unit="section" n="44"/> For
while a display of care and anxiety, and the employment of every device available for the amplification of our style are becoming when we are

<pb id="p.181"/>

pleading for a client accused on a capital charge,
it would be useless to employ the same methods in
cases and trials of minor importance, and the speaker
who, when speaking from his chair before an arbitrator
on some trivial question, should make an admission
like that made by Cicero, to the effect that it was
not merely his soul that was in a state of commotion, but that his whole body was convulsed with
shuddering,<note><hi rend="italics">Div. in Caec.</hi> xiii. 41</note> would meet with well-deserved ridicule.
<milestone unit="section" n="45"/>Again, who does not know what different styles of
eloquence are required when speaking before the
grave assembly of the senate and before the fickle
populace, since even when we are pleading before
single judges the same style will not be suitable
for use before one of weighty character and another
of a more frivolous disposition, while a learned judge
must not be addressed in the same tone that we
should employ before a soldier or a rustic, and our
style must at times be lowered and simplified, for
fear that he may be unable to take it in or to
understand it.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="46"/>Again, circumstances of time and place demand
special consideration. The occasion may be one
for sorrow or for rejoicing, the time at our disposal
may be ample or restricted, and the orator must
adapt himself to all these circumstances.<milestone unit="section" n="47"/> It, likewise, makes no small difference whether we are
speaking in public or in private, before a crowded
audience or in comparative seclusion, in another
city or our own, in the camp or in the forum: each
of these places will require its own style and peculiar
form of oratory, since even in other spheres of life
the same actions are not equally suited to the forum,
the senate-house, the Campus Martius, the theatre

<pb id="p.183"/>

or one's own house, and there is much that is not
in itself reprehensible, and may at times be absolutely necessary, which will be regarded as unseemly
if done in some place where it is not sanctioned by
custom.<milestone unit="section" n="48"/> I have already pointed out<note>VIII. iii. 11 <hi rend="italics">sqq.</hi></note> how much
more elegance and ornament is allowed by the
topics of demonstrative oratory, whose main object
is the delectation of the audience, than is permitted
by deliberative or forensic themes which are concerned with action and argument.</p>
<p>To this must be added the fact that certain
qualities, which are in themselves merits of a high
order, may be rendered unbecoming by the special
circumstances of the case.<milestone unit="section" n="49"/> For example, when a
man is accused on a capital charge, and, above all,
if he is defending himself before his conqueror or
his sovereign, it would be quite intolerable for him
to indulge in frequent metaphors, antique or newlycoined words, rhythms as far removed as possible
from the practice of every-day speech, rounded
periods, florid commonplaces and ornate reflexions.
Would not all these devices destroy the impression
of anxiety which should be created by a man in
such peril, and rob him of the succour of pity, on
which even the innocent are forced to rely?<milestone unit="section" n="50"/> Would
any man be moved by the sad plight of one who
revealed himself as a vainglorious boaster, and
ostentatiously flaunted the airs and graces of his
eloquence at a moment when his fate hung in
suspense? Would he not rather hate the man who,
despite his position as accused, hunted for fine
words, showed himself concerned for his reputation
as a clever speaker, and found time at such a
moment to display his eloquence?<milestone unit="section" n="51"/> I consider that

<pb id="p.185"/>

Marcus Caelius, in the speech in which he defended
himself against a charge of breach of the peace, showed
a wonderful grasp of these facts, when he said: <quote>I
trust that none of you gentlemen, or of all those
who have come to plead against me, will find offence
in my mien or insolence in my voice, or, though that
is a comparative trifle, any trace of arrogance in
my gesture.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="52"/> But there are some cases where the
success of the pleader depends on apology, entreaties
for mercy, or confession of error. Can sorrow be
expressed in epigram? Or will <hi rend="italics">enthymemes</hi><note>A form of syllogism. See V xiv. 1.</note> or
<hi rend="italics">epiphonemata</hi><note>See VIII. v. 11. <quote>An exclamation attached to the close
of a statement or a proof by way of climax.</quote></note> avail to win the judge's mercy? Will
not all embellishment of pure emotion merely impair its force and dispel compassion by such a display
of apparent unconcern?<milestone unit="section" n="53"/> Or, suppose that a father
has to speak of his son's death, or of some wrong
that is worse than death, will he, in making his statement of facts, seek to achieve that grace in exposition which is secured by purity and lucidity of
language, and content himself with setting forth
his case in due order with brevity and meaning?
Or will he count over the heads of his argument
upon his fingers, aim at niceties of division and
proposition, and speak without the least energy of
feeling as is usual in such portions of a speech?
<milestone unit="section" n="54"/>Whither will his grief have fled while he is thus
engaged? Where has the fountain of his tears been
stayed? How came this callous attention to the
rules of text-books to obtrude itself? Will he not
rather, from his opening words to the very last he
utters, maintain a continuous voice of lamentation
and a mien of unvaried woe, if he desires to transplant his grief to the hearts of his audience? For
if he once remits aught of his passion of grief, he

<pb id="p.187"/>

will never be able to recall it to the hearts of them
that hear him.<milestone unit="section" n="55"/> This is a point which declaimers,
above all, must be careful to bear in mind: I
mention this because I have no compunction in
referring to a branch of the art which was once also
my own, or in reverting to the consideration of the
youthful students such as once were in my charge:
the declaimer, I repeat, must bear this in mind,
since in the schools we often feign emotions that
affect us not as advocates, but as the actual sufferers.
<milestone unit="section" n="56"/>For example, we even imagine cases where persons,
either because of some overwhelming misfortune or
repentance for some sin, demand from the senate the
right to make an end of their lives;<note>VII. iv. 39. It is said that poison was provided by the
state of Massilia to serve the turn of such unhappy persons,
so soon as they could convince the local senate that their
proposed suicide was justifiable.</note> and in these
cases it is obviously unbecoming not merely to adopt
a chanting intonation,<note><hi rend="italics">Cp.</hi> I. viii. 2.</note> a fault which has also become
almost universal, or to use extravagant language,
but even to argue without an admixture of emotional
appeal, so managed as to be even more prominent
than the proof which is advanced. For the man
who can lay aside his grief for a moment while he
is pleading, seems capable even of laying it aside
altogether</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="57"/>I am not sure, however, that it is not in our
attitude towards our opponents that this care for
decorum, which we are now discussing, should be
most rigorously maintained. For there can be no
doubt, that in all accusations our first aim should
be to give the impression that it is only with the
greatest reluctance that we have consented to undertake the role of accuser. Consequently, I strongly
disapprove of such remarks as the following which
was made by Cassius Severus:<note><hi rend="italics">Cp.</hi> x. i. 22. In 9 B.C. he accused Nonius Asprenas, a
friend of Augustus, of the crime of poisoning. Asprenas
was defended by Pollio, and supported by Augustus during
his trial.</note> <quote>Thank Heaven, I
am still alive; and that I may find some savour in

<pb id="p.189"/>

life, I see Asprenas arraigned for his crimes.</quote> For,
after this, it is impossible to suppose that he had
just or necessary reasons for accusing Asprenas, and
we cannot help suspecting that his motive was sheer
delight in accusation.<milestone unit="section" n="58"/> But, beside this consideration, which applies to all cases, there is the further
point that certain cases demand special moderation.
Therefore, a man who demands the appointment of
a curator for his father's property, should express his
grief at his father's affliction; and, however grave be
the charges that a father may be going to bring
against his son, he should emphasize the painful
nature of the necessity that is imposed upon him.<note>The imagined case would be as follows. The father disinherits the son for an alleged offence. The son accuses the
father of madness and demands a curator, etc.</note>
And this he should do not merely in a few brief
words, but his emotion should colour his whole
speech, so that it may be felt not merely that he
is speaking, but that he is speaking the truth.
<milestone unit="section" n="59"/>Again, if a ward make allegations against his
guardian, the latter must never give way to such
anger that no trace is left of his former love or
of a certain reverent regard for the memory of his
opponent's father. I have already spoken, in the
seventh book, I think,<note>VII. iv. 24.</note> of the way in which a case
should be pleaded against a father who disinherits
his son, or a wife who brings a charge of illtreatment against her husband, while the fourth book,<note>IV. i. 46.</note>
in which I prescribed certain rules for the exordium,
contains my instructions as to when it is becoming
that the parties should speak themselves, and when
they should employ an advocate to speak for them.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="60"/>It will be readily admitted by everyone that
words may be becoming or offensive in themselves.
There is therefore a further point, which presents
the most serious difficulty, that requires notice in

<pb id="p.191"/>

this connexion: we must consider by what means
things which are naturally unseemly and which, had
we been given the choice, we should have preferred
not to say, may be uttered without indecorum.
<milestone unit="section" n="61"/>What at first sight can be more unpleasing and what
more revolting to the ears of men than a case in
which a son or his advocate has to speak against his
mother? And yet sometimes it is absolutely necessary, as, for example, in the case of Cluentius Habitus.<note>See <hi rend="italics">pro Clu.</hi> lxi. 169 <hi rend="italics">sqq.</hi> Sasia was Cluentius' mother</note>
But it is not always desirable to employ the method
adopted by Cicero against Sasia, not because he did not
make most admirable use of it, but because in such
cases it makes the greatest difference what the point
may be and what the manner in which the mother
seeks to injure her son.<milestone unit="section" n="62"/> In the case of Sasia she hat
openly sought to procure the destruction of her son,
and consequently vigorous methods were justified
against her. But there were two points, the only
points which remained to be dealt with, that were
handled by Cicero with consummate skill: in the
first place, he does not forget the reverence that is
due to parents, and in the second, after a thorough
investigation of the history of the crime, he makes
it clear that it was not merely right, but a positive
necessity that he should say what he proposed to
say against the mother.<milestone unit="section" n="63"/> And he placed this explantation in the forefront of his case,<note><hi rend="italics">pro Clu.</hi> vi. 17.</note> although it
had really nothing to do with the actual question at
issue; a fact which shows that his first consideration
in that difficult and complicated case was the consideration of what was becoming for him to say. He
therefore made the name of mother cast odium not
on the son, but on her who was the object of his
denunciations.<milestone unit="section" n="64"/> It is, however, always possible that a

<pb id="p.193"/>

mother may be her son's opponent in a case of less
serious import, or at any rate in a way which involves
less deadly hostility. Under such circumstances the
orator must adopt a gentler and more restrained
tone. For example, we may offer apology for the
line which we take, and thus lessen the odium
which we incur or even transfer it to a different
quarter, while if it be obvious that the son is deeply
grieved by the situation, it will be believed that he
is blameless in the matter and he will even become
an object of pity.<milestone unit="section" n="65"/> It will also be desirable to throw
the blame on others, so that it may be believed that
the mother's action was instigated by their malice,
and to assert that we will put up with every form of
provocation, and will say nothing harsh in reply, so
that, even although strong language may be absolutely necessary on our part, we may seem to be
driven to use it against our will. Nay, if some
charge has to be made against the mother, it will be
the advocate's task to make it seem that he does so
against the desire of the son and from a sense of
duty to his client. Thus both son and advocate will
win legitimate praise.<milestone unit="section" n="66"/> What I have said about
mothers will apply to either parent; for I have
known of litigation taking place between fathers
and sons as well, after the <hi rend="italics">emancipation</hi><note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> from the <hi rend="italics">patria potestas</hi> by a fictitious form of sale.</note> of the son.
And when other relationships are concerned, we
must take care to create the impression that we
have spoken with reluctance and under stress of
necessity and that we have been forbearing in our
language; but the importance of so doing will vary
according to the respect due to the persons concerned. The same courtesy should be observed in
speaking on behalf of freedmen against their patrons.

<pb id="p.195"/>

In fact, to sum up, it will never become us to plead
against such persons in a tone which we ourselves
should have resented in the mouth of men of like
condition.<milestone unit="section" n="67"/> The same respect is on occasion due to
persons of high rank, and it may be necessary to
offer justification for our freedom of speech to avoid
giving the impression that we have shown ourselves
insolent or ostentatious in our attack upon such
persons. Consequently Cicero, although he intended
to speak against Cotta<note><hi rend="italics">Cp.</hi> v. xiii. 20. P. Oppius, quaestor to M. Aurelius
Cotta in Bithynia, was charged by Cotta in a letter to the
Senate with misappropriation of supplies for his troops and
with an attempt on his life. The speech in which Cicero
defended Oppius (69 B.C.) is lost.</note> with the utmost vehemence,
and indeed the case of Publius Oppius was such that
he could not do otherwise, prefaced his attack by
pleading at some length the necessity imposed upon
him by his duty to his client.<milestone unit="section" n="68"/> Sometimes, again, it
will beseem us to spare or seem to spare our inferiors,
more especially if they be young. Cicero<note>See opening sections of <hi rend="italics">pro Caclio.</hi></note> gives an
example of such moderation in the way in which he
deals with Atratinus in his defence of Caelius: he
does not lash him like an enemy, but admonishes
him almost like a father. For Atratinus was of
noble birth and young, and the grievance which led
him to bring the accusation was not unreasonable.</p>
<p>But the task is comparatively easy in those cases
in which it is to the judge, or even, it may be, to our
audience that we have to indicate the reason for our
moderation. The real difficulty arises when we are
afraid of offending those against whom we are
speaking.<milestone unit="section" n="69"/> The difficulties of Cicero when defending
Murena were increased by the fact that he was
opposed by two persons of this character, namely
Marcus Cato and Servius Sulpicius. And yet in
what courteous language, after allowing Sulpicius all
the virtues, he refuses to admit that he has any idea
of the way to conduct a candidature for the

<pb id="p.197"/>

consulship.<note><hi rend="italics">Pro Muren.</hi> vii. 15.</note> What else was there in which a man of high
birth and a distinguished lawyer would sooner
admit his inferiority? With what skill he sets forth
his reasons for undertaking the defence of Murena,
when he says that he supported Sulpicius' candidature as opposed to that of Murena, but did not
regard that preference as reason why he should
support him in bringing a capital charge against his
rival!<milestone unit="section" n="70"/> And with what a light touch he deals with
Cato!<note><hi rend="italics">Pro Muren.</hi> xxix. 60.</note> He has the highest admiration for his
character and desires to show that the fact that in
certain respects it has become severe and callous is due
not to any personal fault, but to the influence of the
Stoic school of philosophy; in fact you would imagine
that they were engaged not in a forensic dispute,
but merely in some philosophical discussion.<milestone unit="section" n="71"/> This
is undoubtedly the right method, and the safest rule
in such cases will be to follow the practice of Cicero,
namely, that, when we desire to disparage a man
without giving offence, we should allow him to be
the possessor of all other virtues and point out that
it is only in this one respect that he falls short of
his high standard, while we should, if possible, add
some reason why this should be so, such, for example,
as his being too obstinate or credulous or quick to
anger, or acting under the influence of others.
<milestone unit="section" n="72"/>(For we may generally find a way out of such embarrassments by making it clear throughout our
whole speech that we not merely honour the object
of our criticism, but even regard him with affection.)
Further, we should have good cause for speaking thus
and must do so not merely with moderation, but also
give the impression that our action is due to the
necessities of the case.<milestone unit="section" n="73"/> A different situation arises,

<pb id="p.199"/>

but an easier one, when we have to praise the actions
of men who are otherwise disreputable or hateful to
ourselves: for it is only right that we should award
praise where it is deserved, whatever the character
of the person praised may be. Cicero spoke in
defence of Gabinius and Publius Vatinius, both of
them his deadly enemies and men against whom
he had previously spoken and even published his
speeches: but he justifies himself by declaring that
he does so not because he is anxious for his reputation as an accomplished speaker, but because he is
concerned for his honour.<milestone unit="section" n="74"/> He had a more difficult
task in his defence of Cluentius,<note>Ch. 17 <hi rend="italics">sqq.</hi></note> as it was necessary
for him to denounce Scamander's guilt, although he
had previously appeared for him. But he excuses
his action with the utmost grace, alleging the
importunity of those persons who had brought
Scamander to him, and his own youth at the time,
whereas it would have been a serious blot on his
reputation, especially in connexion with a case of the
most dubious character, if he had admitted that he
was one who was ready to undertake the defence of
guilty persons without asking awkward questions.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="75"/>On the other hand, when we are pleading before
a judge, who has special reasons for being hostile to
us or is for some personal motive ill-disposed to the
cause which we have undertaken, although it may
be difficult to persuade him, the method which we
should adopt in speaking is simple enough: we shall
pretend that our confidence in his integrity and in
the justice of our cause is such that we have no
fears. We must play upon his vanity by pointing out
that the less he indulges his own personal enmity
or interest, the greater will be the reputation for

<pb id="p.201"/>

conscientious rectitude that will accrue to him from
his verdict.<milestone unit="section" n="76"/> The same method may be adopted if
our case should chance to be sent back to the same
judges from whom we have appealed: but we may
further, if the case should permit, plead that we
were forced to take the action which we did or were
led to it by error or suspicion.<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> apologise for refusing to accept his original judgement.</note> The safest course
will therefore be to express our regret, apologise for
our fault and employ every means to induce the
judge to feel compunction for his anger.<milestone unit="section" n="77"/> It will
also sometimes happen that a judge may have to try
the same case on which he has previously given
judgment. In such circumstances the method
commonly adopted is to say that we should not
have ventured to dispute his sentence before any
other judge, since he alone would be justified in
revising it: but (and in this we must be guided by
the circumstances of the case) we may allege that
certain facts were not known on the previous
occasion or certain witnesses were unavailable, or,
though this must be advanced with the utmost
caution and only in the last resort, that our clients'
advocates were unequal to their task.<milestone unit="section" n="78"/> And even if
we have to plead a case afresh before different
judges, as may occur in a second trial of a claim to
freedom or in cases in the centumviral courts, which
are divided between two different panels, it will be
most seemly, if we have lost our case before the first
panel, to say nothing against the judges who tried
the case on that occasion. But this is a subject
with which I dealt at some length in the passage
where I discussed <hi rend="italics">proofs.</hi><note><milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>ii. 1, where, as here, it is indicated that different
portions of a case might be tried by two panels of <hi rend="italics">centumviri</hi>
sitting separately. The centumviral court dealt mainly with
cases of inheritance.</note></p>
<p>It may happen that we have to censure actions in
others, of which we have been guilty ourselves,

<pb id="p.203"/>

as, for example, when Tubero charges Ligarius
with having been in Africa.<milestone unit="section" n="79"/> Again, there have
been cases where persons condemned for bribery
have indicted others for the same offence with a
view to recovering their lost position:<note>See v. x. 108 note and with reference to <hi rend="italics">pro Clu.</hi> xxxvi.
98.</note> for this
the schools provide a parallel in the theme where
a luxurious youth accuses his father of the same
offence. I do not see how this can be done with
decorum unless we succeed in discovering some
difference between the two cases, such as character,
age, motives, circumstances of time and place or
intention.<milestone unit="section" n="80"/> Tubero, for example, alleges that he
was a young man at the time and went thither
in the company of his father, who had been sent by
the senate not to take part in the war, but to purchase corn, and further that he left the party as
soon as he could, whereas Ligarius clung to the
party and gave his support, not to Gnaeus Pompeius, who was engaged with Caesar in a struggle
for the supreme power, though both wished to
preserve the state, but to Juba and the Africans
who were the sworn enemies of Rome.<milestone unit="section" n="81"/> The easiest
course, however, is to denounce another's guilt, while
admitting our own in the same connexion. However, that is the part of an informer, not of a
pleader. But if there is no excuse available, penitence is our only hope. For the man who is
converted to the hatred of his own errors, may
perhaps be regarded as sufficiently reformed.<milestone unit="section" n="82"/> For
there are occasionally circumstances which from
the very nature of the case may make such an
attitude not unbecoming, as, for example, in the
case where the father disinherits a son born of a
harlot because that son has married a harlot, a case

<pb id="p.205"/>

which, although it forms a scholastic theme, might
actually arise in a court of law. There are a number
of pleas which the father may put forward with
becoming effect.<milestone unit="section" n="83"/> He will say that it is the prayer
of all parents that their sons should be better men
than themselves (for example, if a daughter also
had been born to him, the harlot, her mother,
would have wished her to be chaste), or that he
himself was in a humbler position (for a man in
such a position is permitted to marry a harlot),<note>The <hi rend="italics">lex lulex de maritandis ordiaibus</hi> (18 B.C. ) forbade
the marriage of a senator with a prostitute.</note> or
that he had no father to warn him; and further
that there was an additional reason against his son's
conduct, namely, that he should not revive the old
family scandal nor reproach his father with his
marriage and his mother with the hard necessity
of her former life, nor give a bad example to his
own children in their turn. We may also plausibly
suggest that there is some particularly shameful
feature in the character of the harlot married by
the son, which the father cannot under existing
circumstances tolerate. There are other possible
arguments which I pass by: for I am not now
engaged in declamation, but am merely pointing
out that there are occasions when the speaker may
turn his own drawbacks to good account.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="84"/>More arduous difficulties confront us when we have
to deal with a complaint of some shameful act such
as rape, more especially when this is of an unnatural kind. I do not refer to cases when the
victim himself is speaking. For what should he do
but groan and weep and curse his existence, so that
the judge will understand his grief rather than hear
it articulately expressed? But the victim's advocate
will have to exhibit similar emotions, since the

<pb id="p.207"/>

admission of such wrongs cause more shame to the
sufferer than the criminal.<milestone unit="section" n="85"/> In many cases it is
desirable to soften the harshness of our language
by the infusion of a more conciliatory tone, as, for
example, Cicero did in his speech<note>Now lost.</note> dealing with
the children of the proscribed. What fate could
be more cruel than that the children of men of
good birth and the descendants of distinguished
ancestors should be excluded from participation
in public life? For this reason that supreme artist
in playing on the minds of men admits that it is
hard, but asserts that the constitution is so essentially dependent on the laws of Sulla, that their
repeal would inevitably involve its destruction.
Thus he succeeded in creating the impression that
lie was doing something on behalf of those very
persons against whom he spoke.<note>Cicero argued that it was better that a few should suffer
unjustly than that the state should be upset by admitting
them to office. But he admitted that their case was hard
and suggested that it was better for them to live in an
orderly state than run the risks in which revolution would
involve them as well as others.</note><milestone unit="section" n="86"/> I have already<note><milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>iii. 28.</note>
pointed out, in dealing with the subject of jests,
how unseemly it is to take the position in life of
individuals as the target for our gibes, and also
have urged that we should refrain from insulting
whole classes, races or communities. But at times
our duty toward our client will force us to say
something on the general character of a whole
class of people, such as freedmen, soldiers, tax farmers or the like.<milestone unit="section" n="87"/> In all these cases the usual
remedy is to create the impression that it is with
reluctance that we introduce topics which must
give pain, while further we shall avoid attacking
everything, and even while using the language
of reproof with regard to the essential point of
attack, shall make up for our censure by praising
our victims in some other connexion.<milestone unit="section" n="88"/> For example,
if we charge soldiers with rapacity, we shall

<pb id="p.209"/>

qualify our statement by saying that the fact is not
surprising, as they think that they are entitled to
some special reward for the perils they have faced
and the wounds they have sustained. Or, if we
censure them for insolence, we shall add that this
quality is due to the fact that they are more
accustomed to war than to peace. In the case of
freedmen we should disparage their influence: but
we may also give them credit for the industry
which secured their emancipation.<milestone unit="section" n="89"/> With regard
to foreign nations, Cicero's practice varies. When
he intends to disparage the credibility of Greek
witnesses he admits their distinction in learning
and literature and professes his admiration for their
nation.<note><hi rend="italics">E.g. pro Flacco</hi> xxvi.</note> On the other hand, he has nothing but
contempt for the Sardinians<note>In a fragment of <hi rend="italics">pro Scauro.</hi></note> and attacks the Allobroges as the enemies of Rome.<note><hi rend="italics">pro Font.</hi> viii.</note> In all these cases
none of his remarks, at the time they were made,
were inconsistent with or adverse to the claims of
decorum.<milestone unit="section" n="90"/> If there be anything offensive in the
subject on which we have to speak, it may be
toned down by a studied moderation in our language; for example, we may describe a brutal character as being unduly severe, an unjust man as led
astray by prejudice, an obstinate man as unreasonably tenacious of his opinion. And there are a
large number of cases where we should attempt to
defeat our opponents by reasoning, which forms the
gentlest of all methods of attack.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="91"/>To these remarks I would add that all extravagance of any kind is indecorous, and consequently
statements which are in sufficient harmony with the
facts will none the less lose all their grace unless
they are modified by a certain restraint. It is hard

<pb id="p.211"/>

to give rules as to the exact method in which this
precept should be observed, but the problem will
easily be solved by following the dictates of our own
judgement, which will tell us what it is sufficient to
say and how much the ears of our audience will
tolerate. We cannot weigh or measure our words
by fixed standards: they are like foods, some of
which are more satisfying than others.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="92"/>I think I should also add a few brief words to the
effect that not only very different rhetorical virtues
have their special admirers, but that they are often
praised by the same persons. For instance, there is
one passage<note>See <hi rend="italics">Or.</hi> rxiii. 76. In this and the next passage Quintilian does not quote, but paraphrases.</note> in Cicero where he writes that the
best style is that which we think we can easily
acquire by imitation, but which we find is really
beyond our powers. But in another passage<note>See <hi rend="italics">Or.</hi> xxviii. 97.</note> he
says that his aim was not to speak in such a manner
that everyone should be confident that he could do
the same, but rather in a style that should be the
despair of all.<milestone unit="section" n="93"/> These two statements may seem to
be inconsistent, but as a matter of fact both alike
deserve the praise which they receive. The difference is due to the fact that cases differ in character.
Those of minor importance are admirably suited by
the simplicity and negligence of unaffected language, whereas cases of greater moment are best
suited by the grand style. Cicero is pre-eminent in
both. Now while eminence in one of these styles
may seem to the inexperienced to be within their
grasp, those who understand know that they are
capable of eminence in neither.</p>

<p>II. Some regard memory as being no more than
one of nature's gifts; and this view is no doubt true
to a great extent; but, like everything else, memory

<pb id="p.213"/>

may be improved by cultivation. And all the labour
of which I have so far spoken will be in vain unless
all the other departments be co-ordinated by the
animating principle of memory. For our whole
education depends upon memory, and we shall
receive instruction all in vain if all we hear slips
from us, while it is the power of memory alone
that brings before us all the store of precedents,
laws, rulings, sayings and facts which the orator
must possess in abundance and which he must
always hold ready for immediate use. Indeed
it is not without good reason that memory has
been called the treasure-house of eloquence.<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But
pleaders need not only to be able to retain a number
of facts in their minds, but also to be quick to take
them in; it is not enough to learn what you have
written by dint of repeated reading; it is just as
necessary to follow the order both of matter and
words when you have merely thought out what you
are going to say, while you must also remember
what has been said by your opponents, and must
not be content merely with refuting their arguments
in the order in which they were advanced, but must
be in a position to deal with each in its appropriate
place.<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Nay, even extempore eloquence, in my
opinion, depends on no mental activity so much
as memory. For while we are saying one thing, we
must be considering something else that we are
going to say: consequently, since the mind is always
looking ahead, it is continually in search of something which is more remote: on the other hand,
whatever it discovers, it deposits by some mysterious
process in the safe-keeping of memory, which acts
as a transmitting agent and hands on to the delivery

<pb id="p.215"/>

what it has received from the imagination.<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> I do
not conceive, however, that I need dwell upon the
question of the precise function of memory, although
many hold the view that certain impressions are
made upon the mind, analogous to those which a
signet-ring makes on wax. Nor, again, shall I be so
credulous, in view of the fact that the retentiveness
or slowness of the memory depends upon our
physical condition, as to venture to allot a special
art to memory.<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> My inclination is rather to marvel
at its powers of reproducing and presenting a
number of remote facts after so long an interval,
and, what is more, of so doing not merely when we
seek for such facts, but even at times of its own
accord, and not only in our waking moments, but
even when we are sunk in sleep.<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And my wonder is
increased by the fact that even beasts, which seem to
be devoid of reason, yet remember and recognise
things, and will return to their old home, however far
they have been taken from it. Again, is it not an
extraordinary inconsistency that we forget recent and
remember distant events, that we cannot recall what
happened yesterday and yet retain a vivid impression
of the acts of our childhood?<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> And what, again, shall
we say of the fact that the things we search for
frequently refuse to present themselves and then
occur to us by chance, or that memory does not
always remain with us, but will even sometimes
return to us after it has been lost? But we should
never have realised the fullness of its power nor its
supernatural capacities, but for the fact that it is
memory which has brought oratory to its present
position of glory.<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> For it provides the orator not
merely with the order of his thoughts, but even of

<pb id="p.217"/>

his words, nor is its power limited to stringing
merely a few words together; its capacity for endurance is inexhaustible, and even in the longest
pleadings the patience of the audience flags long
before the memory of the speaker.<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> This fact may
even be advanced as an argument that there must
be some art of memory and that the natural gift can
be helped by reason, since training enables us to
do things which we cannot do before we have had
any training or practice. On the other hand, I find
that Plato<note><hi rend="italics">Phaedr.</hi> 275 A.</note> asserts that the use of written characters
is a hindrance to memory, on the ground, that is, that
once we have committed a thing to writing, we
cease to guard it in our memory and lose it out of
sheer carelessness.<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> And there can be no doubt that
concentration of mind is of the utmost importance in
this connexion; it is, in fact, like the eyesight, which
turns to, and not away from, the objects which it
contemplates. Thus it results that after writing
for several days with a view to acquiring by heart
what we have written, we find that our mental effort
has of itself imprinted it on our memory.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>The first person to discover an art of memory is
said to have been Simonides,<note>See x. i. 64.</note> of whom the following
well-known story is told. He had written an ode
of the kind usually composed in honour of victorious
athletes, to celebrate the achievement of one who
had gained the crown for boxing. Part of the sum
for which he had contracted was refused him on
the ground that, following the common practice of
poets, he had introduced a digression in praise of
Castor and Pollux, and he was told that, in view
of what he had done, he had best ask for the rest
of the sum due from those whose deeds he had

<pb id="p.219"/>

extolled. And according to the story they paid
their debt.<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> For when a great banquet was given
in honour of the boxer's success, Simonides was
summoned forth from the feast, to which he had
been invited, by a message to the effect that two
youths who had ridden to the door urgently desired
his presence. He found no trace of them, but what
followed proved to him that the gods had shown
their gratitude.<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> For he had scarcely crossed the
threshold on his way out, when the banqueting hall
fell in upon the heads of the guests and wrought
such havoc among them that the relatives of the
dead who came to seek the bodies for burial were
unable to distinguish not merely the faces but even
the limbs of the dead. Then it is said, Simonides,
who remembered the order in which the guests had
been sitting, succeeded in restoring to each man his
own dead.<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> There is, however, great disagreement
among our authorities as to whether this ode was
written in honour of Glaucus of Carystus, Leocrates,
Agatharcus or Scopas, and whether the house was
at Pharsalus, as Simonides himself seems to indicate
in a certain passage, and as is recorded by Apollodorus, Eratosthenes, Euphorion and Eurypylus of
Larissa, or at Crannon, as is stated by Apollas
Callimachus, who is followed by Cicero,<note>Cic. <hi rend="italics">de Or.</hi> II. lxxxvi. 352.</note> to whom
the wide circulation of this story is due.<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> It is
agreed that Scopas, a Thessalian noble, perished at
this banquet, and it is also said that his sister's son
perished with him, while it is thought that a number
of descendants of an elder Scopas met their death
at the same time.<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> For my own part, however, I
regard the portion of the story which concerns
Castor and Pollux as being purely fictitious, since

<pb id="p.221"/>

the poet himself has nowhere mentioned the occurrence; and he would scarcely have kept silence on
an affair which was so much to his credit.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="17"/>This achievement of Simonides appears to have
given rise to the observation that it is an assistance
to the memory if localities are sharply impressed
upon the mind, a view the truth of which everyone
may realise by practical experiment. For when we
return to a place after considerable absence, we not
merely recognise the place itself, but remember
things that we did there, and recall the persons
whom we met and even the unuttered thoughts
which passed through our minds when we were
there before.<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> Thus, as in most cases, art originates in experiment. Some place is chosen of the
largest possible extent and characterised by the
utmost possible variety, such as a spacious house
divided into a number of rooms. Everything of
note therein is carefully committed to the memory,
in order that the thought may be enabled to run
through all the details without let or hindrance.
And undoubtedly the first task is to secure that
there shall be no delay in finding any single detail,
since an idea which is to lead by association to
some other idea requires to be fixed in the mind
with more than ordinary certitude.<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> The next step
is to distinguish something which has been written
down or merely thought of by some particular
symbol which will serve to jog the memory; this
symbol may have reference to the subject as a
whole, it may, for example, be drawn from navigation, warfare, etc., or it may, on the other hand,
be found in some particular word. (For even in
cases of forgetfulness one single word will serve to

<pb id="p.223"/>

restore the memory.) However, let us suppose that
the symbol is drawn from navigation, as, for instance,
an anchor; or from warfare, as, for example, some
weapon. These symbols are then arranged as follows.<milestone unit="section" n="20"/>
The first though is placed, as it were, in the forecourt;
the second, let us say, in the living-room; the remainder are placed in due order all round the <hi rend="italics">impluvium</hi><note>The <hi rend="italics">impluvium</hi> was the light-well in the centre of the
<hi rend="italics">atrium</hi> with a cistern beneath it to catch the rainwater from
the roof, which sloped inwards.</note> and entrusted not merely to bedrooms and
parlours, but even to the care of statues and the
like. This done, as soon as the memory of the facts
requires to be revived, all these places are visited in
turn and the various deposits are demanded from
their custodians, as the sight of each recalls the
respective details. Consequently, however large the
number of these which it is required to remember,
all are linked one to the other like dancers
hand in hand, and there can be no mistake since
they join what precedes to what follows, no trouble
being required except the preliminary labour of
committing the various points to memory.<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> What
I have spoken of as being done in a house, can
equally well be done in connexion with public
buildings, a long journey, the ramparts of a city,
or even pictures. Or we may even imagine such
places to ourselves. We require, therefore,
places, real or imaginary, and images or symbols,
which we must, of course, invent for ourselves. By
images I mean the words by which we distinguish
the things which we have to learn by heart: in
fact, as Cicero says, we use <quote>places like wax tablets
and symbols in lieu of letters.</quote><note><hi rend="italics">De Or.</hi> II. lxxxvi. 354.</note><milestone unit="section" n="22"/> It will be best to
give his words <hi rend="italics">verbatim:</hi><note><hi rend="italics">De Or.</hi> II. lxxxvii. 358.</note> <quote>We must for this purpose employ a number of remarkable places, clearly
envisaged and separated by short intervals: the

<pb id="p.225"/>

images which we use must be active, sharply-cut and
distinctive, such as may occur to the mind and strike
it with rapidity.</quote> This makes me wonder all the
more, how Metrodorus<note>Of Scepsis, the favourite of Mithradates Eupator. See
<hi rend="italics">de Or.</hi> II. lxxxviii. 360. He used the signs of the Zodiac as
aids to the memory, subdividing each into thirty compartments. Quintilian wonders on what principle he can have
made such a division, necessarily purely artificial in nature.</note> should have found three
hundred and sixty different localities in the twelve
signs of the Zodiac through which the sun passes.
It was doubtless due to the vanity and boastfulness
of a man who was inclined to vaunt his memory as
being the result of art rather than of natural gifts.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="23"/>I am far from denying that those devices may be
useful for certain purposes, as, for example, if we
have to reproduce a number of names in the order
in which we heard them. For those who use such
aids place the things which have to be remembered
in localities which they have previously fixed in the
memory; they put a table, for instance, in the forecourt, a platform in the hall and so on with the
rest, and then, when they retrace their steps, they
find the objects where they had placed them.<milestone unit="section" n="24"/> Such
a practice may perhaps have been of use to those
who, after an auction, have succeeded in stating
what object they had sold to each buyer, their statements being checked by the books of the money takers; a feat which it is alleged was performed by
Hortensius. It will, however, be of less service in
learning the various parts of a set speech. For
thoughts do not call up the same images as material
things, and a symbol requires to be specially invented
for them, although even here a particular place may
serve to remind us, as, for example, of some conversation that may have been held there. But how
can such a method grasp a whole series of connected words?<milestone unit="section" n="25"/> I pass by the fact that there are
certain things which it is impossible to represent by

<pb id="p.227"/>

symbols, as, for example, conjunctions. We may, it
is true, like shorthand writers, have definite symbols
for everything, and may select an infinite number
of places to recall all the words contained in the
five books of the second pleading against Verres,
and we may even remember them all as if they
were deposits placed in safe-keeping. But will not
the flow of our speech inevitably be impeded by the
double task imposed upon our memory?<milestone unit="section" n="26"/> For how
can our words be expected to flow in connected
speech, if we have to look back at separate symbols
for each individual word? Therefore the experts
mentioned by Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">de Or.</hi> II. lxxxvii. 360. Charmadas or Charmides, an
elder contemporary of Cicero.</note> as having trained their
memory by methods of this kind, namely Charmadas, and Metrodorus of Scepsis, to whom I have
just referred, may keep their systems for their own
use. My precepts on the subject shall be of a
simpler kind.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="27"/>If a speech of some length has to be committed
to memory, it will be well to learn it piecemeal,
since there is nothing so bad for the memory as being
overburdened. But the sections into which we divide
it for this purpose should not be very short: otherwise
they will be too many in number, and will break up
and distract the memory. I am not, however, prepared to recommend any definite length; it will depend on the natural limits of the passage concerned,
unless, indeed, it be so long as itself to require subdivision.<milestone unit="section" n="28"/> But some limits must be fixed to enable us,
by dint of frequent and continuous practice, to connect
the words in their proper order, which is a task of no
small difficulty, and subsequently to unite the various
sections into a whole when we go over them in
order. If certain portions prove especially difficult to

<pb id="p.229"/>

remember, it will be found advantageous to indicate
them by certain marks, the remembrance of which
will refresh and stimulate the memory.<milestone unit="section" n="29"/> For there can
be but few whose memory is so barren that they will
fail to recognise the symbols with which they have
marked different passages. But if anyone is slow to
recognise his own signs, he should employ the following additional remedy, which, though drawn from the
mnemonic system discussed above,<note>Sects. 18&ndash;23.</note> is not without its
uses: he will adapt his symbols to the nature of the
thoughts which tend to slip from his memory, using
an anchor, as I suggested above, if he has to speak
of a ship, or a spear, if he has to speak of a battle.
<milestone unit="section" n="30"/>For symbols are highly efficacious, and one idea
suggests another: for example, if we change a ring
from one finger to another or tie a thread round it,
it will serve to remind us of our reason for so doing.
Specially effective are those devices which lead the
memory from one thing to another similar thing which
we have got to remember; for example, in the case of
names, if we desire to remember the name Fabius,
we should think of the famous Cunctator, whom we
are certain not to forget, or of some friend bearing
the same name.<milestone unit="section" n="31"/> This is specially easy with names
such as Aper, Ursus, Naso, or Crispus,<note>Boar, Bear, Long-nose, and Curly respectively.</note> since in
these cases we can fix their origin in our memory.
Origin again may assist us to a better remembrance of derivative names, such as Cicero, Verrius,
or Aurelius.<note>Cicero, a sower of chickpea (<hi rend="italics">cicer</hi>), according to Pliny
(xviii. 10). Aurelius = Auselius, child of the sun (<hi rend="italics">a sole</hi>)
according to Festus. Verrius unknown.</note> However, I will say no more on this
point.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="32"/>There is one thing which will be of assistance to
everyone, namely, to learn a passage by heart from
the same tablets on which he has committed it to
writing. For he will have certain tracks to guide

<pb id="p.231"/>

him in his pursuit of memory, and the mind's eye
will be fixed not merely on the pages on which the
words were written, but on individual lines, and at
times he will speak as though he were reading aloud.
Further, if the writing should be interrupted by
some erasure, addition or alteration, there are certain
symbols available, the sight of which will prevent us
from wandering from the track.<milestone unit="section" n="33"/> This device bears
some resemblance to the mnemonic system which
I mentioned above, but if my experience is worth
anything, is at once more expeditious and more
effective. The question has been raised as to
whether we should learn by heart in silence; it
would be best to do so, save for the fact that under
such circumstances the mind is apt to become indolent, with the result that other thoughts break in.
For this reason the mind should be kept alert by the
sound of the voice, so that the memory may derive
assistance from the double effort of speaking and
listening. But our voice should be subdued, rising
scarcely above a murmur.<milestone unit="section" n="34"/> On the other hand, if we
attempt to learn by heart from another reading
aloud, we shall find that there is both loss and gain;
on the one hand, the process of learning will be
slower, because the perception of the eye is quicker
than that of the ear, while, on the other hand, when
we have heard a passage once or twice, we shall be
in a position to test our memory and match it against
the voice of the reader. It is, indeed, important for
other reasons to test ourselves thus from time to time,
since continuous reading has this drawback, that it
passes over the passages which we find hard to remember at the same speed as those which we find less
difficulty in retaining.<milestone unit="section" n="35"/> By testing ourselves to see

<pb id="p.233"/>

whether we remember a passage, we develop greater
concentration without waste of time over the repetition of passages which we already know by heart.
Thus, only those passages which tend to slip from
the memory are repeated with a view to fixing them
in the mind by frequent rehearsal, although as a rule
the mere fact that they once slipped our memory
makes us ultimately remember them with special
accuracy. Both learning by heart and writing have
this feature in common: namely, that good health,
sound digestion, and freedom from other preoccupations of mind contribute largely to the success of
both.<milestone unit="section" n="36"/> But for the purpose of getting a real grasp
of what we have written under the various heads,
division and artistic structure will be found of great
value, while, with the exception of practice, which
is the most powerful aid of all, they are practically
the only means of ensuring an accurate remembrance
of what we have merely thought out. For correct
division will be an absolute safeguard against error in
the order of our speech,<milestone unit="section" n="37"/> since there are certain points
not merely in the distribution of the various questions
in our speech, but also in their development (provided we speak as we ought), which naturally come
first, second, and third, and so on, while the connexion
will be so perfect that nothing can be omitted or
inserted without the fact of the omission or insertion being obvious.<milestone unit="section" n="38"/> We are told that Scaevola,
after a game of draughts in which he made the first
move and was defeated, went over the whole game
again in his mind on his way into the country, and
on recalling the move which had cost him the game,
returned to tell the man with whom he had been
playing, and the latter acknowledged that he was

<pb id="p.235"/>

right. Is order, then, I ask you, to be accounted of
less importance in a speech, in which it depends
entirely on ourselves, whereas in a game our opponent
has an equal share in its development?<milestone unit="section" n="39"/> Again, if
our structure be what it should, the artistic sequence will serve to guide the memory. For just
as it is easier to learn verse than prose, so it is
easier to learn prose when it is artistically constructed than when it has no such organisation. If
these points receive attention, it will be possible to
repeat <hi rend="italics">verbatim</hi> even such psssages as gave the impression of being delivered extempore. My own
memory is of a very ordinary kind, but I found that
I could do this with success on occasions when the
interruption of a declamation by persons who had a
claim to such a courtesy forced me to repeat part of
what I had said. There are persons still living, who
were then present to witness if I lie.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="40"/>However, if anyone asks me what is the one
supreme method of memory, I shall reply, practice
and industry. The most important thing is to learn
much by heart and to think much, and, if possible,
to do this daily, since there is nothing that is more
increased by practice or impaired by neglect than
memory.<milestone unit="section" n="41"/> Therefore boys should, as I have already
urged,<note>See. i. 36; II. vii. I <hi rend="italics">sqq.</hi></note> learn as much as possible by heart at the
earliest stage, while all who, whatever their age,
desire to cultivate the power of memory, should
endeavour to swallow the initial tedium of reading
and re-reading what they have written or read, a
process which we may compare to chewing the cud.
This task will be rendered less tiresome if we begin
by confining ourselves to learning only a little at a
time, in amounts not sufficient to create disgust: we

<pb id="p.237"/>

may then proceed to increase the amount by a line a
day, an addition which will not sensibly increase the
labour of learning, until at last the amount we can
attack will know no limits. We should begin with
poetry and then go on to oratory, while finally we
may attempt passages still freer in rhythm and less
akin to ordinary speech, such, for example, as
passages from legal writers.<milestone unit="section" n="42"/> For passages intended
as an exercise should be somewhat difficult in character if they are to make it easy to achieve the end
for which the exercise is designed; just as athletes
train the muscles of their hands by carrying weights of
lead, although in the actual contests their hands will
be empty and free. Further, I must not omit the
fact, the truth of which our daily practice will teach
us, that in the case of the slower type of mind the
memory of recent events is far from being exact.<milestone unit="section" n="43"/> It is
a curious fact, of which the reason is not obvious, that
the interval of a single night will greatly increase
the strength of the memory, whether this be due to
the fact that it has rested from the labour, the
fatigue of which constituted the obstacle to success,
or whether it be that the power of recollection,
which is the most important element of memory,
undergoes a process of ripening and maturing
during the time which intervenes. Whatever the
cause, things which could not be recalled on the
spot are easily co-ordinated the next day, and time
itself, which is generally accounted one of the causes
of forgetfulness, actually serves to strengthen the
memory.<milestone unit="section" n="44"/> On the other hand, the abnormally rapid
memory fails as a rule to last and takes its leave as
though, its immediate task accomplished, it had no
further duties to perform. And indeed there is

<pb id="p.239"/>

nothing surprising in the fact that things which
have been implanted in the memory for some time
should have a greater tendency to stay there.</p>
<p>The difference between the powers of one mind
and another, to which I have just referred, gives rise
to the question whether those who are intending to
speak should learn their speeches <hi rend="italics">verbatim</hi> or whether
it is sufficient to get a good grasp of the essence and
the order of what they have got to say. To this
problem no answer is possible that will be of universal application.<milestone unit="section" n="45"/> Give me a reliable memory and
plenty of time, and I should prefer not to permit
a single syllable to escape me: otherwise writing
would be superfluous. It is specially important to
train the young to such precision, and the memory
should be continually practised to this end, that we
may never learn to become indulgent to its failure.
For this reason I regard it as a mistake to permit the
student to be prompted or to consult his manuscript,
since such practices merely encourage carelessness,
and no one will ever realise that he has not got his
theme by heart, if he has no fear of forgetting it.
<milestone unit="section" n="46"/>It is this which causes interruptions in the flow of
speech and makes the orator's language halting and
jerky, while he seems as though he were learning
what he says by heart and loses all the grace that a
well-written speech can give, simply by the fact that
he makes it obvious that he has written it. On the
other hand, a good memory will give us credit for
quickness of wit as well, by creating the impression
that our words have not been prepared in the seclusion of the study, but are due to the inspiration
of the moment, an impression which is of the utmost
assistance both to the orator and to his cause.<milestone unit="section" n="47"/> For

<pb id="p.241"/>

the judge admires those words more and fears them
less which he does not suspect of having been
specially prepared beforehand to outwit him.
Further, we must make it one of our chief aims
in pleading to deliver passages which have been
constructed with the utmost care, in such manner
as to make it appear that they are but casually strung
together, and to suggest that we are thinking out
and hesitating over words which we have, as a
matter of fact, carefully prepared in advance.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="48"/>It should now be clear to all what is the best
course to adopt for the cultivation of memory. If,
however, our memory be naturally somewhat dull
or time presses, it will be useless to tie ourselves
down rigidly to every word, since if we forget any
one of them, the result may be awkward hesitation or even a tongue-tied silence. It is, therefore,
far safer to secure a good grasp of the facts themselves and to leave ourselves free to speak as we
will.<milestone unit="section" n="49"/> For the loss of even a single word that we
have chosen is always a matter for regret, and it is
hard to supply a substitute when we are searching
for the word that we had written. But even this
is no remedy for a weak memory, except for those
who have acquired the art of speaking extempore.
But if both memory and this gift be lacking, I
should advise the would-be orator to abandon the
toil of pleading altogether and, if he has any literary
capacity, to betake himself by preference to writing.
But such a misfortune will be of but rare occurrence.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="50"/>For the rest there are many historical examples
of the power to which memory may be developed by
natural aptitude and application. Themistocles is
said to have spoken excellently in Persian after a

<pb id="p.243"/>

year's study; Mithridates is recorded to have known
twenty-two languages, that being the number of
the different nations included in his empire;<note>King of Pontus.</note> Crassus,
surnamed the Rich,<note>Consul, 131 B.C. Commanded in the war against Aristonicus of Pergamum, was defeated and killed.</note> when commanding in Asia had
such a complete mastery of five different Greek
dialects, that he would give judgement in the dialect
employed by the plaintiff in putting forward his
suit; Cyrus is believed to have known the name
of every soldier in his army,<milestone unit="section" n="51"/> while Theodectes<note>Rhetorician of first half of fourth century B.C..</note> is
actually said to have been able to repeat any number
of verses after only a single hearing. I remember
that it used to be alleged that there were persons
still living who could do the same, though I never
had the good fortune to be present at such a performance. Still, we shall do well to have faith in
such miracles, if only that he who believes may also
hope to achieve the like.</p>

<p>III. <hi rend="italics">Delivery</hi> is often styled <hi rend="italics">action.</hi> But the first
name is derived from the voice, the second from the
gesture. For Cicero in one passage<note><hi rend="italics">de Or.</hi> III. lix. 222.</note> speaks of <hi rend="italics">action</hi>
as being <hi rend="italics">a form of speech,</hi> and in another<note><hi rend="italics">Or.</hi> xvii. 55.</note> as being
a <hi rend="italics">kind of physical eloquence.</hi> None the less, he
divides action into two elements, which are the
same as the elements of delivery, namely, voice and
movement. Therefore, it matters not which term
we employ.<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But the thing itself has an extraordinarily powerful effect in oratory. For the
nature of the speech that we have composed within
our minds is not so important as the manner in
which we produce it, since the emotion of each
member of our audience will depend on the impression made upon his hearing. Consequently, no
proof, at least if it be one devised by the orator
himself, will ever be so secure as not to lose its force

<pb id="p.245"/>

if the speaker fails to produce it in tones that drive
it home. All emotional appeals will inevitably fall
flat, unless they are given the fire that voice, look,
and the whole carriage of the body can give them.
<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>For when we have done all this, we may still
account ourselves only too fortunate if we have
succeeded in communicating the fire of our passion
to the judge: consequently, we can have no hope
of moving him if we speak with languor and indifference, nor of preventing him from yielding to the
narcotic influence of our own yawns.<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> A proof of this
is given by actors in the theatre. For they add so
much to the charm even of the greatest poets, that
the verse moves us far more when heard than when
read, while they succeed in securing a hearing even
for the most worthless authors, with the result
that they repeatedly win a welcome on the
stage that is denied them in the library.<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Now
if delivery can count for so much in themes
which we know to be fictitious and devoid of reality,
as to arouse our anger, our tears or our anxiety, how
much greater must its effect be when we actually
believe what we hear? For my own part I would
not hesitate to assert that a mediocre speech supported by all the power of delivery will be more
impressive than the best speech unaccompanied by
such power.<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> It was for this reason that Demosthenes, when asked what was the most important
thing in oratory, gave the palm to delivery and
assigned it second and third place as well, until
his questioner ceased to trouble him. We are
therefore almost justified in concluding that he
regarded it not merely as the first, but as the only
virtue of oratory.<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> This explains why he studied

<pb id="p.247"/>

under the instruction of the actor Andronicus with
such diligence and success as thoroughly to justify
the remark made by Aeschines to the Rhodians when
they expressed their admiration of the speech of
Demosthenes on behalf of Ctesiphon, <quote>What would
you have said if you had heard him yourselves?</quote><note><hi rend="italics">de Or.</hi> III. lvi. 213. Aeschincs in exile at Rhodes first
recited his own speech against Ctesiphon, and then by special
request read Demosthenes' reply, the famous <hi rend="italics">De Corona.</hi></note>
Cicero likewise regards <hi rend="italics">action</hi> as the supreme element
of oratory.<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He records that Gnaeus Lentulus acquired a greater reputation by his delivery than
by his actual eloquence, and that Gains Gracchus
by the same means stirred the whole Roman people
to tears when he bewailed his brother's death,
while Antonius and Crassus produced a great impression by their command of this quality, though
the greatest of all was that produced by Quintus
Hortensius.<note><hi rend="italics">Brut.</hi> lxvi., lxxxix., xxxviii., xliii., lxxxviii.</note> This statement is strongly supported
by the fact that the latter's writings fall so far
short of the reputation which for so long secured
him the first place among orators, then for a
while caused him to be regarded as Cicero's rival,
and finally, for the remainder of his life assigned
him a position second only to that of Cicero, that
his speaking must clearly have possessed some
charm which we fail to find when we read him.
<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>And, indeed, since words in themselves count for
much and the voice adds a force of its own to the
matter of which it speaks, while gesture and motion
are full of significance, we may be sure of finding
something like perfection when all these qualities
are combined.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>There are some, however, who consider that delivery which owes nothing to art and everything to
natural impulse is more forcible, and in fact the only
form of delivery which is worthy of a manly speaker.

<pb id="p.249"/>

But these persons are as a rule identical, either with
those who are in the habit of disapproving of care,
art, polish and every form of premeditation in actual
speaking, as being affected and unnatural, or else
with those who (like Lucius Cotta, according to
Cicero)<note><hi rend="italics">de Or.</hi> III. xi. 42. <hi rend="italics">Brut.</hi> lxxiv. 259.</note> affect the imitation of ancient writers both
in their choice of words and even in the rudeness of
their intonation and rhythm.<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Those, however, who
think it sufficient for men to be born to enable them
to become orators, are welcome to their opinion, and
I must ask them to be indulgent to the efforts to
which I am committed by my belief that we cannot
hope to attain perfection unless nature is assisted by
study. But I will not be so obstinate as to deny
that to nature must be assigned the first place.<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> For
a good delivery is undoubtedly impossible for one
who cannot remember what he has written, or lacks
the quick facility of speech required by sudden
emergencies, or is hampered by incurable impediments of speech. Again, physical uncouthness may
be such that no art can remedy it,<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> while a weak
voice is incompatible with first-rate excellence in
delivery. For we may employ a good, strong voice
as we will; whereas one that is ugly or feeble not
only prevents us from producing a number of effects,
such as a <hi rend="italics">crescendo</hi> or a sudden <hi rend="italics">fortissimo,</hi> but at
times forces faults upon us, making us drop the
voice, alter its pitch and refresh the hoarseness of
the throat and fatigue of the lungs by a hideous
chanting intonation. However, let me now turn to
consider the speaker on whom my precepts will not
be wasted.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="14"/>All delivery, as I have already said, is concerned
with two different things, namely, voice and gesture,

<pb id="p.251"/>

of which the one appeals to the eye and the other
to the ear, the two senses by which all emotion
reaches the soul. But the voice has the first claim
on our attention, since even our gesture is adapted
to suit it.</p>
<p>The first point which calls for consideration is the
nature of the voice, the second the manner in which
it is used. The nature of the voice depends on its
quantity and quality.<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> The question of quantity is
the simpler of the two, since as a rule it is either
strong or weak, although there are certain kinds of
voice which fall between these extremes, and there
are a number of gradations from the highest notes to
the lowest and from the lowest to the highest.
Quality, on the other hand, presents more variations;
for the voice may be clear or husky, full or thin,
smooth or harsh, of wide or narrow compass, rigid or
flexible, and sharp or flat, while lung-power may be
great or small.<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> It is not necessary for my purpose
to enquire into the causes which give rise to these
peculiarities. I need not raise the question whether
the difference lies in those organs by which the
breath is produced, or in those which form the
channels for the voice itself; whether the voice has
a character of its own or depends on the motions
which produce it; whether it be the strength of the
lungs, chest or the vocal organs themselves that
affords it most assistance, since the co-operation of
all these organs is required. For example, it is not
the mouth only that produces sweetness of tone; it
requires the assistance of the nostrils as well, which
carry off what I may describe as the overflow of the
voice. The important fact is that the tone must be
agreeable and not harsh.<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> The methods of using the

<pb id="p.253"/>

voice present great variety. For in addition to the
triple division of accents into sharp, grave and circumflex, there are many other forms of intonation
which are required: it may be intense or relaxed,
high or low, and may move in slow or quick time.
<milestone unit="section" n="18"/>But here again there are many intermediate
gradations between the two extremes, and just as
the face, although it consists of a limited number
of features, yet possesses infinite variety of expression,
so it is with the voice: for though it possesses but
few varieties to which we can give a name, yet every
human being possesses a distinctive voice of his
own, which is as easily distinguished by the ear as
are facial characteristics by the eye.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="19"/>The good qualities of the voice, like everything
else, are improved by training and impaired by
neglect. But the training required by the orator is
not the same as that which is practised by the singing-master, although the two methods have many
points in common. In both cases physical robustness
is essential to save the voice from dwindling to the
feeble shrillness that characterises the voices of
eunuchs, women and invalids, and the means for
creating such robustness are to be found in walking,
rubbing-down with oil, abstinence from sexual intercourse, an easy digestion, and, in a word, in the
simple life.<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> Further, the throat must be sound,
that is to say, soft and smooth; for if the throat be
unsound, the voice is broken or dulled or becomes
harsh or squeaky. For just as the sound produced
in the pipe by the same volume of breath varies
according as the stops are closed or open, or the
instrument is clogged or cracked, so the voice is
strangled if the throat be swollen, and muffled if it

<pb id="p.255"/>

is obstructed, while it becomes rasping if the throat
is inflamed, and may be compared to an organ with
broken pipes in cases where the throat is subject to
spasms.<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> Again, the presence of some obstacle may
divide the breath just as a pebble will divide shallow
waters, which, although their currents unite again
soon after the obstruction is past, still leave a hollow
space in rear of the object struck. An excess of
moisture also impedes the voice, while a deficiency
weakens it. As regards fatigue, its effect is the same
as upon the body: it affects the voice not merely at
the moment of speaking, but for some time afterwards.<milestone unit="section" n="22"/> But while exercise, which gives strength in
all cases, is equally necessary both for orators and
singing-masters, it is a different kind of exercise
which they require. For the orator is too much
occupied by civil affairs to be able to allot fixed
times for taking a walk, and he cannot tune his
voice through all the notes of the scale nor spare
it exertion, since it is frequently necessary for him
to speak in several cases in succession.<milestone unit="section" n="23"/> Nor is the
same regime suitable as regards food: for the orator
needs a strong and enduring voice rather than one
which is soft and sweet, while the singer mellows all
sounds, even the highest, by the modulation of his
voice, whereas we have often to speak in harsh and
agitated tones, must pass wakeful nights, swallow
the soot that is produced by the midnight oil and
stick to our work though our clothes be dripping
with sweat.<milestone unit="section" n="24"/> Consequently, we must not attempt to
mellow our voice by coddling it nor accustom it to
the conditions which it would like to enjoy, but
rather give it exercise suited to the tasks on which
it will be employed, never allowing it to be impaired

<pb id="p.257"/>

by silence, but strengthening it by practice, which
removes all difficulties.<milestone unit="section" n="25"/> The best method for securing such exercise is to learn passages by heart (for if
we have to speak extempore, the passion inspired by
our theme will distract us from all care for our voice),
while the passages selected for the purpose should
be as varied as possible, involving a combination
of loud, argumentative, colloquial and modulated
utterance, so that we may prepare ourselves for all
exigencies simultaneously. This will be sufficient.<milestone unit="section" n="26"/>
Otherwise your delicate, over trained voice will
succumb before any unusual exertion, like bodies
accustomed to the oil of the training school, which
for all the imposing robustness which they display
in their own contests, yet, if ordered to make a day's
march with the troops, to carry burdens and mount
guard at night, would faint beneath the task and
long for their trainers to rub them down with oil and
for the free perspiration of the naked limbs.<milestone unit="section" n="27"/> Who
would tolerate me if in a work such as this I were
to prescribe avoidance of exposure to sun, wind, rain
or parching heat? If we are called upon to speak
in the sun or on a windy, wet or warm day, is that a
reason for deserting the client whom we have undertaken to defend? While as for the warning given
by some that the orator should not speak when
dyspeptic, replete or drunk, or immediately after
vomiting, I think that no sane person would dream
of declaiming under such circumstances.<milestone unit="section" n="28"/> There is,
however, good reason for the rule prescribed by all
authorities, that the voice should not be overstrained
in the years of transition between boyhood and manhood, since at that period it is naturally weak, not, I
think, on account of heat, as some allege (for there

<pb id="p.259"/>

is more heat in the body at other periods), but rather
on account of moisture, of which at that age there is
a superabundance.<milestone unit="section" n="29"/> For this reason the nostrils and
the breast swell at this stage, and all the organs
develop new growth, with the result that they are
tender and liable to injury. However, to return to
the point, the best and most realistic form of exercise
for the voice, once it has become firm and set, is, in
my opinion, the practice of speaking daily just as we
plead in the courts. For thus, not merely do the
voice and lungs gain in strength, but we acquire a
becoming deportment of the body and develop grace
of movement suited to our style of speaking.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="30"/>The rules for delivery are identical with those for the
language of oratory itself. For, as our language must
be correct, clear, ornate and appropriate, so with our
delivery; it will be correct, that is, free from fault, if
our utterance be fluent, clear, pleasant and <quote>urbane,</quote>
that is to say, free from all traces of a rustic or a foreign
accent.<milestone unit="section" n="31"/> For there is good reason for the saying we so
often hear, <quote>He must be a barbarian or a Greek</quote>:
since we may discern a man's nationality from the
sound of his voice as easily as we test a coin by its ring.
If these qualities be present, we shall have those harmonious accents of which Ennius<note><hi rend="italics">Ann.</hi> ix. 305 (Vahlen).</note> expresses his
approval when he describes Cethegus as one whose
<quote>words rang sweetly,</quote> and avoid the opposite effect,
of which Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">Brut.</hi> xv. 58.</note> expresses his disapproval by saying,
<quote>They bark, not plead.</quote> For there are many faults
of which I spoke in the first book<note>I. i. 37; v. 32; viii. 1 and xi. 1 <hi rend="italics">sqq.</hi></note> when I discussed
the method in which the speech of children should
be formed, since I thought it more appropriate to
mention them in connexion with a period of life
when it is still possible to correct them.<milestone unit="section" n="32"/> Again, the

<pb id="p.261"/>

delivery may be described as correct if the voice be
sound, that is to say, exempt from any of the defects
of which I have just spoken, and if it is not dull,
coarse, exaggerated, hard, stiff, hoarse or thick, or
again, thin, hollow, sharp, feeble, soft or effeminate,
and if the breath is neither too short nor difficult to
sustain or recover.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="33"/>The delivery will be clear if, in the first place, the
words are uttered in their entirety, instead of being
swallowed or clipped, as is so often the case, since
too many people fail to complete the final syllables
through over-emphasising the first. But although
words must be given their full phonetic value, it is a
tiresome and offensive trick to pronounce every letter
as if we were entering them in an inventory.<milestone unit="section" n="34"/> For
vowels frequently coalesce and some consonants disappear when followed by a vowel. I have already<note>ix. iv. 40.</note>
given an example of both these occurrences:&mdash;
<hi rend="italics">mullum ille et terris.</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> i.</note><milestone unit="section" n="35"/> Further, we avoid placing two
consonants near each other when their juxtaposition
would cause a harsh sound; thus, we say <hi rend="italics">pellexit</hi> and
<hi rend="italics">collegiate</hi> and employ other like forms of which I have
spoken elsewhere.<note>IX. iv. 37.</note> It is with this in mind that
Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">Brut.</hi> lxxiv. 259. <quote>suavitas vocis et lenis appellatio
literarum</quote> (<quote>the sweetness of his voice and the delicacy
with which he pronounced the various letters.</quote>)</note> praises Catulus for the sweetness with which
he pronounced the various letters. The second
essential for clearness of delivery is that our
language should be properly punctuated, that is
to say, the speaker must begin and end at the
proper place. It is also necessary to note at what
point our speech should pause and be momentarily
suspended (which the Greeks term <foreign lang="greek">u(podiastolh\</foreign> and
<foreign lang="greek">u(postigmh\</foreign><note><quote>A slight stop,</quote> corresponding to our <quote>comma</quote></note> and when it should come to a full stop.
<milestone unit="section" n="36"/>After the words <hi rend="italics">arma virumque cano</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> i. 1.</note> there is a momentary suspension, because <hi rend="italics">virum</hi> is connected with

<pb id="p.263"/>

what follows, the full sense being given by <hi rend="italics">virum
Troiae qui primus ab oris,</hi> after which there is a similar suspension. For although the mention of the
hero's destination introduces an idea different from
that of the place whence he came, the difference does
not call for the insertion of a stop, since both ideas
are expressed by the same verb <hi rend="italics">venit.</hi><milestone unit="section" n="37"/> After <hi rend="italics">Italiam</hi>
comes a third pause, since <hi rend="italics">fato profugus</hi> is parenthetic and breaks up the continuity of the phrase
<hi rend="italics">Italian, Lavinaque.</hi> For the same reason there is a
fourth pause after <hi rend="italics">profulgus.</hi> Then follows <hi rend="italics">Lavinaque
venit litora,</hi> where a stop must be placed, as at this
point a new sentence begins. But stops themselves
vary in length, according as they mark the conclusion
of a phrase or a sentence.<milestone unit="section" n="38"/> Thus after <hi rend="italics">litora</hi> I shall
pause and continue after taking breath. But when
I come to <hi rend="italics">atque altae moenia Romae</hi> I shall make a full
stop, halt and start again with the opening of a fresh
sentence.<milestone unit="section" n="39"/> There are also occasionally, even in
periods, pauses which do not require a fresh breath.
For although the sentence <hi rend="italics">in coetu vero populi Romani,
negotium publicumn gerens, magister equilum,</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Phil.</hi> II. xxv. 63. See <hi rend="italics">Quint.</hi> VIII. iv. 8.</note> etc., contains a number of different <hi rend="italics">cola,</hi><note>See IX. iv. 22, 67, 123. The name <hi rend="italics">colon</hi> is applied to the
longer clauses contained in a period, as opposed to the shorter,
which are styled <hi rend="italics">commata.</hi></note> expressing a number
of different thoughts, all these <hi rend="italics">cola</hi> are embraced by
a single period: consequently, although short pauses
are required at the appropriate intervals, the flow of
the period as a whole must not be broken. On the
other hand, it is at times necessary to take breath without any perceptible pause: in such cases we must do
so surreptitiously, since if we take breath unskilfully,
it will cause as much obscurity as would have resulted
from faulty punctuation. Correctness of punctuation
may seem to be but a trivial merit, but without it
all the other merits of oratory are nothing worth.</p>

<pb id="p.265"/>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="40"/>Delivery will be ornate when it is supported by
a voice that is easy, strong, rich, flexible, firm, sweet,
enduring, resonant, pure, carrying far and penetrating the ear (for there is a type of voice which
impresses the hearing not by its volume, but by its
peculiar quality): in addition, the voice must be
easily managed and must possess all the necessary
inflexions and modulations, in fact it must, as the
saying is, be a perfect instrument, equipped with
every stop: further, it must have strong lungs to
sustain it, and ample breathing power that will be
equal to all demands upon it, however fatiguing.<milestone unit="section" n="41"/> The
deepest bass and the highest treble notes are unsuited to oratory: for the former lack clearness and,
owing to their excessive fullness, have no emotional
power, while the latter are too thin and, owing to
excess of clearness, give an impression of extravagance and are incompatible with the inflexions
demanded by delivery and place too great a strain
upon the voice.<milestone unit="section" n="42"/> For the voice is like the strings of
a musical instrument; the slacker it is the deeper
and fuller the note produced, whereas if it be
tightened, the sound becomes thinner and shriller.
Consequently, the deepest notes lack force, and the
higher run the risk of cracking the voice. The orator
will, therefore, employ the intermediate notes, which
must be raised when we speak with energy and
lowered when we adopt a more subdued tone.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="43"/>For the first essential of a good delivery is evenness. The voice must not run joltingly, with
irregularity of rhythm and sound, mixing long and
short syllables, grave accents and acute, tones loud
and low, without discrimination, the result being that
this universal unevenness produces the impression of

<pb id="p.267"/>

a limping gait. The second essential is variety of
tone, and it is in this alone that delivery really consists.<milestone unit="section" n="44"/> I must warn my readers not to fall into the
error of supposing that evenness and variety are incompatible with one another, since the fault opposed
to evenness is unevenness, while the opposite of
variety is that which the Greeks term <foreign lang="greek">monoei/deia,</foreign> or
uniformity of aspect. The art of producing variety
not merely charms and refreshes the ear, but, by the
very fact that it involves a change of effort, revives
the speaker's flagging energies. It is like the relief
caused by changes in position, such as are involved
by standing, walking, sitting and lying, none of
which can be endured for a long time together.
<milestone unit="section" n="45"/>But the most important point (which I shall proceed
to discuss a little later) is the necessity of adapting
the voice to suit the nature of the various subjects
on which we are speaking and the moods that they
demand: otherwise our voice will be at variance with
our language. We must, therefore, avoid that which
the Greeks call <hi rend="italics">monotony,</hi> that is to say, the unvarying exertion both of lungs and voice. By this I do
not simply mean that we must avoid saying everything in a loud tone, a fault which amounts to
madness, or in a colloquial tone, which creates an
impression of lifelessness, or in a subdued murmur,
which is utterly destructive of all vigour.<milestone unit="section" n="46"/> What I
mean is this: within the limits of one passage and the
compass of one emotion we may vary our tone to a
certain, though not a very great extent, according
as the dignity of the language, the nature of the
thought, the conclusion and opening of our sentences or transitions from one point to another, may
demand. Thus, those who paint in monochrome

<pb id="p.269"/>

still represent their objects in different planes, since
otherwise it would have been impossible to depict
even the limbs of their figures.<milestone unit="section" n="47"/> Let us take as an
example the opening of Cicero's magnificent speech
in defence of Milo. Is it not clear that the orator
has to change his tone almost at every stop? it is the
same face, but the expression is changed. <hi rend="italics">Etsi vereor,
iudices, ne turpe sit,</hi><milestone unit="section" n="48"/> <hi rend="italics">pre fortissimo viro dicere incipientem
timere.</hi><note><hi rend="italics">pro Mil.</hi> i. 1 <hi rend="italics">sqq.</hi> <quote>Although I fear, gentlemen, that it
may be discreditable that I should feel afraid on rising to
defend the harvest of men, and though it is far from becoming
that, whereas Titus Annius is more concerned for the safety
of the State than for his own, I <hi rend="italics">should</hi> he unable to bring a
like degree of courage to aid me in pleading his cause; still,
the strange appearance of this novel tribunal dismays my
eyes, which, whithersoever they turn, look in vain for the
customary aspect of the forum and the time-honoured usage
of the courts. For your bench is not surrounded, as it used
to be, by a ring of spectators,</quote> etc.</note> Although the general tone of the passage is
restrained and subdued, since it is not merely an
<hi rend="italics">exordium,</hi> but the <hi rend="italics">exordium</hi> of a man suffering from
serious anxiety, still something fuller and bolder is
required in the tone, when he says <hi rend="italics">pro fortissiomo viro,</hi>
than when he says <hi rend="italics">etsi cereor and turpe sit</hi> and <hi rend="italics">timere.</hi>
<milestone unit="section" n="49"/>But his second breath must be more vigorous, partly
owing to the natural increase of effort, since we
always speak our second sentence with less timidity,
and partly because he indicates the high courage of
Milo: <hi rend="italics">minimeque deceat, cum</hi> T. Annius ipse magis de
<hi rend="italics">rei publicae salute quam de sua perturbetur.</hi> Then he
proceeds to something like a reproof of himself: <hi rend="italics">me
ad eius causam parem animi maguitudinem adferre non
posse.</hi><milestone unit="section" n="50"/> The next clause suggests a reflexion on the
conduct of others: <hi rend="italics">tamen haec novi iudicii nova forma
terret oculos.</hi> And then in what follows he opens
every stop, as the saying is: <hi rend="italics">qui, quocunque inciderunt,
consuetudinem fori et pristinum morem iudiciorum requirunt:</hi> while the next clause is even fuller and freer:
<hi rend="italics">non enim corona cousessus vester cinctus est, ut solebat.</hi>
<milestone unit="section" n="51"/>I have called attention to these points to make it
clear that there is a certain variety, not merely in

<pb id="p.271"/>

the delivery of <hi rend="italics">cola,</hi> but even in that of phrases consisting of one word, a variety the lack of which
would make every word seem of equal importance.</p>
<p>The voice, however, must not be pressed beyond
its powers, for it is liable to be choked and to become less and less clear in proportion to the increase
of effort, while at times it will break altogether and
produce the sound to which the Greeks have given
a name derived from the crowing of cocks before the
voice is developed.<note>What this word was is not known. Perhaps merely <foreign lang="greek">kokkusmo/s.</foreign></note><milestone unit="section" n="52"/> We must also beware of confusing our utterance by excessive volubility, which
results in disregard of punctuation, loss of emotional
power, and sometimes in the clipping of words. The
opposite fault is excessive slowness of speech, which
is a sign of lack of readiness in invention, tends by
its sluggishness to render our hearers inattentive,
and, further, wastes the time allotted to us for speaking,<note><hi rend="italics">aquam perdit.</hi> Lit. wastes water. The reference is to
the clepsydra or water-clock employed for the measurement
of time.</note> a consideration which is of some importance.
Our speech must be ready, but not precipitate, under
control, but not slow,<milestone unit="section" n="53"/> while we must not take breath
so often as to break up our sentence, nor, on the
other hand, sustain it until it fails us from exhaustion.
For the sound produced by loss of breath is disagreeable; we gasp like a drowning man and fill our lungs
with long drawn inhalations at in appropriate moments,
giving the impression that our action is due not to
choice, but to compulsion. Therefore, in attacking
a period of abnormal length, we should collect our
breath, but quickly, noiselessly and imperceptibly.
On other occasions we shall be able to take breath
at the natural breaks in the substance of our speech.
<milestone unit="section" n="54"/>But we must exercise our breathing capacity to make
it as great as possible. To produce this result Demosthenes used to recite as many successive lines as

<pb id="p.273"/>

possible, while he was climbing a hill. He also, with
a view to securing fluency free from impediment,
used to roll pebbles under his tongue when speaking
in the privacy of his study.<milestone unit="section" n="55"/> Sometimes the breath,
although capable of sustained effort and sufficiently
full and clear, lacks firmness when exerted, had for
that reason is liable to become tremulous, like bodies
which, although to all appearances sound, receive
insufficient support from the sinews. This the Greeks
call <foreign lang="greek">brasmo/s.</foreign><note><foreign lang="greek">bra/gxos</foreign> is generally read, but the word is used in the
sense of <quote>hotrseness,</quote> which is not what Quintilian describes.
I would read <foreign lang="greek">brasmo/s,</foreign> a word meaning <quote>effervescence,</quote>
<quote>shaking,</quote> <quote>shivering.</quote> Here = <hi rend="italics">tremolo.</hi></note> There are some too who, owing to
the loss of teeth, do not draw in the breath naturally,
but suck it in with a hissing sound. There are
others who pant incessantly and so loudly that it
is perfectly audible within them: they remind one
of heavily-laden beasts of burden straining against
the yoke.<milestone unit="section" n="56"/> Some indeed actually affect this mannerism, as though to suggest that they are struggling
with the host of ideas that crowd themselves upon
them and oppressed by a greater flood of eloquence
than their throats are capable of uttering. Others,
again, find a difficulty in opening their mouths, and
seem to struggle with their words; and, further,
although they are not actually faults of the voice,
yet since they arise out of the use of the voice,
I think this is the most appropriate place for
referring to the habit of coughing and spitting with
frequency while speaking, of hawking up phlegm
from the depths of the lungs, like water from a
well,<note><hi rend="italics">trochea</hi> is a windlass used for raising water from a
well.</note> sprinkling the nearest of the bystanders with
saliva, and expelling the greater portion of the
breath through the nostrils.<milestone unit="section" n="57"/> But any of these faults
are tolerable compared with the practice of chanting
instead of speaking, which is the worst feature of
our modern oratory, whether in the courts or in the

<pb id="p.275"/>

schools, and of which I can only say that I do not
know whether it is more useless or more repugnant
to good taste. For what can be less becoming to
an orator than modulations that recall the stage and
a sing-song utterance which at times resembles the
maudlin utterance of drunken revellers?<milestone unit="section" n="58"/> What can
be more fatal to any emotional appeal than that the
speaker should, when the situation calls for grief,
anger, indignation or pity, not merely avoid the
expression of those emotions which require to be
kindled in the judge, but outrage the dignity of
the courts with noises such as are dear to the
Lycians and Carians? For Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">Or.</hi> xviii. 57.</note> has told us that
the rhetoricians of Lycia and Caria come near to
singing in their perorations. But, as a matter of tact,
we have somewhat overstepped the limits imposed by
the more restrained style of singing.<milestone unit="section" n="59"/> I ask you,
does anyone sing, I will not say when his theme is
murder, sacrilege or parricide, but at any rate when
he deals with figures or accounts, or, to cut a long
story short, when he is pleading in any kind of
lawsuit whatever? And if such a form of intonation
is to be permitted at all, there is really no reason
why the modulations of the voice should not be
accompanied by harps and flutes, or even by cymbals,
which would be more appropriate to the revolting
exhibitions of which I am speaking.<milestone unit="section" n="60"/> And yet we
show no reluctance in indulging this vicious practice.
For no one thinks his own singing hideous, and it
involves less trouble than genuine pleading. There
are, moreover, some persons who, in thorough conformity with their other vices, are possessed with a
perpetual passion for hearing something that will
soothe their ears. But, it may be urged, does not

<pb id="p.277"/>

Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">Or.</hi> xviii. 57.</note> himself say that there is a suggestion of
singing in the utterance of an orator? And is not
this the outcome of a natural impulse? I shall
shortly proceed to show to what extent such musical
modulations are permissible: but if we are to call
it singing, it must be no more than a suggestion
of singing, a fact which too many refuse to
realise.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="61"/>But it is now high time for me to explain what I
mean by appropriate delivery. Such appropriateness
obviously lies in the adaptation of the delivery to
the subjects on which we are speaking. This quality
is, in the main, supplied by the emotions themselves,
and the voice will ring as passion strikes its chords.
But there is a difference between true emotion on
the one hand, and false and fictitious emotion on
the other. The former breaks out naturally, as in
the case of grief, anger or indignation, but lacks
art, and therefore requires to be formed by methodical
training.<milestone unit="section" n="62"/> The latter, on the other hand, does imply
art, but lacks the sincerity of nature: consequently
in such cases the main thing is to excite the appropriate feeling in oneself, to form a mental picture
of the facts, and to exhibit an emotion that cannot
be distinguished from the truth. The voice, which
is the intermediary between ourselves and our
hearers, will then produce precisely the same
emotion in the judge that we have put into it. For
it is the index of the mind, and is capable of expressing all its varieties of feeling.<milestone unit="section" n="63"/> Therefore when we
deal with a lively theme, the flow of the voice is
characterised by fullness, simplicity and cheerfulness; but when it is roused to battle, it puts forth
all its strength and strains every nerve. In anger

<pb id="p.279"/>

it is fierce, harsh and intense, and calls for frequent
filling of the lungs, since the breath cannot be sustained for long when it is poured forth without
restraint. When it is desired to throw odium upon
our opponents, it will be somewhat slower, since,
as a rule, it is none save the weaker party takes
refuge in such tactics. On the other hand, in flattery,
admission, apology or question it will be gentle and
subdued.<milestone unit="section" n="64"/> If we advise, warn, promise or console,
it will be grave and dignified, modest if we express
fear or shame, bold in exhortation, precise in argument, full of modulations, suggestive of tears and
designedly muffled in appeals for pity, whereas in
digression it will be full and flowing, and will have
all the resonance that is characteristic of confidence;
in exposition of facts or conversations it will be
even and pitched half-way betwixt high and low.
<milestone unit="section" n="65"/>But it will be raised to express violent emotion, and
sink when our words are of a calmer nature, rising
and falling according to the demands of its theme.</p>
<p>However, for the moment I will defer speaking
of the variations in tone required by different topics,
and will proceed first to the discussion of gesture
which conforms to the voice, and like it, obeys the
impulse of the mind. Its importance in oratory is
sufficiently clear from the fact that there are many
things which it can express without the assistance
of words.<milestone unit="section" n="66"/> For we can indicate our will not merely
by a gesture of the hands, but also with a nod from
the head: signs take the place of language in the
dumb, and the movements of the dance are frequently full of meaning, and appeal to the emotions
without any aid from words. The temper of the
mind can be inferred from the glance and gait,

<pb id="p.281"/>

and even speechless animals show anger, joy, or the
desire to please by means of the eye and other
physical indications.<milestone unit="section" n="67"/> Nor is it wonderful that gesture which depends on various forms of movement
should have such power, when pictures, which are
silent and motionless, penetrate into our innermost
feelings with such power that at times they seem
more eloquent than language itself. On the other
hand, if gesture and the expression of the face are
out of harmony with the speech, if we look cheerful
when our words are sad. or slake our heads when
making a positive assertion, our words will not only
lack weight, but will fail to carry conviction.<milestone unit="section" n="68"/> Gesture and movement are also productive of grace.
It was for this reason that Demosthenes used to
practise his delivery in front of a large mirror, since,
in spite of the fact that its reflexions are reversed,
he trusted his eyes to enable him to judge accurately
the effect produced.</p>
<p>The head, being the chief member of the body,
has a corresponding importance in delivery, serving
not merely to produce graceful elect, but to illustrate our meaning as well.<milestone unit="section" n="69"/> To secure grace it is
essential that the head should be carried naturally
an erect. For a droop suggests humility, while if
it be thrown back it seems to express arrogance, if
inclined to one side it gives an impression of languor,
while if it is held too stiffly and rigidly it appears
to indicate a rude and savage temper. Further, it
should derive appropriate motion from the subject
of our pleading, maintaining harmony with the gesture and following the movement of the hands and
side.<milestone unit="section" n="70"/> For the eyes are always turned in the same
direction as the gesture, except when we are called

<pb id="p.283"/>

upon to condemn or concede something or to express
abhorrence, when we shall show our aversion by
turning away the face and by thrusting out our
hands as though to repel the thought, as in the
lines:

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>Ye gods, such dread calamity avert!</l></quote><bibl><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> iii. 620.</bibl></cit></quote>

or

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>Not for me</l>
<l>To claim such honour!</l></quote><bibl><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> i. 335.</bibl></cit></quote></p>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="71"/>The methods by which the head may express our
meaning are manifold. For in addition to those
movements which indicate consent, refusal and
affirmation, there are those expressive of modesty,
hesitation, wonder or indignation, which are well
known and common to all. But to confine the
gesture to the movement of the head alone is regarded as a fault by those who teach acting as well
as by professors of rhetoric. Even the frequent
nodding of the head is not free from fault, while
to toss or roll it till our hair flies free is suggestive
of a fanatic.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="72"/>By far the greatest influence is exercised by the
glance. For it is by this that we express supplication, threats, flattery, sorrow, joy, pride or submission. It is on this that our audience hang, on
this that they rivet their attention and their gaze,
even before we begin to speak. It is this that
inspires the hearer with affection or dislike, this
that conveys a world of meaning and is often more
eloquent than all our words.<milestone unit="section" n="73"/> Consequently in plays
destined for the stage, the masters of the art of
delivery design even their masks to enhance the
emotional effect. Thus, in tragedy, Aerope will be

<pb id="p.285"/>

sad, Medea fierce, Ajax bewildered, Hercules truculent.<milestone unit="section" n="74"/> In comedy, on the other hand, over and
above the methods adopted to distinguish between
slaves, pimps, parasites, rustics, soldiers, harlots,
maidservants, old men stern and mild, youths moral
or luxurious, married women and girls, we have
the important r&ocirc;le of the father who, because at
times he is excited and at others call, has one
eyebrow raised and the other normal, the custom
among actors being to turn that side of the face to
the audience which best suits the role.<milestone unit="section" n="75"/> But of the
various elements that go to form the expression,
the eyes are the most important, since they, more
than any-thing else, reveal the temper of the mind,
and without actual movement will twinkle with
merriment or be clouded with grief. And further,
nature has given them tears to serve as interpreters
of our feelings, tears that will break forth for sorrow
or stream for very joy. But, when the eyes move,
they become intent, indifferent, proud, fierce, mild,
or angry; and they will assume all these characters
according as the pleading may demand.<milestone unit="section" n="76"/> But they
must never he fixed or protruding, languid or sluggish, lifeless, lascivious, restless, nor swim with a
moist voluptuous glance, nor look aslant nor leer
in amorous fashion, nor yet must they seem to
promise or ask a boon. As for keeping them fully
or partially closed while speaking, surely none save
an uneducated man or a fool would dream of doing
such a thing.<milestone unit="section" n="77"/> And in addition to all these forms of
expression, the upper and lower eyelids can render
service in support of the eyes.<milestone unit="section" n="78"/> The eyebrows also
may be used with great effect. For to some extent
they mould the expression of the eyes and

<pb id="p.287"/>

determine that of the forehead. It is by means of the
eyebrows that we contract, raise or smooth the
latter: in fact, the only thing which has greater
influence over it is the blood, which moves in conformity with the emotions that control the mind,
causing a blush on a skin that is sensitive to shame,
and giving place to an icy pallor under the influence
of fear, whereas, when it is under control, it produces a peaceful complexion, intermediate between
the two.<milestone unit="section" n="79"/> Complete immobility in the eyebrows is
a fault, as also is excess of mobility or the tendency
to raise one and lower the other, as in the comic
mask which I mentioned just now: while it is a
further blemish if they express a feeling out of
keeping with the words we utter. For they show
anger by contraction, grief by depression and cheerfulness by their expansion. They are also dropped
or raised to express consent or refusal respectively.
<milestone unit="section" n="80"/>It is not often that the lips or nostrils can be
becomingly employed to express our feelings, although they are often used to indicate derision,
contempt or loathing. For to <quote>wrinkle the nostrils</quote>
(as Horace says),<note><hi rend="italics">Ep.</hi> I. v. 23.</note> or blow them out, or twitch them,
or fret them with our finger, or snort through them
with a sudden expulsion of the breath, or stretch
them wide or push them up with the flat of the
hand are all indecorous, since it is not without reason
that censure is passed even on blowing the nose too
frequently.<milestone unit="section" n="81"/> It is also an ugly habit to protrude the
lips, open them with a sudden smack,<note>It is hard to distinguish between <hi rend="italics">scindere</hi> and <hi rend="italics">didurere.</hi>
I have adopted a suggestion of Spalding's.</note> compress
them, draw them apart and bare the teeth, or twist
them awry to one side till they almost reach the
ear, or to curl them in scorn, or let them droop, or
allow the voice to escape only on one side. It is

<pb id="p.289"/>

also unbecoming to lick or bite them, since their
motion should be but slight even when they are
employed in forming words. For we must speak
with the mouth rather than the lips.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="82"/>The neck must be straight, not stiff or bent
backward. As regards the throat, contraction and
stretching are equally unbecoming, though in different ways. If it be stretched, it causes strain
as well, and weakens and fatigues the voice,
while if the chin be pressed down into the chest
it makes the voice less distinct and coarsens it,
owing to the pressure on the windpipe.<milestone unit="section" n="83"/> It is, as a
rule, unbecoming to raise or contract the shoulders.
For it shortens the neck and produces a mean and
servile gesture, which is even suggestive of dishonesty when men assume an attitude of flattery,
admiration or fear.<milestone unit="section" n="84"/> In continuous and flowing passages a most becoming gesture is slightly to extend
the arm with shoulders well thrown back and the
fingers opening as the hand moves forward. But
when we have to speak in specially rich or impressive style, as, for example, in the passage <hi rend="italics">saxa atiqu
solitudines voci respondent,</hi><note><hi rend="italics">pro Arh.</hi> viii. 19. See VIII. iii. 75 and IX. iv. 44.
<quote>Rocks and solitude make answer to the voice.</quote></note> the arm will be thrown out
in a stately sidelong sweep and the words will, as
it were, expand in unison with the gesture.<milestone unit="section" n="85"/> As
for the hands, without which all action would be
crippled and enfeebled, it is scarcely possible to
describe the variety of their motions, since they are
almost as expressive as words. For other portions
of the body merely help the speaker, whereas the
hands may almost be said to speak.<milestone unit="section" n="86"/> Do we not
use them to demand, promise, summon, dismiss,
threaten, supplicate, express aversion or fear, question
or deny? Do we not employ them to indicate joy,

<pb id="p.291"/>

sorrow, hesitation, confession, penitence, measure,
quantity, number and time?<milestone unit="section" n="87"/> Have they not power
to excite and prohibit, to express approval, wonder
or shame? Do they not take the place of adverbs
and pronouns when we point at places and things?
In fact, though the peoples and nations of the earth
speak a multitude of tongues, they share in common
the universal language of the hands.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="88"/>The gestures of which I have thus far spoken are
such as naturally proceed from us simultaneously
with our words. But there are others which indicate things by means of mimicry. For example,
you may suggest a sick man by mimicking the
gesture of a doctor feeling the pulse, or a harpist by
a movement of the hands as though they were
plucking the strings. But this is a type of gesture
which should be rigorously avoided in pleading.<milestone unit="section" n="89"/> For
the orator should be as unlike a dancer as possible,
and his gesture should be adapted rather to his
thought than to his actual words, a practice which
was indeed once upon a time even adopted by the
more dignified performers on the stage. I should,
therefore, permit him to direct his hand towards his
body to indicate that he is speaking of himself, or to
point it at some one else to whom he is alluding,
together with other similar gestures which I need
not mention. But, on the other hand, I would not
allow him to use his hands to imitate attitudes or to
illustrate anything he may chance to say.<milestone unit="section" n="90"/> And this
rule applies not merely to the hands, but to all
gesture and to the voice as well. For in delivering
the period <hi rend="italics">stetit soleatus praetor populi Romani,</hi><note>There in his slippers stood the praetor of the Roman
people." <hi rend="italics">Verr.</hi> v. xxxiii. 86: see <hi rend="italics">VIII.</hi> iii. 64.</note> it
would be wrong to imitate Verres leaning on his
mistress, or in uttering the phrase <hi rend="italics">caedebatur in medio</hi>

<pb id="p.293"/>

<hi rend="italics">foro Messanae</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Verr.</hi> v. lxii 162. <quote>He was scourged in the midst of the
market-place of Messina.</quote></note> to make the side writhe, as it does
when quivering beneath the lash, or to utter shrieks,
such as are extorted by pain.<milestone unit="section" n="91"/> For even comic actors
seem to me to commit a gross offence against the
canons of their art when, if they have in the course
of some narrative to quote either the words of an old
man (as, for example, in the prologue to the <hi rend="italics">Hydria</hi>),<note>Plays of Menander.</note>
or of a woman (as in the (<hi rend="italics">Georgus</hi><note>Plays of Menander.</note>), they litter them
in a tremulous or a treble voice, notwithstanding the
fact that they are playing the part of a young man.
So true is it that certain forms of imitation may be
a blemish even in those whose whole art consists in
imitation.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="92"/>One of the commonest of all the gestures consists
in placing the middle finger against the thumb and
extending the remaining three: it is suitable to the
<hi rend="italics">exordum,</hi> the hand being moved forward with an
easy motion a little distance both to right and left,
while the head and shoulders gradually follow the
direction of the gesture. It is also useful in the
<hi rend="italics">statement of facts,</hi> but in that case the hand must be
moved with firmness and a little further forward,
while, if we are reproaching or refuting our adversary, the same movement may be employed with
some vehemence and energy, since such passages
permit of greater freedom of extension.<milestone unit="section" n="93"/> On the
other hand, this same gesture is often directed sideways towards the left shoulder: this is a mistake,
although it is a still worse fault to thrust the arm
across the chest and gesticulate with the elbow.
The middle and third fingers are also sometimes
turned under the thumb, producing a still more
forcible effect than the gesture previously described,
but not well adapted for use in the <hi rend="italics">exordium</hi> or <hi rend="italics">state-</hi>

<pb id="p.295"/>

<hi rend="italics">meant of facts.</hi><milestone unit="section" n="94"/> But when three fingers are doubled
under the thumb, the finger, which Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">de Or.</hi> II. xlv. 188.</note> says
that Crassus used to such effect, is extended. It is
used in denunciation and in indication (whence its
name of index finger), while if it be slightly dropped
after the hand has been raised toward the shoulder,
it signifies affirmation, and if pointed as it were
face downwards toward the ground, it expresses
insistence. It is sometimes also used to indicate
number.<milestone unit="section" n="95"/> Again, if its top joint is lightly gripped on
either side, with the two outer fingers slightly
curved, the little finger rather less than the third,
we shall have a gesture well suited for argument.
But for this purpose the same gesture is rendered
more emphatic by holding the middle joint of the
finger and contracting the last two fingers still
further to match the lower position of the middle
finger and thumb.<milestone unit="section" n="96"/> The following gesture is admirably adapted to accompany modest language: the
thumb and the next three fingers are gently converged to a point and the hand is carried to the
neighbourhood of the month or chest, then relaxed
palm downwards and slightly advanced.<milestone unit="section" n="97"/> It was
with this gesture that I believe Demosthenes to
have commenced the timid and subdued exordium
of his speech in defence of Ctesiphon, and it was,
I think, in such a position that Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">pro Arch.</hi> i. 1.</note> held his
land, when he said, <quote>If I have any talent, though
I am conscious how little it is.</quote> Slightly greater
freedom may be given to the gesture by pointing
the fingers down and drawing the hand in towards
the body and then opening it somewhat more rapidly
in the opposite direction, so that it seems as though
it were delivering our words to the audience.<milestone unit="section" n="98"/>

<pb id="p.297"/>

Sometimes we may hold the first two fingers apart without,
however, inserting the thumb between them, the
remaining two pointing inwards, while even the two
former must not be fully extended.<milestone unit="section" n="99"/> Sometimes,
again, the third and little finger may be pressed in to
the palm near the base of the thumb, which in its
turn is pressed against the middle joints of the first
and middle fingers; at others the little finger is
sometimes drooped obliquely, or the four fingers may
be relaxed rather than extended and the thumb
slanted inwards: this last gesture is well adapted to
pointing to one side or marking the different points
which we are making, the had being carried palmupwards to the left and swept back to the right
face-downwards.<milestone unit="section" n="100"/> The following short gestures are
also employed: the hand may be slightly hollowed
as it is when persons are making a vow, and then
moved slightly to and fro, the shoulders swaying
gently in unison: this is adapted to passages where
we speak with restraint and almost with timidity.
Wonder is best expressed as follows: the hand turns
slightly upwards and the fingers are brought in to
the palm, one after the other, beginning with the
little finger; the hand is then opened and turned
round by a reversal of this motion.<milestone unit="section" n="101"/> There are various
methods of expressing interrogation; but, as a rule,
we do so by a turn of the hand, the arrangement of
the fingers being indifferent. If the first finger
touch the middle of the right-hand edge of the
thumb-nail with its extremity, the other fingers
being relaxed, we shall have a graceful gesture well
suited to express approval or to accompany <hi rend="italics">statements
of facts,</hi> and to mark the distinction between our
different points.<milestone unit="section" n="102"/> There is another gesture not unlike

<pb id="p.299"/>

the preceding, in which the remaining three fingers
are folded: it is much employed by the Greeks both
for the left hand and the right, in rounding off their
<hi rend="italics">enthymemes,</hi><note>Rhetorical or incomplete syllogisms. But see V. x. 2.
xiv. 1</note> detail by detail. A gentle movement of
the hand expresses promise or assent, a more violent
movement suggests exhortation or sometimes praise.
There is also that familiar gesture by which we drive
home our words, consisting in the rapid opening
and shutting of the hand: but this is a common
rather than an artistic gesture.<milestone unit="section" n="103"/> Again, there is the
somewhat unusual gesture in which the hand is
hollowed and raised well above the shoulder with a
motion suggestive of exhortation. The tremulous
motion now generally adopted by foreign schools is,
however, fit only for the stage. I do not know why
some persons disapprove of the movement of the
fingers, with their tops converging, towards the
mouth. For we do this when we are slightly surprised, and at times also employ it to express fear or
entreaty when we are seized with sudden indignation.
<milestone unit="section" n="104"/>Further, we sometimes clench the hand and press
it to our breast when we are expressing regret or
anger, an occasion when it is not unbecoming even
to force the voice through the teeth in phrases such
as <quote>What shall I do now?</quote> <quote>What would you do?</quote>
To point at something with the thumb turned back
is a gesture which is in general just, but is not, in my
opinion, becoming to an orator.<milestone unit="section" n="105"/> Motion is generally
divided into six kinds, but circular motion must be
regarded as a seventh. The latter alone is faulty
when applied to gesture. The remaining motions&mdash;
that is, forward, to right or left and up or down&mdash;all
have their significance, but the gesture is never
directed to what lies behind us, though we do at

<pb id="p.301"/>

times throw the hand back.<milestone unit="section" n="106"/> The best effect is produced by letting the motion of the hand start from
the left and end on the right, but this must be done
gently, the hand sinking to rest and avoiding all
appearance of giving a blow, although at the end of
a sentence it may sometimes be allowed to drop, but
must quickly be raised again: or it may occasionally,
when we desire to express wonder or dissent, spring
back with a rapid motion.</p>
<p>In this connexion the earlier instructors in the art
of gesture rightly added that the movement of the
hand should begin: and end with the thought that is
expressed. Otherwise the gesture will anticipate or
lag behind the voice, both of which produce an
unpleasing effect.<milestone unit="section" n="107"/> Some, through excess of subtlety,
have erroneously prescribed that there should be an
interval of three words between each movement;
but this rule is never observed, nor can it be. These
persons, however, were desirous that there should be
some standard of speed or slowness (a most rational
desire), with a view to avoid prolonged inactivity on
the part of the hands as well as the opposite fault,
into which so many fall, of breaking up the natural
flow of their delivery by continual motion.<milestone unit="section" n="108"/> There is
another still more common error, which is less easy
of detection. Language possesses certain imperceptible stresses, indeed we might almost call them
feet, to which the gesture of most speakers conforms.
Thus there will he one movement at <hi rend="italics">novum crimen,</hi>
another at <hi rend="italics">Giai Caesar,</hi> a third at <hi rend="italics">et ante diem,</hi>
a fourth at <hi rend="italics">non auditum,</hi> a fifth at <hi rend="italics">propinquus meus,</hi> a
sixth at <hi rend="italics">ad te</hi> and others at <hi rend="italics">Quintus Tubero</hi> and
<hi rend="italics">detulit.</hi><note><hi rend="italics">pro Lig.</hi> i. 1. <quote>It is a new charge, Gaius Caesar, a
chartgo hitherto, unheard of, that my kinsman, Quintus Tubero,
has brought to your notice.</quote></note><milestone unit="section" n="109"/> From this springs a further error, namely,
that young men, when writing out their speeches,

<pb id="p.303"/>

devise all their gestures in advance and consider as
they compose how the hand is to fall at each
particular point. A further unfortunate result is
that the movement of the hand, which should end
on the right, frequently finishes on the left.<milestone unit="section" n="110"/> It is
therefore better, in view of the fact that all speech
falls into a number of brief clauses, at the end of
which we can take breath, if necessary, to arrange
our gesture to suit these sections. For example, the
words <hi rend="italics">novum crimes, Gai Caesar,</hi> in a sense form a
phrase complete in itself, since they are followed by
a conjunction, while the next words, <hi rend="italics">et ante hanc diem
non auditum,</hi> are also sufficiently self-contained. To
these phrases the motions of the hand must be conformed, before the speech has passed beyond the
calmness of tone on which it opens.<milestone unit="section" n="111"/> But when increasing warmth of feeling has fired the orator, the
gesture will become more frequent, in keeping with
the impetus of the speech. Some places are best
suited by a rapid, and others by a restrained delivery.
In the one case we pass rapidly on, fire a volley of
arguments and hurry upon our way; in the other, we
drive home our points, force them on the hearer and
implant them in his mind. But the slower the
delivery, the greater its emotional power: thus,
Rosins was rapid and ESOPs weighty in his delivery,
because the former was a comic and the latter a
tragic actor.<milestone unit="section" n="112"/> The same rule applies to the movemints. Consequently on the stage young men and
old, soldiers and married women all walk sedately,
while slaves, maidservants, parasites and fishermen
are more lively in their movements. But instructors
in the art of gesture will not permit the hand to be
raised above the level of the eyes or lowered beneath

<pb id="p.305"/>

that of the breast; since it is thought a grave blemish
to lift it to the top of the head<note>The general sense is clear, though the text is unsetsfactory and scarcely translatable.</note> or lower it to the lower
portions of the belly.<milestone unit="section" n="113"/> It may be moved to the left
within the limits of the shoulder, but no further
without loss of decorum. On the other hand, when,
to express our aversion, we thrust our hand out to
the left, the left shoulder must be brought forward
in unison with the head, which will incline to the
right.<milestone unit="section" n="114"/> It is never correct to employ the left hand
alone in gesture, though it will often conform its
motion to that of the right, as, for example, when
we are counting our arguments on the fingers, or
turn the palms of the hands to the left to express
our horror of something,<milestone unit="section" n="115"/> or thrust them out in front
or spread them out to right and left, or lower them in
apology or supplication (though the gesture is not
the same in these two cases), or raise them in adoration, or stretch them out in demonstration or invocation, as in the passage, <quote>Ye hills and groves of Alba,<note><hi rend="italics">pro Mil.</hi> xxxi. 85.</note></quote>
or in the passage from Gracchus<note>See <hi rend="italics">Cic.</hi> <hi rend="italics">de Or.</hi> III. lvi. 214.</note>: <quote>Whither, alas!
shall I turn me? To the Capitol? Nay, it is wet
with my brother's blood. To my home?</quote> etc.<milestone unit="section" n="116"/> For
in such passages greater emotional effect is produced if both hands co-operate, short gestures being
best adapted to matters of small importance and
themes of a gentle or melancholy character, and
longer gestures to subjects of importance or themes
calling for joy or horror.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="117"/>It is desirable also that I should mention the faults
in the use of the hands, into which even experienced
pleaders are liable to fall. As for the gesture of
demanding a cup, threatening a flogging, or indicating
the number 500 by crooking the thumb,<note><hi rend="italics">Le.</hi> crooking the thumb against the forefinger to
represent the symbol D.</note> all of which
are recorded by writers on the subject, I have never

<pb id="p.307"/>

seen them employed even by uneducated rustics.
<milestone unit="section" n="118"/>But I know that it is of frequent occurrence for a
speaker to expose his side by stretching his arm too
far, to be afraid in one case of extending his hand
beyond the folds of his cloak, and in another to
stretch it as far as it will go, to raise it to the roof,
or by swinging it repeatedly over his left shoulder to
deliver such a rain of blows to the rear that it is
scarcely safe to stand behind him, or to make a circular
sweep to the left, or by casting out his hand at
random to strike the standers-by or to flap both
elbows against his sides.<milestone unit="section" n="119"/> There are others, again,
whose hands are sluggish or tremulous or inclined to
saw the air; sometimes, too, the fingers are crooked
and brought down with a run from the top of the
head, or tossed up into the air with the hand turned
palm upwards. There is also a gesture, which consists in inclining the head to the right shoulder,
stretching out the arm from the ear and extending
the hand with the thumb turned down. This is a
special favourite with those who boast that they
speak <quote>with uplifted hand.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="120"/><note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> with exaggerated violence. See II. xii. 9.</note> To these latter we may
add those speakers who hurl quivering epigrams
with their fingers or denounce with the hand upraised, or rise on tiptoe, whenever they say something
of which they are specially proud. This last proceeding may at times be adopted by itself; but they
convert it into a blemish by simultaneously raising
one or even two fingers as high as they can reach, or
heaving up both hands as if they were carrying something.<milestone unit="section" n="121"/> In addition to these faults, there are those
which spring not from nature, but from nervousness,
such as struggling desperately with our lips when
they refuse to open, making inarticulate sounds, as

<pb id="p.309"/>

though something were sticking in our throat, when
our memory fails us, or our thoughts will not come
at our call; rubbing the end of our nose, walking up
and down in the midst of an unfinished sentence,
stopping suddenly and courting applause by silence,
with many other tricks which it would take too long
to detail, since everybody has his own particular
faults.<milestone unit="section" n="122"/> We must take care not to protrude the chest
or stomach, since such an altitude arches the back,
and all bending backwards is unsightly. The flanks
must conform to the gesture; for the motion of the
entire body contributes to the effect: indeed, Cicero
holds that the body is more expressive than even the
hands. For in the <hi rend="italics">de Orator</hi><note>xviii. 59.</note> he says, <quote>There must
be no quick movements of the fingers, no marking
time with the finger-tips, but the orator should
control himself by the poise of the whole trunk and
by a manly inclination of the side.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="123"/> Slapping the
thigh, which Clean is said to have been the first to
introduce at Athens, is in general use and is becoming
as a mark of indignation, while it also excites the
audience. Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">Brut.</hi> lax. 278.</note> regrets its absence in Calidius,
<quote>There was no striking of the forehead,</quote> he complains, <quote>nor of the thigh.</quote> With regard to the
forehead I must beg leave to differ from him: for it
is a purely theatrical trick even to clap the hands or
beat the breast.<milestone unit="section" n="124"/> it is only on rare occasions, too,
that it is becoming to touch the breast with the
finger-tips of the hollowed hand, when, for example,
we address ourselves or speak words of exhortation,
reproach or commiseration. But if ever we do employ
this gesture, it will not be unbecoming to pull back
the toga at the same time. As regards the feet, we
need to be careful about our gait and the attitudes

<pb id="p.311"/>

in which we stand. To stand with the right foot
advanced or to thrust forward the same foot and
hand are alike unsightly.<milestone unit="section" n="125"/> At times we may rest our
weight on the right foot, but without any corresponding inclination of the chest, while, in any case,
the gesture is better suited to the comic actor than to
the orator. It is also a mistake, when resting on the
left foot, to lift the right or poise it on tiptoe. To
straddle the feet is ugly if we are standing still, and
almost indecent if we are actually moving. To start
forward may be effective, provided that we move but
a short distance and do so but rarely and without
violence.<milestone unit="section" n="126"/> It will also at times be found convenient
to walk to and fro, owing to the extravagant pauses
imposed by the plaudits of the audience; Cicero,<note><hi rend="italics">Orat.</hi> xviii. 59.</note>
however, says that this should be done only on rare
occasions, and that we should take not more than a
few steps. On the other hand, to run up and down,
which, in the ease of Manlius Sure,<note>See VI. iii. 54.</note> Domitius Afer
called overdoing it, is sheer folly, and there was no
little wit in the question put by Virginias Flatus to
a rival professor, when he asked how many miles he
had declaimed.<milestone unit="section" n="127"/> I know, too, that some authorities
warn us not to walk with our backs turned to the
judges, but to move diagonally and keep our eyes
fixed on the panel. This cannot be done in private
trials, but in such cases the space available is small
and the time during which our backs are turned is of
the briefest.<note>The normal arrangement was for the president of the
court and judges to sit on a <hi rend="italics">tribunal</hi> or dais. The advocates
and parties to the suit were on the ground in front. When
pleading before a large jury the orator could walk diagonally,
half-facing the jury, without at any rate turning his back on
too many at a time. When, however, there was but a single
judge, as in a private trial, the feat would he more difficult,
But apparently the court took up less room in such cases,
and the orator's peregrinations would be but small. See
&sect; 134 note.</note> On the other hand, we are permitted
at times to walk backwards gradually. Some even
jump backwards, which is merely ludicrous.<milestone unit="section" n="128"/> Stamping the foot is, as Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">de Or.</hi> iii. lix. 220.</note> says, effective when done
on suitable occasions, that is to say, at the commence
meant or close of a lively argument, but if it be

<pb id="p.313"/>

frequently indulged in, it brands the speaker as a
fool and ceases to attract the attention of the judge.
There is also the unsightly habit of swaying to right
and left, and shifting the weight from one foot to
the other. Above all, we must avoid effeminate
movements, such as Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">Brut.</hi> lxii.</note> ascribes to Titus, a circumstance which led to a certain kind of dance being
nicknamed Titus.<milestone unit="section" n="129"/> Another reprehensible practice
is that of nodding frequently and rapidly to either
side, a mannerism for which the elder Curio<note><hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> Cic. <hi rend="italics">Brut.</hi> lx.</note> was derided by Julius, who asked who it was who was speaking in a boat, while on another occasion, when Curio
had been tossing himself about in his usual manner,
while Octaves, his colleague, was sitting beside him
bandaged and reeking with medicaments on account
of ill-health, Spiciness remarked, <quote>Octaves, you can
never be sufficiently grateful to your colleague: for
if he wasn't there, the flies would have devoured you
this very day where you sit.<milestone unit="section" n="130"/></quote> The shoulders also
are apt to be jerked to and fro, a fault of which
Demosthenes is said to have cured himself by
speaking on a narrow platform with a spear hanging
immediately above his shoulder, in order that, if in
the heat of his eloquence he failed to avoid this
fault, he might have his attention called to the
fact by a prick from the spear. The only condition
that justifies our walking about while speaking is
if we are pleading in a public trial before a large
number of judges and desire specially to impress our
arguments upon them individually.<milestone unit="section" n="131"/> The practice
adopted by some of throwing the toga back over the
shoulder, while they draw up the fold to their waist
with the right hand, and use the left for gesticulation
as they walk up and down and discourse, is not to

<pb id="p.315"/>

be tolerated; for even to draw back the left hand
while extending the right is an objectionable habit.
This reminds me of an extremely foolish trick, which
I think I ought to mention, that some speakers have
of employing the intervals when the audience are
applauding by whispering in someone's ear or jesting
with their friends or looking back at their clerks, as
if telling them to make a note of some gratuity to
be dispensed to their supporters.<milestone unit="section" n="132"/> On the other
hand, when we are making some explanation to the
judge, more especially if the point be somewhat
obscure, a slight inclination in his direction will be
not unbecoming. But to lean forward towards the
advocate seated on the benches of our opponent is
offensive, while, unless we are genuinely fatigued, it
is a piece of affectation to lean back among our own
friends and to be supported in their arms; the same
remark also applies to the practice of being prompted
aloud or reading from manuscript as though uncertain of our memory.<milestone unit="section" n="133"/> For all these mannerisms impair the force of our speaking, chill the
effect of emotional appeals and make the judge
think that he is not being treated with sufficient
respect. To cross over to the seats of our opponents
borders on impudence, and Cassius Severus showed
a neat turn of wit when he demanded that a barrier
might be erected between himself and an opponent
who behaved in this fashion. Moreover, though to
advance towards our opponent may at times produce
an impression of passionate energy, the return to
our former position will always prove correspondingly
tame.<milestone unit="section" n="134"/> Many of the rules which I have given will
require modification by those who have to plead
before judges seated on a dais.<note>Astonish (in a note on the <hi rend="italics">Divination</hi> of Cicero) explains
that in minor cases tried by <hi rend="italics">tribuni, triumviri, quaestores</hi>
and other minor officils, the judges sat on ordinary benches,
not on a raised <hi rend="italics">tribuat.</hi></note> For in such

<pb id="p.317"/>

cases the face must be raised somewhat higher, so
that the speaker's eyes may be fixed on the president
of the court: for the same reason his gestures must
also be carried a little higher, while there are other
details which will readily occur to my reader without
any mention from me. Similar modifications will
be likewise necessary for those who plead sitting.<note><hi rend="italics">Cp.</hi> XI. i. 44, which shows that the cases in question are
those submitted to arbitration.</note>
For this is done, as a rule, only in cases of minor
importance, where delivery will necessarily be more
restrained, and certain defects are inevitable.<milestone unit="section" n="135"/> For
example, when the speaker sits on the left side of the
judge, he will have to advance his right foot, while
if he be seated on the right, many of his gestures
must be made from right to left, in order that they
may be addressed to the judge. Personally, I note
that many speakers start up at the conclusion of
individual periods, while some proceed to walk to
and fro for a little: it is for them to decide whether
this is becoming or not: I will merely remark that,
when they do this, they are not pleading seated.
<milestone unit="section" n="136"/>It was a common custom, which has not entirely
disappeared, to drink or even to eat while pleading;
but I shall not permit my ideal orator to do anything
of the kind. For if a man cannot endure the
burdens imposed by oratory without having recourse
to such remedies, he should not find it a serious
hardship to give up pleading altogether, a course
which is far preferable to acknowledging his contempt
both for his profession and his audience.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="137"/>With regard to dress, there is no special garb
peculiar to the orator, but his dress comes more
under the public eye than that of other men. It
should, therefore, be distinguished and manly, as,
indeed, it ought to be with all men of position. For

<pb id="p.319"/>

excessive care with regard to the cut of the toga,<note>In putting on the toga, it was thrown first over the left
shoulder, so that about 6 feet hung in front and about 12
behind. This longer portion was then carried round under
the right arm and then diagonally across the chest (like a
<hi rend="italics">balleus,</hi> or belt) and over the left shoulder again. A fold of
this portion hanging in front formed the <hi rend="italics">sinus.</hi> The original
<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>feet hanging in front from the left shoulder now hung
below the rest. A portion was pulled up from above and
Allowed to hang over the edge of that portion of the toga
which Quintilian compares to a <hi rend="italics">balleus.</hi> This was known
as the <hi rend="italics">umbo,</hi> and is described by Quintilian as <hi rend="italics">pars quae
ultima imponitur.</hi> He recommends that a considerable
portion should be thus pulled up and allowed to hang fairly
low in front over the edge of the <hi rend="italics">balteus,</hi> that the weight
of the hanging portion might balance the remainder of the
original 6 feet of toga hanging from the left shoulder, keep
it in place and prevent it from slipping lack into its original
position. The toga was very nearly semicircular in shape,
which explains Quintilian's statement that it should be
round. For further details see <hi rend="italics">Companion to Latin Studies,</hi>
Camb. Univ. Press, p. 191.</note>
the style of the shoes, or the arrangement of the
hair, is just as reprehensible as excessive carelessness. There are also details of dress which are
altered to some extent by successive changes in
fashion. The ancients, for example, wore no folds,
and their successors wore them very short.<milestone unit="section" n="138"/> Consequently it follows that in view of the fact that their
arms were, like those of the Greeks, covered by the
garment, they must have employed a different form of
gesture in the exordium from that which is now in
use. However, I am speaking of our own day. The
speaker who has not the right to wear the broad
stripe,<note>Worn by senators.</note> will wear his girdle in such a way that the
front edges of the tunic fall a little below his knees,
while the edges in rear reach to the middle of his
hams. For only women draw them lower and only
centurions higher.<milestone unit="section" n="139"/> If we wear the purple stripe, it
requires but little care to see that it fills becomingly;
negligence in this respect sometimes excites criticism. Among those who wear the broad stripe, it is
the fashion to let it hang somewhat lower than in
garments that are retained by the girdle. The toga
itself should, in my opinion, be round, and cut to
fit, otherwise there are a number of ways in which it
may be unshapely. Its front edge should by preference reach to the middle of the shin, while tie back
should be higher in proposition as the girdle is higher

<pb id="p.321"/>

behind than in front.<milestone unit="section" n="140"/> The fold is most becoming,
if it fall to a point a little above the lower edge of
the tunic, and should certainly never fall below it.
The other fold which passes obliquely like a belt
under the right shoulder and over the left, should
neither be too tight nor too loose. The portion of
the toga which is last to be arranged should fall
rather low, since it will sit better thus and be
kept in its place. A portion of the tunic also should
be drawn back in order that it may not fall over the
arm when we are pleading, and the fold should be
thrown over the shoulder, while it will not be
unbecoming if the edge be turned back.<milestone unit="section" n="141"/> On the
other hand, we should not cover the shoulder and
the whole of the throat, otherwise our dress will be
unduly narrowed and will lose the impressive effect
produced by breadth at the chest. Tire left arm
should only be raised so far as to form a right angle
at the elbow, while the edge of the toga should fall
in equal lengths on either side.<milestone unit="section" n="142"/> The hand should
not be overloaded with rings, which should under no
circumstances encroach upon the middle joint of
the finger. The most becoming attitude for the
hand is produced by raising the thumb and slightly
curving the fingers, unless it is occupied with holding manuscript. But we should not go out of our
way to carry the latter, for it suggests an acknowledgement that we do not trust our memory, and is
a hindrance to a number of gestures.<milestone unit="section" n="143"/> The ancients
used to let the toga fall to the heels, as the Greeks
are in the habit of doing with the cloak: Plotius
and Nigidius<note>Plotins Gallus, a rhetorician, and Nigidius Figulus, an
encyclopaedic writer, both contemporaries of Cicero.</note> both recommend this in the books
which they wrote about gesture as practised in
their own day. I am consequently all the more

<pb id="p.323"/>

surprised at the view expressed by so learned a
man as Plinius Secundus, especially since it occurs
in a book which carries minute research almost to
excess:<note>This work of the elder Pliny was called <hi rend="italics">Studiusus.</hi></note> for he asserts that Cicero was in the
habit of wearing his toga in such a fashion to conceal his varicose veins, despite the fact that this
fashion is to be seen in the statues of persons who
lived after Cicero's day.<milestone unit="section" n="144"/> As regards the short cloak,
bandages used to protect the legs, mufflers and
coverings for the ears, nothing short of ill-health
can excuse their use.</p>
<p>But such attention to our dress is only possible at
the beginning of a speech, since, as the pleading
develops, in fact, almost from the beginning of the
<hi rend="italics">statement of facts,</hi> the fold will slip down from the
shoulder quite naturally and as it were of its own
accord, while when we come to arguments and
commonplaces, it will be found convenient to throw
back the toga from the left shoulder, and even to
throw down the fold if it should stick.<milestone unit="section" n="145"/> The left
hand may be employed to pluck the toga from the
throat and the upper portion of the chest, for by
now the whole body will be hot. And just as at
this point the voice becomes more vehement and
more varied in its utterance, so the clothing begins
to assume something of a combative pose.<milestone unit="section" n="146"/> Consequently, although to wrap the toga round the left
hand or to pull it about us as a girdle would be
almost a symptom of madness, while to throw back
the fold from its bottom over the right shoulder
would be a foppish and effeminate gesture, and
there are yet worse effects than these, there is, at
any rate, no reason why we should not place the
looser portions of the fold under the left arm, since

<pb id="p.325"/>

it gives an air of vigour and freedom not ill-suited
to the warmth and energy of our action.<milestone unit="section" n="147"/> When,
however, our speech draws near its close, more
especially if fortune shows herself kind, practically
everything is becoming; we may stream with sweat,
show signs of fatigue, and let our dress fall in careless disorder and the toga slip loose from us on
every side.<milestone unit="section" n="148"/> This fact makes me all the more surprised that Pliny should think it worth while to
enjoin the orator to dry his brow with a handkerchief in such a way as not to disorder the hair,
although a little later he most properly, and with a
certain gravity and sternness of language, forbids
us to rearrange it. For my own part, I feel that
dishevelled locks make an additional appeal to the
emotions, and that neglect of such precautions
creates a pleasing impression.<milestone unit="section" n="149"/> On the other hand,
if the toga falls down at the beginning of our
speech, or when we have only proceeded but a little
way, the failure to replace it is a sign of indifference,
or sloth, or sheer ignorance of the way in which
clothes should be worn.</p>
<p>The above are the chief adornments and faults
of delivery. But there are a number of further
considerations which the orator must bear in mind.
<milestone unit="section" n="150"/>In the first place there is the question as to the
character of speaker, judges and audience. For
just as the methods of speaking may justifiably be
varied to suit the characteristics of different orators
and different judges, so it is with delivery. The
same characteristics of voice, gesture and gait are
not equally becoming in the presence of the
emperor, the senate, the people, and magistrates,
or in private and public trials, or in making a

<pb id="p.327"/>

request to the praetor for the appointment of a judge
to hear our case, and in actual pleading. Anyone
who will reflect upon the matter will realise the
nature of the differences involved, as he will also be
able to realise the nature of the subject on which
he is speaking and the effect which he desires to
produce.<milestone unit="section" n="151"/> The considerations with regard to the
subject are four in number, of which the first has
reference to the case as a whole. For the case may
be of a gloomy or a cheerful nature, an anxious
business, or one that calls for no alarm, and may
involve issues of great or trivial importance. We
ought, therefore, never to be so preoccupied over
particular portions of a case as to forget to consider
the case as a whole.<milestone unit="section" n="152"/> The second point is concerned
with the different aspects of the various portions of
the speech, that is, the <hi rend="italics">exordium, statement of facts,
arguments</hi> and <hi rend="italics">peroration.</hi> The third concerns the
thoughts, which will vary according to the subject
matter and the emotions which we require to
awaken. The fourth has reference to the words,
which must be given appropriate expression, unless
their force is to be entirely wasted, although it is an
error to attempt to make our delivery reproduce the
sense of every single word.<milestone unit="section" n="153"/> Consequently, in panegyric, funeral orations excepted, in returning thanks,
exhortations and the like, the delivery must be
luxuriant, magnificent, and grand. On the other
hand, in funeral or consolatory speeches, together
with most of those in defence of accused persons,
the delivery will be melancholy and subdued.
When we speak in the senate, it will be authoritative, when we address the people, dignified, and
when we are pleading in private cases, restrained.

<pb id="p.329"/>

As regards the respective portions of speeches,
thoughts and words, I must speak at somewhat
greater length, as the problems involved are manifold.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="154"/>There are three qualities which delivery should
possess. It should be conciliatory, persuasive and
moving, and the possession of these three qualities
involves charm as a further requisite. A conciliatory
effect may be secured either by charm of style or
by producing an impression of excellence of character,
which is in some mysterious way clearly revealed
both by voice and gesture. A persuasive effect, on
the other hand, is produced by the power of assertion,
which is sometimes more convincing even than actual
proof.<milestone unit="section" n="155"/> <quote>Would those statements,</quote> says Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">Brut.</hi> lxxx. 278.</note> to
Calidius, <quote>have been delivered by you in such a
manner if they had been true?</quote> And again, <quote>You
were far from kindling our emotions. Indeed, at
that point of your speech we could scarcely keep
ourselves awake.</quote> We must therefore reveal both
confidence and firmness, above all, if we have the
requisite authority to back them.<milestone unit="section" n="156"/> The method of
arousing the emotions depends on our power to
represent or imitate the passions. Therefore when
the judge in private, or the usher in public cases,
calls upon us to speak, we must rise with deliberation.
We shall then, to make our garb the more becoming,
and to secure a moment for reflexion, devote a brief
space to the arrangement of our toga or even, if
necessary, to throwing it on afresh; but it must
be borne in mind that this injunction applies only
to cases in the courts; for <hi rend="italics">we</hi> must not do this if
we are speaking before the emperor or a magistrate,
or in cases where the judge sits in a position of
superior authority.<milestone unit="section" n="157"/> Even when we turn to the judge,

<pb id="p.331"/>

and have requested and received the praetor's permission to address the court, we must not break forth
at once into speech, but should allow ourselves a few
moments for reflexion. For the display of such care
on the part of one who is about to speak attracts the
audience and gives the judge time to settle down.
<milestone unit="section" n="158"/>Homer<note><hi rend="italics">Il.</hi> iii. 217.</note> inculcates this practice by placing before
us the example of Ulysses, whom he describes as
having stood for a while with eyes fixed on the
ground and staff held motionless, before he poured
forth his whirlwind of eloquence. In this preliminary
delay there are certain pauses, as the actors call
them, which are not unbecoming. We may stroke
our head, look at our hand, wring the fingers, pretend to summon all our energies for the effort,
confess to nervousness by a deep sigh, or may adopt
any other method suited to our individual character,
while these proceedings may be extended over some
time, if we find that the judge is not yet giving us
his attention.<milestone unit="section" n="159"/> Our attitude should be upright, our
feet level and a slight distance apart, or the left may
be very slightly advanced. The knees should be
upright, but not stiff; the shoulders relaxed, the face
stern, but not sad, expressionless or languid: the
arms should be held slightly away from the side,
the left hand being in the position described above,<note>Sect. 142.</note>
while the right, at the moment when our speech
begins, should be slightly extended beyond the fold
of the toga with the most modest of gestures, as
though waiting for the commencement.<milestone unit="section" n="160"/> For it is
a mistake to look at the ceiling, to rub the face and
give it a flush of impudence, to crane it boldly forward, to frown in order to secure a fierce expression,
or brush back the hair from the forehead against its

<pb id="p.333"/>

natural direction in order to produce a terrifying
effect by making it stand on end. Again, there are
other unseemly tricks, such as that so dear to the
Greeks of twitching our fingers and lips as though
studying what to say, clearing the throat with a
loud noise, thrusting out one foot to a considerable
distance, grasping a portion of the toga in the left
hand, standing with feet wide apart, holding ourselves
stiffly, leaning backwards, stooping, or bunching our
shoulders toward the back of the head, as wrestlers
do when about to engage.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="161"/>A gentle delivery is most often best suited to the
<hi rend="italics">exordium.</hi> For there is nothing better calculated
than modesty to win the good-will of the judge,
although there are exceptions to the rule, since, as I
have already pointed out,<note>IV. i. 40.</note> all <hi rend="italics">exordia</hi> are not delivered
in the same manner. But, generally speaking, a
quiet voice, a modest gesture, a toga sitting well
upon the shoulder, and a gentle motion of the sides
to right and left, accompanied by a corresponding
movement of the eyes, will all be found to produce
a becoming effect.<milestone unit="section" n="162"/> In the <hi rend="italics">statement of facts</hi> the hand
should on most occasions be further extended, the
toga allowed to slip back, the gestures sharply distinguished and the voice colloquial, but slightly more
emphatic, while there should also be uniformity of
tone. Such, at any rate, should be the delivery of
a passage such as the following:<note>pro Lig.<hi rend="italics">i.</hi> 2.</note> <quote>For Quintus
Ligarius, since there was no hint of the likelihood of
the war in Africa,</quote> or<note><hi rend="italics">pro Cluenet.</hi> v. 11.</note> <quote>Aulus Cluentius Habitus,
this man's father.</quote> But different methods may be
called for in this same portion of the speech, in
passionate utterances such as, <quote>The mother-in-law
weds her son-in-law,</quote><note><hi rend="italics">pro Cluent. v.</hi> 14.</note> or in pathetic passages such

<pb id="p.335"/>

as, <quote>There in the market-place of Laodicea was displayed a grievous and afflicting spectacle for all the
province of Asia to behold.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="163"/><note><hi rend="italics">Verr.</hi> xxx. 76</note> The <hi rend="italics">proofs,</hi> however,
require the utmost variety of delivery. For to state
them and distinguish between their various points,
and to examine witnesses, we employ something not
far removed from a colloquial tone, as is also the case
in anticipating objections, which is really another
form of statement. But in all these cases we sometimes deride, and sometimes mimic our opponents.
<milestone unit="section" n="164"/><hi rend="italics">Argument,</hi> being as a rule of a livelier, more energetic
and aggressive character, demands a type of gesture
adapted to its style, that is to say, it should be bold
and rapid. There are certain portions of our arguments that require to be pressed home with energy,
and in these our style must be compact and concentrated. <hi rend="italics">Digressions,</hi> as a rule, are characterised by
gentleness, calm and placidity, as, for example, in
Cicero's description of the Rape of Proserpine,<note><hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> IV. iii. 13.</note> his
picture of Sicily,<note><hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> IV. iii. 13.</note> or his panegyric of Pompey.<note>In the lost <hi rend="italics">pro Cornelio: cp.</hi> IV. iii. 13.</note> For
naturally passages which deal with subjects lying
outside the main question in dispute demand a less
combative tone.<milestone unit="section" n="165"/> There are occasions on which we
may adopt a gentle manner in depreciating our
opponents by giving a picture of their character, as
in the following passage:<note>From the lost <hi rend="italics">pro Galio.</hi></note> <quote>I seemed to see some
persons entering the room and others leaving it,
while others were staggering to and fro under the
influence of wine.</quote> Under such circumstances we
may even allow the gesture to match the voice, and
may employ a gentle movement from side to side:
but this motion should be confined to the hands, and
there should be no movement of the flanks.<milestone unit="section" n="166"/> There
are a number of gradations of tone which may be

<pb id="p.337"/>

employed to kindle the feeling of the judges. The
most vehement tones that an orator is ever called
upon to use will be employed in passages such as
the following:<note><hi rend="italics">pro Liq.</hi> iii. 7 and 6.</note> <quote>When the war was begun, Caesar,
and was, in fact, well on its way to a conclusion.</quote>
For he has just said: <quote>I will use my voice to its
fullest power, that all the Roman people may hear
me.</quote> On the other hand, a lower tone, not devoid
of a certain charm, should be employed in passages
such as:<note><hi rend="italics">pro Liq.</hi> iii. 9.</note> <quote>What was that sword of yours doing,
'Tubero, that sword that was drawn on the field of
Pharsalus?</quote><milestone unit="section" n="167"/> But the utterance must be fuller,
slower, and consequently sweeter, when the orator
says,<note><hi rend="italics">Phil.</hi> ii. xxv. 63.</note> <quote>But in an assembly of the Homan people,
and when he was performing his official functions.</quote>
In this passage every sound should e drawn out,
we should dwell upon the vowel-sounds and speak
fill-throated. Still fuller should be the stream of our
voice in the invocation,<note><hi rend="italics">pro Mil.</hi> xxxi. 85.</note> <quote>You, hills and groves of
Alba</quote>; while a tone not far removed from chanting,
and dying away to a cadence, should be employed in
delivering the phrase,<note><hi rend="italics">pro Arch.</hi> viii. 19.</note> <quote>Rocks and solitudes answer
to the voice.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="168"/> These are the modulations denounced
by Demosthenes<note><hi rend="italics">de Cor. 90.</hi></note> and Aeschines,<note><hi rend="italics">In Ctes.</hi> 72.</note> but they do not
necessarily for that reason merit our disapprobation.
For as each of these orators taunts the other with
making use of them, it is clear that they were employed
by both. We may be sure that Demosthenes did not
restrict himself to his ordinary simplicity of tone when
he swore by those that fought for their country at
Marathon, Plataea and Salamis,<note><hi rend="italics">De Cor.</hi> 60.</note> nor did Aeschines
employ a colloquial utterance when he lamented for
the fate of Thebes.<note><hi rend="italics">In Ctes.</hi> 49.</note><milestone unit="section" n="169"/> There is also an entirely different
tone, which might be described as lying almost

<pb id="p.339"/>

outside the range of the instrument. The Greeks
call it bitterness, and it consists in an extravagant
acerbity almost beyond the compass of the human
voice. It is employed in passages such as,<note><hi rend="italics">pro Rab. perd.</hi> vi. 18.</note> <quote>Why
do you not restrain those cries, the proof of your
folly and the evidence of your small numbers?</quote>
But the extravagance of which I spoke will come
in at the opening, where the orator cries, <quote>Why do
you not restrain?</quote></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="170"/>The <hi rend="italics">peroration,</hi> if it involves a recapitulation,
requires an even utterance of short, clear-cut
clauses. If, on the other hand, it is designed to
stir the emotions of the judges, it will demand
some of the qualities already mentioned. If it aims
at soothing them, it should How softly; if it is to
rouse them to pity, the voice must be delicately
modulated to a melancholy sweetness, which is at
once most natural and specially adapted to touch
the heart. For it may be noted that even orphans
and widows have a certain musical quality in the
lamentations which they utter at funerals.<milestone unit="section" n="171"/> A
muffled voice, such as Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">Brutt.</hi> xxxviii. 141.</note> says was possessed
by Antonius, will also be exceedingly effective under
such circumstances, since it has just the natural
tone which we seek to imitate. Appeals to pity
are, however, of two kinds: they may be marked
by an admixture of indignation, as in the passage
just quoted<note>&sect; 162.</note> describing the condemnation of Philodamus, or they may be coupled with appeals for
mercy, in which case their tone will be more subdued.<milestone unit="section" n="172"/> Therefore although there is a suggestion of
the chanting tone in the delivery of such passages
as <quote>In an assembly of the Roman people</quote> (for he did
not utter these words in a contentious tone), or in

<pb id="p.341"/>

<quote>Ye hills and groves of Alba</quote> (for he did not say this
as though he were appealing to them or calling them
to witness), the ensuing phrases<note><hi rend="italics">pro Mil.</hi> xxxvii. 102.</note> require infinitely
greater modulation and longer-drawn harmonies:
<quote>Ah, woe is me, unhappy that I am!</quote> and <quote>What
shall I reply to my children?</quote> and <quote>You, Milo, had
the power to recall me to my country with the aid of
these men, and shall I be powerless by their aid to
keep you in that same country, your native land
and mine?</quote> or when he offers to sell the property of
Gaius Rabirius at one sesterce, <quote>Ah, what a sad and
bitter task my voice is called on to perform!</quote><note><hi rend="italics">pro Rab. Post,</hi> xvii. 46. <hi rend="italics">addicit,</hi> lit. <quote>knocks down</quote>:
<hi rend="italics">praeconium,</hi> lit. <quote>the task of the public crier.</quote></note> Again,<milestone unit="section" n="173"/>
it is a most effective device to confess in the peroration
that the strain of grief and fatigue is overpowering,
and that our strength is sinking beneath them, as
Cicero does in his defence of Milo:<note><hi rend="italics">pro Mil.</hi> xxxviii. 105.</note> <quote>But here I must
make an end: I can no longer speak for tears.</quote> And
in such passages our delivery must conform to our
words.<milestone unit="section" n="174"/> It may be thought that there are other points
which should be mentioned in connexion with the
duties of the orator in this portion of his speech, such
as calling forward the accused, lifting up his children
for the court to see, producing his kinsfolk, and
rending his garments; but they have been dealt
with in their proper place.<note>VI. i. 30.</note></p>
<p>Such being the variety entailed by the different
portions of our pleading, it is sufficiently clear that
our delivery must be adapted to our matter, as I
have already shown, and sometimes also, though
not always conform to our actual words, as I have
just remarked.<note>&sect; 173.</note><milestone unit="section" n="175"/> For instance, must not the words,
<quote>This poor wretched, poverty-stricken man,</quote> be
uttered in a low, subdued tone, whereas, <quote>A hold
and violent fellow and a robber,</quote> is a phrase

<pb id="p.343"/>

requiring a strong and energetic utterance? For
such conformity gives a force and appropriateness
to our matter, and without it the expression of
the voice will be out of harmony with our thought.
<milestone unit="section" n="176"/>Again, what of the fact that a change of delivery
may make precisely the same words either demonstrate or affirm, express reproach, denial, wonder or
indignation, interrogation, mockery or depreciation?
For the word <quote>thou</quote> is given a different expression
in each of the following passages:

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>Thou this poor kingdom dost on me bestow.</l></quote><bibl><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> i. 78.</bibl></cit></quote>

and

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>Thou vanquish him in song?</l></quote><bibl><hi rend="italics">Ecl.</hi> iii. 25.</bibl></cit></quote>

and

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>Art thou, then, that Aeneas?</l></quote><bibl><hi rend="italics">Aen</hi> i. 617.</bibl></cit></quote>

and

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l part="F">And of fear,</l>
<l>Do thou accuse me, Drances!</l></quote><bibl><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> xi. 383.</bibl></cit></quote>

To cut a long matter short, if my reader will take
this or any other word he chooses and run it through
the whole gamut of emotional expression, he will
realise the truth of what I say.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="177"/>There is one further remark which I must add,
namely, that while what is becoming is the main
consideration in delivery, different methods will often
suit different speakers. For this is determined by
a principle which, though it is obscure and can
hardly be expressed in words, none the less
exists: and, though it is a true saying<note><hi rend="italics">de Or.</hi> I. xxix. 132</note> that
<quote>the main secret of artistic success is that whatever we do should become us well,</quote> none the
less, despite the fact that such success cannot be

<pb id="p.345"/>

attained without art, it is impossible entirely to communicate the secret by the rules of art.<milestone unit="section" n="178"/> There are
some persons in whom positive excellences have no
charm, while there are others whose very faults give
pleasure. We have seen the greatest of comic actors,
Demetrius and Stratocles, win their success by
entirely different merits. But that is the less
surprising owing to the fact that the one was at his
best in the r&ocirc;les of gods, young men, good fathers
and slaves, matrons and respectable old women,
while the other excelled in the portrayal of sharptempered old men, cunning slaves, parasites, pimps
and all the more lively characters of comedy. For
their natural gifts differed. For Demetrius' voice,
like his other qualities, had greater charm, while
that of Stratocles was the more powerful.<milestone unit="section" n="179"/> But
yet more noticeable were the incommunicable
peculiarities of their action. Demetrius showed
unique gifts in the movements of his hands, in
his power to charm his audience by the longdrawn sweetness of his exclamations, the skill with
which he would make his dress seem to puff out
with wind as he walked, and the expressive movements of the right side which he sometimes introduced with effect, in all of which things he was
helped by his stature and personal beauty.<milestone unit="section" n="180"/> On the
other hand, Stratocles' <hi rend="italics">forte</hi> lay in his nimbleness
and rapidity of movement, in his laugh (which,
though not always in keeping with the character
lie represented, he deliberately employed to awaken
answering laughter in his audience), and finally, even
in the way in which he sank his neck into his
shoulders. If either of these actors had attempted
any of his rival's tricks, he would have produced a

<pb id="p.347"/>

most unbecoming effect. Consequently, every man
must get to know his own peculiarities and must
consult not merely the general rules of technique,
but his own nature as well with a view to forming
his delivery.<milestone unit="section" n="181"/> But there is no law of heaven which
prohibits the possession of all or at any rate the
majority of styles by one and the same person. I
must conclude this topic with a remark which applies
to all my other topics as well, that the prime essential
is a sense of proportion. For I am not trying to
form a comic actor, but an orator. Consequently,
we need not study all the details of gesture nor, as
regards our speaking, be pedantic in the use we
make of the rules governing punctuation, rhythm
and appeals to the emotions.<milestone unit="section" n="182"/> For example, if an
actor has to speak the following lines on the stage:<note>Ter. <hi rend="italics">Eun.</hi> I. i. 1.</note>

<quote rend="blockquote">
<quote><l>What shall I do then? Not go, even now,</l>
<l>Now when she calls me? Or shall I steel my soul</l>
<l>No longer to endure a harlot's insults?</l></quote></quote>

he will hesitate as in doubt, will vary the modulations
of his voice, together with the movements of hand
and head. But oratory has a different flavour and
objects to elaborate condiments, since it consists in
serious pleading, not in mimicry.<milestone unit="section" n="183"/> There is, therefore, good reason for the condemnation passed on a
delivery which entails the continual alteration of
facial expression, annoying restlessness of gesture
and gusty changes of tone. And it was a wise saying
that the ancient orators borrowed from the Greeks,
as is recorded by Popilius Laenas, to the effect that
there is too much <quote>business</quote> in such delivery.<milestone unit="section" n="184"/> The
instructions given by Cicero on this subject, as on all
others, are quite admirable; I allude to the passages

<pb id="p.349"/>

which I have already quoted from his <hi rend="italics">Orator,</hi><note>&sect; 122.</note> while
there are similar observations in the <hi rend="italics">Brutus</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Brut.</hi> xxxviii. 141.</note> with
reference to Marcus Antonius. But to-day a rather
more violent form of delivery has come into fashion
and is demanded of our orators: it is well adapted to
certain portions of a speech, but requires to be kept
under control. Otherwise, in our attempt to ape
the elegances of the stage, we shall lose the authority
which should characterise the man of dignity and
virtue.</p></div1>

<head>Introduction</head>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="pr"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>I now come to what is by far the most arduous
portion of the task which I have set myself to perform. Indeed had I fully realised the difficulties
when I first designed this work, I should have considered betimes whether my strength was sufficient to
support the load that now weighs upon me so heavily.
But to begin with, I felt how shameful it would be
to fail to perform what I had promised, and later,
despite the fact that my labour became more and
more arduous at almost every stage, the fear of
stultifying what I had already written sustained my
courage through every difficulty.<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Consequently
even now, though the burden that oppresses me is
greater than ever, the end is in sight and I am
resolved to faint by the wayside rather than despair.
But the fact that I began with comparatively trivial
details deceived me. Subsequently I was lured still
further on my voyage by the temptations of the
favouring breeze that filled my sails; but the rules
which I was then concerned to give were still of a
familiar kind and had been already treated by most
writers of rhetorical textbooks: thus far I seemed to
myself to be still in sight of shore and I had the
company of many who had ventured to entrust themselves to the self-same winds.<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But presently when
I entered on the task of setting forth a theory of

<pb id="p.355"/>

eloquence which had been but newly discovered and
rarely essayed, I found but few that had ventured so
far from harbour. And finally now that the ideal
orator, whom it was my design to mould, has been
dismissed by his masters and is either proceeding
on his way borne onward by his own impetus, or
seeking still mightier assistance from the innermost
shrine of wisdom, I begin to feel how far I have
been swept into the great deep.<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Now there is

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>Nothing before and nothing behind but the sky
and the Ocean.</l></quote><bibl><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> iii. 193.</bibl></cit></quote>

One only can I discern in all the boundless waste of
waters, Marcus Tullius Cicero, and even he, though
the ship in which he entered these seas is of such
size and so well found, begins to lessen sail and to
row a slower stroke, and is content to speak merely
of the kind of speech to be employed by the perfect
orator. But my temerity is such that I shall essay to
form my orator's character and to teach him his duties.
Thus I have no predecessor to guide my steps and
must press far, far on, as my theme may demand.
Still an honourable ambition is always deserving of
approval, and it is all the less hazardous to dare
greatly, when forgiveness is assured us if we fail.</p>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The orator then, whom I am concerned to form,
shall be the orator as defined by Marcus Cato, <quote>a good
man, skilled in speaking.</quote><note><hi rend="italics">cp. I. Pr.</hi> 9.</note> But above all he must
possess the quality which Cato places first and which
is in the very nature of things the greatest and most
important, that is, he must be a good man. This is
essential not merely on account of the fact that, if
the powers of eloquence serve only to lend arms to
crime, there can be nothing more pernicious than

<pb id="p.357"/>

eloquence to public and private welfare alike, while
I myself, who have laboured to the best of my ability
to contribute something of value to oratory, shall have
rendered the worst of services to mankind, if I forge
these weapons not for a soldier, but for a robber.
But why speak of myself?<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Nature herself will have
proved not a mother, but a stepmother with regard
to what we deem her greatest gift to man, the gift
that distinguishes us from other living things, if she
devised the power of speech to be the accomplice of
crime, the foe to innocency and the enemy of truth.
For it had been better for men to be born dumb and
devoid of reason than to turn the gifts of providence
to their mutual destruction.<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But this conviction of
mine goes further. For I do not merely assert that
the ideal orator should be a good man, but I affirm
that no man can be an orator unless he is a good man.
For it is impossible to regard those men as gifted
with intelligence who on being offered the choice
between the two paths of virtue and of vice choose
the latter, nor can we allow them prudence, when
by the unforeseen issue of their own actions they
render themselves liable not merely to the heaviest
penalties of the laws, but to the inevitable torment
of an evil conscience.<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But if the view that a bad
man is necessarily a fool is not merely held by philosolphers, but is the universal belief of ordinary men,
the fool will most assuredly never become an orator.
To this must be added the fact that the mind will
not find leisure even for the study of the noblest of
tasks, unless it first be free from vice. The reasons for
this are, first, that vileness and virtue cannot jointly
inhabit in the selfsame heart and that it is as impossible for one and the same mind to harbour good

<pb id="p.359"/>

and evil thoughts as it is for one man to be at once
both good and evil:<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> and secondly, that if the intelligence is to be concentrated on such a vast subject as
eloquence it must be free from all other distractions,
among which must be included even those preoccupations which are free from blame. For it is only
when it is free and self-possessed, with nothing to
divert it or lure it elsewhere, that it will fix its
attention solely on that goal, the attainment of which
is the object of its preparations.<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> If on the other
hand inordinate care for the development of our
estates, excess of anxiety over household affairs,
passionate devotion to hunting or the sacrifice of
whole days to the shows of the theatre, rob our
studies of much of the time that is their due (for
every moment that is given to other things involves
a loss of time for study), what, think you, will be the
results of desire, avarice, and envy, which waken such
violent thoughts within our souls that they disturb
our very slumbers and our dreams?<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> There is nothing
so preoccupied, so distracted, so rent and torn by so
many and such varied passions as an evil mind. For
when it cherishes some dark design, it is tormented
with hope, care and anguish of spirit, and even when
it has accomplished its criminal purpose, it is racked
by anxiety, remorse and the fear of all manner of
punishments. Amid such passions as these what
room is there for literature or any virtuous pursuit?
You might as well look for fruit in land that is choked
with thorns and brambles.<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Well then, I ask you, is
not simplicity of life essential if we are to be able to
endure the toil entailed by study? What can we
hope to get from lust or luxury? Is not the desire
to win praise one of the strongest stimulants to a

<pb id="p.361"/>

passion for literature? But does that mean that we
are to suppose that praise is an object of concern to
bad men? Surely every one of my readers must by
now have realised that oratory is in the main concerned with the treatment of what is just and
honourable? Can a bad and unjust man speak on
such themes as the dignity of the subject demands?
<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Nay, even if we exclude the most important aspects
of the question now before us, and make the impossible concession that the best and worst of men
may have the same talent, industry and learning, we
are still confronted by the question as to which of
the two is entitled to be called the better orator. The
answer is surely clear enough: it will be he who is
the better man. Consequently, the bad man and the
perfect orator can never be identical.<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> For nothing
is perfect, if there exists something else that is
better. However, as I do not wish to appear to
adopt the practice dear to the Socratics of framing
answers to my own questions, let me assume the
existence of a man so obstinately blind to the truth
as to venture to maintain that a bad man equipped
with the same talents, industry and learning will
be not a whit inferior to the good man as an
orator; and let me show that he too is mad.
<milestone unit="section" n="11"/>There is one point at any rate which no one will
question, namely, that the aim of every speech is to
convince the judge that the case which it puts forward is true and honourable. Well then, which will
do this best, the good man or the bad? The good
man will without doubt more often say what is true
and honourable.<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> But even supposing that his duty
should, as I shall show may sometimes happen, lead
him to make statements which are false, his words

<pb id="p.363"/>

are still certain to carry greater weight with his
audience. On the other hand bad men, in their
contempt for public opinion and their ignorance of
what is right, sometimes drop their mask unawares,
and are impudent in the statement of their case and
shameless in their assertions.<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Further, in their
attempt to achieve the impossible they display an
unseemly persistency and unavailing energy. For
in lawsuits no less than in the ordinary paths of
life, they cherish depraved expectations. But it
often happens that even when they tell the truth
they fail to win belief, and the mere fact that such
a man is its advocate is regarded as an indication of
the badness of the case.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="14"/>I must now proceed to deal with the objections
which common opinion is practically unanimous in
bringing against this view. Was not Demosthenes
an orator? And yet we are told that he was a bad
man. Was not Cicero an orator? And yet there
are many who have found fault with his character as
well. What am I to answer? My reply will be
highly unpopular and I must first attempt to conciliate my audience.<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> I do not consider that
Demosthenes deserves the serious reflexions that
have been made upon his character to such an
extent that I am bound to believe all the charges
amassed against him by his enemies; for my reading
tells me that his public policy was of the noblest and
his end most glorious.<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Again, I cannot see that the
aims of Cicero were in any portion of his career other
than such as may become an excellent citizen. As
evidence I would cite the fact that his behaviour as
consul was magnificent and his administration of his
province a model of integrity, while he refused to

<pb id="p.365"/>

become one of the twenty commissioners,<note>For the distribution of the Campanian lands.</note> and in the
grievous civil wars which afflicted his generation
beyond all others, neither hope nor fear ever deterred
him from giving his support to the better party, that
is to say, to the interests of the common weal.
Some, it is true, regard him as lacking in courage.<milestone unit="section" n="17"/>
The best answer to these critics is to be found in his
own words, to the effect that he was timid not in
confronting peril, but in anticipating it. And this
he proved also by the manner of his death, in meeting
which he displayed a singular fortitude.<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> But even
if these two men lacked the perfection of virtue, I
will reply to those who ask if they were orators, in
the manner in which the Stoics would reply, if asked
whether Zeno, Cleanthes or Chrysippus himself were
wise men. I shall say that they were great men
deserving our veneration, but that they did not
attain to that which is the highest perfection
of man's nature.<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> For did not Pythagoras desire
that he should not be called a wise man, like the
sages who preceded him, but rather a student of
wisdom?<note><hi rend="italics">i. e.</hi> <foreign lang="greek">filo/sofos,</foreign> a term of which he was reputed the
inventor.</note> But for my own part, conforming to the
language of every day, I have said time and again,
and shall continue to say, that Cicero was a perfect
orator, just as in ordinary speech we call our friends
good and sensible men, although neither of these
titles can really be given to any save to him that
has attained to perfect wisdom. But if I am called
upon to speak strictly and in accordance with the
most rigid laws of truth, I shall proclaim that I seek
to find that same perfect orator whom Cicero also
sought to discover.<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> For while I admit that he stood
on the loftiest pinnacle of eloquence, and can discover scarcely a single deficiency in him, although I

<pb id="p.367"/>

might perhaps discover certain superfluities which I
think he would have pruned away (for the general
view of the learned is that he possessed many virtues
and a few faults, and he himself<note><hi rend="italics">Brut.</hi> xci. 316. <hi rend="italics">Orat.</hi> xxx. 107.</note> states that he has
succeeded in suppressing much of his youthful
exuberance), none the less, in view of the fact that,
although he had by no means a low opinion of himself, he never claimed to be the perfect sage, and,
had he been granted longer life and less troubled conditions for the composition of his works, would doubtless have spoken better still, I shall not lay myself
open to the charge of ungenerous criticism, if I say
that I believe that he failed actually to achieve that
perfection to the attainment of which none have
approached more nearly,<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> and indeed had I felt otherwise in this connexion, I might have defended my
point with greater boldness and freedom.<note>Quintilian's reverence for Cicero is such that he feels
hampered in maintaining his thesis.</note> Marcus
Antonius declared that he had seen no man who was
genuinely eloquent (and to be eloquent is a far less
achievement than to be an orator), while Cicero himself has failed to find his orator in actual life and
merely imagines and strives to depict the ideal. Shall
I then be afraid to say that in the eternity of time
that is yet to be, something more perfect may be found
than has yet existed?<milestone unit="section" n="22"/> I say nothing of those critics
who will not allow sufficient credit even for eloquence
to Cicero and Demosthenes, although Cicero himself
does not regard Demosthenes as flawless, but asserts
that he sometimes nods,<note>See x. i. 24.</note> while even Cicero fails to
satisfy Brutus and Calvus (at any rate they criticised
his style to his face), or to win the complete approval
of either of the Asinii, who in various passages attack
the faults of his oratory in language which is positively
hosthe.</p>

<pb id="p.369"/>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="23"/>However, let us fly in the face of nature and
assume that a bad man has been discovered who is
endowed with the highest eloquence. I shall none
the less deny that he is an orator. For I should not
allow that every man who has shown himself ready
with his hands was necessarily a brave man, because
true courage cannot be conceived of without the
accompaniment of virtue.<milestone unit="section" n="24"/> Surely the advocate who
is called to defend the accused requires to be a man
of honour, honour which greed cannot corrupt, influence seduce, or fear dismay. Shall we then dignify the traitor, the deserter, the turncoat with the
sacred name of orator? But if the quality which is
usually termed goodness is to be found even in quite
ordinary advocates, why should not the orator, who
has not yet existed, but may still be born, be no less
perfect in character than in excellence of speech?
<milestone unit="section" n="25"/>It is no hack-advocate, no hireling pleader, nor yet,
to use no harser term, a serviceable attorney of the
class generally known as <hi rend="italics">causidici,</hi> that I am seeking to
form, but rather a man who to extraordinary natural
gifts has added a thorough mastery of all the fairest
branches of knowledge, a man sent by heaven to be
the blessing of mankind, one to whom all history
can find no parallel, uniquely perfect in every detail
and utterly noble alike in thought and speech.<milestone unit="section" n="26"/> How
small a portion of all these abilities will be required
for the defence of the innocent, the repression of
crime or the support of truth against falsehood in
suits involving questions of money? It is true that
our supreme orator will bear his part in such tasks,
but his powers will be displayed with brighter splendour in greater matters than these, when he is
called upon to direct the counsels of the senate and

<pb id="p.371"/>

guide the people from the paths of error to better
things.<milestone unit="section" n="27"/> Was not this the man conceived by Virgil
and described as quelling a riot when torches and
stones have begun to fly:<note><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> i. 151 <hi rend="italics">sqq.</hi></note>

<quote rend="blockquote">
<quote><l>Then, if before their eyes some statesman grave</l>
<l>Stand forth, with virtue and high service crowned,</l>
<l>Straight are they dumb and stand intent to hear.</l></quote></quote>

Here then we have one who is before all else a
good man, and it is only after this that the poet adds
that he is skilled in speaking:

<quote rend="blockquote">
<l><quote>His words their minds control, their passions soothe.</quote></l></quote>

Again,<milestone unit="section" n="28"/> will not this same man, whom we are striving
to form, if in time of war he be called upon to inspire
his soldiers with courage for the fray, draw for his
eloquence on the innermost precepts of philosophy?
For how can men who stand upon the verge of battle
banish all the crowding fears of hardship, pain and
death from their minds, unless those fears be replaced by the sense of the duty that they owe
their country, by courage and the lively image of a
soldier's honour?<milestone unit="section" n="29"/> And assuredly the man who will
best inspire such feelings in others is he who has
first inspired them in himself. For however we strive
to conceal it, insincerity will always betray itself, and
there was never in any man so great eloquence as
would not begin to stumble and hesitate so soon as
his words ran counter to his inmost thoughts.<milestone unit="section" n="30"/> Now:
a bad man cannot help speaking things other than
he feels. On the other land, the good will never be
at a loss for honourable words or fail to find matter
full of virtue for utterance, since among his virtues
practical wisdom will be one. And even though his

<pb id="p.373"/>

imagination lacks artifice to lend it charm, its own
nature will be ornament enough, for if honour dictate
the words, we shall find eloquence there as well.
<milestone unit="section" n="31"/>Therefore, let those that are young, or rather let all
of us, whatever our age, since it is never too late to
resolve to follow what is right, strive with all our
hearts and devote all our efforts to the pursuit of virtue
and eloquence; and perchance it may be granted to us
to attain to the perfection that we seek. For since
nature does not forbid the attainment of either, why
should not someone succeed in attaining both together? And why should not each of us hope to be
that happy man?<milestone unit="section" n="32"/> But if our powers are inadequate
to such achievement, we shall still be the better for
the double effort in proportion to the distance which
we have advanced toward either goal. At any rate
let us banish from our hearts the delusion that
eloquence, the fairest of all things, can be combined
with vice. The power of speaking is even to be
accounted an evil when it is found in evil men; for it
makes its possessors yet worse than they were before.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="33"/>I think I hear certain persons (for there will
always be some who had rather be eloquent than
good) asking, <quote>Why then is there so much art in connexion with eloquence? Why have you talked so
much of 'glosses,'<note><hi rend="italics">color</hi> is a technical term for <quote>the particular aspect given
to a case by skilful manipulation of the facts&mdash;the 'gloss'
or 'varnish' put on them by the accused or accuser.</quote>&mdash;Peterson <hi rend="italics">on Quint.</hi> X. i. 116.</note> the methods of defence to be
employed in difficult cases, and sometimes even of
actual confession of guilt, unless it is the case that
the power and force of speech at times triumphs over
truth itself? For a good man will only plead good
cases, and those might safely be left to truth to
support without the aid of learning.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="34"/> Now, though
my reply to these critics will in the first place be
a defence of my own work, it will also explain what

<pb id="p.375"/>

I consider to be the duty of a good man on occasions
when circumstances have caused him to undertake the defence of the guilty. For it is by no
means useless to consider how at times we should
speak in defence of falsehood or even of injustice, if
only for this reason, that such an investigation will
enable us to detect and defeat them with the greater
ease, just as the physician who has a thorough
knowledge of all that can injure the health will be
all the more skilful in the prescription of remedies.
<milestone unit="section" n="35"/>For the Academicians, although they will argue on
either side of a question, do not thereby commit
themselves to taking one of these two views as their
guide in life to the exclusion of the other, while the
famous Carneades, who is said to have spoken at
Rome in the presence of Cato the Censor, and to
have argued against justice with no less vigour than
he had argued for justice on the preceding day, was
not himself an unjust man. But the nature of virtue
is revealed by vice, its opposite, justice becomes yet
more manifest from the contemplation of injustice,
and there are many other things that are proved by
their contraries. Consequently the schemes of his
adversaries should be no less well known to the
orator than those of the enemy to a commander in
the field.<milestone unit="section" n="36"/> But it is even true, although at first sight
it seems hard to believe, that there may be sound
reason why at times a good man who is appearing
for the defence should attempt to conceal the truth
from the judge. If any of my readers is surprised
at my making such a statement (although this
opinion is not of my own invention, but is derived
from those whom antiquity regarded as the greatest
teachers of wisdom), I would have him reflect that

<pb id="p.377"/>

there are many things which are made honourable
or the reverse not by the nature of the facts, but by
the causes from which they spring.<milestone unit="section" n="37"/> For if to slay
a man is often a virtue and to put one's own children
to death is at times the noblest of deeds, and if it
is permissible in the public interest to do deeds
yet more horrible to relate than these, we should
assuredly take into consideration not solely and
simply what is the nature of the case which the
good man undertakes to defend, but what is his
reason and what his purpose in so doing.<milestone unit="section" n="38"/> And first
of all everyone must allow, what even the sternest
of the Stoics admit, that the good man will sometimes tell a lie, and further that he will sometimes do
so for comparatively trivial reasons; for example we
tell countless lies to sick children for their good and
make many promises to them which we do not intend
to perform.<milestone unit="section" n="39"/> And there is clearly far more justification for lying when it is a question of diverting
an assassin from his victim or deceiving an enemy
to save our country. Consequently a practice which
is at times reprehensible even in slaves, may on
other occasions be praiseworthy even in a wise man.
If this be granted, I can see that there will be many
possible emergencies such as to justify an orator in
undertaking cases of a kind which, in the absence of
any honourable reason, he would have refused to
touch.<milestone unit="section" n="40"/> In saying this I do not mean that we should
be ready under any circumstances to defend our
father, brother or friend when in peril (since I
hold that we should be guided by stricter rules in
such matters), although such contingencies may
well cause us no little perplexity, when we have to
decide between the rival claims of justice and natural

<pb id="p.379"/>

affection. But let us put the problem beyond all
question of doubt. Suppose a man to have plotted
against a tyrant and to be accused of having done so.
Which of the two will the orator, as defined by us,
desire to save? And if he undertakes the defence
of the accused, will he not employ falsehood with
no less readiness than the advocate who is defending
a bad case before a jury?<milestone unit="section" n="41"/> Again, suppose that the
judge is likely to condemn acts which were rightly
done, unless we can convince him that they were
never done. Is not this another case where the
orator will not shrink even from lies, if so he may
save one who is not merely innocent, but a praiseworthy citizen? Again, suppose that we realise that
certain acts are just in themselves, though prejudicial
to the state under existing circumstances. Shall we
not then employ methods of speaking which, despite
the excellence of their intention, bear a close resemblance to fraud.<milestone unit="section" n="42"/> Further, no one will hesitate
for a moment to hold the view that it is in the
interests of the commonwealth that guilty persons
should be acquitted rather than punished, if it be
possible thereby to convert them to a better state of
mind, a possibility which is generally conceded. If
then it is clear to an orator that a man who is guilty
of the offences laid to his charge will become a good
man, will he not strive to secure his acquittal?
<milestone unit="section" n="43"/>Imagine for example that a skilful commander, without whose aid the state cannot hope to crush its
enemies, is labouring under a charge which is obviously true: will not the common interest irresistibly
summon our orator to defend him? We know at
any rate that Fabricius publicly voted for and secured
the election to the consulate of Cornelius Rufinus,

<pb id="p.381"/>

despite the tact that he was a bad citizen and his
personal enemy, merely because he knew that he
was a capable general and the state was threatened
with war.<note>The late is uncertain, but the reference must be either to
the Samnite war of 290 or the war with Pyrrhus.</note> And when certain persons expressed
their surprise at his conduct, he replied that he had
rather be robbed by a fellow-citizen than be sold as
a slave by the enemy. Well then, had Fabricius
been an orator, would he not have defended Rufinus
against a charge of peculation, even though his
guilt were as clear as day?<milestone unit="section" n="44"/> I might produce many
other similar examples, but one of them taken at
random is enough. For my purpose is not to
assert that such tasks will often be incumbent
on the orator whom I desire to form, but merely to
show that, in the event of his being compelled to
take such action, it will not invalidate our definition
of an orator as a <quote>good man, skilled in speaking.</quote>
<milestone unit="section" n="45"/>And it is necessary also both to teach and learn how
to establish difficult cases by proof. For often even
the best cases have a resemblance to bad and, the
charges which tell heavily against an innocent person frequently have a strong resemblance to the
truth. Consequently, the same methods of defence
have to be employed that would be used if he were
guilty. Further, there are countless elements which
are common to both good cases and bad, such as oral
and documentary evidence, suspicions and opinions,
all of which have to be established or disposed of in
the same way, whether they be true or merely resemble the truth. Therefore, while maintaining his
integrity of purpose, the orator will modify his pleading to suit the circumstances.</p>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Since then the orator is a good man, and such
goodness cannot be conceived as existing apart from

<pb id="p.383"/>

virtue, virtue, despite the fact that it is in part
derived from certain natural impulses, will require to
be perfected by instruction. The orator must above
all things devote his attention to the formation of
moral character and must acquire a complete knowledge of all that is just and honourable. For without
this knowledge no one can be either a good man or
skilled in speaking,<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> unless indeed we agree with
those who regard morality as intuitive and as owing
nothing to instruction: indeed they go so far as to
acknowledge that handicrafts, not excluding even
those which are most despised among them, can
only be acquired by the result of teaching, whereas
virtue, which of all gifts to man is that which makes
him most near akin to the immortal gods, comes to
him without search or effort, as a natural concomitant
of birth. But can the man who does not know what
abstinence is, claim to be truly abstinent?<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> or brave, if
he has never purged his soul of the fears of pain, death
and superstition? or just, it he has never, in language
approaching that of philosophy, discussed the nature
of virtue and justice, or of the laws that have been
given to mankind by nature or established among
individual peoples and nations? What a contempt
it argues for such themes to regard them as being
so easy of comprehension!<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> However, I pass this by;
for I am sure that no one with the least smattering
of literary culture will have the slightest hesitation
in agreeing with me. I will proceed to my next
point, that no one will achieve sufficient skill even in
speaking, unless he makes a thorough study of all
the workings of nature and forms his character on
the precepts of philosophy and the dictates of reason.
<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>For it is with good cause that Lucius Crassus, in the

<pb id="p.385"/>

third book of the <hi rend="italics">de Oratore,</hi><note>Chs. xx. xxvii. and xxxi.</note> affirms that all that is
said concerning equity, justice, truth and the good,
and their opposites, forms part of the studies of an
orator, and that the philosophers, when they exert
their powers of speaking to defend these virtues, are
using the weapons of rhetoric, not their own. But
he also confesses that the knowledge of these subjects must be sought from the philosophers for the
reason that, in his opinion, philosophy has more
effective possession of them.<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And it is for the same
reason that Cicero in several of his books and letters
proclaims that eloquence has its fountain-head in the
most secret springs of wisdom, and that consequently
for a considerable time the instructors of morals and
of eloquence were identical. Accordingly this exhortation of mine must not be taken to mean that I
wish the orator to be a philosopher, since there is no
other way of life that is further removed from the
duties of a statesman and the tasks of an orator.
<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>For what philosopher has ever been a frequent
speaker in the courts or won renown in public
assemblies? Nay, what philosopher has ever taken a
prominent part in the government of the state, which
forms the most frequent theme of their instructions?
None the less I desire that he, whose character I am
seeking to mould, should be a <quote>wise man</quote> in the
Roman sense, that is, one who reveals himself as a true
statesman, not in the discussions of the study, but
in the actual practice and experience of life.<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> But
inasmuch as the study of philosophy has been
deserted by those who have turned to the pursuit of
eloquence, and since philosophy no longer moves in
its true sphere of action and in the broad daylight of
the forum, but has retired first to porches and

<pb id="p.387"/>

gymnasia and finally to the gatherings of the schools, all
that is essential for an orator, and yet is not taught
by the professors of eloquence, must undoubtedly be
sought from those persons in whose possession it
has remained. The authors who have discoursed on
the nature of virtue must be read through and
through, that the life of the orator may be wedded
to the knowledge of things human and divine.<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But
how much greater and fairer would such subjects
appear if those who taught them were also those
who could give them most eloquent expression! O
that the day may dawn when the perfect orator of
our heart's desire shall claim for his own possession
that science that has lost the affection of mankind
through the arrogance of its claims and the vices of
some that have brought disgrace upon its virtues,
and shall restore it to its place in the domain of
eloquence, as though he had been victorious in a
trial for the restoration of stolen goods!<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> And since
philosophy falls into three divisions, physics, ethics
and dialectic, which, I ask you, of these departments is not closely connected with the task of the
orator?</p>
<p>Let us reverse the order just given and deal first
with the third department which is entirely concerned with words. If it be true that to know the
properties of each word, to clear away ambiguities,
to unravel perplexities, to distinguish between truth
and falsehood, to prove or to refute as may be
desired, all form part of the functions of an orator,
who is there that can doubt the truth of my contention?<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> I grant that we shall not have to employ
dialectic with such minute attention to detail when
we are pleading in the courts as when we are

<pb id="p.389"/>

engaged in philosophical debate, since the orator's
duty is not merely to instruct, but also to move and
delight his audience; and to succeed in doing this
he needs a strength, impetuosity and grace as well.
For oratory is like a river: the current is stronger
when it flows within deep banks and with a mighty
flood, than when the waters are shallow and broken
by the pebbles that bar their way.<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> And just as
the trainers of the wrestling school do not impart
the various <hi rend="italics">throws</hi> to their pupils that those who
have learnt them may make use of all of them in
actual wrestling matches (for weight and strength
and wind count for more than these), but that they
may have a store from which to draw one or two
of such tricks, as occasion may offer;<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> even so the
science of dialectic, or if you prefer it of disputation, while it is often useful in definition, inference,
differentiation, resolution of ambiguity, distinction
and classification, as also in luring on or entangling
our opponents, yet if it claim to assume the entire
direction of the struggles of the forum, will merely
stand in the way of arts superior to itself and by its
very subtlety will exhaust the strength that has
been pared down to suit its limitations.<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> As a
result you will find that certain persons who show
astonishing skill in philosophical debate, as soon as
they quit the sphere of their quibbles, are as helpless in any case that demands more serious pleading
as those small animals which, though nimble enough
in a confined space, are easily captured in an open
field.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="15"/>Proceeding to moral philosophy or ethics, we may
note that it at any rate is entirely suited to the
orator. For vast as is the variety of cases (since in

<pb id="p.391"/>

them, as I have pointed out in previous books, we seek
to discover certain points by conjecture,<note>See <milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>vi. 45.</note> reach our
conclusions in others by means of definition,<note>See III. vi. 45.</note> dispose
of others on legal grounds' or by raising the question of competence,<note>See ill. vi. 23.</note> while other points are established by syllogism<note>See III. vi. 15.</note> and others involve contradictions<note>Probably an allusion to contradictory laws. See VIII. vii.</note> or are diversely interpreted owing to some
ambiguity of language<note>See VII. ix.</note>), there is scarcely a single
one which does not at some point or another involve
the discussion of equity and virtue, while there are
also, as everyone knows, not a few which turn
entirely on questions of quality.<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Again in deliberative assemblies how can we advise a policy without
raising the question of what is honourable? Nay,
even the third department of oratory, which is
concerned with the tasks of praise and denunciation,
must without a doubt deal with questions of right
and wrong.<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> For the orator will assuredly have
much to say on such topics as justice, fortitude,
abstinence, self-control and piety. But the good
man, who has come to the knowledge of these things
not by mere hearsay, as though they were just words
and names for his tongue to employ, but has grasped
the meaning of virtue and acquired a true feeling for
it, will never be perplexed when he has to think out
a problem, but will speak out truly what he
knows.<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> Since, however, <hi rend="italics">general</hi> questions are always
more important than special (for the particular is
contained in the universal, while the universal is
never to be regarded as something superimposed on
the particular), everyone will readily admit that the
studies of which we are speaking are pre-eminently
concerned with general questions.<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> Further, since
there are numerous points which require to be

<pb id="p.393"/>

determined by appropriate and concise definitions
(hence the <hi rend="italics">definitive basis</hi><note>See III vi. 31.</note> of cases), it is surely
desirable that the orator should be instructed in
such things by those who have devoted special
attention to the subject. Again, does not every
question of law turn either on the precise meaning
of words, the discussion of equity, or conjecture as
to the intention&mdash;subjects which in part encroach on
the domain of dialectic and in part on that of ethics?
<milestone unit="section" n="20"/>Consequently all oratory involves a natural admixture
of all these philosophic elements&mdash;at least, that is to
say, all oratory that is worthy of the name. For
mere garrulity that is ignorant of all such learning
must needs go astray, since its guides are either
non-existent or false.</p>
<p>Physics<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> natural phlilosophy in the widest sense.</note> on the other hand is far richer than the
other branches of philosophy, if viewed from the
standpoint of providing exercise in speaking, in
proportion as a loftier inspiration is required to
speak of things divine than of things human; and
further it includes within its scope the whole of
ethics, which as we have shown<note>&sect; 15.</note> are essential to the
very existence of oratory.<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> For, if the world is
governed by providence, it will certainly be the
duty of all good men to bear their part in the
administration of the state. If the origin of our
souls be divine, we must win our way towards virtue
and abjure the service of the lusts of our earthly
body. Are not these themes which the orator will
frequently be called upon to handle? Again there
are questions concerned with auguries and oracles
or any other religious topic (all of them subjects
that have often given rise to the most important debates in the senate) on which the orator will have to

<pb id="p.395"/>

discourse, if he is also to be the statesman we
would have him be. And finally, how can we conceive of any real eloquence at all proceeding from
a man who is ignorant of all that is best in the
world?<milestone unit="section" n="22"/> If our reason did not make these facts
obvious, we should still be led by historical examples
to believe their truth. For Pericles, whose eloquence, despite the fact that it has left no visible
record for posterity, was none the less, if we may
believe the historians and that free-speaking tribe,
the old comic poets, endowed with almost incredible
force, is known to have been a pupil of the physicist
Anaxagoras, while Demosthenes, greatest of all the
orators of Greece, sat at the feet of Plato.<milestone unit="section" n="23"/> As for
Cicero, he has often proclaimed<note><hi rend="italics">Or. iii 12</hi></note> the fact that he
owed less to the schools of rhetoric than to the
walks of Academe: nor would he ever have developed
such amazing fertility of talent, had he bounded his
genius by the limits of the forum and not by the
frontiers of nature herself.</p>
<p>But this leads me to another question as to which
school of philosophy is like to prove of most service
to oratory, although there are only a few that can be
said to contend for this honour.<milestone unit="section" n="24"/> For in the first
place Epicurus banishes us from his presence without
more ado, since he bids all his followers to fly from
learning in the swiftest ship that they can find.<note><foreign lang="greek">paidei/an pa=san a)ka/tion a)ra/menos feu=ge.</foreign></note>
Nor would Aristippus, who regards the highest good
as consisting in physical pleasure, be likely to exhort
us to the toils entailed by our study. And what
part can Pyrrho have in the work that is before us?
For he will have doubts as to whether there exist
judges to address, accused to defend, or a senate
where he can be called upon to speak his opinion.

<pb id="p.397"/>

<milestone unit="section" n="25"/>Some authorities hold that the Academy will be the
most useful school, on the ground that its habit of
disputing on both sides of a question approaches
most nearly to the actual practice of the courts.
And by way of proof they add the fact that this
school has produced speakers highly renowned for
their eloquence. The Peripatetics also make it their
boast that they have a form of study which is near
akin to oratory. For it was with them in the main
that originated the practice of declaiming on general
questions<note>See II. i. 9. III. v. 5. and 10.</note> by way of exercise. The Stoics, though
driven to admit that, generally speaking, their teachers
have been deficient both in fullness and charm of
eloquence, still contend that no men can prove more
acutely or draw conclusions with greater subtlety
than themselves.<milestone unit="section" n="26"/> But all these arguments take
place within their own circle, for, as though they
were tied by some solemn oath or held fast in the
bonds of some superstitious belief, they consider that
it is a crime to abandon a conviction once formed.
On the other hand, there is no need for an orator to
swear allegiance to any one philosophic code.<milestone unit="section" n="27"/> For
lie has a greater and nobler aim, to which he directs
all his efforts with as much zeal as if he were a
candidate for office, since he is to be made perfect
not only in the glory of a virtuous life, but in that of
eloquence as well. He will consequently select as
his models of eloquence all the greatest masters of
oratory, and will choose the noblest precepts and
the most direct road to virtue as the means for
the formation of an upright character. He will
neglect no form of exercise, but will devote special
attention to those which are of the highest and
fairest nature.<milestone unit="section" n="28"/> For what subject can be found more

<pb id="p.399"/>

fully adapted to a rich and weighty eloquence than
the topics of virtue, politics, providence, the origin
of the soul and friendship? The themes which tend
to elevate mind and language alike are questions
such as what things are truly good, what means there
are of assuaging fear, restraining the passions and
lifting us and the soul that came from heaven clear
of the delusions of the common herd.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="29"/>But it is desirable that we should not restrict our
study to the precepts of philosophy alone. It is still
more important that we should know and ponder
continually all the noblest sayings and deeds that have
been handed down to us from ancient times. And
assuredly we shall nowhere find a larger or more
remarkable store of these than in the records of our
own country.<milestone unit="section" n="30"/> Who will teach courage, justice,
loyalty, self-control, simplicity, and contempt of
grief and pain better than men like Fabricius, Curius,
Regulus, Decius, Mucius and countless others? For
if the Greeks bear away the palm for moral precepts,
Rome can produce more striking examples of moral
performance, which is a far greater thing.<milestone unit="section" n="31"/> But the
man who does not believe that it is enough to fix
his eyes merely on his own age and his own transitory
life, but regards the space allotted for an honourable
life and the course in which glory's race is run as
conditioned solely by the memory of posterity, will
not rest content with a mere knowledge of the
events of history. No, it is from the thought of
posterity that he must inspire his soul with justice
and derive that freedom of spirit which it is his duty
to display when he pleads in the courts or gives
counsel in the senate. No man will ever be the
consummate orator of whom we are in quest unless

<pb id="p.401"/>

he has both the knowledge and the courage to speak
in accordance with the promptings of honour.</p>

<p>III. Our orator will also require a knowledge of
civil law and of the custom and religion of the state
in whose life he is to bear his part. For how will he
be able to advise either in public or in private, if he
is ignorant of all the main elements that go to make
the state? How can he truthfully call himself an
advocate if he has to go to others to acquire that
knowledge which is all-important in the courts?
He will be little better than if he were a reciter of
the poets.<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For he will be a mere transmitter of the
instructions that others have given him, it will be on
the authority of others that he propounds what he
asks the judge to believe, and he whose duty it is to
succour the litigant will himself be in need of succour.
It is true that at times this may be effected with but
little inconvenience, if what he advances for the
edification of the judge has been taught him and
composed in the seclusion of his study and learnt by
heart there like other elements of the case. But
what will he do, when he is confronted by unexpected
problems such as frequently arise in the actual
course of pleading? Will he not disgrace himself by looking round and asking the junior counsel
who sit on the benches behind him for advice?<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Can
lie hope to get a thorough grasp of such information
at the very moment when he is required to produce
it in his speech? Can he make his assertions with
confidence or speak with native simplicity as though
his arguments were his own? Grant that he may do
so in his actual speech. But what will he do in a
debate, when he has continually to meet fresh points
raised by his opponent and is given no time to learn

<pb id="p.403"/>

up his case? What will do, if he has no legal
expert to advise him or if his prompter through
insufficient knowledge of the subject provides him
with information that is false? It is the most serious
drawback of such ignorance, that he will always
believe that his adviser knows what he is talking
about.<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> I am not ignorant of the generally prevailing custom, nor have I forgotten those who sit by
our store-chests and provide weapons for the pleader:
I know too that the Greeks did likewise: hence
the name of <hi rend="italics">pragmaticus</hi> which was bestowed on
such persons. But I am speaking of an orator, who
owes it as a duty to his case to serve it not merely
by the loudness of his voice, but by all other means
that may be of assistance to it.<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Consequently I do
not wish my orator to be helpless, if it so chance
that he puts in an appearance for the preliminary
proceedings to which the hour before the commencement of the trial<note><hi rend="italics">Ad horam constare</hi> appears to be a technical <hi rend="italics">term</hi> for
<quote>apperance at the preliminary hour.</quote> the purpose of which
is indicated in the paraphrase given above.</note> is allotted, or to be unskilful in
the preparation and production of evidence. For
who, sooner than himself, should prepare the points
which he wishes to be brought out when he is
pleading? You might as well suppose that the
qualifications of a successful general consist merely
in courage and energy in the field of battle and skill
in meeting all the demands of actual conflict, while
suffering him to be ignorant of the methods of levying troops, mustering and equipping his forces,
arranging for supplies or selecting a suitable position
for his camp, despite the fact that preparation for
war is an essential preliminary for its successful
conduct.<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And yet such a general would bear a
very close resemblance to the advocate who leaves
much of the detail that is necessary for success to

<pb id="p.405"/>

the care of others, more especially in view of the
fact that this, the most necessary element in the
management of a case, is not as difficult as it may
perhaps seem to outside observers. For every point
of law, which is certain, is based either on written
law or accepted custom: if, on the other hand, the
point is doubtful, it must be examined in the light
of equity.<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Laws which are either written or founded
on accepted custom present no difficulty, since they
call merely for knowledge and make no demand on
the imagination. On the other hand, the points explained in the rulings of the legal experts turn either
on the interpretation of words or on the distinction
between right and wrong. To understand the meaning of each word is either common to all sensible
men or the special possession of the orator, while
the demands of equity are known to every good
man.<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Now I regard the orator above all as being
a man of virtue and good sense, who will not be
seriously troubled, after having devoted himself to
the study of that which is excellent by nature, if
some legal expert disagrees with him; for even they
are allowed to disagree among themselves. But if
he further wishes to know the views of everyone,
he will require to read, and reading is the least
laborious of' all the tasks that fall to the student's
lot.<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Moreover, if the class of legal experts is as a rule
drawn from those who, in despair of making successful pleaders, have taken refuge with the law,
how easy it must be for an orator to know what
those succeed in learning, who by their own confession are incapable of becoming orators! But
Marcus Cato was at once a great orator and an
expert lawyer, while Scaevola and Servius Sulpicius

<pb id="p.407"/>

were universally allowed to be eloquent as well.<note><hi rend="italics">i. e.</hi> as well as experts on the law.</note>
<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>And Cicero not merely possessed a sufficient supply of
legal knowledge to serve his needs when pleading,
but actually began to write on the subject, so that
it is clear that an orator has not merely time to
learn, but even to teach the law.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>Let no one, however, regard the advice I have
given as to the attention due to the development
of character and the study of the law as being
impugned by the fact that we are familiar with
many who, because they were weary of the toil
entailed on those who seek to scale the heights
of eloquence, have betaken themselves to the study
of law as a refuge for their indolence. Some of
these transfer their attention to the praetor's edicts
or the civil law,<note>The piraetor's edicts were displayed on a whitened board
(<hi rend="italics">in albo</hi>), while the headings of the civil law were written in
red.</note> and have preferred to become
specialists in <hi rend="italics">formulae,</hi> or legalists, as Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">de Or.</hi> I. iv. 231.</note> calls
them, on the pretext of choosing a more useful
branch of study, whereas their real motive was its
comparative easiness.<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Others are the victims of a
more arrogant form of sloth; they assume a stern
air and let their beards grow, and, as though despising the precepts of oratory, sit for a while in
the schools of the philosophers, that, by an assumption of a severe mien before the public gaze and by
an affected contempt of others they may assert their
moral superiority, while leading a life of debauchery
at home. For philosophy may be counterfeited, but
eloquence never.</p>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Above all, our orator should be equipped
with a rich store of examples both old and new:
and he ought not merely to know those which are
recorded in history or transmitted by oral tradition
or occur from day to day, but should not neglect

<pb id="p.409"/>

even those fictitious examples invented by the great
poets.<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For while the former have the authority of
evidence or even of legal decisions, the latter also
either have the warrant of antiquity or are regarded
as having been invented by great men to serve as
lessons to the world. He should therefore be acquainted with as many examples as possible. It is
this which gives old age so much authority, since
the old are believed to have a larger store of knowledge and experience, as Homer so frequently bears
witness. But we must not wait till the evening of
our days, since study has this advantage that, as far
as knowledge of facts is concerned, it is capable of
giving the impression that we have lived in ages
long gone by.</p>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Such are the instruments of which I promised<note><hi rend="italics">Pr.</hi> 22 and xii. <hi rend="italics">Pr.</hi> 4.</note>
to give account, the instruments, that is, not merely
of the art, as some have held, but of the orator himself. These are the weapons that he should have
ready to his hand, this the knowledge with which he
must be equipped, while it must be supplemented by
a ready store of words and figures, power of imagination, skill in arrangement, retentiveness of memory
and grace of delivery. But of all these qualities the
highest is that loftiness of soul which fear cannot
dismay nor uproar terrify nor the authority of the
audience fetter further than the respect which is
their due.<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For although the vices which are its
opposites, such as arrogance, temerity, impudence
and presumption, are all positively obnoxious, still
without constancy, confidence and courage, art, study
and proficiency will be of no avail. You might as
well put weapons into the hands of the unwarlike
and the coward. It is indeed with some reluctance,

<pb id="p.411"/>

as it may give rise to misunderstanding, that I say
that even modesty (which, though a fault in itself, is
an amiable failing which may easily be the mother of
virtues) is on occasion an impediment and has
frequently caused the fruits of genius and study to
consume away in the mildew of obscurity merely
because they have never been displayed to the public
day.<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But in case any of my readers should still lack
skill to distinguish the precise meaning of each
word, I would have him know that it is not honest
shame that is the object of my criticism, but that
excess of modesty which is really a form of fear
deterring the soul from doing what is its duty to do,
and resulting in confusion of mind, regret that our
task was ever begun, and sudden silence. For who
can hesitate to give the name of fault to a feeling
that makes a man ashamed to do what is right?<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> On
the other hand, I am not unwilling that the man who
has got to make a speech should show signs of
nervousness when he rises to his feet, should change
colour and make it clear that he feels the risks of his
position: indeed, if these symptoms do not occur
naturally, it will be necessary to simulate them.
But the feeling that stirs us should be due to the
realisation of the magnitude of our task and not to
fear: we should be moved, but not to the extent of
collapsing. But the best remedy for such excess
of modesty is confidence: however great our natural
timidity of mien, we shall find strength and support
in the consciousness of the nobility of our task.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>There are also those natural instruments which, as
I mentioned above,<note>I <hi rend="italics">Pr.</hi> 27.</note> may be further improved by
care, such as voice, lungs and grace of carriage
and movement, all of which are of such importance

<pb id="p.413"/>

as frequently to give a speaker the reputation for
talent. Our own age has had orators of greater
resource and power, but Trachalus appeared to stand
out above all his contemporaries, when he was speaking. Such was the elect produced by his lofty
stature, the fire of his eye, the dignity of his brow,
the excellence of his gesture, coupled with a voice
which was not almost a tragedian's, as Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">de Or.</hi> I. xxviii. 128.</note>
demands that it should be, but surpassed the voice
of all tragedians that I have ever heard.<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> At any
rate I remember that, when he was speaking in the
Basilica Julia before the first tribunal, and the four
panels of judges<note>Of the Cenutumviral Court. Four different cases were
being tried simultaneously.</note> were assembled as usual and the
whole building was full of noise, he could still be
heard and understood and applauded from all four
tribunals at once, a fact which was not complimentary
to the other pleaders. But gifts like these are such
as all may pray for and few are happy enough to
attain. And if we cannot achieve such fortune, we
must even be content to be heard by the court which
we are addressing. Such then should the orator be,
and such are the things which he should know.</p>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The age at which the orator should begin to
plead will of course depend on the development of
his strength. I shall not specify it further, since it
is clear that Demosthenes pleaded against his
guardians while he was still a mere boy, Calvus,
Caesar and Pollio<note>Demosthenes was 18, Crassus 19, Caesar 21, Asinius Pollio
and Calvus not much older. See Tac. <hi rend="italics">Dial.</hi> 34.</note> all undertook cases of the first
importance before they were old enough to be
qualified for the quaestorship, others are said to have
pleaded while still wearing the garb of boyhood,
and Augustus Caesar delivered a funeral oration over
his grandmother from the public rostra when he was
only twelve years old.<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> In my opinion we should aim

<pb id="p.415"/>

at a happy mean. The unripe brow of boyhood
should not be prematurely robbed of its ingenuous
air nor should the young speaker's powers be brought
before the public while yet unformed, since such a
practice leads to a contempt for study, lays the
foundations of impudence and induces a fault which
is pernicious in all departments of life, namely, a self-confidence that is not justified by the speaker's
resources.<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> On the other hand, it is undesirable to
postpone the apprenticeship of the bar till old age:
for the fear of appearing in public grows daily and
the magnitude of the task on which we must venture
continually increases and we waste time deliberating
when we should begin, till we find it is too late to
begin at all. Consequently it is desirable that the
fruit of our studies should be brought before the
public eye while it is still fresh and sweet, while it
may hope for indulgence and be secure of a kindly
disposition in the audience, while boldness is not
unbecoming and youth compensates for all defects
and boyish extravagance is regarded as a sign of
natural vigour.<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Take for example the whole of the
well-known passage from Cicero's defence of Sextus
Roscius:<note><hi rend="italics">pro Rose. Amer.</hi> xxvi. 72.</note> <quote>For what is more common than the air
to the living, than the earth to the dead, than the
sea to mariners or the shore to shipwrecked men?</quote>
etc. This passage was delivered at the age of
twenty-six amid loud applause from the audience,
but in later years<note><hi rend="italics">Orat.</hi> xxx. 107.</note> he acknowledges that the ferment
of youth has died down and his style been clarified
with age. And, indeed, however much private study
may contribute to success, there is still a peculiar
proficiency that the courts alone can give: for there
the atmosphere is changed and the reality of the

<pb id="p.417"/>

peril puts a different complexion on things, while, if
it is impossible to combine the two, practice without
theory is more useful than theory without practice.
Consequently,<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> some who have grown old in the
schools lose their heads when confronted by the
novelty of the law courts and wish that it were
possible to reproduce all the conditions under which
they delivered their exercises. But there sits the
judge in silence, their opponent bellows at them, no
rash utterance passes unnoticed and all assumptions
must be proved, the clock cuts short the speech that
has been laboriously pieced together at the cost of
hours of study both by day and night, and there are
certain cases which require simplicity of language and
the abandonment of the perpetual bombast of the
schools, a fact which these fluent fellows completely
fail to realise.<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And so you will find some persons
who regard themselves as too eloquent to speak in
the courts. On the other hand, the man, whom we
conducted to the forum while still young and in the
charm of immaturity, should begin with as easy and
favourable a case as may be (just as the cubs of wild
beasts are brought up to start with on softer
forms of prey), and should not proceed straight
from this commencement to plead case after case
without a break, or cause his talents to set and
harden while they still require nourishment; on the
contrary, as soon as he has come to realise the nature
of the conflicts in which he will have to engage and
the object to which his studies should be directed, he
should take an interval of rest and refreshment.
Thus,<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> at an age to which boldness is still natural, he
will find it easy to get over the timidity which invariably accompanies the period of apprenticeship, and

<pb id="p.419"/>

will not, on the other hand, carry his boldness so far
as to lead him to despise the difficulties of his task.
This was the method employed by Cicero: for when
he had already won a distinguished position at the
bar of his day, he took ship to Asia and there studied
under a number of professors of philosophy and
rhetoric, but above all under Apollonius Molon,
whose lectures he had attended at Rome and to
whom he now at Rhodes entrusted the refashioning
and recasting of his style. It is only when theory
and practice are brought into a perfect harmony
that the orator reaps the reward of all his study.</p>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When our orator has developed his strength
to such a pitch that it is equal to every kind of confact in which he may be called upon to bear his part,
his first consideration should be to exercise care in
the choice of the cases which he proposes to undertake. A good man will undoubtedly prefer defence
to prosecution, but he will not have such a rooted
objection to the task of accuser as to disregard his
duty towards the state or towards individuals and
refuse to call any man to render an account of his
way of life. For the laws themselves would be
powerless without the assistance of advocates equal
to the task of supporting them; and to regard it as a
sin to demand the punishment of crime is almost equivalent to the sanctioning of crime, while it is certainly
contrary to the interest of the good to give the
wicked free leave to work their will.<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Therefore, our
orator will not suffer the complaints of our allies, the
death of friends or kinsmen, or conspiracies that
threaten the common weal to go unavenged, while
his conduct will be governed not by a passion to
secure the punishment of the guilty, but by the

<pb id="p.421"/>

desire to correct vice and reform morals. For fear
is the only means of restraining those who cannot
be led to better ways by the voice of reason.<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Consequently, while to devote one's life to the task of
accusation, and to be tempted by the hope of reward
to bring the guilty to trial is little better than making
one's living by highway robbery, none the less to rid
one's country of the pests that gnaw its vitals is
conduct worthy of comparison with that of heroes,
who champion their country's cause in the field of
battle. For this reason men who were leaders of the
state have not refused to undertake this portion of
an orator's duty, and even young men of high rank
have been regarded as giving their country a pledge
of their devotion by accusing bad citizens, since it
was thought that their hatred of evil and their
readiness to incur enmity were proofs of their confidence in their own rectitude.<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Such action was
taken by Hortensius, the Luculli, Sulpicius, Cicero,
Caesar and many others, among them both the Catos,
of whom one was actually called the Wise,<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> Cato the Elder.</note> while if
the other is not regarded as wise, I do not know of
any that can claim the title after him. On the other
hand, this same orator of ours will not defend all and
sundry: that haven of safety which his eloquence
provides will never be opened to pirates as it is to
others, and he will be led to undertake cases mainly
by consideration of their nature.<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> However, since
one man cannot undertake the cases of all litigants
who are not, as many undoubtedly are, dishonest, he
will be influenced to some extent by the character
of the persons who recommend clients to his protection and also by the character of the litigants
themselves, and will allow himself to be moved by

<pb id="p.423"/>

the wishes of all virtuous men; for a good man will
naturally have such for his most intimate friends.
<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>But he must put away from him two kinds of
pretentious display, the one consisting in the
officious proffering of his services to the powerful
against those of meaner position, and the other,
which is even more obtrusive, in deliberately supporting inferiors against those of high degree. For a
case is not rendered either just or the reverse by the
social position of the parties engaged. Nor, again,
will a sense of shame deter him from throwing over
a case which he has undertaken in the belief that it
had justice on its side, but which his study of the
facts has shown to be unjust, although before doing
so he should give his client his true opinion on the
case.<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For, if we judge aright, there is no greater
benefit that we can confer on our clients than this,
that we should not cheat them by giving them empty
hopes of success. On the other hand, no client that
does not take his advocate into his counsel deserves
that advocate's assistance, and it is certainly unworthy
of our ideal orator that he should wittingly defend
injustice. For if he is led to defend what is false
by any of the motives which I mentioned above,<note>XII. i. 36.</note> his
own action will still be honourable.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>It is an open question whether he should never
demand a fee for his services. To decide the
question at first sight would be the act of a fool.
For we all know that by far the most honourable
course, and the one which is most in keeping with a
liberal education and that temper of mind which we
desiderate, is not to sell our services nor to debase
the value of such a boon as eloquence, since there
are not a few things which come to be regarded as

<pb id="p.425"/>

cheap, merely because they have a price set upon
them.<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> This much even the blind can see, as the
saying is, and no one who is the possessor of sufficient
wealth to satisfy his needs (and that does not imply
any great opulence) will seek to secure an income
by such methods without laying himself open to the
charge of meanness. On the other hand, if his
domestic circumstances are such as to require some
addition to his income to enable him to meet the
necessary demands upon his purse, there is not a
philosopher who would forbid him to accept this form
of recompense for his services, since collections were
made even on behalf of Socrates, and Zeno, Cleanthes
and Chrysippus took fees from their pupils.<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Nor
can I see how we can turn a more honest penny than
by performance of the most honourable of tasks and
by accepting money from those to whom we have
rendered the most signal services and who, if they
made no return for what we have done for them,
would show themselves undeserving to have been
defended by us. Nay, it is not only just, but
necessary that this should be so, since the duties of
advocacy and the bestowal of every minute of our
time on the affairs of others deprive us of all other
means of making money.<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> But we must none the
less observe the happy mean, and it makes no small
difference from whom we take payment, what payment we demand, and how long we continue to do
so. As for the piratical practice of bargaining and
the scandalous traffic of those who proportion their
fees to the peril in which their would-be client
stands, such a procedure will be eschewed even by
those who are more than half scoundrels, more
especially since the advocate who devotes himself

<pb id="p.427"/>

to the defence of good men and worthy causes will
have nothing to fear from ingratitude. And even if
a client should prove ungrateful, it is better that he
should be the sinner and not our orator.<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> To conelude, then, the orator will not seek to make more
money than is sufficient for his needs, and even if he
is poor, he will not regard his payment as a fee, but
rather as the expression of the principle that one
good turn deserves another, since he will be well
aware that he has conferred far more than he receives.
For it does not follow that because his services
ought not to be sold, they should therefore be
unremunerated. Finally, gratitude is primarily the
business of the debtor.</p>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>We have next to consider how a case should
be studied, since such study is the foundation of
oratory. There is no one so destitute of all talent
as, after making himself thoroughly familiar with all
the facts of his case, to be unable at least to communicate those facts to the judge.<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But those who
devote any serious attention to such study are very
few indeed. For, to say nothing of those careless
advocates who are quite indifferent as to what the
pivot of the whole case may be, provided only there
are points which, though irrelevant to the case, will
give them the opportunity of declaiming in thunderous tones on the character of persons involved or
developing some commonplace, there are some who
are so perverted by vanity that, on the oft-repeated
pretext that they are occupied by other business,
they bid their client come to them on the day preceding the trial or early on the morning of the day
itself, and sometimes even boast that they learnt up
their case while sitting in court;<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> while others by

<pb id="p.429"/>

way of creating an impression of extraordinary talent,
and to make it seem that they arc quick in the uptake, pretend that they have grasped the facts of
the case and understand the situation almost before
they have heard what it is, and then after chanting
out some long and fluent discourse which has nought
to do either with the judge or their client, but
awakens the clamorous applause of the audience,
they are escorted home through the forum, perspiring
at every pore and attended by flocks of enthusiastic
friends.<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Further, I would not even tolerate the
affectation of those who insist that their friends, and
not themselves, should be instructed in the facts
of the case, though this is a less serious evil, if the
friends can be relied upon to learn and supply the
facts correctly. But who can give such effective
study to the case as the advocate himself? How
can the intermediary, the go-between or interpreter,
devote himself whole-heartedly to the study of other
men's cases, when those who have got to do the
actual pleading do not think it worth while to get
up their own?<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> On the other hand, it is a most
pernicious practice to rest content with a written
statement of the case composed either by the litigant
who betakes himself to an advocate because he finds
that his own powers are not equal to the conduct of
his case, or by some member of that class of legal
advisers<note><hi rend="italics">Advocatus</hi> is here used in its original sense. By Quintilian's time it had come also to mean <quote>advocate,</quote> and is
often so used by him elsewhere.</note> who admit that they are incapable of pleading, and then proceed to take upon themselves the
most difficult of all the tasks that confront the pleader.
For if a man is capable of judging what should be
said, what concealed, what avoided, altered or even
invented, why should he not appear as orator himself,
since he performs the far more difficult feat of making

<pb id="p.431"/>

an orator?<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Such persons would not, however, do so
much harm if they would only put down all the
facts as they occurred. But as it is, they add suggestions of their own, put their own construction on
the facts and insert inventions which are far more
damaging than the unvarnished truth. And then
the advocate as a rule, on receiving the document,
regards it as a crime to make any alteration, and
keeps to it as faithfully as if it were a theme set for
declamation in the schools. The sequel is that they
are tripped up and have to learn from their opponents the case which they refused to learn from their
own clients.<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> We should therefore above all allow
the parties concerned ample time for an interview in
a place free from interruption, and should even
exhort them to set forth on the spot all the facts in
as many words as they may choose to use and allowing them to go as far back as they please. For it is
less of a drawback to listen to a number of irrelevant
facts than to be left in ignorance of essentials.
Moreover,<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> the orator will often detect both the evil
and its remedy in facts which the litigant regarded
as devoid of all importance, one way or the other.
Further, the advocate who has got to plead the case
should not put such excessive confidence in his
powers of memory as to disdain to jot down what he
has heard.</p>
<p>Nor should one hearing be regarded as sufficient.
The litigant should be made to repeat his statements
at least once, not merely because certain points may
have escaped him on the occasion of his first statement, as is extremely likely to happen if, as is often
the case, he is a man of no education, but also that
we may note whether he sticks to what he originally

<pb id="p.433"/>

said.<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> For a large number of clients lie, and hold
forth, not as if they were instructing their advocate
in the facts of the case, but as if they were pleading
with a judge. Consequently we must never be too
ready to believe them, but must test them in every
way, try to confuse them and draw them out.<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> For
just as doctors have to do more than treat the
ailments which meet the eye, and need also to
discover those which he hid, since their patients
often conceal the truth, so the advocate must look
out for more points than his client discloses to him.
After he considers that he has given a sufficiently
patient hearing to the latter's statements, he must
assume another character and adopt the r&ocirc;le of his
opponent, urging every conceivable objection that a
discussion of the kind which we are considering may
permit.<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The client must be subjected to a hosthe
cross-examination and given no peace: for by enquiring into everything, we shall sometimes come
upon the truth where we least expect it.</p>
<p>In fact, the advocate who is most successful in
getting up his case is he who is incredulous. For
the client promises everything: the people, he says,
will bear witness to the truth of what he says, he can
produce documentary evidence at a moment's notice
and there are some points which he says his opponent
<milestone unit="section" n="12"/>will not deny. It is therefore necessary to look into
every document connected with the case, and where
the mere sight of them is not sufficient, they must
be read through. For very frequently they are
either not at all what the client alleged them to be,
or contain less, or are mixed up with elements that
may damage our case, or prove more than is required
and are likely to detract from their credibility just

<pb id="p.435"/>

because they are so extravagant.<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Further, it will
often be found that the thread is broken or the seal
tampered with or the signatures unsupported by
witnesses. And unless you discover such facts at
home, they will take you by surprise in court and
trip you up, doing you more harm by forcing you to
abandon them than they would have done had they
never been promised you. There are also a number
of points which the client regards as irrelevant to
his case, which the advocate will be able to elicit,
provided he go carefully through all the <quote>dwelling places</quote> of argument which I have already described.<note>V. x. 20 <hi rend="italics">sqq. i. e.</hi> sources from which arguments may be
drawn.</note>
<milestone unit="section" n="14"/>Now though, for reasons already mentioned, it is
most undesirable that he should hunt for and try
every single one of those, while actually engaged in
pleading his case, it is most necessary in the preliminary study of the case to leave no stone unturned to
discover the character of the persons involved, the
circumstances of time and place, the customs and
documents concerned, and the rest, from which we
may not merely deduce the proofs known as artificial,
but may also discover which witnesses are most to be
feared and the best method of refuting them. For
it makes a great difference whether it be envy,
hatred or contempt that forms the chief obstacle to
the success of the defence, since of these obstacles
the first tells most against superiors, the second
against equals, and the third against those of low
degree.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="15"/>Having thus given a thorough examination
to the case and clearly envisaged all those points
which will tell for or against his client, the orator
must then place himself in the position of a third
person, namely, the judge, and imagine that the

<pb id="p.437"/>

case is being pleaded before himself, and assume
that the point which would have carried most weight
with himself, had he been trying the case, is likely
to have the greatest influence with the actual judge.
Thus he will rarely be deceived as to the result of
the trial, or, if he is, it will be the fault of the judge.</p>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>As regards the points to be observed in the
actual pleading, I have dealt with these in every
portion of this work, but there still remain a few on
which I must touch as being specially appropriate to
the present place, since they are concerned not so
much with the art of speaking as with the duties
of the advocate. Above all it is important that he
should never, like so many, be led by a desire to win
applause to neglect the interest of the actual case.
<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>It is not always the duty of generals in the field to
lead their armies through flat and smiling country:
it will often be necessary to cross rugged mountain
ranges, to storm cities placed on inaccessible cliffs or
rendered difficult of access by elaborate fortifications.
Similarly oratory will always be glad of the opportunity of man&oelig;uvring in all its freedom and delighting the spectator by the deployment of its full
strength for conflict in the open field;<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> but if it is
forced to enter the tortuous defiles of the law, or
dark places whence the truth has to be dragged
forth, it will not go prancing in front of the enemy's
lines nor launch its shafts of quivering and passionate
epigram of the fashion that is now so popular, but
will wage war by means of sap and mine and ambush
and all the tactics of secrecy.<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> None of these
methods win applause during their actual execution:
the reward comes after they have been carried to a
successful termination, when even the most ambitious

<pb id="p.439"/>

will reap a richer recompense than they could ever
have secured by other means. For so soon as the
thunders of applause awakened among their admirers
by these affected declamatory displays have died
away, the glory of true virtue rises again with
renewed splendour, the judges do not conceal who
it is has moved them, the well-trained orator wins
their belief and oratory receives its only genuine
tribute, the praise accorded it when its task is done.
<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The old orators indeed used to conceal their eloquence, a method which is recommended by Marcus
Antonius, as a means of securing that the speaker's
words should carry conviction and of masking the
advocate's real designs. But the truth is that the
eloquence of those days was capable of concealment,
for it had not yet attained that splendour of diction
which makes it impossible to hide its light under a
bushel. Therefore artifice and stratagem should be
masked, since detection in such cases spells failure.
Thus far, and thus only, may eloquence hope to enjoy
the advantages of secrecy.<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But when we come to
consider the choice of words, the weight essential
to general reflexions and the elegance demanded by
figures, we are confronted by elements which must
either strike the attention or be condemned to nonexistence. But the very fact that they strike the
attention is a reason why they should not flaunt
themselves obtrusively. And, if we have to make
the choice, I should prefer that it should be the
cause, and not the orator, to which we award our
praise. Nevertheless, the true orator will achieve
the distinction of seeming to speak with all the
excellence that an excellent case deserves. One
thing may be regarded as certain, that no one can

<pb id="p.441"/>

plead worse than he who wins applause despite the
disapproval meted out to his case. For the inevitable
conclusion is that the applause must have been
evoked by something having no connexion with the
case.<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Further, the true orator will not turn up his
nose at cases of minor importance on the ground of
their being beneath his dignity or as being likely
to detract from his reputation because the subject
matter does not allow his genius full scope. For the
strongest reason for undertaking a case is to be fund
in our duty towards our clients: nay, we should even
desire the suits in which our friends are involved to
he as unimportant as possible, and remember that the
advocate who gives an adequate presentment to his
case, has spoken exceeding well.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>But there are so he who, even although the cases
which they have undertaken give but small scope for
eloquence, none the less trick it out with matter
drawn from without and, if all else fails, fill up the
gaps in their case with abuse of their opponents,
true if possible, but false if necessary, the sole consideration that weighs with them being that it affords
exercise for their talents and is likely to win applause
during its delivery. Such conduct seems to me so
unworthy of our perfect orator that, in my opinion,
he will not even bring true charges against his
opponents unless the case demand.<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> For it is a
dog's eloquence, as Appius says, to undertake the
task of abusing one's opponent,<note><hi rend="italics">A cognitor</hi> is one who represents another. The litigant
may abuse his opponent, but that does not justify his
advocate in doing so.</note> and they who do so
should steel themselves in advance to the prospect
of being targets for like abuse themselves, since
those who adopt this style of pleading are frequently
attacked themselves, and there can at any rate be
no doubt that the litigant pays dearly for the violence

<pb id="p.443"/>

of his advocate. But such faults are less serious than
that which lies deep in the soul itself, making the
evil speaker to differ from the evil doer only in
respect of opportunity.<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> It is not uncommon for
the litigant to demand a base and inhuman gratification of his rancour, such as not a single man among
the audience will approve, for it is on revenge rather
than on protection that his heart is set. But in this,
as in a number of other points, it is the duty of the
orator to refuse to comply with his clients' desires.
For how can a man with the least degree of gentlemanly feeling consent to make a brutal attack merely
because another desires it?<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> And yet there are some
who take pleasure in directing their onslaughts
against their opponents' counsel as well, a practice
which, unless they have deserved such attacks, shows
an inhuman disregard of the duties incumbent on the
profession, and is not merely useless to the speaker
(since he thereby gives his opponent the right to
reply in the same strain), but contrary to the
interests of his case, since it creates a hosthe and
antagonistic disposition in the advocates attacked,
whose eloquence, however feeble it may be, will be
redoubled by resentment at the insults to which
they have been subjected.<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Above all, it involves a
complete waste of one of the most valuable of an
orator's assets, namely that self-restraint which gives
weight and credit to his words, if he debases himself from an honest man into a snarling wrangler,
directing all his efforts not to win the goodwill of the
judge, but to gratify his client's spite.<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Often too
the attractions of freedom of speech will lure him
into a rashness of language perilous not merely to
the interests of the case, but to those of the speaker

<pb id="p.445"/>

himself. It was not without good reason that Pericles used to pray that no word might occur to his
mind that could give offence to the people. But
what he felt with regard to the people, I feel with
regard to every audience, since they can cause just
as much harm to the orator as the people could
ever do to Pericles. For utterances which seemed
courageous at the moment of speaking, are called
foolish when it is found that they have given offence.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="14"/>In view of the tact that there is commonly a great
variety in the aims which pleaders set before themselves and that the diligence shown by some is
branded as tedious caution, while the readiness of
others is criticised as rashness, I think that this will
be an appropriate place to set forth my views as to
how the orator may strike the happy mean.<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> He will
show all the diligence of which he is capable in his
pleading. For to plead worse than he might have
done, is not merely an indication of negligence, but
stamps him as a had man and a traitor, disloyal to the
cause which he has undertaken. Consequently he
must refuse to undertake more cases than he feels
he can manage.<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> As far as possible he will deliver
only what he has written, and, if circumstances
permit, only what he has, as Demosthenes says,<note>This passage is our sole authority for the saying.</note>
carved into shape. Such a practice is possible in
first hearings and also in subsequent hearings such as
are granted in the public courts after an interval of
several days. On the other hand, when we have to
reply on the spot, it is impossible to prepare everything: in fact for the less ready type of speaker, it
may, in the event of his opponents putting forward
arguments quite other than those which they were
expected to advance, be a positive drawback to have

<pb id="p.447"/>

written anything.<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> For it is only with reluctance
that such speakers will under such circumstances
consent to abandon what they have written, and
throughout their pleading keep looking back and
trying to discover whether any portion of their
manuscript can be saved from the wreck and interpolated into what they have to improvise. And if
they do make such interpolations, the result is a lack
of' cohesion which is betrayed not merely by the
gaping of the seams where the patch has been unskilfully inserted, but by the differences of style.
<milestone unit="section" n="18"/>Consequently, the vigour of their eloquence will be
hampered and their thought will lack connexion, each
of which circumstances reacts unfavourably upon the
other, since what is written trammels the mind
instead of following its lead. Therefore, in such
pleadings we must, as the rustic adage says, <quote>stand
on all our feet.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="19"/> For since the case turns on the
propounding and refutation of arguments, it is
always possible to write out what we propose to
advance on our own behalf, and similar preparation
is also possible with regard to the refutation of such
replies as are absolutely certain to be made by our
adversary: for there are times when we have this
certainty. But with regard to all other portions of
our speech, the only preparation that is possible in
advance consists in a thorough knowledge of our
case, while there is a second precaution which may
be taken in court, consisting in giving our best
attention to our opponent's speech.<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> On the other
hand, there is much that may be thought out in
advance and we may forearm our mind against all
possible emergencies, a course which is far safer
than writing, since a train of thought can easily be

<pb id="p.449"/>

abandoned or diverted in a new direction. But
whether we have to improvise a reply, or are obliged
to speak extempore by some other reason, the orator
on whom training, study and practice have conferred
the gift of facility, will never regard himself as lost
or taken at hopeless disadvantage.<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> He stands
armed for battle, ever ready for the fray, and his
eloquence will no more fail him in the courts than
speech will fail him in domestic affairs and the daily
concerns of life: and he will never shirk his burden
for fear of failing to find words, provided he has time
to study his case: for all other knowledge will always
be his at command.</p>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The question of the <quote>kind of style</quote> to be
adopted remains to be discussed. This was described
in my original division<note>II. xiv. 5.</note> of my subject as forming its
third portion: for I promised that I would speak of
the art, the artist and the work. But since oratory
is the work both of rhetoric and of the orator, and
since it has many forms, as I shall show, the art and
the artist are involved in the consideration of all
these forms. But they differ greatly from one
another, and not merely in <hi rend="italics">species,</hi> as statue differs
from statue, picture from picture and speech from
speech, but in <hi rend="italics">genus</hi> as well, as, for example,
Etruscan statues differ from Greek and Asiatic
orators from Attic.<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But these different kinds of
work, of which I speak, are not merely the product
of different authors, but have each their own following of admirers, with the result that the perfect
orator has not yet been found, a statement which
perhaps may be extended to all arts, not merely
because some qualities are more evident in some
artists than in others, but because one single form

<pb id="p.451"/>

will not satisfy all critics, a fact which is due in
part to conditions of time or place, in part to the
taste and ideals of individuals.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The first great painters, whose works deserve
inspection for something more than their mere
antiquity, are said to have been Polygnotus and
Aglaopllon,<note>Of the painters mentioned in this and the following
sections Polyglotus of Thasos, son of Aglaophon, painted at
Athens in the middle of the 5th century B.C.. Zunis of
Heracelea Parrhasius of Ephesus flourished 420&ndash;390, while
the remainder are painters of the 4th century. Of these
Palmphilus of Sicyon was the teacher of Melanthius and
Apelles, the latter being the most famous painter of antiquity.</note> whose simple colouring has still such
enthusiastic admirers that they prefer these almost
primitive works, which may be regarded as the first
foundations of the art that was to be, over the works
of the greatest of their successors, their motive
being, in my opinion, an ostentatious desire to seem
persons of superior taste.<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Later Zeuxis and Parrhasius contributed much to the progress of painting.
These artists were separated by no great distance of
time, since both flourished about the period of the
Peloponnesian war: for example, Xenophon<note><hi rend="italics">Memoir.</hi> III. x. 1.</note> has
preserved a conversation between Socrates and
Parrhasius. The first-mentioned seems to have
discovered the method of representing light and
shade, while the latter is said to have devoted
special attention to the treatment of line.<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For
Zeuxis emphasised the limbs of the human body,<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> by giving them roundness and solidity by his treatment of light and shade.</note>
thinking thereby to add dignity and grandeur to
his style: it is generally supposed that in this he
followed the example of Homer, who likes to
represent even his female characters as being of
heroic mould. Parrhasius, on the other hand, was
so fine a draughtsman that he has been styled the
law-giver of his art, on the ground that all other
artists take his representations of gods and heroes as
models, as though no other course were possible.
<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>It was, however, from about the period of the reign
of Philip down to that of the successors of Alexander

<pb id="p.453"/>

that painting flourished more especially, although
the different artists are distinguished for different
excellences. Protogenes, for example, was renowned
for accuracy, Pamphilus and Melanthius for soundness of taste, Antiphilus for facility, Theon of Samos
for his depiction of imaginary scenes, known as
<foreign lang="greek">fantasi/ai,</foreign> and Apelles for genius and grace, in the
latter of which qualities he took especial pride.
Euphranor, on the other hand, was admired on the
ground that, while he ranked with the most eminent
masters of other arts, he at the same time achieved
marvellous skill in the arts of sculpture and painting.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>The same differences exist between sculptors. The
art of Callon and Hegesias<note>Callon of Aegina and Hegesias flourished in the latter
years of the 6th century. Calamis of Athens and Myron of
Eleutheae, first half of 5th centuryy. Phidlias of Athens and
Polyelitus of Argos, the two most famous sculptors of the
second half of 5th century. Praxiteles, middle of 4th
century. Lysippus and Demetrius, last half of 4th century.</note> is somewhat rude and
recalls the Etruscans, but the work of Calamis has
already begun to be less stiff, while Myron's statues
show a greater softness of form than had been
achieved by the artists just mentioned. Polyclitus
surpassed all others for care and grace, but although
the majority of critics account him as the greatest
of sculptors, to avoid making him faultless they
express the opinion that his work is lacking in
grandeur.<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> For while he gave the human form an
ideal grace, he is thought to have been less successful in representing the dignity of the gods. he is
further alleged to have shrunk from representing
persons of maturer years, and to have ventured on
nothing more difficult than a smooth and beardless
face. But the qualities lacking in Polyclitus are
allowed to have been possessed by Phidias and
Alcamenes.<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> On the other hand, Phidias is regarded
as more gifted in his representation of gods than of
men, and indeed for chryselephantine statues he is
without a peer, as he would in truth be, even if he

<pb id="p.455"/>

had produced nothing in this material beyond his
Minerva at Athens and his Jupiter at Olympia in
Elis, whose beauty is such that it is said to have
added something even to the awe with which the
god was already regarded: so perfectly did the
majesty of the work give the impression of godhead.
Lysippus and Praxiteles are asserted to be supreme
as regards faithfulness to nature. For Demetrius is
blamed for carrying realism too far, and is less
concerned about the beauty than the truth of his
work.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>Now, if we turn our attention to the various styles
of oratory, we shall find almost as great variety of
talents as there are of personal appearance. There
were certain kinds of oratory which, owing to the
circumstances of the age, suffered from lack of polish,
although in other respects they displayed remarkable
genius. In this class we may place orators such as
Laelius, Africanus, Cato, and even the Gracchi,
whom we may call the <quote>Polygnoti</quote> and <quote>Callones</quote>
of oratory.<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Among orators of the intermediate
type we may rank Lucius Crassus and Quintus
Hortensius. Then let us turn to a vast harvest of
orators who flourished much about the same period.
It is here that we find the vigour of Caesar, the
natural talent of Caelius, the subtlety of Calidius,
the accuracy of Pollio, the dignity of Messala, the
austerity of Calvus, the gravity of Brutus, the acumen
of Sulpicius and the bitterness of Cassius, while
among those whom we have seen ourselves we
admire the fluency of Seneca, the strength of Africanus, the mellowness of Afer, the charm of Crispus,
the sonority of Trachalus and the elegance of Secundus.<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> But in Cicero we have one who is not,

<pb id="p.457"/>

like Euphranor, merely distinguished in a number
of different forms of art, but is supreme in all the
different qualities which are praised in each individual
orator.<note><hi rend="italics">Cp.</hi> x. i. 105 <hi rend="italics">sq.</hi></note> And yet even his own contemporaries
ventured to attack him on the ground that he was
bombastic, Asiatic, redundant, given to excessive
repetition, liable at times to be pointless in his
witticisms, sensuous, extravagant and (an outrageous
accusation!) almost effeminate in his rhythm.<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> And
later, after he had fallen a victim to the proscription of the second triumvirate, those who hated
and envied him and regarded him as their rival, nay,
even those who had flattered him in the days of his
power, attacked him now that he could no longer
reply. But that very man, who is now regarded
by some as being too jejune and dry, was attacked
by his personal enemies on no other ground than
that his style was too florid and his talents too little
under control. Both charges are false, but there is
more colour for the he in the latter case than in
the former.<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Those, however, who criticised him
most severely were the speakers who desired to be
regarded as the imitators of Attic oratory. This
coterie, regarding themselves as the sole initiates in
the mysteries of their art, assailed him as an alien,
indifferent to their superstitions and refusing to be
bound by their laws. Their descendants are among
us to-day, a withered, sapless and anemic band.
<milestone unit="section" n="15"/>For it is they that flaunt their weakness under the
name of health, in defiance of the actual truth, and
because they cannot endure the dazzling rays of the
sun of eloquence, hide themselves beneath the
shadow of a mighty name.<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> Attic.</note> However, as Cicero himself answered them at length and in a number of

<pb id="p.459"/>

passages, it will be safer for me to be brief in my
treatment of this topic.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="16"/>The distinction between the Attic and the Asiatic
schools takes us back to antiquity. The former were
regarded as concise and healthy, the latter as empty
and inflated: the former were remarkable for the
absence of all superfluity, while the latter were
deficient alike in taste and restraint. The reason
for this division, according to some authorities,
among them Santra, is to be found in the fact that,
as Greek gradually extended its range into the
neighbouring cities of Asia, there arose a class of
men who desired to distinguish themselves as orators
before they had acquired sufficient command of the
language, and who consequently began to express
by periphrases what could have been expressed
directly, until finally this practice became an ingrained habit.<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> My own view, however, is that the
difference between the two styles is attributable to
the character both of the orators and the audiences
whom they addressed: the Athenians, with their
polish and refinement, refused to tolerate emptiness
and redundance, while the Asiatics, being naturally
given to bombast and ostentation, were puffed up
with a passion for a more vainglorious style of
eloquence.<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> At a later period, the critics, to whom
we owe this classification, added a third style, the
Rhodian, which they asserted to he midway between
the two and to be a blend of both, since the orators
of this school are neither so concise as the Attic nor
redundant like the Asiatic school, but appear to
derive their style in part from their national characteristics, in part from those of their founder.<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> For
it was Aeschines who introduced the culture of

<pb id="p.461"/>

Athens at Rhodes, which he had chosen as his place
of exile: and just as certain plants degenerate as a
result of change of soil and climate, so the fine Attic
flavour was marred by the admixture of foreign
ingredients. Consequently certain of the orators of
this school are regarded as somewhat slow and
lacking in energy, though not devoid of a certain
weight, and as resembling placid pools rather than
the limpid springs of Athens or the turbid torrents
of Asia.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="20"/>No one therefore should have any hesitation in
pronouncing Attic oratory to be by far the best. But
although all Attic writers have something in comion, namely a keen and exact judgement, their
talents manitest themselves in a number of different
forms.<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> Consequently I regard those critics as committing a serious error who regard only those
authors as Attic who, while they are simple, lucid
and expressive, are none the less content with a
certain frugality of eloquence, and keep their hands
modestly within the folds of their cloaks. For what
author is there who answers to this conception? I
am prepared to grant that there is Lysias, since he
is the favourite model of the admirers of this school,
and such an admission will save us from being
referred to Coccus<note>The only Coccus known to us is stated by Suidas to
have been a pupil of Isocrates, whereas we should here
have expected Quintilian to refer to some orator of the
5th century contemporary with Andocides (closing decades
of 4th century).</note> and Andocides.<milestone unit="section" n="22"/> But I should like
to ask whether Isocrates spoke in the Attic style.
For there is no author less like Lysias. They will
answer in the negative. And yet it is to the school
of Isocrates that we owe the greatest orators. Let
us look for something closer. Is Hyperides
Attic? Yes, they reply, but of an over-sensuous
character. I pass by a number of orators, such as
Lyucrgus and Aristogeiton and their predecessors

<pb id="p.463"/>

Isaeus and Antiphon; for though they have a certain
<hi rend="italics">generic</hi> resemblance, they may be said to differ in
<hi rend="italics">species.</hi><milestone unit="section" n="23"/> But what of Aesehines, whom I mentioned
just now? Is not his style ampler and holder and
more lofty than theirs? And what of Demosthenes
himself? Did not he surpass all those simple and
circumspect orators in force, loftiness, energy, polish
and rhythm? Does he not rise to great heights in
his <hi rend="italics">commonplaces</hi> Does he not rejoice in the employment of figures? Does he not make brilliant use of
metaphor? Does he not lend a voice, a fictitious
utterance to speechless things?<milestone unit="section" n="24"/> Does not his famous
oath by the warriors who fell fighting for their country
at Salamis and Marathon show that Plato was his
master? And shall we call Plato an Asiatic, Plato
who as a rule deserves comparison with poets instinct
with the divine fire of inspiration? What of Pericles?
Can we believe that his style was like the slender
stream of Lysias' eloquence, when the comedians,
even while they revile him, compare his oratory to
the bolts and thunder of the skies?<milestone unit="section" n="25"/> What is the
reason, then, why these critics regard that style
which flows in a slender trickle and babbles among
the pebbles as having the true Attic flavour and
the true scent of Attic thyme? I really think that,
if they were to discover a soil of exceptional richness
and a crop of unusual abundance within the boundaries
of Attica, they would deny it to be Attic, on the
ground that it has produced more seed than it
received: for you will remember the mocking comments passed by Menander<note><hi rend="italics">Georg. 35 sqq.</hi> (Koerte); <foreign lang="greek">a)pe/dwken o)rqw=s kai\ dikai/ws, ou) ple/on, &verbar; a)ll' au)to\ to\ me/tron.</foreign></note> on the exact fidelity
with which the soil of Attica repays its deposits.
<milestone unit="section" n="26"/>Well, then, if any man should, in addition to the
actual virtues which the great orator Demosthenes

<pb id="p.465"/>

possessed, show himself to be the possessor of others,
that either owing to his own temperament or the
laws of Athens<note>See II. xvi. 4. Quintilian alludes to an alleged law forbidding Athenian oratos, to appeal to the emotions in the
law courts.</note> Demosthenes is thought to have
lacked, and should reveal in himself the power of
strongly stirring the emotions, shall I hear one of
these critics protesting that Demosthenes never did
this? And if he produces something rhythmically
superior (an impossible feat, perhaps, but let us
assume it to be so), are we to be told that it is not
Attic? These critics would show finer feeling and
better judgement, if they took the view that Attic
eloquence meant perfect eloquence.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="27"/>Still I should find this attitude less intolerable if
it were only the Greeks that insisted on it. For Latin
eloquence, although in my opinion it closely resembles
the Greek as far as invention, arrangement, judgement and the like are concerned, and may indeed be
regarded as its disciple, cannot aspire to imitate it
in point of elocution. For, in the first place, it is
harsher in sound, since our alphabet does not contain
the most euphonious of the Greek letters, one a
vowel and the other a consonant,<note><foreign lang="greek">f</foreign> alio <foreign lang="greek">g</foreign>.</note> than which there
are none that fall more sweetly on the ear, and
which we are forced to borrow whenever we use
Greek words.<milestone unit="section" n="28"/> The result of such borrowing is, for
some reason or other, the immediate accession to
our language of a certain liveliness and charm.
Take, for example, words such as <hi rend="italics">sephyri</hi> and <hi rend="italics">zophori:</hi><note>Friezes.</note>
if they were spelt according to the Latin alphabet,
they would produce a heavy and barbarous sound.
For we replace these letters by others of a harsh
and unpleasant character,<note>F and U; <hi rend="italics">zefuri and zofori.</hi></note> from which Greece is
happily immune.<milestone unit="section" n="29"/> For the sixth letter in our alphabet
is represented by a sound which can scarcely be

<pb id="p.467"/>

called human or even articulate, being produced by
forcing the air through the interstices of the teeth.
Such a sound, even when followed by a vowel, is
harsh enough and, as often as it clashes (<hi rend="italics">frangit</hi>)
with a consonant,<note><hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> I. iv. 11.</note> as it does in this very word
<hi rend="italics">frangit,</hi> becomes harsher still. Then there is the
Aeolic digamma whose sound occurs in words such
as our <hi rend="italics">servus</hi> and <hi rend="italics">cervus;</hi> for even though we have
rejected the actual form of the letter, we cannot
get rid of that which it represents.<note>A sound approximating to our W.</note><milestone unit="section" n="30"/> Similarly the
letter Q, which is superfluous and useless save for
the purpose of attaching to itself the vowels by
which it is followed, results in the formation of
harsh syllables, as, for example, when we write <hi rend="italics">equos</hi>
and <hi rend="italics">aequum,</hi> more especially since these two vowels
together produce a sound for which Greek has no
equivalent and which cannot therefore be expressed
in Greek letters.<note>The sound of Q in itself does not differ from C. It
would therefore be useless, save as an indication that U and
another vowel are to follow. The U in this combination
following Q was, as Donatus later pointed out, <quote>neither a
vowel nor a consonant,</quote> <hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> it was something between U
and V.</note><milestone unit="section" n="31"/> Again, we have a number of
words which end with M, a letter which suggests
the mooing of a cow, and is never the final letter
in any Greek word: for in its place they use the
letters <hi rend="italics">nu,</hi> the sound of which is naturally pleasant
and produces a ringing tone when it occurs at the
end of' a word, whereas in Latin this termination is
scarcely ever found.<milestone unit="section" n="32"/> Again, we have syllables which
produce such a harsh effect by ending in B and
D, that <hi rend="italics">many,</hi> not, it is true, of our most ancient
writers, but still writers of considerable antiquity,
have attempted to mitigate the harshness not merely
by saying <hi rend="italics">aversa</hi> for <hi rend="italics">abversa,</hi> but by adding an S
to the preposition <hi rend="italics">ab,</hi> although S is an ugly letter
<milestone unit="section" n="33"/>in itself Our accents also are less agreeable than
those of the Greeks. This is due to a certain rigidity
and monotony of pronunciation, since the final

<pb id="p.469"/>

syllable is never marked by the rise of the acute
accent nor by the rise and fill of the circumflex, but
one or even two grave accents<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> the last syllable and often the last <hi rend="italics">two</hi> syllables
have the grave accent. See I. v. <hi rend="italics">sqq.</hi></note> are regularly to be
found at the end. Consequently the Greek language
is so much more agreeable in sound than the Latin,
that our poets, whenever they wish their verse to
be especially harmonious, adorn it with Greek words.
<milestone unit="section" n="34"/>A still stronger indication of the inferiority of Latin
is to be found in the fact that there are many things
which have no Latin names, so that it is necessary
to express them by metaphor or periphrasis, while
even in the case of things which have names, the
extreme poverty of the language leads us to resort
to the same practice.<note><hi rend="italics">I.e.</hi> because the names are not holly adequate and
there are no satisfactory synonyms.</note> On the other hand, the
Greeks have not merely abundance of words, but
they have also a number of different dialects.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="35"/>Consequently he who demands from Latin the
grace of Attic Greek, must first provide a like
charm of tone and equal richness of vocabulary. If
this advantage is denied us, we must adapt our
thoughts to suit the words we have and, where our
matter is unusually slight and delicate, must avoid
expressing it in words which are, I will not say too
gross, but at any rate too strong for it, for fear that
the combination should result in the destruction
both of delicacy and force.<milestone unit="section" n="36"/> For the less help we
get from the language, the more must we rely on
inventiveness of thought to bring us through the
conflict. We must discover sentiments full of loftiness and variety, must stir all the emotions and
illumine our style by brilliance of metaphor. Since
we cannot be so delicate, let us be stronger. If
they beat us for subtlety, let us prevail by weight,
and if they have greater precision, let us outdo

<pb id="p.471"/>

them in fullness of expression.<milestone unit="section" n="37"/> Even the lesser
orators of Greece have their own havens where they
may ride in safety,<note>Owing to the subtlety and delicacy of the Greek
language even second-rate talent will he able to win distinction in dealing with minor things. But the coarser and
more full-blooded nature of Latin makes this difficult.</note> while we as a rule carry more
sail. Let stronger gales fill our canvas, and yet let
us not always keep the high seas; for at times we
must cling to shore. The Greeks can easily traverse
any shallows; I must find a deeper, though not
much deeper, channel, that my bark may not run
aground.<milestone unit="section" n="38"/> For even though the Greeks surpass us
where circumstances call for delicacy and restraint,
though we acknowledge their superiority in this
respect alone, and therefore do not claim to rival
them in comedy, that is no justification for our
abandonment of this department of oratory, but
rather a reason why we should handle it as best we
can. Now we can at any rate resemble the Greeks
in the method and judgement with which we treat
our matter, although that grace of language, which
our words cannot provide, must be secured by the
admixture of foreign condiments.<milestone unit="section" n="39"/> For example, is
not Cicero shrewd, simple and not unduly exalted
in tone, when he deals with private eases? Is not
Calidius also distinguished for the same virtue?
Were not Scipio, Laelius and Cato the Attic orators
of Rome? Surely we ought to be satisfied with
them, since nothing can be better.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="40"/>There are still some critics who deny that any
form of eloquence is purely natural, except that
which closely resembles the ordinary speech of everyday life, which we use to our friends, our wives, our
children and our slaves, a language, that is to say,
which contents itself with expressing the purpose
of the mind without seeking to discover anything
in the way of elaborate and far-fetched phraseology.

<pb id="p.473"/>

And they hold that whatever is added to this
simplicity lays the speaker open to the charge of
affectation and pretentious ostentation of speech,
void of all sincerity and elaborated merely for the
sake of the words, although the sole duty assigned
to words by nature is to be the servants of thought.
<milestone unit="section" n="41"/>Such language may be compared to the bodies of
athletes, which although they develop their strength
by exercise and diet, are of unnatural growth and
abnormal in appearance. For what, say these critics,
is the good of expressing a thing by periphrasis or
metaphor (that is, either by a number of words or
by words which have no connexion with the thing),
when everything has been allotted a name of its
own?<milestone unit="section" n="42"/> Finally, they urge that all the earliest orators
spoke according to the dictates of nature, but that
subsequently there arose a class of speakers resembling poets rather than orators, who regarded
false and artificial methods of expression as positive
merits; they were, it is true, more sparing than
the poets in their use of such expressions, but none
the less worked on similar lines. There is some
truth in this contention, and we should therefore
be careful not to depart from the more exact usage
of ordinary speech to the extent that is done by
certain orators.<milestone unit="section" n="43"/> On the other hand, that is no
reason for thus calumniating the man who, as I said
in dealing with the subject of artistic structure,<note>x. ch. 4.</note>
succeeds in improving upon the bare necessaries of
style. For the common language of every day seems
to me to be of a different character from the style
of an eloquent speaker. If all that was required of
the latter was merely to indicate the facts, he might
rest content with literalness of language, without

<pb id="p.475"/>

further elaboration. But since it is his duty to
delight and move his audience and to play upon
the various feelings, it becomes necessary for him
to employ those additional aids which are granted
to us by that same nature which gave us speech.
<milestone unit="section" n="44"/>It is, in fact, as natural to do this as to harden the
muscles, increase our strength and improve our complexion by means of exercise. It is for this reason
that among all nations one man is regarded as more
eloquent and more attractive in his style than
another (since if this were not the case, all speakers
would be equal); but the same men speak differently on different subjects and observe distinctions
of character. Consequently the more effective a
man's speaking, the more in accordance with the
nature of eloquence will it be.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="45"/>I have, therefore, no strong objection even to the
views expressed by those who think that some concession should be made to the circumstances under which
we speak and to the ears of the audience which
require something more polished and emotional than
ordinary speech. For this reason I consider that it
would be absurd to restrict an orator to the style of
the predecessors of Cato and the Gracchi, or even
of those orators themselves. And I note that it was
the practice of Cicero, while devoting himself in the
main to the interests of his case, to take into account
the delectation of his audience as well, since, as he
pointed out, his own interests were concerned as
well as those of his client, although of course the
latter were of paramount importance. For his very
charm was a valuable asset.<milestone unit="section" n="46"/> I do not know what
can be added by way of improvement to the charms
of his style, except perhaps the introduction of

<pb id="p.477"/>

something more in the way of brilliant reflexions to
suit the taste of our own times. For this can be done
without injury to the treatment of our case or inpairing the authority of our language, provided that
such embellishments are not too frequent or continuous, and do not mutually destroy the effects
which they were designed to produce.<milestone unit="section" n="47"/> I am ready
to go so far along the path of concession, but let no
man press me further. I concur in the fashion of
the day to the extent of agreeing that the toga
should not be long in the nap, but not to the extent
of insisting that it should be of silk: I agree that
the hair should be cut, but not that it should be
dressed in tiers and ringlets, since we must always
remember that ornaments, unless they be judged
from the standpoint of the fop and the debauchee,
are always effective in proportion to their seemliness.
<milestone unit="section" n="48"/>But with regard to those passages to which we give
the name of <hi rend="italics">reflexions,</hi><note>For this ever-recurring technical term there is no
adequate translation. It means a <quote>reflexion coached in
aphoristic or epigrammatic form.</quote></note> a form of ornament which
was not employed by the ancients and, above all,
not by the Greeks, although I do find it in Cicero,
who can deny their usefulness, provided they are
relevant to the case, are not too diffuse and contribute to our success? For they strike the mind
and often produce a decisive effect by one single
blow, while their very brevity makes them cling to
the memory, and the pleasure which they produce
has the force of persuasion.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="49"/>There are, however, some who, while allowing
the actual delivery of such specially brilliant forms
of ornament, think that they should be excluded
from the written speech. Consequently I must not
dismiss even this topic without a word of discussion. For a number of learned authorities

<pb id="p.479"/>

have held that the written and the spoken speech
stand on different footings, and that consequently
some of the most eloquent of speakers have left
nothing for posterity to read in durable literary form,
as, for example, is the case with Pericles and Decades
Again, they urge that there have been authors, like
Isocrates, who, while admirable writers, were not
well-fitted for actual speaking;<milestone unit="section" n="50"/> and, further, that
actual pleading is characterised by a greater energy
and by the employment, almost verging on license,
of every artifice designed to please, since the minds
of an uneducated audience require to be moved and
led. On the other hand, the written speech with
is published as a model of style must be polished
and filed and brought into conformity with the
accepted rules and standards of artistic construction,
since it will come into the hands of learned men
and its art will be judged by artists.<milestone unit="section" n="51"/> These subtle
teachers (for such they have persuaded themselves
and others that they are) have laid it down that
the <foreign lang="greek">para/deigma</foreign><note>Sec v. xi. 1. Parallels and especially historical ones.</note> is best suited for actual speech and
the <foreign lang="greek">e)nqu/mhma</foreign><note>See v. xiv. 1 <hi rend="italics">sqq.</hi> A form of syllogism.</note> for writing. My own view is that
there is absolutely no difference between writing
well and speaking well, and that a written speech
is merely a record of one that has actually been
delivered. Consequently it must in my opinion
possess every kind of merit, and note that I say
merit, not fault. For I know that faults do sometimes meet with the approval of the uneducated.
<milestone unit="section" n="52"/>What, then, will be the difference between what is
written and what is spoken? If I were given a jury
of wise men, I should cut down a large number of
passages from the speeches not only of Cicero, but
even of Demosthenes, who is much more concise.

<pb id="p.481"/>

For with such a jury there would be no need to
appeal to the emotions nor to charm and soothe the
ears, since according to Aristotle<note><hi rend="italics">Rhet.</hi> iii. 13.</note> even exordia are
superfluous, if addressed to such persons, as they
will have no influence upon judges who are truly
wise: it will be sufficient to state the facts with
precision and significance and to marshal our array
of proofs.<milestone unit="section" n="53"/> Since, however, our judges are the
people, or drawn from the people, and since those
who are appointed to give sentence are frequently
ill-educated and sometimes mere rustics, it becomes
necessary to employ every method that we think
likely to assist our case, and these artifices must
not merely be produced in speech, but exhibited in
the written version as well, at least if in writing it
our design is to show how it should be spoken.<milestone unit="section" n="54"/> If
Demosthenes or Cicero had spoken the words as
they wrote them, would either have spoken ill
And is our acquaintance with either of those two
great orators based on anything save their writings?
Did they speak better, then, or worse than they
wrote? If they spoke worse, all that can be said
is that they should have spoken as they wrote,
while, if they spoke better, they should have
written as they spoke.<milestone unit="section" n="55"/> Well, you ask, is an orator
then always to speak as he writes? If possible,
always. If, however, the time allowed by the
judge is too short for this to be possible, he will
have to cut out much that he should have said,
but the published speech will contain the omitted
passages. On the other hand, such passages as
were uttered merely to suit the character of the
judges will not be published for the benefit of
posterity, for fear that they should seem to indicate

<pb id="p.483"/>

the author's deliberate judgement instead of being
a mere concession to the needs of the moment.
<milestone unit="section" n="56"/>For it is most important that we should know how
the judge is disposed to listen, and his face will
often (as Cicero<note>Not in any extant work.</note> reminds us) serve as a guide to
the speaker. Consequently we must press the points
that we see commend themselves to him, and draw
back from those which are ill-received, while our
actual language must be so modified that he will
find our arguments as intelligible as possible. That
this should be necessary is scarcely surprising, when
we consider the alterations that are frequently
necessary to suit the characters of the different
witnesses.<milestone unit="section" n="57"/> He was a shrewd man who, when he
asked a rustic witness whether he knew Amphion,
and the witness replied that he did not, dropped
the aspirate and shortened the second syllable,<note>The witness did not recognise the name correctly
pronounced <hi rend="italics">Amphion,</hi> but recognised it when pronounced
Amphion.</note>
whereupon the witness recognised him at once.
Such situations, when it is impossible to speak as
we write, will sometimes make it necessary to speak
in language other than that which we use in
writing.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="58"/>There is another threefold division, whereby,
it is held, we may differentiate three styles of
speaking, all of them correct. The first is termed
the plain<note><hi rend="italics">subtilis</hi> (<hi rend="italics">lit.</hi> = finely woven) applied to style has three
meanings: (a) refined, (b) precise, (c) plain. See Sandys on
Cic. <hi rend="italics">Or.</hi> vi. 20.</note> (or <foreign lang="greek">i)sxno/n</foreign>), the second grand and
forcible (or <foreign lang="greek">a(dro/n</foreign>), and the third either intermediate or florid, the latter being a translation
of <foreign lang="greek">a)nqhro/n.</foreign><milestone unit="section" n="59"/> The nature of these three styles is,
broadly speaking, as follows. The first would seem
best adapted for instructing, the second for moving,
and the third (by whichever name we call it) for
charming or, as others would have it, conciliating
the audience; for instruction the quality most

<pb id="p.485"/>

needed is acumen, for conciliation gentleness, and
for stirring the emotions force. Consequently it is
mainly in the plain style that we shall state our
facts and advance our proofs, though it should be
borne in mind that this style will often be sufficiently
full in itself without any assistance whatever from
the other two.<milestone unit="section" n="60"/> The intermediate style will have
more frequent recourse to metaphor and will make
a more attractive use of figures, while it will introduce alluring digressions, will be neat in rhythm
and pleasing in its reflexions: its flow, however, will
be gentle, like that of a river whose waters are clear,
but overshadowed by the green banks on either side.
<milestone unit="section" n="61"/>But he whose eloquence is like to some great torrent
that rolls down rocks and <quote>disdains a bridge</quote><note>Verg. <hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> viii. 728.</note> and
carves out its own banks for itself, will sweep the
judge from his feet, struggle as he may, and force
him to go whither he bears him. This is the orator
that will call the dead to life (as, for example, Cicero
calls upon Appius Caecus<note>See III. viii. 54. <quote>Cicero in the <hi rend="italics">pro Caclio</hi> makes both
Appius Caecus and her brother Clodius address Clodia the
former rebuking her for her immorality, the latter exhorting
her thereto.</quote></note>); it is in his pages
that his native land itself will cry aloud and at
times address the orator himself, as it addresses
Cicero in the speech delivered against Catiline in
the senate.<milestone unit="section" n="62"/> Such an orator will also exalt his style
by amplification and rise even to <hi rend="italics">hyperbole,</hi> as when
Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">Phil.</hi> II. xxvii. 67. The passage continues: <quote>could
scarce, methinks, have swallowed with such speed so many
things, scattered in so many places.</quote></note> cries, <quote>What Charybdis was ever so voracious!</quote> or <quote>By the god of truth, even Ocean's
self,</quote> etc. (I choose these fine passages as being
familiar to the student). It is such an one that
will bring down the Gods to form part of his
audience or even to speak with him, as in the
following, <quote>For on you I call, ye hills and groves
of Alba, on you, I say, ye fallen altars of the
Albans, altars that were once the peers and equals

<pb id="p.487"/>

of the holy places of Rome.</quote><note><hi rend="italics">pro, Mil.</hi> xxxi. 85.</note> This is he that will
inspire anger or pity, and while he speaks the judge
will call upon the gods and weep, following him
wherever he sweeps him from one emotion to
another, and no longer asking merely for instruction.
<milestone unit="section" n="63"/>Wherefore if one of these three styles has to be
selected to the exclusion of the others, who will
hesitate to prefer this style to all others, since it
is by far the strongest and the best adapted to the
most important cases?<milestone unit="section" n="64"/> For Homer himself assigns
to Menelaus<note><hi rend="italics">Mil.</hi> iii. 214. The words which Quintilian translates by
<hi rend="italics">non deerrare verbhis</hi> are <foreign lang="greek">ou)d' a)famartoeph/s,</foreign> <quote>no stumbler in
speech,</quote> rather than <quote>correct in speech.</quote></note> an eloquence, terse and pleasing, exact
(for that is what is meant by <quote>making no errors in
words</quote>) and devoid of all redundance, which qualities
are virtues of the first type: and he says that from
the lips of Nestor<note><hi rend="italics">Il.</hi> i. 249.</note> flowed speech sweeter than honey,
than which assuredly we can conceive no greater
delight: but when he seeks to express the supreme
gift of eloquence possessed by Ulysses<note><hi rend="italics">Il.</hi> iii. 221.</note> he gives a
mighty voice and a vehemence of oratory equal to
the snows of winter in the abundance and the vigour
of its words.<milestone unit="section" n="65"/> <quote>With him then,</quote> he says, <quote>no mortal
will contend, and men shall look upon him as on a
god.</quote><note>A blend of <hi rend="italics">Il.</hi> iii. 223 and <hi rend="italics">Od.</hi> viii. 173.</note> It is this force and impetuosity that Eupolis
admires in Pericles, this that Aristophanes<note><hi rend="italics">Aeh.</hi> 530. <quote>Then in his wrath Pericles the Olympian
lightened and thundered and threw all Greece into confusion.</quote></note> compares
to the thunderbolt, this that is the power of true
eloquence.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="66"/>But eloquence cannot be confined even to these
three forms of style. For just as the third style is
intermediate between the grand and the plain style,
so each of these three are separated by interspaces

<pb id="p.489"/>

which are occupied by intermediate styles compounded of the two which he on either side.<milestone unit="section" n="67"/> For
there are styles fuller or plainer than the plain, and
gentler or more vehement than the vehement, while
the gentler style itself may either rise to greater
force or sink to milder tones. Thus we may discover
almost countless species of styles, each differing from
the other by some fine shade of difference. We may
draw a parallel from the winds. It is generally accepted that there are four blowing from the four
quarters of the globe, but we find there are also
a large number of winds which he between these,
called by a variety of names, and in certain cases
confined to certain districts and river valleys.<milestone unit="section" n="68"/> The
same thing may be noted in music. For after assigning five notes to the lyre, musicians fill up the
intervals between the strings by a variety of notes,
and between these again they interpose yet others,
so that the original divisions admit of a number of
gradations.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="69"/>Eloquence has, therefore, a quantity of different
aspects, but it is sheer folly to inquire which of these
the orator should take as his model, since every
species that is in itself correct has its use, and what
is commonly called <hi rend="italics">style of speaking</hi> does not depend
on the orator. For he will use all styles, as circumstances may demand, and the choice will be
determined not only by the case as a whole, but by
the demands of the different portions of the case.
<milestone unit="section" n="70"/>For just as he will not speak in the same way when
he is defending a client on a capital charge and
when he is speaking in a lawsuit concerned with an
inheritance, or discussing interdicts and suits taking
the form of a wager,<note><hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> I. x. 5 and IV. ii. 61. <hi rend="italics">Sponsio</hi> (= wager) was a form
of lawsuit in which the litigant promised to pay a certain
sum of money if he lost his case. The <hi rend="italics">intrdiet</hi> was an order
issued by the praetor commanding or prohibiting certain
action.</note> or claims in connexion with

<pb id="p.491"/>

loans, so too he will preserve a due distinction
between the speeches which he makes in the senate,
before the people and in private consultations, while
he will also introduce numerous modifications to
suit the different persons and circumstances of time
and place. Thus in one and the same speech he
will use one style for stirring the emotions, and
another to conciliate his hearers; it is from different
sources that he will derive anger or pity, and the
art which he employs in instructing the judge will
be other than that which he employs to move him.
<milestone unit="section" n="71"/>He will not maintain the same tone throughout his
<hi rend="italics">exordium, statement of fact, arguments, digression</hi> and
<hi rend="italics">peroration.</hi> He will speak gravely, severely, sharply,
with vehemence, energy, fullness, bitterness, or
geniality, quietly, simply, Hatteringly, gently, sweetly,
briefy or wittily; he will not always be like himself, but he will never be unworthy of himself.
<milestone unit="section" n="72"/>Thus the purpose for which oratory was above all
designed will be secured, that is to say, he will
speak with profit and with power to effect his aim,
while he will also win the praise not merely of the
learned, but of the multitude as well.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="73"/>They make the gravest mistake who consider that
the style which is best adapted to win popularity
and applause is a faulty and corrupt style of speaking
which revels in license of diction or wantons in
childish epigram or swells with stilted bombast or
riots in empty commonplace or adorns itself with
blossoms of eloquence which will fall to earth if
but lightly shaken, or regards extravagance as
sublime or raves wildly under the pretext of free
speech.<milestone unit="section" n="74"/> I am ready to admit that such qualities
please many, and I feel no surprise that this should

<pb id="p.493"/>

be the case. For any kind of eloquence is pleasing
and attractive to the car, and every effort of the
voice inspires a natural pleasure in the soul of man;
indeed this is the sole cause of those familiar gatherings in the Forum or on the Old Wall,<note>The <hi rend="italics">agger</hi> of Servius Tullius, which served as a promenadec.
The nearest modern parallel may be found in the <quote>Hyde
Park orator.</quote></note> so that there
is small reason for wonder if any pleader is safe to
draw a ring of listeners from the crowd.<milestone unit="section" n="75"/> And when
any unusually precious phrase strikes the ears of an
uneducated audience, whatever its true merits, it
wakens their admiration just for the very reason
that they feel they could never have produced it
themselves. And it deserves their admiration, since
even such success is hard to attain. On the other
hand, when such displays are compared with their
betters, they sink into insignificance and fade out
of sight, for they are like wool dyed red that
pleases in the absence of purple, but, as Ovid<note><hi rend="italics">Halm. Am.</hi> 707 <hi rend="italics">sqq.</hi></note> says,
if compared with a cloak of Tyrian dye, pales in the
presence of the fairer hue.<milestone unit="section" n="76"/> If, however, we test
such corrupt eloquence by the touchstone of a critical
taste, as, for example, we test inferior dyes with
sulphur, it will lay aside the false brilliance that
deceived the eye and fade to a pallor almost too
repulsive to describe. Such passages shine only in
the absence of the sunlight, just as certain tiny
insects seem transformed in the darkness to little
flames of fire. Finally, while many approve of things
that are bad, no one disapproves of that which is
good.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="77"/>But the true orator will not merely be able to
achieve all the feats of which I have spoken with
supreme excellence, but with the utmost ease as
well. For the sovereign power of eloquence and
the voice that awakens well-deserved applause will

<pb id="p.495"/>

be free from the perpetual distress of harassing
anxiety which wastes and fevers the orator who
painfully corrects himself and pines away over the
laborious weighing and piecing together of his
words.<milestone unit="section" n="78"/> No, our orator, brilliant, sublime and
opulent of speech, is lord and master of all the
resources of eloquence, whose affluence surrounds
him. For he that has reached the summit has no
more weary hills to scale. At first the climber's toil
is hard, but the higher he mounts the easier becomes the gradient and the richer the soil.<milestone unit="section" n="79"/> And
if by perseverance of study he pass even beyond
these gentler slopes, fruits for which none have
toiled thrust themselves upon him, and all things
spring forth unbidden; and yet if they be not
gathered daily, they will wither away. But even
such wealth must observe the mean, without which
nothing is either praiseworthy or beneficial, while
brilliance must be attended by manliness, and imagination by soundness of taste.<milestone unit="section" n="80"/> Thus the works
of the orator will be great not extravagant, sublime
not bombastic, bold not rash, severe but not gloomy,
grave but not slow, rich but not luxuriant, pleasing
but not effeminate, grand but not grandiose. It is
the same with other qualities: the mean is safest,
for the worst of all faults is to fly to extremes.</p>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After employing these gifts of eloquence in
the courts, in councils, in public assemblies and the
debates of the senate, and, in a word, in the performance of all the duties of a good citizen, the
orator will bring his activities to a close in a manner
worthy of a blameless life spent in the pursuit of
the noblest of professions. And he will do this,
not because he can ever have enough of doing good,

<pb id="p.497"/>

or because one endowed with intellect and talents
such as his would not be justified in praying that
such glorious labours may be prolonged to their
utmost span, but for this reason, that it is his duty
to look to the future, for fear that his work may be
less effective than it has been in the past.<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For the
orator depends not merely on his knowledge, which
increases with the years, but on his voice, lungs and
powers of endurance. And if these be broken or
impaired by age or health, he must beware that he
does not fall short in something of his high reputation as a master of oratory, that fatigue does not
interrupt his eloquence, that he is not brought to
realise that some of his words are inaudible, or to
mourn that he is not what once he was.<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Domitius
Afer was by far the greatest of all the orators whom
it has been my good fortune to know, and I saw
him, when far advanced in years, daily losing something of that authority which his merits had won
for him; he whose supremacy in the courts had once
been universally acknowledged, now pleaded amid
the unworthy laughter of some, and the silent
blushes of others, giving occasion to the malicious
saying that he had rather <quote>faint than finish.</quote><note>By <quote>finish</quote> is meant <quote>retire from pleading.</quote></note><milestone unit="section" n="4"/> And
yet even then, whatever his deficiencies, he spoke
not badly, but merely less well.</p>
<p>Therefore before ever he fall a prey to the ambush
where time lies in wait for him, the orator should
sound the retreat and seek harbour while his ship
is yet intact. For the fruits of his studies will
not be lessened by retirement. Either he will bequeath the history of his own times for the delight
of after ages, or will interpret the law to those
who seek his counsels, as Lucius Crassus proposes

<pb id="p.499"/>

to do in the <hi rend="italics">de Oratore</hi><note><hi rend="italics">de</hi> (<hi rend="italics">Or.</hi> I. xlii. 190.</note> of Cicero, or compose some
treatise on the art of oratory, or give worthy utterance
to the sublimest ideals of conduct.<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> His house
will, as in the days of old, be thronged by all
the best of the rising generation, who will seek to
learn from him as from an oracle how they may find
the path to true eloquence. And he as their father
in the art will mould them to all excellence, and
like some old pilot will teach them of the shores
whereby their ships must sail, of the harbours where
they may shelter, and the signs of the weather, and
will expound to them what they shall do when the
breeze is fair or the tempest blows. Whereto he
will be inclined not only by the common duty of
humanity, but by a certain passion for the task that
once was his, since no man desires that the art
wherein he was once supreme should suffer decay
or diminution.<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And what can be more honourable
than to teach that which you know surpassing well?
It was for this that the elder Caelius brought his son
to Cicero, as the latter<note><hi rend="italics">pro Cael.</hi> iv. 10.</note> tells us, and it was with this
intent that the same great orator took upon himself
the duties of instructor, and trained Pansa, Hirtius
and Dolabella by declaiming daily before them or
hearing them declaim.<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> And I know not whether
we should not deem it the happiest moment in an
orator's life, when he has retired from the public
gaze, the consecrated priest of eloquence, free from
envy and far from strife, when he has set his glory
on a pinnacle beyond the reach of detraction, enjoys,
while still living, that veneration which most men
win but after death, and sees how great shall be his
renown amid generations yet unborn.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>I can say with a good conscience that, as far as

<pb id="p.501"/>

my poor powers have permitted, I have published
frankly and disinterestedly, for the benefit of such
as might wish to learn, all that my previous knowledge and the researches made for the purpose of
this work might supply. And to have taught what
lie knows is satisfaction enough for any good man.
<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>I fear, however, that I may be regarded as setting
too lofty an ideal for the orator by insisting that he
should be a good man skilled in speaking, or as
imposing too many subjects of study on the learner.
For in addition to the many branches of knowledge
which have to be studied in boyhood and the traditional rules of eloquence, I have enjoined the study
of morals and of civil law, so that I am afraid that
even those who have regarded these things as
essential to my theme, may he appalled at the delay
which they impose and abandon all hope of achievement before they have put my precepts to the test.
<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>I would ask them to consider how great are the
powers of the mind of man and how astonishing its
capacity for carrying its desires into execution: for
has not man succeeded in crossing the high seas, in
learning the number and the courses of the stars,
and almost measuring the universe itself, all of them
accomplishments of less importance than oratory, but
of far greater difficulty? And then let them reflect
on the greatness of' their aims and on the fact that
no labour should be too huge for those that are
beckoned by the hope of such reward.<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> If they can
only rise to the height of this conception, they will
find it easier to enter on this portion of their task,
and will cease to regard the road as impassable or
even hard. For the first and greatest of' the aims
we set before us, namely that we shall be good

<pb id="p.503"/>

men, depends for its achievement mainly on the
will to succeed: and he that truly and sincerely
forms such resolve, will easily acquire those forms
of knowledge that teach the way to virtue.<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> For
the precepts that are enjoined upon us are not
so complex or so numerous that they may be
acquired by little more than a few years' study. It
is repugnance to learn that makes such labour long.
For if you will only believe it, you will quickly learn
the principles that shall lead you to a life of virtue
and happiness. For nature brought us into the world
that we might attain to all excellence of mind, and
so easy is it for those to learn who seek for better
things, that he who directs his gaze aright will
rather marvel that the bad should be so many.<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> For
as water is the natural element of fish, dry land
for creatures of the earth and the circumambient
atmosphere for winged things, even so it should
be easier to live according to nature than counter
to her will. As regards other accomplishments,
there are plenty of years available for their acquisition, even though we measure the life of man not
by the span of age, but by the period of youth. For
in every case order and method and a sense of proportion will shorten our labour.<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> But the chief fault
lies with our teachers, in that they love to keep back
the pupils they have managed to lay their hands on,
partly from the desire to draw their miserable fees
for as long as possible, partly out of ostentation, to
enhance the difficulty of acquiring the knowledge
which they promise to impart, and to some extent
owing to their ignorance or carelessness in teaching.
The next most serious fault lies in ourselves, who
think it better to linger over what we have learned

<pb id="p.505"/>

than to learn what we do not yet know.<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> For example, to restrict my remarks mainly to the study
of rhetoric, what is the use of spending so many
years, after the fashion now so prevalent (for I will
say nothing of those who spend almost their whole
lives), in declaiming in the schools and devoting so
much labour to the treatment of fictitious themes,
when it would be possible with but slight expenditure
of time to form some idea of what the true conflicts
are in which the orator must engage, and of the
laws of speaking which he ought to follow?<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> In
saying this, I do not for a moment mean to suggest
that we should ever omit to exercise ourselves in
speaking. I merely urge that we should not grow old
over one special form of exercise. We have been in a
position to acquire varied knowledge, to familiarise
ourselves with the principles that should guide our
life, and to try our strength in the courts, while we
were still attending the schools. The theory of speaking is of such a nature that it does not demand
many years for its acquisition. For any one of the
various branches of knowledge which I have mentioned will, as a rule, be found to be comprised in
a few volumes, a fact which shows that instruction
does not require an indefinite amount of time to be
devoted to it. The rest depends entirely on practice,
which at once develops our powers and maintains
them, once developed.<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Knowledge increases day
by day, and yet how many books is it absolutely
necessary to read in our search for its attainment, for
examples of facts from the historians or of eloquence
from the orators, or, again, for the opinions of the
philosophers and the lawyers, that is to say, if we
are content to read merely what is useful without

<pb id="p.507"/>

attempting the impossible task of reading everything?<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> But it is ourselves that make the time for
study short: for how little time we allot to it!
Some hours are passed in the futile labour of ceremonial calls, others in idle chatter, others in staring
at the shows of the theatre, and others again in
feasting. To this add all the various forms of amusement, the insane attention devoted to the cultivation
of the body, journeys abroad, visits to the country,
anxious calculation of loss and gain, the allurements
of lust, wine-bibbing and those remaining hours
which are all too few to gratify our souls on fire
with passion for every kind of pleasure.<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> If all this
time were spent on study, life would seem long
enough and there would be plenty of time for learning, even though we should take the hours of daylight only into our account, without asking any
assistance from the night, of which no little space
is superfluous even for the heaviest sleeper. As it
is, we count not the years which we have given to
study, but the years we have lived.<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> And indeed
even although geometricians, musicians and grammarians, together with the professors of every other
branch of knowledge, spend all their lives, however
long, in the study of one single science, it does not
therefore follow that we require several lives more
if we are to learn more. For they do not spend all
their days even to old age in learning these things,
but being content to have learned these things and
nothing more, exhaust their length of years not in
acquiring, but in imparting knowledge.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="21"/>However, to say nothing of Homer, in whom we
may find either the perfect achievements, or at
any rate clear signs of the knowledge of every art,

<pb id="p.509"/>

and to pass by Hippias of Elis, who not merely
boasted his knowledge of the liberal arts, but wore
a robe, a ring and shoes, all of which he had made
with his own hands, and had trained himself to be
independent of external assistance, we accept the
universal tradition of Greece to the effect that
Gorgias, triumphant over all the countless ills incident to extreme old age, would bid his hearers
propound any questions they pleased for him to
answer.<milestone unit="section" n="22"/> Again in what branch of knowledge
worthy of literary expression was Plato deficient?
How many generations' study did Aristotle require to embrace not merely the whole range of
philosophical and rhetorical knowledge, but to
investigate the nature of every beast and plant.
And yet they had to discover all these things which
we only have to learn. Antiquity has given us all
these teachers and all these patterns for our imitation,
that there might be no greater happiness conceivable
than to be born in this age above all others, since
all previous ages have toiled that we might reap the
fruit of their wisdom.<milestone unit="section" n="23"/> Marcus Cato was at once a
great general, a philosopher, orator, historian, and
an expert both in law and agriculture, and despite
his military labours abroad and the distractions of
political struggles at home, and despite the rudeness
of the age in which he lived, he none the less
learned Greek, when far advanced in years, that he
might prove to mankind that even old men are
capable of learning that on which they have set
their hearts.<milestone unit="section" n="24"/> How wide, almost universal, was the
knowledge that Varro communicated to the world!
What of all that goes to make up the equipment of
an orator was lacking to Cicero? Why should I say

<pb id="p.511"/>

more, since even Cornelius Celsus, a man of very
ordinary ability, not merely wrote about rhetoric in
all its departments, but left treatises on the art of
war, agriculture and medicine as well. Indeed the
high ambition revealed by his design gives him the
right to ask us to believe that he was acquainted
with all these subjects.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="25"/>But, it will be urged, to carry out such a task is
difficult and has never been accomplished. To
which I reply that sufficient encouragement for
study may be found in the fact, firstly, that nature
does not forbid such achievement and it does not
follow that, because a thing never has been done, it
therefore never can be done, and secondly, that all
great achievements have required time for their first
accomplishment.<milestone unit="section" n="26"/> Poetry has risen to the heights
of glory, thanks to the efforts of poets so far apart
as Homer and Virgil, and oratory owes its position
to the genius of Demosthenes and Cicero. Finally,
whatever is best in its own sphere must at some
previous time have been non-existent. But even if
a man despair of reaching supreme excellence (and
why should he despair, if he have talents, health,
capacity and teachers to aid him?), it is none the
less a fine achievement, as Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">Or.</hi> i. 4.</note> says, to win the
rank of second or even third.<milestone unit="section" n="27"/> For even if a soldier
cannot achieve the glory of Achilles in war, he will
not despise fame such as fell to the lot of Ajax and
Diomede, while those who cannot be Homers may
be content to reach the level of Tyrtaeus. Nay, if
men had been obsessed by the conviction that it was
impossible to surpass the man who had so far shown
himself best, those whom we now regard as best
would never have reached such distinction, Lucretius

<pb id="p.513"/>

and Macer would never have been succeeded by
Virgil, nor Crassus and Hortensius by Cicero, nor
they in their turn by those who flourished after
them.<milestone unit="section" n="28"/> But even though we cannot hope to surpass
the great, it is still a high honour to follow in their
footsteps. Did Pollio and Messala, who began to
plead when Cicero held the citadel of eloquence,
fail to obtain sufficient honour in their lifetime or
to hand down a fair name to posterity? The arts
which have been developed to the highest pitch
of excellence would deserve but ill of mankind if
that which was best had also been the last of its
line.<milestone unit="section" n="29"/> Add to this the further consideration that
even moderate eloquence is often productive of
great results and, if such studies are to be measured
solely by their utility, is almost equal to the perfect
eloquence for which we seek. Nor would it be difficult
to produce either ancient or recent examples to show
that there is no other source from which men have
reaped such a harvest of wealth, honour, friendship
and glory, both present and to come. But it would
be a disgrace to learning to follow the fashion of those
who say that they pursue not virtue, but only the
pleasure derived from virtue, and to demand this
meaner recompense from the noblest of all arts, whose
practice and even whose possession is ample reward
for all our labours.<milestone unit="section" n="30"/> Wherefore let us seek with all
our hearts that true majesty of oratory, the fairest
gift of god to man, without which all things are
stricken dumb and robbed alike of present glory and
the immortal record of posterity; and let us press
forward to whatsoever is best, since, if we do this,
we shall either reach the summit or at least see
many others far beneath us.</p>

<pb id="p.515"/>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="31"/>Such, Marcellus Victorius, were the views by
the expression of which it seemed to me that I
might, as far as in me lay, help to advance the
teaching of oratory. If the knowledge of these
principles proves to be of small practical utility to
the young student, it should at least produce what
[value more,&mdash;the will to do well.</p>
