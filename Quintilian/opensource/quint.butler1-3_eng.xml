friend Trypho, greeting</salute></opener>

<p>You have daily importuned me with the request
that I should at length take steps to publish the
book on the Education of an Orator which I dedicated
to my friend Marcellus. For my own view was that
it was not yet ripe for publication. As you know I
have spent little more than two years on its composition, during which time moreover I have been distracted by a multitude of other affairs. These two
years have been devoted not so much to actual writing
as to the research demanded by a task to which
practically no limits can be set and to the reading
of innumerable authors. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>  Further, following the precept of Horace who in his Art of Poetry deprecates
hasty publication and urges the would-be author

<quote rend="blockquote">
<l part="F">To withhold</l>
<l>His work till nine long years have passed away,</l></quote>

I proposed to give them time, in order that the
ardour of creation might cool and that I might
revise them with all the consideration of a dispassionate reader. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>  But if there is such a demand for
their publication as you assert, why then let us
spread our canvas to the gale and offer up a fervent
prayer to heaven as we put out to sea. But remember I rely on your loyal care to see that they
reach the public in as correct a form as possible.</p></div1>

<div1 type="book" n="1"><head>Book I</head>

<milestone unit="chapter" n="pr"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><p>Having at length, after twenty years devoted to
the training of the young, obtained leisure for study,
I was asked by certain of my friends to write
something on the art of speaking. For a long time I
resisted their entreaties, since I was well aware that
some of the most distinguished Greek and Roman
writers had bequeathed to posterity a number of
works dealing with this subject, to the composition
of which they had devoted the utmost care. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>  This
seemed to me to be an admirable excuse for my refusal, but served merely to increase their enthusiasm.
They urged that previous writers on the subject had
expressed different and at times contradictory
opinions, between which it was very difficult to
choose. They thought therefore that they were
justified in imposing on me the task, if not of
discovering original views, at least of passing definite
judgment on those expressed by my predecessors.
 <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>  I was moved to comply not so much because I
felt confidence that I was equal to the task, as

<pb id="p.7"/>

because I had a certain compunction about refusing.
The subject proved more extensive than I had first
imagined; but finally I volunteered to shoulder a
task which was on a far larger scale than that which
I was originally asked to undertake. I wished on
the one hand to oblige my very good friends beyond
their requests, and on the other to avoid the beaten
track and the necessity of treading where others
had gone before. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>  For almost all others who have
written on the art of oratory have started with the
assumption that their readers were perfect in all
other branches of education and that their own task
was merely to put the finishing touches to their
rhetorical training; this is due to the fact that they
either despised the preliminary stages of education
or thought that they were not their concern, since
the duties of the different branches of education
are distinct one from another, or else, and this
is nearer the truth, because they had no hope of
making a remunerative display of their talent in
dealing with subjects, which, although necessary,
are far from being showy: just as in architecture it
is the superstructure and not the foundations which
attracts the eye. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>  I on the other hand hold that the
art of oratory includes all that is essential for the
training of an orator, and that it is impossible to reach
the summit in any subject unless we have first passed
through all the elementary stages. I shall not therefore refuse to stoop to the consideration of those
minor details, neglect of which may result in there
being no opportunity for more important things, and
propose to mould the studies of my orator from infancy, on the assumption that his whole education has
been entrusted to my charge. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>  This work I dedicate


<pb id="p.9"/>

to you, Marcellus Victorius. You have been the truest
of friends to me and you have shown a passionate
enthusiasm for literature. But good as these reasons
are, they are not the only reasons that lead me to
regard you as especially worthy of such a pledge of
our mutual affection. There is also the consideration
that this book should prove of service in the
education of your son Geta, who, young though he
is, already shows clear promise of real talent. It has
been my design to lead my reader from the very
cradle of speech through all the stages of education
which can be of any service to our budding orator
till we have reached the very summit of the art. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>  I
have been all the more desirous of so doing because
two books on the art of rhetoric are at present
circulating under my name, although never published
by me or composed for such a purpose. One is a
two days' lecture which was taken down by the boys
who were my audience. The other consists of such
notes as my good pupils succeeded in taking down
from a course of lectures on a somewhat more
extensive scale: I appreciate their kindness, but
they showed an excess of enthusiasm and a certain
lack of discretion in doing my utterances the honour
of publication. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>  Consequently in the present work
although some passages remain the same, you will
find many alterations and still more additions, while
the whole theme will be treated with greater system
and with as great perfection as lies within my
power.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>  My aim, then, is the education of the perfect
orator. The first essential for such an one is that he
should be a good man, and consequently we demand
of him not merely the possession of exceptional


<pb id="p.11"/>

gifts of speech, but of all the excellences of character
as well. <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>  For I will not admit that the principles of
upright and honourable living should, as some have
held, be regarded as the peculiar concern of philosophy. The man who can really play his part as a
citizen and is capable of meeting the demands both
of public and private business, the man who can
guide a state by his counsels, give it a firm basis by
his legislation and purge its vices by his decisions as
a judge, is assuredly no other than the orator of our
quest. <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>  Wherefore, although I admit I shall make
use of certain of the principles laid down in philosophical textbooks, I would insist that such principles
have a just claim to form part of the subject-matter
of this work and do actually belong to the art of
oratory. <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>  I shall frequently be compelled to speak of
such virtues as courage, justice, self-control; in fact
scarcely a case comes up in which some one of these
virtues is not involved; every one of them requires
illustration and consequently makes a demand on
the imagination and eloquence of the pleader. I
ask you then, can there be any doubt that, wherever
imaginative power and amplitude of diction are required, the orator has a specially important part to
play? <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>  These two branches of knowledge were, as
Cicero has clearly shown,<note><hi rend="italics">de Or.</hi> iii. 15.</note> so closely united, not
merely in theory but in practice, that the same men
were regarded as uniting the qualifications of orator
and philosopher. Subsequently this single branch
of study split up into its component parts, and
thanks to the indolence of its professors was regarded as consisting of several distinct subjects.
As soon as speaking became a means of livelihood
and the practice of making an evil use of the


<pb id="p.13"/>

blessings of eloquence came into vogue, those who
had a reputation for eloquence ceased to study moral
philosophy, and ethics, <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>  thus abandoned by the
orators, became the prey of weaker intellects. As
a consequence certain persons, disdaining the toil of
learning to speak well, returned to the task of
forming character and establishing rules of life and
kept to themselves what is, if we <hi rend="italics">must</hi> make a
division, the better part of philosophy, but presumptuously laid claim to the sole possession of the
title of philosopher, a distinction which neither the
greatest generals nor the most famous statesmen
and administrators have ever dared to claim for themselves. For they preferred the performance to the
promise of great deeds. <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>  I am ready to admit that
many of the old philosophers inculcated the most excellent principles and practised what they preached.
But in our own day the name of philosopher has
too often been the mask for the worst vices. For
their attempt has not been to win the name of
philosopher by virtue and the earnest search for
wisdom; instead they have sought to disguise the
depravity of their characters by the assumption
of a stern and austere mien accompanied by the
wearing of a garb differing from that of their fellow
men. <milestone unit="section" n="16"/>  Now as a matter of fact we all of us frequently
handle those themes which philosophy claims for its
own. Who, short of being an utter villain, does not
speak of justice, equity and virtue? Who (and even
common country-folk are no exception) does not
make some inquiry into the causes of natural phenomena? As for the special uses and distinctions of
words, they should be a subject of study common to
all who give any thought to the meaning of language.

<pb id="p.15"/>

 <milestone unit="section" n="17"/>  But it is surely the orator who will have the greatest
mastery of all such departments of knowledge and
the greatest power to express it in words. And if ever
he had reached perfection, there would be no need
to go to the schools of philosophy for the precepts of
virtue. As things stand, it is occasionally necessary
to have recourse to those authors who have, as I
said above, usurped the better part of the art of
oratory after its desertion by the orators and to
demand back what is ours by right, not with a view
to appropriating their discoveries, but to show them
that they have appropriated what in truth belonged
to others. <milestone unit="section" n="18"/>  Let our ideal orator then be such as to
have a genuine title to the name of philosopher: it
is not sufficient that he should be blameless in point
of character (for I cannot agree with those who hold
this opinion): he must also be a thorough master of
the science and the art of speaking, to an extent
that perhaps no orator has yet attained. <milestone unit="section" n="19"/>  Still we
must none the less follow the ideal, as was done by
not a few of the ancients, who, though they refused
to admit that the perfect sage had yet been found,
none the less handed down precepts of wisdom for
the use of posterity. <milestone unit="section" n="20"/>  Perfect eloquence is assuredly
a reality, which is not beyond the reach of human
intellect. Even if we fail to reach it, those whose
aspirations are highest, will attain to greater heights
than those who abandon themselves to premature
despair of ever reaching the goal and halt at the
very foot of the ascent.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="21"/>  I have therefore all the juster claim to indulgence,
if I refuse to pass by those minor details which are
none the less essential to my task. My first book
will be concerned with the education preliminary to


<pb id="p.17"/>

the duties of the teacher of rhetoric. My second will
deal with the rudiments of the schools of rhetoric
and with problems connected with the essence of
rhetoric itself. <milestone unit="section" n="22"/>  The next five will be concerned
with Invention, in which I include Arrangement.
The four following will be assigned to Eloquence,
under which head I include Memory and Delivery.
Finally there will be one book in which our complete orator will be delineated; as far as my feeble
powers permit, I shall discuss his character, the
rules which should guide him in undertaking,
studying and pleading cases, the style of his eloquence, the time at which he should cease to plead
cases and the studies to which he should devote
himself after such cessation. <milestone unit="section" n="23"/>  In the course of these
discussions I shall deal in its proper place with
the method of teaching by which students will
acquire not merely a knowledge of those things
to which the name of art is restricted by certain
theorists, and will not only come to understand the
laws of rhetoric, but will acquire that which will
increase their powers of speech and nourish their
eloquence. <milestone unit="section" n="24"/>  For as a rule the result of the dry textbooks on the art of rhetoric is that by straining
after excessive subtlety they impair and cripple
all the nobler elements of style, exhaust the lifeblood of the imagination and leave but the bare
bones, which, while it is right and necessary that
they should exist and be bound each to each by
their respective ligaments, require a covering of flesh
as well. <milestone unit="section" n="25"/>  I shall therefore avoid the precedent set
by the majority and shall not restrict myself to this
narrow conception of my theme, but shall include in
my twelve books a brief demonstration of everything


<pb id="p.19"/>

which may seem likely to contribute to the education of an orator. For if I were to attempt to say
all that might be said on each subject, the book
would never be finished.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="26"/>  There is however one point which I must emphasise before I begin, which is this. Without
natural gifts technical rules are useless. Consequently the student who is devoid of talent will
derive no more profit from this work than barren
soil from a treatise on agriculture. <milestone unit="section" n="27"/>  There are, it is
true, other natural aids, such as the possession of a
good voice and robust lungs, sound health, powers of
endurance and grace, and if these are possessed only
to a moderate extent, they may be improved by
methodical training. In some cases, however, these
gifts are lacking to such an extent that their absence
is fatal to all such advantages as talent and study
can confer, while, similarly, they are of no profit in
themselves unless cultivated by skilful teaching, persistent study and continuous and extensive practice
in writing, reading and speaking.
</p>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>I would, therefore, have a father conceive the
highest hopes of his son from the moment of his
birth. If he does so, he will be more careful about
the groundwork of his education. For there is
absolutely no foundation for the complaint that but
few men have the power to take in the knowledge
that is imparted to them, and that the majority are
so slow of understanding that education is a waste
of time and labour. On the contrary you will find
that most are quick to reason and ready to learn.
Reasoning comes as naturally to man as flying to
birds, speed to horses and ferocity to beasts of prey:


<pb id="p.21"/>

our minds are endowed by nature with such activity
and sagacity that the soul is believed to proceed
from heaven. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>  Those who are dull and unteachable
are as abnormal as prodigious births and monstrosities, and are but few in number. A proof of what
I say is to be found in the fact that boys commonly
show promise of many accomplishments, and when
such promise dies away as they grow up, this is
plainly due not to the failure of natural gifts, but to
lack of the requisite care. But, it will be urged,
there are degrees of talent. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>  Undoubtedly, I reply,
and there will be a corresponding variation in actual
accomplishment: but that there are any who gain
nothing from education, I absolutely deny. The
man who shares this conviction, must, as soon as he
becomes a father, devote the utmost care to fostering the promise shown by the son whom he destines
to become an orator.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>  Above all see that the child's nurse speaks
correctly. The ideal, according to Chrysippus,
would be that she should be a philosopher: failing
that he desired that the best should be chosen, as
far as possible. No doubt the most important point
is that they should be of good character: but they
should speak correctly as well. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>  It is the nurse that
the child first hears, and her words that he will first
attempt to imitate. And we are by nature most
tenacious of childish impressions, just as the flavour
first absorbed by vessels when new persists, and the
colour imparted by dyes to the primitive whiteness
of wool is indelible. Further it is the worst
impressions that are most durable. For, while what
is good readily deteriorates, you will never turn vice


<pb id="p.23"/>

into virtue. Do not therefore allow the boy to
become accustomed even in infancy to a style of
speech which he will subsequently have to unlearn.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>  As regards parents, I should like to see them as
highly educated as possible, and I do not restrict this
remark to fathers alone. We are told that the
eloquence of the Gracchi owed much to their
mother Cornelia, whose letters even to-day testify to
the cultivation of her style. Laelia, the daughter
of Gaius Laelius, is said to have reproduced the
elegance of her father's language in her own speech,
while the oration delivered before the triumvirs by
Hortensia, the daughter of Quintus Hortensius, is
still read and not merely as a compliment to her sex.
 <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>  And even those who have not had the fortune to
receive a good education should not for that reason
devote less care to their son's education; but should
on the contrary show all the greater diligence in
other matters where they can be of service to their
children.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>  As regards the boys in whose company our budding
orator is to be brought up, I would repeat what
I have said about nurses. As regards his <hi rend="italics">paedagogi,</hi><note>There is no translation for <hi rend="italics">paedagogus,</hi> the slave-tutor.
<quote>Tutor,</quote> <quote>guardian,</quote> <quote>governor,</quote> and similar terms are
all misleading. He had the general supervision of the boy,
escorted him to school and elsewhere, and saw that lie
did not get into mischief, but did not, as a rule, direct his
studies.</note>
I would urge that they should have had a thorough
education, or if they have not, that they should be
aware of the fact. There are none worse than
those, who as soon as they have progressed beyond
a knowledge of the alphabet delude themselves
into the belief that they are the possessors of real
knowledge. For they disdain to stoop to the
drudgery of teaching, and conceiving that they
have acquired a certain title to authority&mdash;a frequent
source of vanity in such persons&mdash;become imperious
or even brutal in instilling a thorough dose of their


<pb id="p.25"/>

own folly. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>  Their misconduct is no less prejudicial
to morals. We are, for instance, told by Diogenes
of Babylon, that Leonides, Alexander's <hi rend="italics">paedagogus,</hi>
infected his pupil with certain faults, which as a
result of his education as a boy clung to him even in
his maturer years when he had become the greatest
of kings.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>  If any of my readers regards me as somewhat
exacting in my demands, I would ask him to reflect
that it is no easy task to create an orator, even
though his education be carried out under the most
favourable circumstances, and that further and
greater difficulties are still before us. For continuous application, the very best of teachers and
a variety of exercises are necessary. <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>  Therefore the
rules which we lay down for the education of our
pupil must be of the best. If anyone refuses to be
guided by them, the fault will lie not with the
method, but with the individual. Still if it should
prove impossible to secure the ideal nurse, the ideal
companions, or the ideal <hi rend="italics">paedagogus,</hi> I would insist
that there should be one person at any rate attached
to the boy who has some knowledge of speaking
and who will, if any incorrect expression should be
used by nurse or <hi rend="italics">paedagogus</hi> in the presence of
the child under their charge, at once correct the
error and prevent its becoming a habit. But it must
be clearly understood that this is only a remedy, and
that the ideal course is that indicated above.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>  I prefer that a boy should begin with Greek,
because Latin, being in general use, will be picked
up by him whether we will or no; while the fact
that Latin learning is derived from Greek is a
further reason for his being first instructed in the


<pb id="p.27"/>

latter. <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>  I do not however desire that this principle
should be so superstitiously observed that he should
for long speak and learn only Greek, as is done in the
majority of cases. Such a course gives rise to many
faults of language and accent; the latter tends to
acquire a foreign intonation, while the former
through force of habit becomes impregnated with
Greek idioms, which persist with extreme obstinacy
even when we are speaking another tongue. <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>  The
study of Latin ought therefore to follow at no great
distance and in a short time proceed side by side
with Greek. The result will be that, as soon as we
begin to give equal attention to both languages,
neither will prove a hindrance to the other.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>  Some hold that boys should not be taught to
read till they are seven years old, that being the
earliest age at which they can derive profit from
instruction and endure the strain of learning. Most
of them attribute this view to Hesiod, at least such
as lived before the time of Aristophanes the grammarian, who was the first to deny that the <hi rend="italics">Hypothecae,</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Admonitions,</hi> a lost didactic poem. Aristophanes of
Byzantium, 257&ndash;180 B.C., the famous Alexandrian critic.</note> in which this opinion is expressed, was the
work of that poet. <milestone unit="section" n="16"/>  But other authorities, among
them Eratosthenes, give the same advice. Those
however who hold that a child's mind should not be
allowed to lie fallow for a moment are wiser.
Chrysippus, for instance, though he gives the nurses
a three years' reign, still holds the formation of
the child's mind on the best principles to be a part
of their duties. <milestone unit="section" n="17"/>  Why, again, since children are
capable of moral training, should they not be
capable of literary education? I am well aware
that during the whole period of which I am speaking
we can expect scarcely the same amount of progress


<pb id="p.29"/>

that one year will effect afterwards. Still those who
disagree with me seem in taking this line to spare
the teacher rather than the pupil. <milestone unit="section" n="18"/>  What better
occupation can a child have so soon as he is able to
speak? And he must be kept occupied somehow or
other. Or why should we despise the profit to be
derived before the age of seven, small though it be?
For though the knowledge absorbed in the previous
years may be but little, yet the boy will be learning
something more advanced during that year, in which
he would otherwise have been occupied with something more elementary. <milestone unit="section" n="19"/>  Such progress each successive year increases the total, and the time gained
during childhood is clear profit to the period of
youth. Further as regards the years which follow
I must emphasise the importance of learning what
has to be learnt in good time. Let us not therefore
waste the earliest years: there is all the less excuse
for this, since the elements of literary training are
solely a question of memory, which not only exists
even in small children, but is specially retentive at
that age.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="20"/>  I am not however so blind to differences of age
as to think that the very young should be forced on
prematurely or given real work to do. Above all
things we must take care that the child, who is not
yet old enough to love his studies, does not come to
hate them and dread the bitterness which he has
once tasted, even when the years of infancy are
left behind. His studies must be made an amusement: he must be questioned and praised and
taught to rejoice when he has done well; sometimes
too, when he refuses instruction, it should be given
to some other to excite his envy, at times also he


<pb id="p.31"/>

must be engaged in competition and should be
allowed to believe himself successful more often than
not, while he should be encouraged to do his best by
such rewards as may appeal to his tender years.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="21"/>  These instructions may seem but trivialities in
view of the fact that I am professing to describe the
education of an orator. But studies, like men, have
their infancy, and as the training of the body which
is destined to grow to the fulness of strength begins
while the child is in his cradle and at his mother's
breast, so even the man who is destined to rise to
the heights of eloquence was once a squalling babe,
tried to speak in stammering accents and was
puzzled by the shapes of letters. Nor does the
fact that capacity for learning is inadequate, prove
that it is not necessary to learn anything. <milestone unit="section" n="22"/>  No
one blames a father because he thinks that such
details should on no account be neglected in the
case of his own son. Why then should he be criticised who sets down for the benefit of the public
what he would be right to put into practice in his
own house? There is this further reason why he
should not be blamed. Small children are better
adapted for taking in small things, and just as the
body can only be trained to certain flexions of the
limbs while it is young and supple, so the acquisition
of strength makes the mind offer greater resistance
to the acquisition of most subjects of knowledge.
 <milestone unit="section" n="23"/>  Would Philip of Macedon have wished that his son
Alexander should be taught the rudiments of letters
by Aristotle, the greatest philosopher of that age, or
would the latter have undertaken the task, if he had
not thought that even the earliest instruction is best
given by the most perfect teacher and has real


<pb id="p.33"/>

reference to the whole of education? <milestone unit="section" n="24"/>  Let us assume
therefore that Alexander has been confided to our
charge and that the infant placed in our lap deserves
no less attention than he&mdash;though for that matter
every man's child deserves equal attention. Would
you be ashamed even in teaching him the alphabet
to point out some brief rules for his education?</p>

<p>At any rate I am not satisfied with the course
(which I note is usually adopted) of teaching small
children the names and order of the letters before
their shapes. <milestone unit="section" n="25"/>  Such a practice makes them slow
to recognise the letters, since they do not pay
attention to their actual shape, preferring to be
guided by what they have already learned by
rote. It is for this reason that teachers, when
they think they have sufficiently familiarised their
young pupils with the letters written in their
usual order, reverse that order or rearrange it in
every kind of combination, until they learn to know
the letters from their appearance and not from
the order in which they occur. It will be best
therefore for children to begin by learning their
appearance and names just as they do with men.
 <milestone unit="section" n="26"/>  The method, however, to which we have objected in
teaching the alphabet, is unobjectionable when
applied to syllables. I quite approve on the other
hand of a practice which has been devised to
stimulate children to learn by giving them ivory
letters to play with, as I do of anything else that
may be discovered to delight the very young, the
sight, handling and naming of which is a pleasure.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="27"/>  As soon as the child has begun to know the
shapes of the various letters, it will be no bad thing
to have them cut as accurately as possible upon a


<pb id="p.35"/>

board, so that the pen may be guided along the
grooves. Thus mistakes such as occur with wax
tablets will be rendered impossible; for the pen
will be confined between the edges of the letters
and will be prevented from going astray. Further
by increasing the frequency and speed with which
they follow these fixed outlines we shall give steadiness to the fingers, and there will be no need to
guide the child's hand with our own. <milestone unit="section" n="28"/>  The art of
writing well and quickly is not unimportant for our
purpose, though it is generally disregarded by persons
of quality. Writing is of the utmost importance
in the study which we have under consideration and
by its means alone can true and deeply rooted
proficiency be obtained. But a sluggish pen delays
our thoughts, while an unformed and illiterate hand
cannot be deciphered, a circumstance which necessitates another wearisome task, namely the dictation of what we have written to a copyist. <milestone unit="section" n="29"/>  We shall
therefore at all times and in all places, and above all
when we are writing private letters to our friends,
find a gratification in the thought that we have not
neglected even this accomplishment.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="30"/>  As regards syllables, no short cut is possible: they
must all be learnt, and there is no good in putting
off learning the most difficult; this is the general
practice, but the sole result is bad spelling. <milestone unit="section" n="31"/>  Further
we must beware of placing a blind confidence in a
child's memory. It is better to repeat syllables and
impress them on the memory and, when he is
reading, not to press him to read continuously or
with greater speed, unless indeed the clear and
obvious sequence of letters can suggest itself without
its being necessary for the child to stop to think.


<pb id="p.37"/>

The syllables once learnt, let him begin to construct
words with them and sentences with the words.
 <milestone unit="section" n="32"/>  You will hardly believe how much reading is delayed
by undue haste. If the child attempts more than
his powers allow, the inevitable result is hesitation,
interruption and repetition, and the mistakes which
he makes merely lead him to lose confidence in what
he already knows. <milestone unit="section" n="33"/>  Reading must therefore first be
sure, then connected, while it must be kept slow for
a considerable time, until practice brings speed
unaccompanied by error. <milestone unit="section" n="34"/>  For to look to the right,
which is regularly taught, and to look ahead depends not so much on precept as on practice; since
it is necessary to keep the eyes on what follows
while reading out what precedes, with the resulting difficulty that the attention of the mind must
be divided, the eyes and voice being differently engaged. It will be found worth while, when the boy
begins to write out words in accordance with the
usual practice, to see that he does not waste his
labour in writing out common words of everyday
occurrence. <milestone unit="section" n="35"/>  He can readily learn the explanations
or <hi rend="italics">glosses,</hi> as the Greeks call them, of the more
obscure words by the way and, while he is still engaged on the first rudiments, acquire what would
otherwise demand special time to be devoted to it.
And as we are still discussing minor details, I would
urge that the lines, which he is set to copy, should
not express thoughts of no significance, but convey
some sound moral lesson. <milestone unit="section" n="36"/>  He will remember such
aphorisms even when he is an old man, and the impression made upon his unformed mind will contribute
to the formation of his character. He may also be
entertained by learning the sayings of famous men


<pb id="p.39"/>

and above all selections from the poets, poetry being
more attractive to children. For memory is most necessary to an orator, as I shall point out in its proper
place, and there is nothing like practice for strengthening and developing it. And at the tender age
of which we are now speaking, when originality is
impossible, memory is almost the only faculty which
can be developed by the teacher. <milestone unit="section" n="37"/>  It will be worth
while, by way of improving the child's pronunciation
and distinctness of utterance, to make him rattle
off a selection of names and lines of studied difficulty:
they should be formed of a number of syllables
which go ill together and should be harsh and
rugged in sound: the Greeks call them <quote>gags.</quote>
This sounds a trifling matter, but its omission will
result in numerous faults of pronunciation, which,
unless removed in early years, will become a perverse
and incurable habit and persist through life.</p>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But the time has come for the boy to grow up
little by little, to leave the nursery and tackle his
studies in good earnest. This therefore is the place
to discuss the question as to whether it is better to
have him educated privately at home or hand him
over to some large school and those whom I may
call public instructors. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>  The latter course has, I
know, won the approval of most eminent authorities
and of those who have formed the national character
of the most famous states. It would, however, be folly
to shut our eyes to the fact that there are some who
disagree with this preference for public education
owing to a certain prejudice in favour of private
tuition. These persons seem to be guided in the
main by two principles. In the interests of morality
they would avoid the society of a number of human


<pb id="p.41"/>

beings at an age that is specially liable to acquire
serious faults: I only wish I could deny the truth of
the view that such education has often been the
cause of the most discreditable actions. Secondly
they hold that whoever is to be the boy's teacher, he
will devote his time more generously to one pupil
than if he has to divide it among several. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>  The first
reason certainly deserves serious consideration. If
it were proved that schools, while advantageous
to study, are prejudicial to morality, I should give
my vote for virtuous living in preference to even
supreme excellence of speaking. But in my opinion
the two are inseparable. I hold that no one can be
a true orator unless he is also a good man and,
even if he could be, I would not have it so. I will
therefore deal with this point first.</p>

<p>It is held that schools corrupt the morals. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>  It is
true that this is sometimes the case. But morals
may be corrupted at home as well. There are
numerous instances of both, as there are also of
the preservation of a good reputation under either
circumstance. The nature of the individual boy
and the care devoted to his education make all the
difference. Given a natural bent toward evil or
negligence in developing and watching over modest
behaviour in early years, privacy will provide equal
opportunity for sin. The teacher employed at
home may be of bad character, and there is just as
much danger in associating with bad slaves as there
is with immodest companions of good birth. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>  On the
other hand if the natural bent be towards virtue,
and parents are not afflicted with a blind and torpid
indifference, it is possible to choose a teacher of the
highest character (and those who are wise will make


<pb id="p.43"/>

this their first object), to adopt a method of education of the strictest kind and at the same time to
attach some respectable man or faithful freedman to
their son as his friend and guardian, that his unfailing companionship may improve the character
even of those who gave rise to apprehension.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>  Yet how easy were the remedy for such fears.
Would that we did not too often ruin our children's
character ourselves! We spoil them from the
cradle. That soft upbringing, which we call kindness, saps all the sinews both of mind and body. If
the child crawls on purple, what will he not desire
when he comes to manhood? Before he can talk he
can distinguish scarlet and cries for the very best
brand of purple. We train their palates before we
teach their lips to speak. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>  They grow up in litters:
if they set foot to earth, they are supported by the
hands of attendants on either side. We rejoice if
they say something over-free, and words which we
should not tolerate from the lips even of an Alexandrian page are greeted with laughter and a kiss.
We have no right to be surprised. It was we that
taught them: <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>  they hear us use such words, they see
our mistresses and minions; every dinner party is
loud with foul songs, and things are presented to
their eyes of which we should blush to speak.
Hence springs habit, and habit in time becomes
second nature. The poor children learn these things
before they know them to be wrong. They become
luxurious and effeminate, and far from acquiring
such vices at schools, introduce them themselves.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>  I now turn to the objection that one master can
live more attention to one pupil. In the first place
there is nothing to prevent the principle of <quote>one


<pb id="p.45"/>

teacher, one boy</quote> being combined with school
education. And even if such a combination should
prove impossible, I should still prefer the broad
daylight of a respectable school to the solitude and
obscurity of a private education. For all the best
teachers pride themselves on having a large number
of pupils and think themselves worthy of a bigger
audience. <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>  On the other hand in the case of inferior teachers a consciousness of their own defects
not seldom reconciles them to being attached to a
single pupil and playing the part&mdash;for it amounts to
little more&mdash;of a mere <hi rend="italics">paedagogus.</hi></p>
<p> <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>  But let us assume that influence, money or friendship succeed in securing a paragon of learning to
teach the boy at home. Will he be able to devote
the whole day to one pupil? Or can we demand
such continuous attention on the part of the learner?
The mind is as easily tired as the eye, if given no
relaxation. Moreover by far the larger proportion
of the learner's time ought to be devoted to private
study. <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>  The teacher does not stand over him while
he is writing or thinking or learning by heart. While
he is so occupied the intervention of anyone, be he
who he may, is a hindrance. Further, not all reading requires to be first read aloud or interpreted by
a master. If it did, how would the boy ever become
acquainted with all the authors required of him? A
small time only is required to give purpose and
direction to the day's work, and consequently
individual instruction can be given to more than one
pupil. <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>  There are moreover a large number of
subjects in which it is desirable that instruction
should be given to all the pupils simultaneously.
I say nothing of the analyses and declamations of


<pb id="p.47"/>

the professors of rhetoric: in such cases there is no
limit to the number of the audience, as each individual pupil will in any case receive full value.
 <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>  The voice of a lecturer is not like a dinner which
will only suffice for a limited number; it is like the
sun which distributes the same quantity of light and
heat to all of us. So too with the teacher of
literature. Whether he speak of style or expound
disputed passages, explain stories or paraphrase
poems, everyone who hears him will profit by his
teaching. <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>  But, it will be urged, a large class is
unsuitable for the correction of faults or for explanation. It may be inconvenient: one cannot hope for
absolute perfection; but I shall shortly contrast the
inconvenience with the obvious advantages.</p>

<p>Still I do not wish a boy to be sent where he will
be neglected. But a good teacher will not burden
himself with a larger number of pupils than he can
manage, and it is further of the very first importance that he should be on friendly and intimate
terms with us and make his teaching not a duty
but a labour of love. Then there will never be
any question of being swamped by the number of
our fellow-learners. <milestone unit="section" n="16"/>  Moreover any teacher who has
the least tincture of literary culture will devote
special attention to any boy who shows signs of
industry and talent; for such a pupil will redound
to his own credit. But even if large schools are to
be avoided, a proposition from which I must dissent
if the size be due to the excellence of the teacher,
it does not follow that all schools are to be avoided.
It is one thing to avoid them, another to select the
best.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="17"/>  Having refuted these objections, let me now


<pb id="p.49"/>

explain my own views. <milestone unit="section" n="18"/>  It is above all things necessary that our future orator, who will have to live
in the utmost publicity and in the broad daylight of
public life, should become accustomed from his
childhood to move in society without fear and
habituated to a life far removed from that of the
pale student, the solitary and recluse. His mind
requires constant stimulus and excitement, whereas
retirement such as has just been mentioned induces
languor and the mind becomes mildewed like things
that are left in the dark, or else flies to the opposite
extreme and becomes puffed up with empty conceit;
for he who has no standard of comparison by which
to judge his own powers will necessarily rate them
too high. <milestone unit="section" n="19"/>  Again when the fruits of his study have
to be displayed to the public gaze, our recluse is
blinded by the sun's glare, and finds everything new
and unfamiliar, for though he has learnt what is required to be done in public, his learning is but the
theory of a hermit. <milestone unit="section" n="20"/>  I say nothing of friendships
which endure unbroken to old age having acquired
the binding force of a sacred duty: for initiation
in the same studies has all the sanctity of initiation
in the same mysteries of religion. And where shall
he acquire that instinct which we call common
feeling, if he secludes himself from that intercourse
which is natural not merely to mankind but even to
dumb animals? <milestone unit="section" n="21"/>  Further, at home he can only learn
what is taught to himself, while at school he will
learn what is taught others as well. He will hear
many merits praised and many faults corrected every
day: he will derive equal profit from hearing the
indolence of a comrade rebuked or his industry
commended. <milestone unit="section" n="22"/>  Such praise will incite him to

<pb id="p.51"/>

emulation, he will think it a disgrace to be outdone by
his contemporaries and a distinction to surpass his
seniors. All such incentives provide a valuable
stimulus, and though ambition may be a fault in
itself, it is often the mother of virtues. <milestone unit="section" n="23"/>  I remember
that my own masters had a practice which was not
without advantages. Having distributed the boys
in classes, they made the order in which they were
to speak depend on their ability, so that the boy
who had made most progress in his studies had the
privilege of declaiming first. <milestone unit="section" n="24"/>  The performances
on these occasions were criticised. To win commendation was a tremendous honour, but the prize
most eagerly coveted was to be the leader of the
class. Such a position was not permanent. Once a
month the defeated competitors were given a fresh
opportunity of competing for the prize. Consequently success did not lead the victor to relax his
efforts, while the vexation caused by defeat served
as an incentive to wipe out the disgrace. <milestone unit="section" n="25"/>  I will
venture to assert that to the best of my memory
this practice did more to kindle our oratorical ambitions than all the exhortations of our instructors,
the watchfulness of our <hi rend="italics">paedagogi</hi> and the prayers of
our parents. <milestone unit="section" n="26"/>  Further while emulation promotes
progress in the more advanced pupils, beginners who
are still of tender years derive greater pleasure from
imitating their comrades than their masters, just
because it is easier. For children still in the elementary stages of education can scarce dare hope to
reach that complete eloquence which they understand to be their goal: their ambition will not soar
so high, but they will imitate the vine which has to
grasp the lower branches of the tree on which it is


<pb id="p.53"/>

trained before it can reach the topmost boughs. <milestone unit="section" n="27"/>  So
true is this that it is the master's duty as well, if he
is engaged on the task of training unformed minds
and prefers practical utility to a more ambitious
programme, not to burden his pupils at once with
tasks to which their strength is unequal, but to curb
his energies and refrain from talking over the heads
of his audience. <milestone unit="section" n="28"/>  Vessels with narrow mouths will
not receive liquids if too much be poured into them
at a time, but are easily filled if the liquid is admitted in a gentle stream or, it may be, drop by
drop; similarly you must consider how much a
child's mind is capable of receiving: the things
which are beyond their grasp will not enter their
minds, which have not opened out sufficiently to
take them in. <milestone unit="section" n="29"/>  It is a good thing therefore that a
boy should have companions whom he will desire
first to imitate and then to surpass: thus he will be
led to aspire to higher achievement. I would add
that the instructors themselves cannot develop the
same intelligence and energy before a single listener
as they can when inspired by the presence of a
numerous audience.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="30"/>  For eloquence depends in the main on the state
of the mind, which must be moved, conceive images
and adapt itself to suit the nature of the subject
which is the theme of speech. Further the loftier
and the more elevated the mind, the more powerful
will be the forces which move it: consequently
praise gives it growth and effort increase, and the
thought that it is doing something great fills it with
joy. <milestone unit="section" n="31"/>  The duty of stooping to expend that power of
speaking which has been acquired at the cost of such
effort upon an audience of one gives rise to a silent


<pb id="p.55"/>

feeling of disdain, and the teacher is ashamed to
raise his voice above the ordinary conversational
level. Imagine the air of a declaimer, or the voice
of an orator, his gait, his delivery, the movements of
his body, the emotions of his mind, and, to go no
further, the fatigue of his exertions, all for the sake
of one listener! Would he not seem little less than
a lunatic? No, there would be no such thing as
eloquence, if we spoke only with one person at
a time.</p>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The skilful teacher will make it his first care,
as soon as a boy is entrusted to him, to ascertain his
ability and character. The surest indication in
a child is his power of memory. The characteristics of a good memory are twofold: it must be
quick to take in and faithful to retain impressions
of what it receives. The indication of next importance is the power of imitation: for this is a
sign that the child is teachable: but he must imitate
merely what he is taught, and must not, for
example, mimic someone's gait or bearing or defects. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>  For I have no hope that a child will turn
out well who loves imitation merely for the purpose
of raising a laugh. He who is really gifted will also
above all else be good. For the rest, I regard
slowness of intellect as preferable to actual badness. But a good boy will be quite unlike the
dullard and the sloth. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>  My ideal pupil will absorb
instruction with ease and will even ask some
questions; but he will follow rather than anticipate
his teacher. Precocious intellects rarely produce
sound fruit. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>  By the precocious I mean those who
perform small tasks with ease and, thus emboldened,
proceed to display all their little accomplishments


<pb id="p.57"/>

without being asked: but their accomplishments are
only of the most obvious kind: they string words together and trot them out boldly and undeterred by
the slightest sense of modesty. Their actual achievement is small, but what they can do they perform with
ease. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>  They have no real power and what they have
is but of shallow growth: it is as when we cast
seed on the surface of the soil: it springs up too
rapidly, the blade apes the loaded ear, and yellows
ere harvest time, but bears no grain. Such tricks
please us when we contrast them with the performer's age, but progress soon stops and our admiration withers away.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>  Such indications once noted, the teacher must next
consider what treatment is to be applied to the mind
of his pupil. There are some boys who are slack,
unless pressed on; others again are impatient of
control: some are amenable to fear, while others are
paralysed by it: in some cases the mind requires
continued application to form it, in others this result
is best obtained by rapid concentration. Give me
the boy who is spurred on by praise, delighted by
success and ready to weep over failure. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>  Such an
one must be encouraged by appeals to his ambition;
rebuke will bite him to the quick; honour will be a
spur, and there is no fear of his proving indolent.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>  Still, all our pupils will require some relaxation,
not merely because there is nothing in this world
that can stand continued strain and even unthinking
and inanimate objects are unable to maintain their
strength, unless given intervals of rest, but because
study depends on the good will of the student, a
quality that cannot be secured by compulsion.
 <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>  Consequently if restored and refreshed by a holiday


<pb id="p.59"/>

they will bring greater energy to their learning and
approach their work with greater spirit of a kind
that will not submit to be driven. <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>  I approve of play
in the young; it is a sign of a lively disposition; nor
will you ever lead me to believe that a boy who is
gloomy and in a continual state of depression is ever
likely to show alertness of mind in his work, lacking
as he does the impulse most natural to boys of his
age. <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>  Such relaxation must not however be unlimited: otherwise the refusal to give a holiday will
make boys hate their work, while excessive indulgence will accustom them to idleness. There are
moreover certain games which have an educational
value for boys, as for instance when they compete
in posing each other with all kinds of questions
which they ask turn and turn about. <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>  Games
too reveal character in the most natural way, at
least that is so if the teacher will bear in mind
that there is no child so young as to be unable to
learn to distinguish between right and wrong, and
that the character is best moulded, when it is still
guiltless of deceit and most susceptible to instruction: for once a bad habit has become engrained,
it is easier to break than bend. <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>  There must be no
delay, then, in warning a boy that his actions must
be unselfish, honest, self-controlled, and we must
never forget the words of Virgil,

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>So strong is custom formed in early years.</l></quote> <bibl>Georg. ii. 272.</bibl></cit></quote>
</p>

<p>I disapprove of flogging, although it is the regular
custom and meets with the acquiescence of Chrysippus, because in the first place it is a disgraceful
form of punishment and fit only for slaves, <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>  and is in

<pb id="p.61"/>

any case an insult, as you will realise if you imagine
its infliction at a later age. Secondly if a boy is so
insensible to instruction that reproof is useless, he
will, like the worst type of slave, merely become
hardened to blows. Finally there will be absolutely no
need of such punishment if the master is a thorough
disciplinarian. <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>  As it is, we try to make amends for
the negligence of the boy's <hi rend="italics">paedagogus,</hi> not by
forcing him to do what is right, but by punishing
him for not doing what is right. And though you
may compel a child with blows, what are you
to do with him when he is a young man no longer
amenable to such threats and confronted with tasks
of far greater difficulty? <milestone unit="section" n="16"/>  Moreover when children
are beaten, pain or fear frequently have results of
which it is not pleasant to speak and which are
likely subsequently to be a source of shame, a shame
which unnerves and depresses the mind and leads
the child to shun and loathe the light. <milestone unit="section" n="17"/>  Further if inadequate care is taken in the choices of respectable
governors and instructors, I blush to mention the
shameful abuse which scoundrels sometimes make
of their right to administer corporal punishment or
the opportunity not infrequently offered to others
by the fear thus caused in the victims. I will not
linger on this subject; it is more than enough if I
have made my meaning clear. I will content myself
with saying that children are helpless and easily
victimised, and that therefore no one should be given
unlimited power over them. <milestone unit="section" n="18"/>  I will now proceed to
describe the subjects in which the boy must be
trained, if he is to become an orator, and to indicate
the age at which each should be commenced.</p>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>As soon as the boy has learned to read and


<pb id="p.63"/>

write without difficulty, it is the turn for the teacher<note><hi rend="italics">grammaticus</hi> is the teacher of literature and languages;
at times it is necessary to restrict its meaning to <quote>grammar.</quote></note>
of literature. My words apply equally to Greek and
Latin masters, though I prefer that a start should
be made with a Greek: <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>  in either case the method
is the same. This profession may be most briefly
considered under two heads, the art of speaking
correctly and the interpretation of the poets; but
there is more beneath the surface than meets the
eye. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>  For the art of writing is combined with that of
speaking, and correct reading precedes interpretation, while in each of these cases criticism has its
work to perform. The old school of teachers indeed
carried their criticism so far that they were not
content with obelising lines or rejecting books whose
titles they regarded as spurious, as though they
were expelling a supposititious child from the family
circle, but also drew up a canon of authors, from
which some were omitted altogether. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>  Nor is it
sufficient to have read the poets only; every kind of
writer must be carefully studied, not merely for the
subject matter, but for the vocabulary; for words
often acquire authority from their use by a particular
author. Nor can such training be regarded as complete if it stop short of music, for the teacher of
literature has to speak of metre and rhythm: nor
again if he be ignorant of astronomy, can he understand the poets; for they, to mention no further points,
frequently give their indications of time by reference
to the rising and setting of the stars. Ignorance of
philosophy is an equal drawback, since there are
numerous passages in almost every poem based on
the most intricate questions of natural philosophy,
while among the Greeks we have Empedocles and
among our own poets Varro and Lucretius, all of


<pb id="p.65"/>

whom have expounded their philosophies in verse.
 <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>  No small powers of eloquence also are required to
enable the teacher to speak appropriately and
fluently on the various points which have just been
mentioned. For this reason those who criticise the
art of teaching literature as trivial and lacking in
substance put themselves out of court. Unless the
foundations of oratory are well and truly laid by
the teaching of literature, the superstructure will
collapse. The study of literature is a necessity for
boys and the delight of old age, the sweet companion of our privacy and the sole branch of study
which has more solid substance than display.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>  The elementary stages of the teaching of literature must not therefore be despised as trivial. It is
of course an easy task to point out the difference
between vowels and consonants, and to subdivide the
latter into semivowels and mutes. But as the pupil
gradually approaches the inner shrine of the sacred
place, he will come to realise the intricacy of the subject, an intricacy calculated not merely to sharpen the
wits of a boy, but to exercise even the most profound
knowledge and erudition. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>  It is not every ear that
can appreciate the correct sound of the different
letters. It is fully as hard as to distinguish the
different notes in music. But all teachers of literature will condescend to such minutiae: they
will discuss for instance whether certain necessary
letters are absent from the alphabet, not indeed
when we are writing Greek words (for then we
borrow two letters<note>Y and Z.</note> from them), but in the case of
genuine Latin words: <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>  for example in words such as
<hi rend="italics">seruus</hi> and <hi rend="italics">uulgus</hi> we feel the lack of the Aeolic
digamma; there is also a sound intermediate between


<pb id="p.67"/>


<hi rend="italics">u</hi> and <hi rend="italics">i,</hi> for we do not pronounce <hi rend="italics">optimum</hi> as we do <hi rend="italics">opimum,</hi> while in <hi rend="italics">here</hi> the sound is neither exactly <hi rend="italics">e</hi> or <hi rend="italics">i.</hi>
 <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>  Again there is the question whether certain letters
are not superfluous, not to mention the mark of the
aspirate, to which, if it is required at all, there
should be a corresponding symbol to indicate the
opposite: for instance <hi rend="italics">k,</hi> which is also used as an
abbreviation for certain nouns, and <hi rend="italics">q,</hi> which, though
slanted slightly more by us, resembles both in sound
and shape the Greek <hi rend="italics">koppa,</hi> now used by the Greeks
solely as a numerical sign<note><hi rend="italics">K</hi> = Kaeso, Kalendae, 'Karthago, Kaput, Kalumnia, etc.
The <hi rend="italics">q</hi>-sound can be expressed by c. <hi rend="italics">Koppa</hi> (ZZZ) as a numeral
= 90.</note>: there is also <hi rend="italics">x,</hi> the last
letter of our own alphabet, which we could dispense
with as easily as with <hi rend="italics">psi.</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>  Again the teacher of
literature will have to determine whether certain
vowels have not been consonantalised. For instance
<hi rend="italics">iam</hi> and <hi rend="italics">etiam</hi> are both spelt with an <hi rend="italics">i, uos</hi> and <hi rend="italics">tuos</hi>
both with a <hi rend="italics">u.</hi> Vowels, however, when joined as
vowels, either make one long vowel (compare the
obsolete method of indicating a long vowel by
doubling it as the equivalent of the circumflex),
or a diphthong, though some hold that even three
vowels can form a single syllable; this however is
only possible if one or more assume the role of
consonants. <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>  He will also inquire why it is that
there are two vowels which may be repeated, while
a consonant can only be followed and modified by
a different consonant.<note>The two vowels are <hi rend="italics">i</hi> and <hi rend="italics">u.</hi> A consonant cannot be
duplicated within one syllable.</note> But <hi rend="italics">i</hi> can follow <hi rend="italics">i</hi> (for
<hi rend="italics">coniicit</hi> is derived from <hi rend="italics">iacit</hi><note>The derivation is mentioned to show that two <hi rend="italics">i's,</hi> not
one, are found in the second syllable of <hi rend="italics">coniicit.</hi></note>): so too does <hi rend="italics">u,</hi> witness the modern spelling of <hi rend="italics">seruus</hi> and <hi rend="italics">uulgus.</hi> He
should also know that Cicero preferred to write
<hi rend="italics">aiio</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Maaiiam</hi> with a double <hi rend="italics">i;</hi> in that case one


<pb id="p.69"/>

of them is consonantalised. <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>  A boy therefore must
learn both the peculiarities and the common characteristics of letters and must know how they are
related to each other. Nor must he be surprised
that <hi rend="italics">scabillum</hi> is formed from <hi rend="italics">scamnus</hi> or that a
double-edged axe should be called <hi rend="italics">bipennis</hi> from
<hi rend="italics">pinnus,</hi> <quote>sharp</quote>: for I would not have him fall into
the same error as those who, supposing this word to
be derived from <hi rend="italics">his</hi> and <hi rend="italics">pennae,</hi> think that it is a
metaphor from the wings of birds.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>  He must not be content with knowing only those
changes introduced by conjugation and prefixes,
such as <hi rend="italics">secat secuit, cadit excidit, caedit exc&imacr;dit, calcat
exculcat,</hi> to which might be added <hi rend="italics">lotus</hi> from <hi rend="italics">lauare</hi>
and again <hi rend="italics">inlotus</hi> with a thousand others. He must
learn as well the changes that time has brought
about even in nominatives. For just as names like
<hi rend="italics">Valesius</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Fusius</hi> have become <hi rend="italics">Valerius</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Furius,</hi>
so <hi rend="italics">arbos, labos, vapos</hi> and even <hi rend="italics">clamos</hi> and <hi rend="italics">lases</hi><note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> of lares.</note>
were the original forms. <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>  And this same letter <hi rend="italics">s,</hi>
which has disappeared from these words, has itself
in some cases taken the place of another letter. For
our ancestors used to say <hi rend="italics">mertare</hi> and <hi rend="italics">pultare.</hi><note>For <hi rend="italics">mersare</hi> and <hi rend="italics">pulsare.</hi></note> They
also said <hi rend="italics">fordeum</hi> and <hi rend="italics">faedi,</hi> using <hi rend="italics">f</hi> instead of the
aspirate as being a kindred letter. For the Greeks
unlike us aspirate <hi rend="italics">f</hi> like their own <hi rend="italics">phi,</hi> as Cicero
bears witness in the <hi rend="italics">pro Fundanio,</hi> where he laughs at
a witness who is unable to pronounce the first letter
of that name. <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>  In some cases again we have substituted <hi rend="italics">b</hi> for other letters, as with <hi rend="italics">Burrus, Bruges,</hi>
and <hi rend="italics">Belena.</hi><note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> Pyrrus, Phryges, Helena.</note> The same letter too has turned <hi rend="italics">duellum</hi>
into <hi rend="italics">bellum,</hi> and as a result some have ventured to
call the <hi rend="italics">Duelii Belii.</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="16"/>  What of <hi rend="italics">stlocus</hi> and <hi rend="italics">stlites?</hi>
What of the connexion between <hi rend="italics">t</hi> and <hi rend="italics">d,</hi> a connexion


<pb id="p.71"/>

which makes it less surprising that on some of
the older buildings of Rome and certain famous
temples we should find the names <hi rend="italics">Alexanter</hi> and
<hi rend="italics">Cassantra?</hi> What again of the interchange of <hi rend="italics">o</hi>
and <hi rend="italics">u,</hi> of which examples may be found in <hi rend="italics">Hecoba,
notrix, Culcides</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Pulixena,</hi> or to take purely Latin
words <hi rend="italics">dederont</hi> and <hi rend="italics">probaueront?</hi> So too <hi rend="italics">Odysseus,</hi>
which the Aeolian dialect turned into <hi rend="italics">Ulysseus,</hi> has
been transformed by us into <hi rend="italics">Ulixes.</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="17"/>  Similarly <hi rend="italics">e</hi> in
certain cases held the place that is now occupied
by <hi rend="italics">i,</hi> as in <hi rend="italics">Menerua, leber, magester,</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Dioue victore</hi>
in place of <hi rend="italics">Dioui victori.</hi> It is sufficient for me to
give a mere indication as regards these points, for I
am not teaching, but merely advising those who
have got to teach. The next subject to which attention must be given is that of syllables, of which I will
speak briefly, when I come to deal with orthography.</p>

<p>Following this the teacher concerned will note
the number and nature of the parts of speech,
although there is some dispute as to their number.
 <milestone unit="section" n="18"/>  Earlier writers, among them Aristotle himself and
Theodectes, hold that there are but three, <hi rend="italics">verbs,
nouns</hi> and <hi rend="italics">convictions.</hi> Their view was that the
force of language resided in the verbs, and the
matter in the nouns (for the one is what we speak,
the other that which we speak about), while the
duty of the convinctions was to provide a link
between the nouns and the verbs. I know that
<hi rend="italics">conjunction</hi> is the term in general use. But <hi rend="italics">conviction</hi>
seems to me to be the more accurate translation of
the Greek <foreign lang="greek">.</foreign> <milestone unit="section" n="19"/>  Gradually the number was
increased by the philosophers, more especially by
the Stoics: <hi rend="italics">articles</hi> were first added to the <hi rend="italics">convinctions,</hi> then <hi rend="italics">prepositions:</hi> to nouns <hi rend="italics">appellations</hi> were


<pb id="p.73"/>

added, then the <hi rend="italics">pronoun</hi> and finally the <hi rend="italics">participle,</hi>
which holds a middle position between the verb
and the noun. To the verb itself was added the
<hi rend="italics">adverb.</hi> Our own language dispenses with the
articles, which are therefore distributed among the
other parts of speech. <milestone unit="section" n="20"/>  But <hi rend="italics">interjections</hi> must be
added to those already mentioned. Others however follow good authority in asserting that there
are eight parts of speech. Among these I may
mention Aristarchus and in our own day Palaemon,
who classified the <hi rend="italics">vocable</hi> or <hi rend="italics">appellation</hi> as a species
of the genus noun. Those on the other hand who
distinguish between the noun and the vocable, make
nine parts of speech. But yet again there are
some who differentiate between the vocable and the
appellation, saying that the <hi rend="italics">vocable</hi> indicates concrete
objects which can be seen and touched, such as a
<quote>house</quote> or <quote>bed,</quote> while an <hi rend="italics">appellation</hi> is something
imperceptible either to sight or touch or to both,
such as the <quote>wind,</quote> <quote>heaven,</quote> or <quote>virtue.</quote> They
added also the <hi rend="italics">asseveration,</hi> such as <quote>alas</quote> and the
<hi rend="italics">derivative</hi><note>Generally interpreted <hi rend="italics">collective:</hi> but see Colson, <hi rend="italics">Class.
Quart.</hi> x. l, p. 17; <hi rend="italics">fasciatim</hi> = in bundles (from <hi rend="italics">fascis</hi>).</note> such <hi rend="italics">as fasciatim.</hi> But of these classifications I do not approve. <milestone unit="section" n="21"/>  Whether we should translate <foreign lang="greek">proshgori/a</foreign> by <hi rend="italics">vocable</hi> or <hi rend="italics">appellation,</hi> and whether
it should be regarded as a species of noun, I leave
to the decision of such as desire to express their
opinion: it is a matter of no importance.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="22"/>  Boys should begin by learning to decline nouns
and conjugate verbs: otherwise they will never be
able to understand the next subject of study. This
admonition would be superfluous but for the fact
that most teachers, misled by a desire to show rapid
progress, begin with what should really come at the
end: their passion for displaying their pupils' talents


<pb id="p.75"/>

in connexion with the more imposing aspects of
their work serves but to delay progress and their
short cut to knowledge merely lengthens the
journey. <milestone unit="section" n="23"/>  And yet a teacher who has acquired
sufficient knowledge himself and is ready to teach
what he has learned&mdash;and such readiness is all too
rare&mdash;will not be content with stating that nouns
have three genders or with mentioning those which
are common to two or all three together. <milestone unit="section" n="24"/>  Nor
again shall I be in a hurry to regard it as a proof of
real diligence, if he points out that there are irregular nouns of the kind called <hi rend="italics">epicene</hi> by the Greeks,
in which one gender implies both, or which in spite
of being feminine or neuter in form indicate males
or females respectively, as for instance <hi rend="italics">Muraena</hi>
and <hi rend="italics">Glycerium.</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="25"/>  A really keen and intelligent teacher
will inquire into the origin of names derived from
physical characteristics, such as <hi rend="italics">Rufus</hi> or <hi rend="italics">Longus,</hi>
whenever their meaning is obscure, as in the case of
<hi rend="italics">Sulla, Burrus, Galba, Plautus, Pansa, Scaurus</hi> and the
like; of names derived from accidents of birth such
as <hi rend="italics">Agrippa, Opiter, Cordus</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Postumus,</hi> and again of
names given after birth such as <hi rend="italics">Vopiscus.</hi> Then there
are names such as <hi rend="italics">Cotta, Scipio, Laenas</hi> or <hi rend="italics">Seranus,</hi><note>Sulla =? spindleshanks (<hi rend="italics">surula</hi>). Burrus = red. Galba
= caterpillar. Plautus = flat-footed. Pansa = splay-footed.
Scaurus = with swollen ankles. Agrippa = born feet foremost. Opiter = one whose father died while his grandfather
still lived. Cordus = late-born. Postumus = last-born, or
born after the father's death. Vopiscus = a twin born alive
after the premature birth and death of the other. Scipio =
staff. Laenas from <hi rend="italics">laena</hi> (cloak). Seranus = the sower.
Cotta uncertain.</note>
which originated in various ways. <milestone unit="section" n="26"/>  It will also be found
that names are frequently derived from races, places
and many other causes. Further there are obsolete
slave-names such as <hi rend="italics">Marcipor</hi> or <hi rend="italics">Publipor</hi><note><hi rend="italics">i.e. Marcipuer, Publipuer.</hi></note> derived
from the names of their owners. The teacher must
also inquire whether there is not room for a sixth


<pb id="p.77"/>

case in Greek and a seventh in Latin. For when I
say <quote>wounded by a spear,</quote> the case is not a true
ablative in Latin nor a true dative in Greek. <milestone unit="section" n="27"/>  Again
if we turn to verbs, who is so ill-educated as not to
be familiar with their various kinds and qualities,
their different persons and numbers. Such subjects belong to the elementary school and the
rudiments of knowledge. Some, however, will
find points undetermined by inflexion somewhat
perplexing. For there are certain participles, about
which there may be doubts as to whether they are
really nouns or verbs, since their meaning varies
with their use, as for example <hi rend="italics">lectum</hi> and <hi rend="italics">sapiens,</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="28"/> while there are other verbs which resemble nouns,
such as <hi rend="italics">fraudator</hi> and <hi rend="italics">nutritor.</hi><note><hi rend="italics">lectum</hi> may be ace. of <hi rend="italics">lectus,</hi> <quote>bed,</quote> or supine or past
part. pass. of <hi rend="italics">legerc,</hi> <quote>to read</quote>; <hi rend="italics">sapiens</hi> may be pres. part.
of <hi rend="italics">sapere,</hi> <quote>to know,</quote> or an adj. = <quote>wise</quote>; <hi rend="italics">fraudator</hi> and
<hi rend="italics">nutritor</hi> are 2nd and 3rd pers. sing. fut. imper. pass. of
<hi rend="italics">fraudo and nutrio.</hi></note> Again <hi rend="italics">itur in antiquam
silvam</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> vi. 179: <quote>They go into the ancient wood.</quote></note> is a peculiar usage. For there is no subject
to serve as a starting point: <hi rend="italics">fletur</hi> is a similar example.
The passive may be used in different ways as for
instance in

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>panditur interea domus omnipotentis Olympi</l></quote> <bibl>Aen. x. 1</bibl></cit></quote>

 <quote rend="blockquote">Meanwhile the house of almighty Olympus
is opened.</quote>

and in


<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>totis usque adeo turbatur agris.</l></quote>

<bibl>Ecl. i. 11</bibl></cit></quote>

<quote rend="blockquote"><l>There is such confusion in all the fields.</l></quote>

Yet a third usage is found in <hi rend="italics">urbs habitatur,</hi> whence
we get phrases such as <hi rend="italics">campus curritur</hi> and <hi rend="italics">mare navigatur. <milestone unit="section" n="29"/>  Pransus</hi> and <hi rend="italics">potus</hi><note><quote>Having dined,</quote> <quote>having drunk.</quote> Active in sense,
passive in form.</note> have a meaning which does
not correspond to their form. And what of those
verbs which are only partially conjugated? Some
(as for instance <hi rend="italics">fero</hi>) even suffer an entire change in
the perfect. Others are used only in the third


<pb id="p.79"/>

person, such as <hi rend="italics">licet</hi> and <hi rend="italics">piget,</hi> while some resemble
nouns tending to acquire an adverbial meaning; for
we say <hi rend="italics">dictu</hi> and <hi rend="italics">factu</hi><note>Supines.</note> as we say <hi rend="italics">noctu</hi> and <hi rend="italics">diu,</hi>
since these words are participial though quite different
from <hi rend="italics">dicto and facto.</hi></p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Style has three kinds of excellence, correctness, lucidity and elegance (for many include the
all-important quality of appropriateness under the
heading of elegance). Its faults are likewise threefold, namely the opposites of these excellences. The
teacher of literature therefore must study the rules
for correctness of speech, these constituting the
first part of his art. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>  The observance of these rules
is concerned with either one or more words. I must
now be understood to use <hi rend="italics">verbum</hi> in its most general
sense. It has of course two meanings; the one covers
all the parts of which language is composed, as in
the line of Horace:

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>Once supply the thought,</l>
<l>And words will follow swift as soon as sought</l></quote> <bibl>Ars Poetica, 311.</bibl></cit></quote>

the other restricts it to a part of speech such as
<hi rend="italics">lego</hi> and <hi rend="italics">scribo.</hi> To avoid this ambiguity, some
authorities prefer the terms <hi rend="italics">voces, locutiones, dictiones.</hi>
 <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>  Individual words will either be native or imported,
simple or compound, literal or metaphorical, in
current use or newly-coined.</p>

<p>A single word is more likely to be faulty than
to possess any intrinsic merit. For though we
may speak of a word as appropriate, distinguished
or sublime, it can possess none of these properties
save in relation to connected and consecutive speech;
since when we praise words, we do so because they
suit the matter. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>  There is only one excellence that


<pb id="p.81"/>

can be isolated for consideration, namely euphony,
the Greek term for our <hi rend="italics">uocalitas:</hi> that is to say that,
when we are confronted with making a choice
between two exact synonyms, we must select that
which sounds best.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>  In the first place <hi rend="italics">barbarisms</hi> and <hi rend="italics">solecisms</hi> must not
be allowed to intrude their offensive presence. These
blemishes are however pardoned at times, because
we have become accustomed to them or because they
have age or authority in their favour or are near akin
to positive excellences, since it is often difficult to distinguish such blemishes from figures of speech.1 The
teacher therefore, that such slippery customers may
not elude detection, must seek to acquire a delicate
discrimination; but of this I will speak later when
I come to discuss figures of speech.<note><hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> &sect; 40.</note> <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>  For the present
I will define <hi rend="italics">barbarism</hi> as an offence occurring in
connexion with single words. Some of my readers
may object that such a topic is beneath the dignity
of so ambitious a work. But who does not know
that some <hi rend="italics">barbarisms</hi> occur in writing, others in
speaking? For although what is incorrect in
writing will also be incorrect in speech, the converse
is not necessarily true, inasmuch as mistakes in
writing are caused by addition or omission, substitution or transposition, while mistakes in speaking are
due to separation or combination of syllables, to
aspiration or other errors of sound. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>  Trivial as these
points may seem, our boys are still at school and I
am reminding their instructors of their duty. And
if one of our teachers is lacking in education and
has done no more than set foot in the outer courts
of his art, he will have to confine himself to the
rules published in the elementary text-books: the


<pb id="p.83"/>

more learned teacher on the other hand will be in a
position to go much further: first of all, for example,
he will point out that there are many different kinds
of <hi rend="italics">barbarism.</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>  One kind is due to race, such as the
insertion of a Spanish or African term; for instance
the iron tire of a wheel is called <hi rend="italics">cantus,</hi><note>Pers. v. 71. Usually, though wrongly, spelt <hi rend="italics">oanthus.</hi></note> though
Persius uses it as established in the Latin language;
Catullus picked up <hi rend="italics">ploxenum</hi><note>Cat. xcvii. 6.</note> (a box) in the valley
of the Po, while the author of the <hi rend="italics">in Pollionem,</hi> be
he Labienus or Cornelius Gallus, imported <hi rend="italics">casamo</hi>
from Gaul in the sense of <quote>follower.</quote> As for
<hi rend="italics">mastruca,</hi><note>In <hi rend="italics">Or. pro Scauro.</hi></note> which is Sardinian for a <quote>rough coat,</quote> it
is introduced by Cicero merely as an object of derision. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>  Another kind of barbarism proceeds from the
speaker's temper: for instance, we regard it as barbarous if a speaker use cruel or brutal language.
 <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>  A third and very common kind, of which anyone
may fashion examples for himself, consists in the
addition or omission of a letter or syllable, or in the
substitution of one for another or in placing one
where it has no right to be. <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>  Some teachers however,
to display their learning, are in the habit of picking
out examples of <hi rend="italics">barbarism</hi> from the poets and attacking the authors whom they are expounding for
using such words. A boy should however realize
that in poets such peculiarities are pardonable or
even praiseworthy, and should therefore be taught
less common instances. <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>  For Tinga of Placentia, if
we may believe Hortensius who takes him to task for
it, committed two <hi rend="italics">barbarisms</hi> in one word by saying
<hi rend="italics">precula</hi> for <hi rend="italics">pergula:</hi> that is to say he substituted c
for <hi rend="italics">g,</hi> and transposed <hi rend="italics">r</hi> and e. On the other hand


<pb id="p.85"/>

when Ennius writes <hi rend="italics">Mettocoque Fufetioeo,</hi><note>The barbarism lies in the use of the old Greek terminationoeo in the genitive.</note> where
the <hi rend="italics">barbarism</hi> is twice repeated, he is defended on
the plea of poetic licence. <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>  Substitution is however
sometimes admitted even in prose, as for instance
when Cicero speaks of the army of <hi rend="italics">Canopus which</hi> is
locally styled <hi rend="italics">Canobus,</hi> while the number of authors
who have been guilty of transposition in writing
<hi rend="italics">Trasumennus</hi> for <hi rend="italics">Tarsumennus</hi> has succeeded in standardising the error. Similar instances may be quoted.
If <hi rend="italics">adsentior</hi> be regarded as the correct form, we must
remember that Sisenna said <hi rend="italics">adsentio,</hi> and that many
have followed him on the ground of analogy: on
the other hand, if <hi rend="italics">adsentio</hi> is the correct form, we
must remember that <hi rend="italics">adsentior</hi> has the support of
current usage. <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>  And yet our fat fool, the fashionable
schoolmaster, will regard one of these forms as an
example of omission or the other as an instance
of addition. Again there are words which when
used separately are undoubtedly incorrect, but
when used in conjunction excite no unfavourable
comment. <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>  For instance <hi rend="italics">dua</hi> and <hi rend="italics">tre</hi> are <hi rend="italics">barbarisms</hi>
and differ in gender, but the words <hi rend="italics">duapondo</hi>
and <hi rend="italics">trepondo</hi><note>Two and three pounds in weight.</note> have persisted in common parlance
down to our own day, and Messala shows that the
practice is correct. <milestone unit="section" n="16"/>  It may perhaps seem absurd to
say that a <hi rend="italics">barbarism,</hi> which is an error in a single
word, may be made, like a <hi rend="italics">solecism,</hi> by errors in
connexion with number or gender. But take on the
one hand <hi rend="italics">scala</hi> (stairs) and <hi rend="italics">scopa</hi> (which literally
means a twig, but is used in the sense of broom)
and on the other hand <hi rend="italics">hordea</hi> (barley) and <hi rend="italics">mulsa</hi>
(mead): here we have substitution, omission and
addition of letters, but the blemish consists in the
former case merely in the use of singular for plural,


<pb id="p.87"/>

in the latter of plural for singular. Those on the
other hand who have used the word <hi rend="italics">gladia</hi> are guilty
of a mistake in gender. <milestone unit="section" n="17"/>  I merely mention these as
instances: I do not wish anyone to think that I
have added a fresh problem to a subject into which
the obstinacy of pedants has already introduced
confusion.</p>

<p>The faults which arise in the course of actual
speaking require greater penetration on the part
of the critic, since it is impossible to cite examples
from writing, except in cases where they occur
in poetry, as when the diphthong is divided into
two syllables in <hi rend="italics">Europai</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Asiai</hi><note>The archaic genitive as used by epic poets.</note>; or when the
opposite fault occurs, called <hi rend="italics">synaeresis</hi> or <hi rend="italics">synaloephe</hi>
by the Greeks and <hi rend="italics">complexio</hi> by ourselves: as an
example I may quote the line of Publius Varro:

<quote rend="blockquote"><l>turn te flagranti deiectum fulmine Plaethon.<note><hi rend="italics">Ph<hi rend="overline">oe</hi>thon</hi> for <hi rend="italics">Pha&euml;thon.</hi></note></l></quote>

 <milestone unit="section" n="18"/>  If this were prose, it would be possible to give
the letters their true syllabic value. I may mention
as further anomalies peculiar to poetry the lengthening of a short syllable as in <hi rend="italics">Italiam fato profugus,</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> i. 6.</note>
or the shortening of a long such as <hi rend="italics">un&#x012D;ius ob noxam
et furias;</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> i. 45.</note> but in poetry we cannot label these as
actual faults. <milestone unit="section" n="19"/>  Errors in sound on the other hand
can be detected by the ear alone; although in Latin,
as regards the addition or omission of the aspirate,
the question may be raised whether this is an error
when it occurs in writing; for there is some doubt
whether <hi rend="italics">h</hi> is a letter or merely a breathing, practice
having frequently varied in different ages. <milestone unit="section" n="20"/>  Older
authors used it but rarely even before vowels, saying
<hi rend="italics">aedus</hi> or <hi rend="italics">ircus,</hi> while its conjunction with consonants
was for a long time avoided, as in words such as


<pb id="p.89"/>

<hi rend="italics">Graccus</hi> or <hi rend="italics">triumpus.</hi> Then for a short time it broke
out into excessive use, witness such spelling as <hi rend="italics">chorona,
chenturia or</hi> <hi rend="italics">praecho,</hi> which may still be read in certain
inscriptions: the well-known epigram of Catullus<note>Cat. Ixxxi.</note>
will be remembered in this connexion. <milestone unit="section" n="21"/>  The spellings
vehementer, comprehendere and mihi have lasted to our
own day: and among early writers, especially of
tragedy, we actually find <hi rend="italics">mehe</hi> for <hi rend="italics">me</hi> in the older MSS.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="22"/>  It is still more difficult to detect errors of <hi rend="italics">tenor</hi> or
tone (I note that old writers spell the word <hi rend="italics">tonor,</hi>
as derived from the Greek <foreign lang="greek">to/nos</foreign>), or of accent, styled
prosody by the Greeks, such as the substitution of
the acute accent for the grave or the grave for the
acute: such an example would be the placing of the
acute accent on the first syllable of <hi rend="italics">Camillus,</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="23"/>  or the
substitution of the grave for the circumflex in <hi rend="italics">Cethegus,</hi>
an error which results in the alteration of the
quantity of the middle syllable, since it means
making the first syllable acute; or again the substitution of the circumflex for the grave on the
second syllable of <hi rend="italics">Appi,</hi> where the contraction of
two syllables into one circumflexed syllable involves
a double error. <milestone unit="section" n="24"/>  This, however, occurs far more frequently in Greek words such as <hi rend="italics">Atrei,</hi> which in our
young days was pronounced by the most learned of
our elders with an acute accent on the first syllable,
necessitating a grave accent on the second; the
same remark applies to <hi rend="italics">Nerei</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Terei.</hi> Such has
been the tradition as regards accents.<note>The Roman accent was a stress, while the Greek was a
pitch accent, though by the Christian era tending to change
into stress. Roman grammarians borrow the Greek terminology and speak of accents in terms of pitch. The explanation of this is probably that the Roman stress accent was
accompanied by an elevation of the pitch. Here the acute
accent certainly implies stress; the grave implies a drop in
pitch and the absence of stress. The circumflex means that
the voice rises slightly and then falls slightly, but implies
stress. See Lindsay, <hi rend="italics">Latin Language,</hi> pp. 148&ndash;153.</note>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="25"/>  Still I am well aware that certain learned men
and some professed teachers of literature, to ensure
that certain words may be kept distinct, sometimes
place an acute accent on the last syllable, both when
they are teaching and in ordinary speech: as, for
instance, in the following passage:

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>quae circus litora, circum piscosos scopulos,</l></quote> <bibl>Aen. iv. 254.</bibl></cit></quote>

 <milestone unit="section" n="26"/>  where they make the last syllable of <hi rend="italics">circum</hi> acute on
the ground that, if that syllable were given the grave
accent, it might be thought that they meant <hi rend="italics">circus</hi>
not <hi rend="italics">circuitus.</hi><note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> that <hi rend="italics">circum</hi> is the ace. of <hi rend="italics">circus,</hi> and not the adverb
indicating circuit.</note> Similarly when <hi rend="italics">quale</hi> is interrogative,
they give the final syllable a grave accent, but when
using it in a comparison, make it acute. This practice,
however, they restrict almost entirely to adverbs
and pronouns; in other cases they follow the old
usage. <milestone unit="section" n="27"/>  Personally I think that in such phrases
as these the circumstances are almost entirely altered
by the fact that we join two words together. For
when I say <hi rend="italics">circum litora</hi> I pronounce the phrase as
one word, concealing the fact that it is composed of
two, consequently it contains but one acute accent,
as though it were a single word. The same thing
occurs in the phrase <hi rend="italics">Troiae qui primus ab oris.</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Aen. i.</hi> l: <hi rend="italics">qui</hi> coalesces with <hi rend="italics">primus, ab</hi> with <hi rend="italics">oris.</hi></note> <milestone unit="section" n="28"/>  It
sometimes happens that the accent is altered by
the metre as in pecudes pictaeque volucres<note><hi rend="italics">Georg.</hi> iii. 243.</note>; for I shall
read <hi rend="italics">volucres</hi> with the acute on the middle syllable,
because, although that syllable is short by nature, it
is long by position: else the last two syllables
would form an iambus, which its position in the
hexameter does not allow. <milestone unit="section" n="29"/>  But these same words,
if separated, will form no exception to the rule: or
if the custom under discussion prevails, the old law


<pb id="p.93"/>

of the language will disappear. (This law is more
difficult for the Greeks to observe, because they
have several dialects, as they call them, and what is
wrong in one may be right in another.) But with us
the rule is simplicity itself. <milestone unit="section" n="30"/>  For in every word
the acute accent is restricted to three syllables,
whether these be the only syllables in the word or
the three last, and will fall either on the penultimate
or the antepenultimate. The middle of the three
syllables of which I speak will be acute or circumflexed, if long, while if it be short, it will have a
grave accent and the acute will be thrown back to
the preceding syllable, that is to say the antepenultimate. <milestone unit="section" n="31"/>  Every word has an acute accent, but
never more than one. Further the acute never falls
on the last syllable and therefore in dissyllabic words
marks the first syllable. Moreover the acute accent
and the circumflex are never found in one and the
same word, since the circumflex itself contains an
acute accent. Neither the circumflex nor the acute,
therefore, will ever be found in the last syllable of
a Latin word, with this exception, that monosyllables
must either be acute or circumflexed; otherwise we
should find words without an acute accent at all.
 <milestone unit="section" n="32"/>  There are also faults of sound, which we cannot reproduce in writing, as they spring from defects of the
voice and tongue. The Greeks who are happier in
inventing names than we are call them iotacisms,
lambdacisms,<note>Iotacism = doubling the i sound, e.g. <hi rend="italics">Troiia</hi> for <hi rend="italics">Troia;</hi>
lambdacism = doubling the l.</note> <foreign lang="greek">i)sxno/thtes</foreign> (attenuations) and <foreign lang="greek">plateiasmoi/</foreign> (broadenings); they also use the term <foreign lang="greek">koilostomi/a,</foreign>
when the voice seems to proceed from the depths of
the mouth. <milestone unit="section" n="33"/>  There are also certain peculiar and
indescribable sounds for which we sometimes take
whole nations to fault. To sum up then, if all the
faults of which we have just spoken be avoided,


<pb id="p.95"/>

we shall be in possession of the Greek <foreign lang="greek">o)rqoe/peia,</foreign>
that is to say, an exact and pleasing articulation; for
that is what we mean when we speak of correct
pronunciation.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="34"/>  All other faults in speaking are concerned with
more words than one; among this class of faults is
the <hi rend="italics">solecism,</hi> although there have been controversies
about this as well. For even those who acknowledge
that it occurs in connected speech, argue that, since
it can be corrected by the alteration of one word,
the fault lies in the word and not in the phrase or
sentence. <milestone unit="section" n="35"/>  For example whether <hi rend="italics">amarae corticis</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Ecl.</hi> vi. 62.</note> or
<hi rend="italics">medio cortice</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Georg.</hi> ii. 74.</note> contains a solecism in gender (and
personally I object to neither, as Vergil is the
author of both; however, for the sake of argument
let us assume that one of the two is incorrect), still
whichever phrase is incorrect, it can be set right by
the alteration of the word in which the fault lies:
that is to say we can emend either to <hi rend="italics">amari corticis</hi>
or <hi rend="italics">media cortice.</hi> But it is obvious that these critics
misrepresent the case. For neither word is faulty
in itself; the error arises from its association with
another word. The fault therefore lies in the
phrase. <milestone unit="section" n="36"/>  Those who raise the question as to whether
a <hi rend="italics">solecism</hi> can arise in a single word show greater
intelligence. Is it for instance a <hi rend="italics">solecism</hi> if a man
when calling a single person to him says <hi rend="italics">uenite,</hi>
or in dismissing several persons says <hi rend="italics">abi</hi> or <hi rend="italics">discede?</hi>
Or again if the answer does not correspond to the
question: suppose, for example, when someone said
to you <quote>Whom do I see?</quote>, you were to reply <quote>I.</quote>
Some too think it a <hi rend="italics">solecism</hi> if the spoken word is
contradicted by the motion of hand or head. <milestone unit="section" n="37"/>  I do
not entirely concur with this view nor yet do I

<pb id="p.97"/>

wholly dissent. I admit that a <hi rend="italics">solecism</hi> may occur
in a single word, but with this proviso: there must
be something else equivalent to another word, to
which the word, in which the error lies, can be
referred, so that the <hi rend="italics">solecism</hi> arises from the faulty
connexion of those symbols by which facts are expressed and purpose indicated. <milestone unit="section" n="38"/>  To avoid all suspicion of quibbling, I will say that a <hi rend="italics">solecism</hi> may
occur in one word, but never in a word in isolation.
There is, however, some controversy as to the
number and nature of the different kinds of <hi rend="italics">solecism.</hi>
Those who have dealt with the subject most fully
make a fourfold division, identical with that which
is made in the case of <hi rend="italics">barbarisms: solecisms</hi> are
brought about by addition, for instance in phrases
such as <hi rend="italics">nam enim, de susum, in Alexandriam;</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="39"/>  by
omission, in phrases such as <hi rend="italics">ambulo viam, Aegypto
venio,</hi> or <hi rend="italics">ne hoc fecit:</hi> and by transposition as in
<hi rend="italics">quoque ego, enim hoc voluit, aulem non habuit.</hi><note><hi rend="italics">i.e. nam</hi> cannot he coupled with <hi rend="italics">enim; de</hi> being a preposition cannot govern an adverb (<quote>from above</quote>); <hi rend="italics">in</hi> is
not required with <hi rend="italics">Alexandriam,</hi> which is the name of a
town. <hi rend="italics">Quoque, enim</hi> and <hi rend="italics">autem</hi> cannot come first in a
sentence <hi rend="italics">Ambulo per viam, ab Aegypto venio, ne hoc
quidem fecit</hi> would be the correct Latin.</note> Under
this last head comes the question whether <hi rend="italics">igitur</hi> can
be placed first in a sentence: for I note that authors
of the first rank disagree on this point, some of
them frequently placing it in that position, others
never. <milestone unit="section" n="40"/>  Some distinguish these three classes of
error from the <hi rend="italics">solecism,</hi> styling addition a <hi rend="italics">pleonasm,</hi>
omission an <hi rend="italics">ellipse,</hi> and transposition <hi rend="italics">anastrophe:</hi> and
they assert that if <hi rend="italics">anastrophe</hi> is a solecism, <hi rend="italics">hyperbaton</hi>
might also be so called. <milestone unit="section" n="41"/>  About substitution, that is
when one word is used instead of another, there is
no dispute. It is an error which we may detect in
connexion with all the parts of speech, but most
frequently in the verb, because it has greater variety

<pb id="p.99"/>

than any other: consequently in connexion with the
verb we get <hi rend="italics">solecisms</hi> of gender, tense, person and
mood (or <quote>states</quote> or <quote>qualities</quote> if you prefer either
of these terms), be these types of error six in number,
as some assert, or eight as is insisted by others (for
the number of the forms of solecism will depend on
the number of subdivisions which you assign to the
parts of speech of which we have just spoken).
Further there are solecisms of number; <milestone unit="section" n="42"/>  now Latin
has two numbers, singular and plural, while Greek
possesses a third, namely the dual. There have
however been some who have given us a dual as
well in words such as <hi rend="italics">scripsere</hi> and <hi rend="italics">legere,</hi> in which
as a matter of fact the final syllable has been
softened to avoid harshness, just as in old writers
we find <hi rend="italics">male merere</hi> for <hi rend="italics">male mereris.</hi> Consequently
what they assert to be a dual is concerned solely
with this one class of termination, whereas in Greek
it is found throughout the whole structure of the
verb and in nouns as well, though even then it is
but rarely used. <milestone unit="section" n="43"/>  But we find not a trace of such a
usage in any Latin author. On the contrary phrases
such as <hi rend="italics">devenere locos,</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> i. 369: <quote>They came to the places.</quote></note> <hi rend="italics">conticuere omnes</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> ii. l: <quote>All were silent.</quote></note> and
<hi rend="italics">consedere duces</hi><note>Ovid, <hi rend="italics">Met.</hi> xiii. l: <quote>The chiefs sat them down.</quote></note> clearly prove that they have nothing to do with the dual. Moreover <hi rend="italics">dixere,</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Dixere,</hi> <quote>they have spoken,</quote> was said when the advocates had finished their pleading.</note> although Antonius Rufus cites it as proof to the
contrary, is often used by the usher in the courts to
denote more than two advocates. <milestone unit="section" n="44"/>  Again, does not
Livy near the beginning of his first book write
<hi rend="italics">tenuere arcem Sabini</hi><note>Liv. I. xii.: <quote>The Sabines held the citadel.</quote> <quote>The
Romans marched up the slope against them.</quote></note> and later <hi rend="italics">in adversum Romani
subiere?</hi> But I can produce still better authority.
For Cicero in his <hi rend="italics">Orator</hi> says, <quote>I have no objection

<pb id="p.101"/>

to the form <hi rend="italics">scripsere,</hi> though I regard <hi rend="italics">scripserunt</hi> as
the more correct.</quote><note><hi rend="italics">Orat.</hi> xlvii. 157.</note> <milestone unit="section" n="45"/>  Similarly in vocables and
nouns <hi rend="italics">solecisms</hi> occur in connexion with gender,
number and more especially case, by substitution
of one for another. To these may be added
<hi rend="italics">solecisms</hi> in the use of comparatives and superlatives,
or the employment of patronymics instead of
possessives and <hi rend="italics">vice versa.</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="46"/>  As for <hi rend="italics">solecisms</hi> connected
with expressions of quantity, there are some who
will regard phrases such as <hi rend="italics">magnum peculiolum</hi><note>Lit. <quote>A great little fortune.</quote></note> as a
solecism, because the diminutive is used instead of
the ordinary noun, which implies no diminution. I
think I should call it a misuse of the diminutive rather
than a <hi rend="italics">solecism;</hi> for it is an error of sense, whereas
solecisms are not errors of sense, but rather faulty
combinations of words. <milestone unit="section" n="47"/>  As regards participles,
<hi rend="italics">solecisms</hi> occur in case and gender as with nouns, in
tense as with verbs, and in number as in both.
The pronoun admits of <hi rend="italics">solecisms</hi> in gender, number
and case. <milestone unit="section" n="48"/>  <hi rend="italics">Solecisms</hi> also occur with great frequency in connexion with parts of speech: but
a bare statement on this point is not sufficient,
as it may lead a boy to think that such error
consists only in the substitution of one part of
speech for another, as for instance if a verb is
placed where we require a noun, or an adverb takes
the place of a pronoun and so on. <milestone unit="section" n="49"/>  For there are
some nouns which are cognate, that is to say of the
same <hi rend="italics">genus,</hi> and he who uses the wrong <hi rend="italics">species</hi><note><hi rend="italics">e.g. intus</hi>for <hi rend="italics">intro,</hi> the <hi rend="italics">genus</hi>being adverbs of place.</note> in
connexion with one of these will be guilty of the
same offence as if he were to change the <hi rend="italics">genus.</hi>
Thus <hi rend="italics">an</hi> and <hi rend="italics">aut</hi> are conjunctions, but it would be
bad Latin to say in a question <hi rend="italics">hic</hi> and <hi rend="italics">ille sit</hi><note>For <hi rend="italics">hic an ille sit?</hi></note>; <milestone unit="section" n="50"/>  <hi rend="italics">ne</hi> and

<pb id="p.103"/>

<hi rend="italics">non</hi> are adverbs: but he who says <hi rend="italics">non feceris</hi> in lieu
of <hi rend="italics">ne feceris,</hi> is guilty of a similar mistake, since one
negative denies, while the other forbids. Further
<hi rend="italics">intro</hi> and <hi rend="italics">intus</hi> are adverbs of place, but <hi rend="italics">eo intus</hi> and
<hi rend="italics">intro sum</hi> are solecisms. <milestone unit="section" n="51"/>  Similar errors may be
committed in connexion with the various kinds of
pronouns, interjections and prepositions. It is also
a <hi rend="italics">solecism</hi><note>The meaning of this passage is uncertain, but the
solecism in question is probably an anacoluthon.</note> if there is a disagreement between what
precedes and what follows within the limits of a
single clause. <milestone unit="section" n="52"/>  Some phrases have all the appearance
of a <hi rend="italics">solecism</hi> and yet cannot be called faulty; take
for instance phrases such as <hi rend="italics">tragoedia Thyestes</hi> or
<hi rend="italics">ludi Floralia</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Megalensia</hi><note>Where strict grammar would require <hi rend="italics">tragoedia Thyestis,
ludi Florales, Megalenses.</hi> The normal usage would be
simply to say <hi rend="italics">Thyestes, Floralia, Megalensia.</hi></note>: although these are
never found in later times, they are the rule in
ancient writers. We will therefore style them <hi rend="italics">figures</hi>
and, though their use is more frequent in poets, will
not deny their employment even to orators. <milestone unit="section" n="53"/>  Figures
however will generally have some justification,
as I shall show in a later portion of this work, which
I promised you a little while back.<note>I. iv. 24. The promise is fulfilled in Book IX.</note> I must however point out that a figure, if used unwittingly,
will be a <hi rend="italics">solecism.</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="54"/>  In the same class, though they
cannot be called figures, come errors such as the use
of masculine names with a female termination and
feminine names with a neuter termination. I have
said enough about <hi rend="italics">solecisms;</hi> for I did not set out to
write a treatise on grammar, but was unwilling to
slight the science by passing it by without salutation,
when it met me in the course of my journey.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="55"/>  I therefore resume the path which I prescribed
for myself and point out that words are either

<pb id="p.105"/>

native or foreign. Foreign words, like our population
and our institutions, have come to us from practically
every nation upon earth. <milestone unit="section" n="56"/>  I pass by words of Tuscan,
Sabine and Praenestine origin; for though Lucilius
attacks Vettius for using them, and Pollio reproves
Livy for his lapses into the dialect of Padua, I may be
allowed to regard all such words as of native origin.
Many Gallic words have become current coin, <milestone unit="section" n="57"/>  such
as <hi rend="italics">raeda</hi> (chariot) and <hi rend="italics">petorritim</hi> (four-wheeled
wagon) of which Cicero uses the former and Horace
the latter. <hi rend="italics">Mappa</hi> (napkin) again, a word familiar
in connexion with the circus, is claimed by the
Carthaginians, while I have heard that <hi rend="italics">gurdus,</hi> which
is colloquially used in the sense of <quote>stupid,</quote> is
derived from Spain. <milestone unit="section" n="58"/>  But this distinction between
native and foreign words has reference chiefly to
Greek. For Latin is largely derived from that
language, and we use words which are admittedly
Greek to express things for which we have no Latin
equivalent. Similiarly they at tines borrow words
from us. In this connexion the problem arises
whether foreign words should be declined according
to their language or our own. <milestone unit="section" n="59"/>  If you come across
an archaistic grammarian, he will insist on absolute
conformity to Latin practice, because, since we have
an ablative and the Greeks have not, it would be
absurd in declining a word to use five Greek
cases and one Latin. <milestone unit="section" n="60"/>  He will also praise the
patriotism of those who aimed at strengthening the
Latin language and asserted that we had no need
of foreign practices. They, therefore, pronounced
<hi rend="italics">Castorem</hi> with the second syllable long to bring it
into conformity with all those Latin nouns which
have the same termination in the nominative as

<pb id="p.107"/>

<hi rend="italics">Castor.</hi> They also insisted on the forms <hi rend="italics">Palaemo,
Telamo,</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Plato</hi> (the last being adopted by Cicero),
because they could not find any Latin nouns ending
in <hi rend="italics">-on.</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="61"/>  They were reluctant even to permit
masculine Greek nouns to end in <hi rend="italics">-as</hi> in the nominative case, and consequently in Caelius we find <hi rend="italics">Pelia
cincinnatus</hi> and in Messala <hi rend="italics">bene fecit Euthia,</hi> and in
Cicero <hi rend="italics">Hermagora.</hi><note>This form does not actually occur in Cicero, MSS.
evidently wrongly giving <hi rend="italics">Hermagaras.</hi></note> So we need not be surprised
that the majority of early writers said <hi rend="italics">Aenea</hi> and
<hi rend="italics">Anchisa.</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="62"/>  For, it was urged, if such words are spelt
like <hi rend="italics">Maecenas, Sufenas</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Asprenas,</hi> the genitive
should terminate in <hi rend="italics">-is</hi> not in <hi rend="italics">-e.</hi> On the same
principle they placed an acute accent on the middle
syllable of <hi rend="italics">Olympus</hi> and <hi rend="italics">tyrannus,</hi> because Latin does
not allow an acute accent on the first syllable if it is
short and is followed by two long syllables. <milestone unit="section" n="63"/>  So too
we get the Latinised genitives <hi rend="italics">Ulixi</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Achilli</hi> together with many other analogous forms. More recent
scholars have instituted the practice of giving Greek
nouns their Greek declension, although this is not
always possible. Personally I prefer to follow the
Latin method, so far as grace of diction will permit.
For I should not like to say <hi rend="italics">Calypsonem</hi> on the analogy
of <hi rend="italics">Iunonem,</hi> although Gaius Caesar in deference to
antiquity does adopt this way of declining it. Current
practice has however prevailed over his authority. <milestone unit="section" n="64"/>  In
other words which can be declined in either way
without impropriety, those who prefer it can employ
the Greek form: they will not be speaking Latin,
but will not on the other hand deserve censure.</p>

<p>Simple words are what they are in the nominative, that is, their essential nature. <milestone unit="section" n="65"/>  Compound

<pb id="p.109"/>

words are formed by the prefix of a preposition as
in <hi rend="italics">innocens,</hi> though care must be taken that two
conflicting prepositions are not prefixed as in
<hi rend="italics">imperterritus:</hi><note>Quintilian regards the negative <hi rend="italics">in</hi> as a preposition. His
objection to <hi rend="italics">imperterritus</hi> (which is used by Vergil) seems
to lie in the fact that while <hi rend="italics">interritus</hi> is a natural way of
expressing <quote>unterrified,</quote> it is unreasonable to negative <hi rend="italics">perterritus,</hi> which means <quote>thoroughly terrified.</quote> The presence
of the intensifying <hi rend="italics">per</hi> conflicts with the force of the
negative <hi rend="italics">in.</hi></note> if this be avoided they may in certain
cases have a double prefix as in <hi rend="italics">incompositus</hi> or
<hi rend="italics">reconditus</hi> or the Ciceronian <hi rend="italics">subabsurdtim.</hi> They may
also be formed by what I might term the combination of two independent units, as in <hi rend="italics">maleficus.</hi>
 <milestone unit="section" n="66"/>  For I will not admit that the combination of three
is possible at any rate in Latin, although Cicero
asserts that <hi rend="italics">capsis</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Orat.</hi> xlv. 154.</note> is compounded of <hi rend="italics">cape si vis,</hi> and
there are to be found scholars who contend that
<hi rend="italics">Lupercalia</hi> likewise is a compound of three parts of
speech, namely <hi rend="italics">luere per caprum.</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="67"/>  As for <hi rend="italics">Solitaurilia</hi>
it is by now universally believed to stand for
<hi rend="italics">Suovelaurilia,</hi> a derivation which corresponds to the
actual sacrifice, which has its counterpart in Homer<note>As in <hi rend="italics">Od.</hi> xi. 130. The word means sacrifices of a pig,
sheep and bull.</note>
as well. But these compounds are formed not so
much from three words as from the fragments of
three. On the other hand Pacuvius seems to have
formed compounds of a preposition and two vocables
(<hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> nouns) as in

<quote rend="blockquote"><l>Nerei repandirostrum incurvticervicum pecs:</l></quote>

<quote rend="blockquote"><l>The flock</l>
<l>Of Nereus snout-uplifted, neck-inarched</l></quote>

the effect is unpleasing. <milestone unit="section" n="68"/>  Compounds are however
formed from two complete Latin words, as for instance <hi rend="italics">supefui</hi> and <hi rend="italics">subterfui;</hi> though in this case
there is some question as to whether the words from
which they are formed are complete.<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> if both elements are complete in themselves is the
word a true compound?</note> They may
also be formed of one complete and one incomplete

<pb id="p.111"/>

word, as in the case of <hi rend="italics">malevolus,</hi> or of one incomplete and one complete, such as <hi rend="italics">noctivagus,</hi> or of
two incomplete words as in <hi rend="italics">pedisecus</hi> (footman), or
from one Latin and one foreign word as in <hi rend="italics">biclinium</hi>
(a dining-couch for two), or in the reverse order
as in <hi rend="italics">epitogium</hi> (an upper garment) or <hi rend="italics">Anticato,</hi> and
sometimes even from two foreign words as in
<hi rend="italics">epiraedium</hi> (a thong attaching the horse to the raeda).
For in this last case the preposition is Greek, while
<hi rend="italics">raeda</hi> is Gallic, while the compound is employed
neither by Greek nor Gaul, but has been appropriated by Rome from the two foreign tongues. <milestone unit="section" n="69"/>  In
the case of prepositions they are frequently changed
by the act of compounding: as a result we get
<hi rend="italics">abstulit, aufugit, amisit,</hi> though the preposition is <hi rend="italics">ab,</hi>
and <hi rend="italics">coil,</hi> though the preposition is <hi rend="italics">con.</hi> The same is
true of <hi rend="italics">ignauus</hi> and <hi rend="italics">erepublica.</hi><note>Sometimes written as one word.</note> But compounds are
better suited to Greek than to Latin, <milestone unit="section" n="70"/>  though I do
not think that this is due to the nature of our
language: the reason rather is that we have a
preference for foreign goods, and therefore receive
<foreign lang="greek">kurtau/xhn</foreign> with applause, whereas we can scarce
defend <hi rend="italics">incurvicervicus</hi> from derisive laughter.</p>

<p>Words are <hi rend="italics">proper</hi> when they bear their original
meaning; <milestone unit="section" n="71"/>  <hi rend="italics">metaphorical,</hi> when they are used in a
sense different from their natural meaning. <hi rend="italics">Current</hi>
words are safest to use: there is a spice of danger in
coining <hi rend="italics">new.</hi> For if they are adopted, our style
wins but small glory from them; while if they are
rejected, they become a subject for jest. <milestone unit="section" n="72"/>  Still we
must make the venture; for as Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">de Nat. deorum,</hi> I. xxxiv. 95.</note> says, use
softens even these words which at first seemed harsh.
On the other hand the <hi rend="italics">power of onomatopoeia</hi> is denied
us. Who would tolerate an attempt to imitate

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>There are special rules which must be observed both by speakers and writers. Language is
based on reason, antiquity, authority and usage.
Reason finds its chief support in analogy and sometimes in etymology. As for antiquity, it is commended to us by the possession of a certain majesty, I
might almost say sanctity. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>  Authority as a rule we
derive from orators and historians. For poets, owing
to the necessities of metre, are allowed a certain
licence except in cases where they deliberately
choose one of two expressions, when both are metrically possible, as for instance in <hi rend="italics">imo de stirpe recisum</hi>
and <hi rend="italics">aeriae quo congessere palumbes</hi> or <hi rend="italics">silice in nuda</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> xii. 208: <quote>cutaway from the lowest root.</quote> <hi rend="italics">Ecl.</hi> iii.
69: <quote>where airy doves have made their nest.</quote> <hi rend="italics">Ecl.</hi> i. 15:
<quote>on the naked rock.</quote> <hi rend="italics">Stirps, palumbes</hi> and <hi rend="italics">silex</hi> are usually
masculine.</note> and the like. The judgment of a supreme orator
is placed on the same level as reason, and even error
brings no disgrace, if it result from treading in the
footsteps of such distinguished guides. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>  Usage
however is the surest pilot in speaking, and we
should treat language as currency minted with
the public stamp. But in all these cases we have
need of a critical judgment, especially as regards
<hi rend="italics">analogy</hi> (a Greek term for which a Latin equivalent
has been found in <hi rend="italics">proportion).</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>  The essence of <hi rend="italics">analogy</hi>
is the testing of all subjects of doubt by the application of some standard of comparison about which
there is no question, the proof that is to say of the
uncertain by reference to the certain. This can be
done in two different ways: by comparing similar
words, paying special attention to their final syllables

<pb id="p.115"/>

(hence monosyllables are asserted to lie outside the
domain of <hi rend="italics">analogy</hi><note>sc. because two monosyllables, unless identical, cannot
have the same final syllable.</note>) and by the study of diminutives. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Comparison of nouns will reveal either their gender
or their declension: in the first case, supposing the
question is raised as to whether <hi rend="italics">junis</hi> be masculine
or feminine, <hi rend="italics">panis</hi> will supply a standard of comparison: in the second case, supposing we are in doubt
as to whether we should say <hi rend="italics">hac domu</hi> or <hi rend="italics">hac domo,
domuum</hi> or <hi rend="italics">domorum,</hi> the standard of comparison will
be found in words such as <hi rend="italics">anus</hi> or <hi rend="italics">manus.</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>  Diminutives
merely reveal the gender: for instance, to return to
a word previously used as an illustration, <hi rend="italics">funiculus</hi>
proves that<hi rend="italics">funis</hi> is masculine. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>  The same standard
may be applied in the case of verbs. For instance
if it should be asserted that the middle syllable of
<hi rend="italics">fervere</hi> is short, we can prove this to be an error,
because all verbs which in the indicative terminate
in <hi rend="italics">-eo,</hi> make the middle syllable of the infinitive
long, if that syllable contain an <hi rend="italics">e:</hi> take as examples
such verbs as <hi rend="italics">prandeo, pendeo, spondeo</hi> with infinitives
<hi rend="italics">prand&emacr;re, pend&emacr;re, spond&emacr;re.</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>  Those verbs, however,
which terminate in <hi rend="italics">-o</hi> alone, if they form the infinitive in <hi rend="italics">e,</hi> have the <hi rend="italics">e</hi> short; compare <hi rend="italics">lego, dico, curro,</hi>
with the infinitives, <hi rend="italics">leg&#x0115;re, dic&#x0115;re, curr&#x0115;re.</hi> I admit
that in Lucilius we find&mdash;

<quote>
<l>fervit aqua et fervet: firvit nunc ferverit ad annum.<note>In Book IX.</note></l></quote>

<quote rend="blockquote">The water boils and boil it will; it boils and for a
year will boil.</quote>
</p>

<p>But with all due respect to so learned a man, if he
regards <hi rend="italics">fervit</hi> as on the same footing as <hi rend="italics">currit</hi> and
<hi rend="italics">legit,</hi> we shall say <hi rend="italics">fervo</hi> as we say <hi rend="italics">lego</hi> and <hi rend="italics">curro:</hi>
but such a form has never yet come to my ears. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But this is not a true comparison: for <hi rend="italics">fervit</hi>

<pb id="p.117"/>

resembles <hi rend="italics">servit,</hi> and on this analogy we should say
<hi rend="italics">fervire</hi> like <hi rend="italics">servire.</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>  It is also possible in certain
cases to discover the present indicative of a verb from
the study of its other tenses. I remember, for instance, refuting certain scholars who criticised me for
using the word <hi rend="italics">pepigi:</hi> for, although they admitted
that it had been used by some of the best authors,
they asserted that it was an irrational form because
the present indicative <hi rend="italics">paciscor,</hi> being passive in
form, made <hi rend="italics">pactus sum</hi> as its perfect. <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>  I in addition
to quoting the authority of orators and historians
maintained that I was also supported by analogy.
For when I found <hi rend="italics">ni ita pacunt</hi> in the Twelve Tables,
I noted that <hi rend="italics">cadunt</hi> provided a parallel: it was clear
therefore that the present indicative, though now
obsolete, was <hi rend="italics">paco</hi> on the analogy of <hi rend="italics">cado,</hi> and it
was further obvious that we say <hi rend="italics">pepigi</hi> for just the
same reason that we say <hi rend="italics">cecidi.</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>  But we must
remember that <hi rend="italics">analogy</hi> cannot be universally applied,
as it is often inconsistent with itself. It is true
indeed that scholars have attempted to justify certain
apparent anomalies: for example, when it is noted
to what an extent <hi rend="italics">lepus</hi> and <hi rend="italics">lupus,</hi> which resemble
each other closely in the nominative, differ in the
plural and in the other cases, they reply that they
are not true parallels, since <hi rend="italics">lepus</hi> is <hi rend="italics">epicene,</hi> while
<hi rend="italics">lupus</hi> is masculine, although Varro in the book in
which he narrates the origins of Rome, writes <hi rend="italics">lupus
femina,</hi> following the precedent of Ennius and
Fabius Pictor. <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>  The same scholars, however, when
asked why <hi rend="italics">aper</hi> became <hi rend="italics">apri</hi> in the genitive, but <hi rend="italics">pater
patris,</hi> asserted that <hi rend="italics">aper</hi> was an absolute, <hi rend="italics">pater</hi>
a relative noun. Further since both words derive
from the Greek, they took refuge in the fact

<pb id="p.119"/>

that <foreign lang="greek">patro/s</foreign> provides a parallel to <hi rend="italics">patris</hi> and <foreign lang="greek">ka/prou</foreign>
to <hi rend="italics">apri.</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>  But how will they evade the difficulty
that feminine nouns whose nominative singular
ends in <hi rend="italics">-us</hi> never make the genitive end in <hi rend="italics">-ris,</hi>
and yet the genitive of <hi rend="italics">Venus</hi> is <hi rend="italics">Veneris:</hi> again
nouns ending in <hi rend="italics">-es</hi> have various genitive terminations, but never end in <hi rend="italics">-ris,</hi> but yet we have
no choice but to make the genitive of <hi rend="italics">Ceres Cereris?</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Again what of those words which, although identical in the form of the nominative or present indicative, develop the utmost variety in their inflections.
Thus from <hi rend="italics">Alba</hi> we get both <hi rend="italics">Albanus and Albensis,</hi>
from <hi rend="italics">volo</hi> both <hi rend="italics">volui</hi> and <hi rend="italics">volavi.</hi> Analogy itself
admits that verbs whose present indicative ends in
-o have a great variety of perfect formations, as
for instance <hi rend="italics">cado cecidi, spondeo spopondi, pingo pinxi,
lego legi, pono posui, fiango fregi, laudo laudavi.</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="16"/>  For
<hi rend="italics">analogy</hi> was not sent down from heaven at the
creation of mankind to frame the rules of language,
but was discovered after they began to speak and to
note the terminations of words used in speech. It
is therefore based not on reason but on example,
nor is it a law of language, but rather a practice
which is observed, being in fact the offspring of
usage. <milestone unit="section" n="17"/>  Some scholars, however, are so perverse and
obstinate in their passion for analogy, that they say
<hi rend="italics">audaciter</hi> in preference to <hi rend="italics">audacter,</hi> the form preferred
by all orators, and <hi rend="italics">emicavit</hi> for <hi rend="italics">emicuit,</hi> and <hi rend="italics">conire</hi>
for <hi rend="italics">coire.</hi> We may permit them to say <hi rend="italics">audivisse,
scivisse, tribunale</hi> and <hi rend="italics">faciliter,</hi> nor will we deprive
them of <hi rend="italics">frugalis</hi> as an alternative for <hi rend="italics">frugi:</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="18"/>  for
from what else can <hi rend="italics">frugalitas</hi> be formed? They may
also be allowed to point out that phrases such as
<hi rend="italics">centum milia nummum</hi> and <hi rend="italics">fidem deum</hi><note><hi rend="italics">i.e. nummum</hi> and <hi rend="italics">deum</hi> should, strictly speaking, be
accus. singular.</note> involve a

<pb id="p.121"/>

double solecism, since they change both case and
number. Of course we were in blank ignorance
of the fact and were not simply conforming to usage
and the demands of elegance, as in the numerous
cases, with which Cicero deals magnificently, as
always, in his Orator.<note>xlvi. 155.</note> <milestone unit="section" n="19"/>  Augustus again in his letters
to Gaius Caesar corrects him for preferring <hi rend="italics">calidus</hi>
to <hi rend="italics">caldus,</hi> not on the ground that the former is not
Latin, but because it is unpleasing and as he himself
puts it in Greek <foreign lang="greek">peri/ergon</foreign> (affected). <milestone unit="section" n="20"/>  Some hold
that this is just a question of <foreign lang="greek">o)rqoe/peia</foreign> or correctness
of speech, a subject to which I am far from being
indifferent. For what can be more necessary than
that we should speak correctly? Nay, I even think
that, as far as possible, we should cling to correct
forms and resist all tendencies to change. But to
attempt to retain forms long obsolete and extinct
is sheer impertinence and ostentatious pedantry. <milestone unit="section" n="21"/> I would suggest that the ripe scholar, who says <quote><hi rend="italics">ave</hi></quote>
without the aspirate and with a long e (for it comes
from <hi rend="italics">av&emacr;re</hi> and uses <hi rend="italics">calefacere</hi> and <hi rend="italics">conservavisse</hi> in
preference to the usual forms,<note>For <hi rend="italics">hav&#x0115;,</hi> calfacere, conservasse.</note> should also add <hi rend="italics">face,
dice</hi> and the like to his vocabulary. <milestone unit="section" n="22"/>  His way is the
right way. Who doubts it? But there is an easier
and more frequented path close by. There is,
however, nothing which annoys me more than their
habit not merely of inferring the nominative from
the oblique cases, but of actually altering it. For
instance in <hi rend="italics">ebur</hi> and <hi rend="italics">robur,</hi> the forms regularly used
both in writing and speech by the best authors,
these gentlemen change their second syllable to o,
because their genitives are <hi rend="italics">roboris</hi> and <hi rend="italics">eboris,</hi> and because <hi rend="italics">sulpur</hi> and <hi rend="italics">guttur</hi> keep the u in the genitive. So
too <hi rend="italics">femur</hi> and <hi rend="italics">iecur</hi> give rise to similar controversy.

<pb id="p.123"/>

 <milestone unit="section" n="23"/>  Their proceedings are just as arbitrary as if they
were to substitute an <hi rend="italics">o</hi> in the genitives of <hi rend="italics">sulpur</hi>
and <hi rend="italics">guttur</hi> on the analogy of <hi rend="italics">eboris</hi> and <hi rend="italics">roboris.</hi>
Thus Antonius Gnipho while admitting <hi rend="italics">robur, ebur</hi>
and even <hi rend="italics">marmur</hi> to be correct, would have their
plurals to be <hi rend="italics">ebura, robura</hi> and <hi rend="italics">marnura.</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="24"/>  If they
would only pay attention to the affinities existing
between letters, they would realize that <hi rend="italics">robur</hi> makes
its genitive <hi rend="italics">roboris</hi> in precisely the same way that
<hi rend="italics">limes, miles, iudex</hi> and <hi rend="italics">uindex</hi> make their genitives
<hi rend="italics">militis, limitis, iudicis and uindicis,</hi> not to mention other
words to which I have already referred. <milestone unit="section" n="25"/>  Do not nouns
which are similar in the nominative show, as I have
already observed, quite different terminations in the
oblique eases? Compare <hi rend="italics">uirgo</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Iuno, lusus</hi> and
<hi rend="italics">fusus, caspis</hi> and <hi rend="italics">puppis</hi> and a thousand others.
Again some nouns are not used in the plural, while
others are not used in the singular, some are indeclinable, while others, like <hi rend="italics">Jupiter,</hi> in the oblique
cases entirely abandon the form of the nominative.
 <milestone unit="section" n="26"/>  The same is true of verbs: for instance <hi rend="italics">fero</hi> disappears in the perfect and subsequent tenses. Nor
does it matter greatly whether such forms are nonexistent or too harsh to use. For what is the genitive singular of <hi rend="italics">progenies</hi> or the genitive plural of <hi rend="italics">spes?</hi>
Or how will <hi rend="italics">quire</hi> and <hi rend="italics">ruere</hi> form a perfect passive or
passive participles. <milestone unit="section" n="27"/>  Why should I mention other
words when it is even doubtful whether the genitive
of <hi rend="italics">senatus</hi> is <hi rend="italics">senati</hi> or <hi rend="italics">senatus?</hi> In view of what I
have said, it seems to me that the remark, that it
is one thing to speak Latin and another to speak
grammar, was far from unhappy. So much for
<hi rend="italics">analogy,</hi> of which I have said more than enough.
 <milestone unit="section" n="28"/>  <hi rend="italics">Etymology</hi> inquires into the origin of words, and

<pb id="p.125"/>

was called <hi rend="italics">notation</hi> by Cicero,<note><hi rend="italics">Top.</hi> viii. 35.</note> on the ground that
the term used by Aristotle<note><foreign lang="greek">peri\ e(rm.</foreign> 2.</note> is <foreign lang="greek">su/mbolon,</foreign> which may
be translated by <hi rend="italics">nota.</hi> A literal rendering of <foreign lang="greek">e)tumologi/a</foreign>
would be <hi rend="italics">ueriloquium,</hi> a form which even Cicero, its
inventor, shrinks from using. Some again, with an
eye to the meaning of the word, call it <hi rend="italics">origination.</hi>
Etymology is sometimes of the utmost use, whenever the word under discussion needs interpretation.
 <milestone unit="section" n="29"/>  For instance Marcus Caelius wishes to prove that he
is <hi rend="italics">homo frugi,</hi> not because he is abstemious (for he
could not even pretend to be that), but because he
is useful to many, that is <hi rend="italics">fructuosus,</hi> from which
<hi rend="italics">frugalitas</hi> is derived. Consequently we find room
for etymology when we are concerned with definitions. <milestone unit="section" n="30"/>  Sometimes again this science attempts to
distinguish between correct forms and <hi rend="italics">barbarisms,</hi> as
for instance when we are discussing whether we
should call Sicily <hi rend="italics">Triquetra</hi> or <hi rend="italics">Triquedra,</hi> or say
<hi rend="italics">meridies</hi> or <hi rend="italics">medidies,</hi> not to mention other words
which depend on current usage. <milestone unit="section" n="31"/>  Such a science
demands profound erudition, whether we are dealing with the large number of words which are
derived from the Greek, more especially those
inflected according to the practice of the Aeolic
dialect, the form of Greek which most nearly
resembles Latin; or are using ancient historians as
a basis for inquiry into the origin of names of men,
places, nations and cities. For instance what is the
origin of names such as <hi rend="italics">Brutus, Publicola,</hi> or <hi rend="italics">Pythicus?</hi>
Why do we speak of <hi rend="italics">Latium, Italia</hi> or <hi rend="italics">Beneventum?</hi>
What is the reason for employing such names as
<hi rend="italics">Capitolium, collis Quirinalis</hi> or <hi rend="italics">Argietum?</hi><note>For derivations see Index of Names at end.</note></p>
<p> <milestone unit="section" n="32"/>  I now turn to minor points concerning which
enthusiasts for etymology give themselves an

<pb id="p.127"/>

infinity of trouble, restoring to their true form words
which have become slightly altered: the methods
which they employ are varied and manifold: they
shorten them or lengthen them, add, remove, or
interchange letters and syllables as the case may be.
As a result perverseness of judgment leads to the
most hideous absurdities. I am ready to admit that
<hi rend="italics">consul</hi> may be derived from <hi rend="italics">consulere</hi> in the sense of
consulting or judging; for the ancients used <hi rend="italics">consulere</hi> in the latter sense, and it still survives in the
phrase <hi rend="italics">rogat boni consulas,</hi> that is <hi rend="italics">bonum iudices,</hi> <quote>judge
fit.</quote> <milestone unit="section" n="33"/>  Again <hi rend="italics">senatus</hi> may well be derived from old
age (for the senators are called <quote>the fathers</quote>):
I concur in the derivations assigned to <hi rend="italics">rex rector</hi>
to say nothing of many other words where there
can be no doubt, and do not refuse to accept those
suggested for <hi rend="italics">tegula, regula</hi> and the like: let <hi rend="italics">classis</hi>
be from <hi rend="italics">calare</hi> (call out, summon), <hi rend="italics">lepus</hi> be a contraction of <hi rend="italics">levipes</hi> and <hi rend="italics">vulpes of volipes.</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="34"/>  But are we
also to admit the derivation of certain words from
their opposites, and accept <hi rend="italics">lucus a non lucendo,</hi> since
a grove is dark with shade, <hi rend="italics">ludus</hi> in the sense of
school as being so called because it is quite the
reverse of <quote>play</quote> and <hi rend="italics">Dis, Ditis</hi> from <hi rend="italics">diues,</hi> because
Pluto is far from being rich? Are we to assent to
the view that <hi rend="italics">homo</hi> is derived from <hi rend="italics">humus,</hi> because
man sprang from the earth, as though all other
living things had not the same origin or as if
primitive man gave the earth a name before giving
one to himself? Or again can <hi rend="italics">verbum</hi> be derived
from <hi rend="italics">aer verheratus,</hi> <quote>beaten air</quote>? <milestone unit="section" n="35"/>  Let us go a
little further and we shall find that <hi rend="italics">stella</hi> is believed
to be <hi rend="italics">still luminis</hi> <quote>a drop of light,</quote> a derivation
whose author is so famous in literature that it would

<pb id="p.129"/>

be unkind to mention his name in connexion with a
point where he comes in for censure. <milestone unit="section" n="36"/>  But those
who collected such derivations in book form, put
their names on the title page; and Gavius thought
himself a perfect genius when he identified <hi rend="italics">caelibes,</hi>
<quote>bachelors,</quote> with <hi rend="italics">caelites,</hi> <quote>gods,</quote> on the ground
that they are free from a heavy load of care, and
supported this opinion by a Greek analogy: for he
asserted that <foreign lang="greek">h)i+/qeoi</foreign> <quote>young men,</quote> had a precisely
similar origin. Modestus is not his inferior in
inventive power: for he asserts that <hi rend="italics">caelibes,</hi> that is
to say unmarried men, are so called because Saturn
cut off the genital organs of <hi rend="italics">Caelus.</hi> Aelius asserts
that <hi rend="italics">pituita,</hi> <quote>phlegm,</quote> is so called <hi rend="italics">quia petat uitam,</hi>
because it attacks life. <milestone unit="section" n="37"/>  But we may pardon anyone
after the example set by Varro.<note><hi rend="italics">de Lingua Lat.</hi> v. 34 and 76.</note> For he tried to
persuade Cicero, to whom he dedicated his work,
that a field was called <hi rend="italics">eager</hi> because something is
done in it (<hi rend="italics">agitur</hi>), and jackdaws <hi rend="italics">graculos</hi> because
they fly in flocks <hi rend="italics">(gregatim</hi>), in spite of the obvious
fact that the first word is derived from the Greek,
the latter from the cry of the bird in question. <milestone unit="section" n="38"/> But Varro had such a passion for derivations that he
derived the name <hi rend="italics">merula</hi> <quote>a blackbird</quote> from <hi rend="italics">mera
uolans</hi> on the ground that it flies alone! Some
scholars do not hesitate to have recourse to <hi rend="italics">etymology</hi>
for the origin of every word, deriving names such as
<hi rend="italics">Rufus</hi> or <hi rend="italics">Longus</hi> from the appearance of their
possessor, verbs such as <hi rend="italics">strepere</hi> or <hi rend="italics">murmurare</hi> from
the sounds which they represent, and even extending this practice to certain derivatives, making
<hi rend="italics">uelox</hi> for instance find its origin in <hi rend="italics">uelocitas,</hi><note>The above makes Quintilian derive <hi rend="italics">velox</hi> from <hi rend="italics">velocitas,</hi>
as Varro (<hi rend="italics">L.L.</hi> viii. 15) derives <hi rend="italics">prudens</hi> from <hi rend="italics">prudentia.</hi>
Those who regard this as incredible must with Colson
transpose <hi rend="italics">ut. . . velox</hi> to follow <hi rend="italics">Rufos</hi> making <hi rend="italics">Velox</hi> a cognomen, or with Meister read <hi rend="italics">velo</hi> for <hi rend="italics">velocitate,</hi> or <hi rend="italics">velo</hi> <hi rend="italics">citato</hi>
(Colson).</note> as well
as to compounds and the like: now although such
words doubtless have an origin, no special science is

<pb id="p.131"/>

required to detect it, since it is only doubtful cases
that demand the intervention of the etymologist.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="39"/>  Archaic words not only enjoy the patronage of
distinguished authors, but also give style a certain
majesty and charm. For they have the authority of
age behind them, and for the very reason that they
have fallen into desuetude, produce an attractive
effect not unlike that of novelty. <milestone unit="section" n="40"/>  But such words
must be used sparingly and must not thrust themselves upon our notice, since there is nothing more
tiresome than affectation, nor above all must they be
drawn from remote and forgotten ages: I refer to
words such as <hi rend="italics">topper,</hi> <quote>quite,</quote> <hi rend="italics">antegerio,</hi> <quote>exceedingly,</quote> <hi rend="italics">exanclare,</hi> <quote>to exhaust,</quote> <hi rend="italics">prosapia,</hi> <quote>a race</quote>
and the language of the Salian Hymns now scarcely
understood by its own priests. <milestone unit="section" n="41"/>  Religion, it is true,
forbids us to alter the words of these hymns and
we must treat them as sacred things. But what a
faulty thing is speech, whose prime virtue is clearness, if it requires an interpreter to make its meaning
plain! Consequently in the case of old words the
best will be those that are newest, just as in the
case of new words the best will be the oldest.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="42"/>  The same arguments apply to authority. For
although the use of words transmitted to us by the
best authors may seem to preclude the possibility
of error, it is important to notice not merely what
they said, but what words they succeeded in sanctioning. For no one to-day would introduce words such
as <hi rend="italics">tuburchinabunidus,</hi> <quote>voracious,</quote> or <hi rend="italics">lurchinabundus,</hi>
<quote>guzzling,</quote> although they have the authority of
Cato; nor make <hi rend="italics">lodices,</hi> <quote>blankets,</quote> masculine,
though Pollio preferred that gender; nor say <hi rend="italics">gladiola,</hi> <quote>small swords,</quote> though Messala used this plural,

<pb id="p.133"/>

nor <hi rend="italics">parricidatus</hi> for parricide, a form which can
scarcely be tolerated even in Caelius, nor will Calvus
persuade me to speak of <hi rend="italics">collos,</hi> <quote>necks.</quote> Indeed,
were these authors alive to-day, they would never
use such words.</p>

<p>Usage remains to be discussed. <milestone unit="section" n="43"/>  For it would be
almost laughable to prefer the language of the
past to that of the present day, and what is ancient
speech but ancient usage of speaking? But even
here the critical faculty is necessary, and we must
make up our minds what we mean by usage. <milestone unit="section" n="44"/>  If it
be defined merely as the practice of the majority,
we shall have a very dangerous rule affecting not
merely style but life as well, a far more serious
matter. For where is so much good to be found that
what is right should please the majority? The
practices of depilation, of dressing the hair in
tiers, or of drinking to excess at the baths, although
they may have thrust their way into society, cannot claim the support of usage, since there is something to blame in all of them (although we have
usage on our side when we bathe or have our
hair cut or take our meals together). So too in
speech we must not accept as a rule of language
words and phrases that have become a vicious habit
with a number of persons. <milestone unit="section" n="45"/>  To say nothing of the
language of the uneducated, we are all of us well
aware that whole theatres and the entire crowd of
spectators will often commit <hi rend="italics">barbarisms</hi> in the cries
which they utter as one man. I will therefore define
usage in speech as the agreed practice of educated
men, just as where our way of life is concerned I
should define it as the agreed practice of all good
men.

</p>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Having stated the rules which we must
follow in speaking, I will now proceed to lay down
the rules which must be observed when we write.
Such rules are called <hi rend="italics">orthography</hi> by the Greeks; let
us style it the science of writing correctly. This
science does not consist merely in the knowledge of
the letters composing each syllable (such a study
is beneath the dignity of a teacher of grammar),
but, in my opinion, develops all its subtlety in connexion with doubtful points. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>  For instance, while it
is absurd to place a circumflex over all long syllables
since the quantity of most syllables is obvious from
the very nature of the word which is written, it is
all the same occasionally necessary, since the same
letter involves a different meaning according as it is
long or short. For example we determine whether
<hi rend="italics">mains</hi> is to mean an <quote>apple tree</quote> or a <quote>bad man</quote> by
the use of the circumflex; <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>  <hi rend="italics">palus</hi> means a <quote>stake,</quote> if
the first syllable is long, a <quote>marsh,</quote> if it be short;
again when the same letter is short in the nominative
and long in the ablative, we generally require the
circumflex to make it clear which quantity to understand. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>  Similarly it has been held that we should
observe distinctions such as the following: if the
preposition <hi rend="italics">ex</hi> is compounded with <hi rend="italics">specto,</hi> there will
be an <hi rend="italics">s</hi> in the second syllable, while there will be no
<hi rend="italics">s</hi> if it is compounded with <hi rend="italics">pecto.</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>  Again the following distinction has frequently been observed: <hi rend="italics">ad</hi> is
spelt with a <hi rend="italics">d</hi> when it is a preposition, but with a <hi rend="italics">t</hi>
when it is a conjunction, while <hi rend="italics">cum</hi> is spelt <hi rend="italics">quum</hi>
when it denotes time, but <hi rend="italics">cum</hi> when it denotes
accompaniment. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>  Still more pedantic are the practices
of making the fourth letter of <hi rend="italics">quidquid</hi> a <hi rend="italics">c</hi> to avoid
the appearance of repeating a question, and of writing

<pb id="p.137"/>

<hi rend="italics">quotidie</hi> instead of <hi rend="italics">colidie</hi> to show that it stands for
<hi rend="italics">quot diebus.</hi> But such practices have disappeared
into the limbo of absurdities.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>  It is often debated whether in our spelling of
prepositions we should be guided by their sound
when compounded, or separate. For instance when
I say <hi rend="italics">optinuit,</hi> logic demands that the second
letter should be a <hi rend="italics">b,</hi> while to the ear the sound is
rather that of <hi rend="italics">p:</hi> or again take the case of <hi rend="italics">immunis:</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="8"/> the letter <hi rend="italics">n,</hi> which is required by strict adherence to
fact, is forced by the sound of the <hi rend="italics">m.</hi> which follows
to change into another <hi rend="italics">m.</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>  We must also note when
analysing compound words, whether the middle
consonant adheres to the preceding syllable or to
that which follows. For example since the latter
part of <hi rend="italics">haruspex</hi> is from <hi rend="italics">spectare,</hi> the <hi rend="italics">s</hi> must be
assigned to the third syllable. In <hi rend="italics">abstemius</hi> on the
other hand it will go with the first syllable since the
word is derived from <hi rend="italics">abstinentia temeti,</hi> <quote>abstention
from wine.</quote> <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>  As for <hi rend="italics">k</hi> my view is that it should not
be used at all except in such words as may be indicated by the letter standing alone as an abbreviation.<note><hi rend="italics">K</hi> may stand for <hi rend="italics">Kalendae, Kaeso, Karthago, Kalumnia,
Kaput.</hi></note>
I mention the fact because some hold that <hi rend="italics">k</hi> should
be used whenever the next letter is an a, despite
the existence of the letter c which maintains its
force in conjunction with all the vowels.</p>

<p><hi rend="italics">Orthography,</hi> however, <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>  is also the servant of usage
and therefore undergoes frequent change. I make
no mention of the earliest times when our alphabet
contained fewer letters<note>The original alphabet consisted of twenty-one letters,
and was increased to twenty-three by the addition of <hi rend="italics">y</hi>
and <hi rend="italics">z.</hi></note> and their shapes differed
from those which we now use, while their values also
were different. For instance in Greek the letter o
was sometimes long and short, as it is with us, and
again was sometimes used to express the syllable

<pb id="p.139"/>

which is identical with its name.<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> the interjection O!</note> <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>  And in Latin
ancient writers ended a number of words with <hi rend="italics">d,</hi> as
may be seen on the column adorned with the beaks
of ships, which was set up in the forum in honour
of Duilius.<note>The ablative originally terminated in <hi rend="italics">d; e.g. pugnandod,
marid, navaled, pracdad,</hi> etc., on the base of the column of
Duilius.</note> Sometimes again they gave words a
final g, as we may still see in the shrine of the Sun,
close to the temple of Quirinus, where we find the
word <hi rend="italics">uesperug,</hi> which we write <hi rend="italics">uesperugo</hi> (evening
star). <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>  I have already spoken of the interchange
of letters<note>I. iv. 12&ndash;17.</note> and need not repeat my remarks here:
perhaps their pronunciation corresponded with their
spelling. <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>  For a long time the doubling of semivowels was avoided,<note><hi rend="italics">e.g. iusi</hi> was written for <hi rend="italics">iussi.</hi></note> while down to the time of
Accius and beyond, long syllables were indicated by
repetition of the vowel. <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>  The practice of joining <hi rend="italics">e</hi>
and <hi rend="italics">i</hi> as in the Greek diphthong <foreign lang="greek">ei</foreign> lasted longer: it
served to distinguish cases and numbers, for which
we may compare the instructions of Lucilius:

<quote rend="blockquote">
<l>The boys are come: why then, their names must
end</l>
<l>With <hi rend="italics">e</hi> and <hi rend="italics">i</hi> to make them more than one;
and later&mdash;</l></quote>

<quote rend="blockquote">
<l>If to a thief and liar (<hi rend="italics">mendaci furique</hi>) you would
give,</l>
<l>In <hi rend="italics">e</hi> and <hi rend="italics">i</hi> your thief must terminate.</l></quote>
</p>

<p>But this addition of <hi rend="italics">e</hi> is quite superfluous, since <hi rend="italics">t</hi>
can be long no less than short: <milestone unit="section" n="16"/>  it is also at times
inconvenient. For in those words which end in i
and have <hi rend="italics">e</hi> as their last letter but one, we shall on
this principle have to write e twice: I refer to words
such as <hi rend="italics">aurei</hi> or <hi rend="italics">argentei</hi> and the like. <milestone unit="section" n="17"/>  Now such a
practice will be an actual hindrance to those who are
learning to read. This difficulty occurs in Greek as

<pb id="p.141"/>

well in connexion with the addition of an <hi rend="italics">iota,</hi> which
is employed not merely in the termination of the
dative, but is sometimes found in the middle of
words as in <foreign lang="greek">lh/|sths,</foreign> for the reason that the analysis
applied by etymology shows the word to be a trisyllable<note>The noun being formed from <foreign lang="greek">lhi/zw. *l*h*i*s*t*h*i</foreign> in the text
is dative after <hi rend="italics">in.</hi> The trisyllable to which Q. refers is the
nominative.</note> and requires the addition of that letter.
The diphthong <hi rend="italics">ae</hi> now written with an <hi rend="italics">e,</hi> was pronounced in old days as <hi rend="italics">ai;</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="18"/>  some wrote <hi rend="italics">ai</hi> in all cases,
as in Greek, others confined its use to the dative and
genitive singular; whence it comes that Vergil,<note><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> ix. 26 and vii. 464.</note>
always a passionate lover of antiquity, inserted <hi rend="italics">pictai
uestis</hi> and <hi rend="italics">aquai</hi> in his poems. <milestone unit="section" n="19"/>  But in the plural they
used e and wrote <hi rend="italics">Syllae, Galbae.</hi> Lucilius has given
instructions on this point also; his instructions
occupy quite a number of verses, for which the
incredulous may consult his ninth book. <milestone unit="section" n="20"/>  Again in
Cicero's days and a little later, it was the almost
universal practice to write a double <hi rend="italics">s</hi>, whenever that
letter occurred between two long vowels or after a
long vowel, as for example in <hi rend="italics">caussae, cassus, diuissiones.</hi>
That he and Vergil both used this spelling is shown
by their own autograph manuscripts. <milestone unit="section" n="21"/>  And yet at
a slightly earlier date <hi rend="italics">iussi</hi> which we write with a
double <hi rend="italics">s</hi> was spelt with only one. Further <hi rend="italics">optimnus
maximus,</hi> which older writers spelt with a <hi rend="italics">u,</hi> appear for the first time with an i (such at any rate
is the tradition) in an inscription of Gaius Caesar.<note>Caligula, the first of the Caesars to adopt this title.</note>
 <milestone unit="section" n="22"/>  We now write <hi rend="italics">here,</hi> but I still find in manuscripts of
the old comic poets phrases such as <hi rend="italics">heri ad me uenit,</hi><note>Ter. <hi rend="italics">Phorm.</hi> 36.</note>
and the same spelling is found in letters of Augustus
written or corrected by his own hand. <milestone unit="section" n="23"/>  Again did
not Cato the censor spell <hi rend="italics">dicam</hi> and <hi rend="italics">faciam</hi> as <hi rend="italics">dicem</hi>

<pb id="p.143"/>

and <hi rend="italics">faciem</hi> and observe the same practice in words of
similar termination? This is clear from old manuscripts of his works and is recorded by Messala in
his treatise on the letter <hi rend="italics">s. Sibe</hi> and <hi rend="italics">quase</hi> are found
in many books, but I cannot say whether the
authors wished them to be spelt thus: <milestone unit="section" n="24"/>  I learn from
Pedianus that Livy, whose precedent he himself
adopted, used this spelling: to-day we make these
words end with an <hi rend="italics">i.</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="25"/>  What shall I say of <hi rend="italics">uorlices,
uorsus</hi> and the like, which Scipio Africanus is said
to have been the first to spell with an e? <milestone unit="section" n="26"/>  My own
teachers spelt <hi rend="italics">seruus</hi> and <hi rend="italics">ceruus</hi> with a <hi rend="italics">uo,</hi> in order
that the repetition of the vowel might not lead to
the coalescence and confusion of the two sounds:
to-day however we write these words with a double
<hi rend="italics">u</hi> on the principle which I have already stated:
neither spelling however exactly expresses the pronunciation. It was not without reason that Claudius
introduced the Aeolic <hi rend="italics">digamma</hi> to represent this
sound.<note>cp. I. iv. 8.</note> It is a distinct improvement that to-day we
spell <hi rend="italics">cui</hi> as I have written it: <milestone unit="section" n="27"/>  when I was a boy it
used to be spelt <hi rend="italics">quoi,</hi> giving it a very full sound,
merely to distinguish it from <hi rend="italics">qui.</hi></p>
<p> <milestone unit="section" n="28"/>  Again, what of words whose spelling is at variance
with their pronunciation? For instance <hi rend="italics">C</hi> is used as
an abbreviation for Gaius, and when inverted stands
for a woman, for as we know from the words of the
marriage service women used to be called <hi rend="italics">Gaiae,</hi>
just as men were called <hi rend="italics">Gaii.</hi><note>The bride used the <hi rend="italics">formula ubi tu Gaius, ibi ego Gaia.</hi></note> <hi rend="italics">Gnaeus</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="29"/>  too in the
abbreviation indicating the <hi rend="italics">praenomen</hi> is spelt in a
manner which does not agree with its pronunciation.
We also find <hi rend="italics">columnas</hi><note><hi rend="italics">columa</hi> is mentioned by the grammarian Pompeius as a
barbarism in the fifth century. <hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> dimin. <hi rend="italics">columella. Consul</hi> is abbreviated <hi rend="italics">cos.</hi></note> and <hi rend="italics">consul</hi> spelt without an <hi rend="italics">n,</hi>

<pb id="p.145"/>

while <hi rend="italics">Subura</hi> when indicated by three letters is spelt
<hi rend="italics">Suc.</hi><note>The original name was <hi rend="italics">Sucusa.</hi></note> I could quote many other examples of this,
but I fear that I have already said too much on so
trivial a theme.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="30"/>  On all such subjects the teacher must use his own
judgment; for in such matters it should be the
supreme authority. For my own part, I think that,
within the limits prescribed by usage, words should
be spelt as they are pronounced. <milestone unit="section" n="31"/>  For the use of
letters is to preserve the sound of words and to
deliver them to readers as a sacred trust: consequently they ought to represent the pronunciation
which we are to use. <milestone unit="section" n="32"/>  These are the more important
points in connexion with writing and speaking
correctly. I do not go so far as to deny to the
teacher of literature all part in the two remaining departments of speaking and writing with
elegance and significance, but I reserve these for a
more important portion of this work, as I have still
to deal with the duties of the teacher of rhetoric.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="33"/>  I am however haunted by the thought that some
readers will regard what I have said as trivial details
which are only likely to prove a hindrance to those
who are intent upon a greater task; and I myself
do not think that we should go so far as to lose our
sleep of nights or quibble like fools over such
minutiae; for such studies make mincemeat of the
mind. But it is only the superfluities of grammar
that do any harm. <milestone unit="section" n="34"/>  I ask you, is Cicero a less great
orator for having given this science his diligent
attention or for having, as his letters show, demanded
rigid correctness of speech from his son? Or was the
vigour of Gaius Caesar's eloquence impaired by the
publication of a treatise on Analogy? <milestone unit="section" n="35"/>  Or the polish

<pb id="p.147"/>

of Messala dimmed by the fact that he devoted
whole books to the discussion not merely of
single words, but of single letters? Such studies do
no harm to those who but pass through them: it is
only the pedantic stickler who suffers.</p>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Reading remains for consideration. In
this connexion there is much that can only be
taught in actual practice, as for instance when the
boy should take breath, at what point he should
introduce a pause into a line, where the sense ends
or begins, when the voice should be raised or
lowered, what modulation should be given to each
phrase, and when he should increase or slacken
speed, or speak with greater or less energy. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>  In
this portion of my work I will give but one golden
rule: to do all these things, he must understand
what he reads. But above all his reading must be
manly, combining dignity and charm; it must be
different from the reading of prose, for poetry is
song and poets claim to be singers. But this fact
does not justify degeneration into sing-song or the
effeminate modulations now in vogue: there is an
excellent saying on this point attributed to Gaius
Caesar while he was still a boy: <quote>If you are singing,
you sing badly: if you are reading, you sing.</quote>
 <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>  Again I do not, like some teachers, wish character
as revealed by speeches to be indicated as it is by
the comic actor, though I think that there should
be some modulation of the voice to distinguish such
passages from those where the poet is speaking in
person. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>  There are other points where there is much
need of instruction: above all, unformed minds
which are liable to be all the more deeply impressed
by what they learn in their days of childish

<pb id="p.149"/>

ignorance, must learn not merely what is eloquent;
it is even more important that they should study
what is morally excellent.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>  It is therefore an admirable practice which now
prevails, to begin by reading Homer and Vergil,
although the intelligence needs to be further developed for the full appreciation of their merits: but
there is plenty of time for that since the boy will
read them more than once. In the meantime let his
mind be lifted by the sublimity of heroic verse,
inspired by the greatness of its theme and imbued
with the loftiest sentiments. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>  The reading of tragedy
also is useful, and lyric poets will provide nourishment for the mind, provided not merely the authors
be carefully selected, but also the passages from
their works which are to be read. For the Greek lyric
poets are often licentious and even in Horace there
are passages which I should be unwilling to explain
to a class. Elegiacs, however, more especially erotic
elegy, and hendecasyllables, which are merely sections
of Sotadean verse<note>One form of Sotadean is ZZZ
The Hendecasyllable runs ZZZ,= the
Sotadean minus the first three syllables. Both metres were
frequently used for indecent lampoons. For Sotades see
index.</note> (concerning which latter I need
give no admonitions), should be entirely banished, if
possible; if not absolutely banished, they should be
reserved for pupils of a less impressionable age. As to
comedy, whose contribution to eloquence may be of
no small importance, <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>  since it is concerned with every
kind of character and emotion, I will shortly point
out in its due places what use can in my opinion
be made of it in the education of boys. As soon as
we have no fear of contaminating their morals, it
should take its place among the subjects which it is
specially desirable to read. I speak of Menander,
though I would not exclude others. For Latin
authors will also be of some service. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>  But the

<pb id="p.151"/>

subjects selected for lectures to boys should be those
which will enlarge the mind and provide the greatest nourishment to the intellect. Life is quite long
enough for the subsequent study of those other subjects which are concerned with matters of interest
solely to learned men. But even the old Latin poets
may be of great value, in spite of the fact that their
strength lies in their natural talent rather than in
their art: above all they will contribute richness
of vocabulary: for the vocabulary of the tragedians
is full of dignity, while in that of the comedians
there is a certain elegance and Attic grace. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>  They
are, too, more careful about dramatic structure than
the majority of moderns, who regard epigram as the
sole merit of every kind of literary work. For
purity at any rate and manliness, if I may say so,
we must certainly go to these writers, since to-day
even our style of speaking is infected with all the
faults of modern decadence. <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>  Finally we may derive
confidence from the practice of the greatest orators
of drawing upon the early poets to support their
arguments or adorn their eloquence. <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>  For we find,
more especially in the pages of Cicero, but frequently in Asinius and other orators of that period, quotations from Ennius, Accius, Pacuvius, Lucilius, Terence,
Caecilius and others, inserted not merely to show
the speaker's learning, but to please his hearers
as well, since the charms of poetry provide a pleasant relief from the severity of forensic eloquence. <milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Such quotations have the additional advantage of
helping the speaker's case, for the orator makes use
of the sentiments expressed by the poet as evidence
in support of his own statements. But while my
earlier remarks have special application to the
education of boys, those which I have just made

<pb id="p.153"/>

apply rather to persons of riper years; for the love of
letters and the value of reading are not confined to
one's schooldays, but end only with life.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>  In lecturing the teacher of literature must give
attention to minor points as well: he will ask his
class after analysing a verse to give him the parts of
speech and the peculiar features of the feet which
it contains: these latter should be so familiar in
poetry as to make their presence desired even in
the prose of oratory. He will point out what words
are barbarous, what improperly used, and what are
contrary to the laws of language. <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>  He will not do
this by way of censuring the poets for such peculiarities, for poets are usually the servants of their
metres and are allowed such licence that faults
are given other names when they occur in poetry:
for we style them <hi rend="italics">metaplasms,</hi><note>The formation of cases of nouns and tenses of verbs from
a non-existent nom. or pres.: or more generally any change
in the forms of a word.</note> <hi rend="italics">schematisms</hi> and
<hi rend="italics">schemata,</hi><note><hi rend="italics">schematismus</hi> and <hi rend="italics">schemata</hi> both seem to mean the same,
<hi rend="italics">sc.</hi> figures.</note> as I have said, and make a virtue of
necessity. Their aim will rather be to familiarise the
pupil with the artifices of style and to stimulate his
memory. <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>  Further in the elementary stages of such
instruction it will not be unprofitable to show the
different meanings which may be given to each word.
With regard to <hi rend="italics">glossemala,</hi> that is to say words not
in common use, the teacher must exercise no ordinary diligence, <milestone unit="section" n="16"/>  while still greater care is required in
teaching all the tropes<note>See Book VIII. chap. vi.</note> which are employed for the
adornment more especially of poetry, but of oratory
as well, and in making his class acquainted with the
two sorts of <hi rend="italics">schemata</hi> or figures known as <hi rend="italics">figures of
speech</hi> and <hi rend="italics">figures of thought.</hi><note>See Book <milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>chaps. i. and ii. A trope is an expression
used in a sense which it cannot strictly bear. A figure is a
form of speech differing from the ordinary method of expression; see IX i. 4.</note> I shall however

<pb id="p.155"/>

postpone discussion of <hi rend="italics">tropes</hi> and <hi rend="italics">figures</hi> till I come to
deal with the various ornaments of style. <milestone unit="section" n="17"/>  Above
all he will impress upon their minds the value of
proper arrangement, and of graceful treatment of
the matter in hand: he will show what is appropriate
to the various characters, what is praiseworthy in the
thoughts or words, where copious diction is to be
commended and where restraint.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="18"/>  In addition to this he will explain the various
stories that occur: this must be done with care,
but should not be encumbered with superfluous
detail. For it is sufficient to set forth the version
which is generally received or at any rate rests upon
good authority. But to ferret out everything that
has ever been said on the subject even by the most
worthless of writers is a sign of tiresome pedantry
or empty ostentation, and results in delaying and
swamping the mind when it would be better
employed on other themes. <milestone unit="section" n="19"/>  The man who pores
over every page even though it be wholly unworthy
of reading, is capable of devoting his attention
to the investigation of old wives' tales. And yet
the commentaries of teachers of literature are full
of such encumbrances to learning and strangely
unfamiliar to their own authors. <milestone unit="section" n="20"/>  It is, for instance,
recorded that Didymus, who was unsurpassed for
the number of books which he wrote, on one occasion
objected to some story as being absurd, whereupon
one of his own books was produced which contained
the story in question. <milestone unit="section" n="21"/>  Such abuses occur chiefly in
connexion with fabulous stories and are sometimes
carried to ludicrous or even scandalous extremes:
for in such cases the more unscrupulous commentator
has such full scope for invention, that he can tell lies

<pb id="p.157"/>

to his heart's content about whole books and authors
without fear of detection: for what never existed
can obviously never be found, whereas if the subject
is familiar the careful investigator will often detect
the fraud. Consequently I shall count it a merit in
a teacher of literature that there should be some
things which he does not know.</p>

<p>IX. I have now finished with two of the
departments, with which teachers of literature profess to deal, namely the art of speaking correctly
and the interpretation of authors; the former they
call <hi rend="italics">nethodic&emacr;,</hi> the latter <hi rend="italics">histori&emacr;</hi> We must however
add to their activities instruction in certain rudiments
of oratory for the benefit of those who are not yet
ripe for the schools of rhetoric. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>  Their pupils should
learn to paraphrase Aesop's fables, the natural successors of the fairy stories of the nursery, in simple
and restrained language and subsequently to set
down this paraphrase in writing with the same simplicity of style: they should begin by analysing
each verse, then give its meaning in different
language, and finally proceed to a freer paraphrase in
which they will be permitted now to abridge and
now to embellish the original, so far as this may be
done without losing the poet's meaning. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>  This is no
easy task even for the expert instructor, and the
pupil who handles it successfully will be capable of
learning everything. He should also be set to write
<hi rend="italics">aphorisms, moral essays (chriae</hi>) and <hi rend="italics">delineations of character (ethologiae</hi>),<note>The meaning of <hi rend="italics">ethologia</hi> is doubtful, but probably means
a simple character-sketch of some famous man.</note> of which the teacher will first give
the general scheme, since such themes will be drawn
from their reading. In all of these exercises the
general idea is the same, but the form differs:
<hi rend="italics">aphorisms</hi> are general propositions, while <hi rend="italics">ethologiae</hi>

<pb id="p.159"/>

are concerned with persons <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>  . Of <hi rend="italics">moral essays</hi> there
are various forms: some are akin to <hi rend="italics">aphorisms</hi> and
commence with a simple statement <quote>he said</quote> or <quote>he
used to say</quote>: others give the answer to a question
and begin <quote>on being asked</quote> or <quote>in answer to this
he replied,</quote> while a third and not dissimilar type
begins, <quote>when someone has said or done something.</quote>
Some hold that a <hi rend="italics">moral essay</hi> may take some action
as its text; <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>  take for example the statement <quote>Crates
on seeing an ill-educated boy, beat his <hi rend="italics">paedagogus,</hi></quote> or
a very similar example which they do not venture
actually to propose as a theme for a <hi rend="italics">moral essay,</hi> but
content themselves with saying that it is of the
nature of such a theme, namely <quote>Milo, having

these instances are couched in the same grammatical form<note>The sense is not clear: it appears to refer to the stereotyped form in which the <hi rend="italics">chria</hi> was couched.</note> and deeds no less than sayings may
be presented for treatment. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>  Short stories from the
poets should in my opinion be handled not with
a view to style but as a means of increasing knowledge. Other more serious and ambitious tasks
have been also imposed on teachers of literature by
the fact that Latin rhetoricians will have nothing to
do with them: Greek rhetoricians have a better
comprehension of the extent and nature of the tasks
placed on their shoulders.</p>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>I have made my remarks on this stage of
education as brief as possible, making no attempt to
say everything, (for the theme is infinite), but confining myself to the most necessary points. I will
now proceed briefly to discuss the remaining arts in
which I think boys ought to be instructed before
being handed over to the teacher of rhetoric: for it

<pb id="p.161"/>

is by such studies that the course of education described by the Greeks as <foreign lang="greek">e)gku/klikos paidei/a</foreign> or general
education will be brought to its full completion.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>  For there are other subjects of education which
must be studied simultaneously with literature.
These being independent studies are capable of completion without a knowledge of oratory, while on the
other hand they cannot by themselves produce an
orator. The question has consequently been raised
as to whether they are necessary for this purpose.
 <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>  What, say some, has the knowledge of the way to
describe an equilateral triangle on a given straight
line got to do with pleading in the law-courts or
speaking in the senate? Will an acquaintance with
the names and intervals of the notes of the lyre help
an orator to defend a criminal or direct the policy
of his country? <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>  They will perhaps produce a long
list of orators who are most effective in the courts
but have never sat under a geometrician and whose
understanding of music is confined to the pleasure
which their ears, like those of other men, derive
from it. To such critics I reply, and Cicero frequently
makes the same remark in his Orator, that I am
not describing any orator who actually exists or has
existed, but have in my mind's eye an ideal orator,
perfect down to the smallest detail. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>  For when the
philosophers describe the ideal sage who is to be
consummate in all knowledge and a very god incarnate, as they say, they would have him receive
instruction not merely in the knowledge of things
human and divine, but would also lead him through
a course of subjects, which in themselves are comparatively trivial, as for instance the elaborate
subtleties of formal logic: not that acquaintance

<pb id="p.163"/>

with the so called <quote>horn</quote><note>You have what you have not lost: you have not lost
horns: therefore you have horns.</note> or <quote>crocodile</quote><note>A crocodile, having seized a woman's son, said that he
would restore him, if she would tell him the truth. She
replied, <quote>You will not restore him.</quote> <hi rend="italics">Was</hi> it the crocodile's
duty to give him up?</note> problems
can make a man wise, but because it is important that he should never trip even in the
smallest trifles. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>  So too the teacher of geometry,
music or other subjects which I would class with
these, will not be able to create the perfect orator
(who like the philosopher ought to be a wise man),
but none the less these arts will assist in his perfection. I may draw a parallel from the use of antidotes
and other remedies applied to the eyes or to wounds.
We know that these are composed of ingredients
which produce many and sometimes contrary effects,
but mixed together they make a single compound
resembling no one of its component parts, but
deriving its peculiar properties from all: <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>  so too dumb
insects produce honey, whose taste is beyond the
skill of man to imitate, from different kinds of flowers
and juices. Shall we marvel then, if oratory, the
highest gift of providence to man, needs the assistance
of many arts, which, although they do not reveal or
intrude themselves in actual speaking, supply hidden
forces and make their silent presence felt? <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>  <quote>But</quote>
it will be urged <quote>men have proved fluent without
their aid.</quote> Granted, but I am in quest of an orator.
<quote>Their contribution is but small.</quote> Yes, but we shall
never attain completeness, if minor details be
lacking. And it will be agreed that though our
ideal of perfection may dwell on a height that is hard
to gain, it is our duty to teach all we know, that
achievement may at least come somewhat nearer
the goal. But why should our courage fail? The
perfect orator is not contrary to the laws of nature,
and it is cowardly to despair of anything that is
within the bounds of possibility.

<pb id="p.165"/>
</p>

<p>For myself I should be ready to accept the verdict
of antiquity. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>  Who is ignorant of the fact that
music, of which I will speak first, was in ancient
times the object not merely of intense study but of
veneration: in fact Orpheus and Linus, to mention
no others, were regarded as uniting the roles of musician, poet and philosopher. Both were of divine
origin, while the former, because by the marvel of
his music he soothed the savage breast, is recorded
to have drawn after him not merely beasts of the
wild, but rocks and trees. <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>  So too Timagenes
asserts that music is the oldest of the arts related to
literature, a statement which is confirmed by the testimony of the greatest of poets in whose songs we read
that the praise of heroes and of gods were sung to
the music of the lyre at the feasts of kings. Does not
lopas, the Vergilian bard, sing

<quote rend="blockquote">
<cit><quote><l>The wandering moon and labours of the Sun</l></quote>
<bibl>Aen. i. 742.</bibl></cit></quote>

and the like? whereby the supreme poet manifests most clearly that music is united with the
knowledge even of things divine. <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>  If this be admitted, music will be a necessity even for an orator,
since those fields of knowledge, which were annexed
by philosophy on their abandonment by oratory,
once were ours and without the knowledge of all
such things there can be no perfect eloquence.
 <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>  There can in any case be no doubt that some of
those men whose wisdom is a household word have
been earnest students of music: Pythagoras for
instance and his followers popularised the belief,
which they no doubt had received from earlier
teachers, that the universe is constructed on the
same principles which were afterwards imitated in

<pb id="p.167"/>

the construction of the lyre, and not content merely
with emphasising that concord of discordant elements
which they style harmony attributed a sound to the
motions of the celestial bodies.<note>The music of the spheres: <hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> the vision of Er in Plato
(<hi rend="italics">Rcp.</hi> 10) and the <hi rend="italics">Somnium Scipionis</hi> of Cicero. The
sounds produced by the heavenly bodies correspond to the
notes of the heptachord.</note> <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>  As for Plato, there
are certain passages in his works, more especially in
the <hi rend="italics">Timaeus,</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Tim.</hi> p. 47.</note> which are quite unintelligible to those
who have not studied the theory of music. But
why speak only of the philosophers, whose master,
Socrates, did not blush to receive instruction in playing the lyre even when far advanced in years? <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>  It is
recorded that the greatest generals played on the
lyre and the pipe, and that the armies of Sparta were
fired to martial ardour by the strains of music. And
what else is the function of the horns and trumpets
attached to our legions? The louder the concert of
their notes, the greater is the glorious supremacy of
our arms over all the nations of the earth. <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>  It was
not therefore without reason that Plato regarded the
knowledge of music as necessary to his ideal statesman or politician, as he calls him; while the leaders
even of that school, which in other respects is the
strictest and most severe of all schools of philosophy,<note>sc. the Stoics.</note>
held that the wise man might well devote some of
his attention to such studies. Lycurgus himself, the
founder of the stern laws of Sparta, approved of the
training supplied by music. <milestone unit="section" n="16"/>  Indeed nature itself
seems to have given music as a boon to men to lighten
the strain of labour: even the rower in the galleys
is cheered to effort by song. Nor is this function of
music confined to cases where the efforts of a number
are given union by the sound of some sweet voice
that sets the tune, but even solitary workers find
solace at their toil in artless song. <milestone unit="section" n="17"/>  So far I have
attempted merely to sound the praises of the noblest

<pb id="p.169"/>

of arts without bringing it into connexion with the
education of an orator. I will therefore pass by the
fact that the art of letters and that of music were
once united: indeed Archytas and Euenus held
that the former was subordinate to the latter, while
we know that the same instructors were employed
for the teaching of both from Sophron, a writer of
farces, it is true, but so highly esteemed by Plato,
that he is believed to have had Sophron's works
under his pillow on his deathbed: <milestone unit="section" n="18"/>  the same fact is
proved by the case of Eupolis, who makes Prodamus
teach both music and literature, and whose Maricas,
who was none other than Hyperbolus in disguise,
asserts that he knows nothing of music but letters.
Aristophanes<note><hi rend="italics">Knights,</hi> 188.</note> again in more than one of his plays
shows that boys were trained in music from remote
antiquity, while in the <hi rend="italics">Hypobolimaeus</hi> of Menander
an old man, when a father claims his son from him,
gives an account of all expenses incurred on behalf
of the boy's education and states that he has paid
out large sums to musicians and geometricians. <milestone unit="section" n="19"/> From the importance thus given to music also originated the custom of taking a lyre round the company
after dinner, and when on such an occasion Themistocles confessed that he could not play, his education
was (to quote the words of Cicero) <quote>regarded as imperfect.</quote><note><hi rend="italics">Tusc. Disp.</hi> I. ii. 4.</note> <milestone unit="section" n="20"/>  Even at the banquets of our own forefathers
it was the custom to introduce the pipe and lyre, and
even the hymn of the Salii has its tune. These
practices were instituted by King Numa and clearly
prove that not even those whom we regard as rude
warriors, neglected the study of music, at least in so
far as the resources of that age allowed. <milestone unit="section" n="21"/>  Finally
there was actually a proverb among the Greeks,

<pb id="p.171"/>

that the uneducated were far from the company of
the Muses and Graces. <milestone unit="section" n="22"/>  But let us discuss the
advantages which our future orator may reasonably
expect to derive from the study of Music.</p>

<p>Music has two modes of expression in the voice
and in the body;<note>Music includes dancing.</note> for both voice and body require
to be controlled by appropriate rules. Aristoxenus
divides music, in so far as it concerns the voice, into
<hi rend="italics">rhythm</hi> and <hi rend="italics">melody,</hi> the one consisting in measure,
the latter in sound and song. Now I ask you whether
it is not absolutely necessary for the orator to be
acquainted with all these methods of expression
which are concerned firstly with gesture, secondly
with the arrangement of words and thirdly with the
inflexions of the voice, of which a great variety are
required in pleading. <milestone unit="section" n="23"/>  Otherwise we must assume
that structure and the euphonious combination of
sounds are necessary only for poetry, lyric and otherwise, but superfluous in pleading, or that unlike
music, oratory has no interest in the variation of
arrangement and sound to suit the demands of the
case. <milestone unit="section" n="24"/>  But eloquence does vary both tone and rhythm,
expressing sublime thoughts with elevation, pleasing
thoughts with sweetness, and ordinary with gentle
utterance, and in every expression of its art is in
sympathy with the emotions of which it is the mouthpiece. <milestone unit="section" n="25"/>  It is by the raising, lowering or inflexion of
the voice that the orator stirs the emotions of his
hearers, and the measure, if I may repeat the term,
of voice or phrase differs according as we wish
to rouse the indignation or the pity of the judge.
For, as we know, different emotions are roused even
by the various musical instruments, which are
incapable of reproducing speech. <milestone unit="section" n="26"/>  Further the

<pb id="p.173"/>

motion of the body must be suitable and becoming,
or as the Greeks call it <hi rend="italics">eurythmic,</hi> and this can only
be secured by the study of music. This is a most
important department of eloquence, and will receive
separate treatment in this work.<note>Book <milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>chap. iii.</note> <milestone unit="section" n="27"/>  To proceed, an
orator will assuredly pay special attention to his
voice, and what is so specially the concern of music
as this? Here too I must not anticipate a later
section of this work, and will content myself by
citing the example of Gaius Gracchus, the leading
orator of his age, who during his speeches had a
musician standing behind him with a pitchpipe, or
<hi rend="italics">tonarion</hi> as the Greeks call it, whose duty it was to
give him the tones in which his voice was to be
pitched. <milestone unit="section" n="28"/>  Such was the attention which he paid to
this point even in the midst of his most turbulent
speeches, when he was terrifying the patrician party
and even when he had begun to fear their power.
I should like for the benefit of the uninstructed,
those <quote>creatures of the heavier Muse,</quote> as the saying
is, to remove all doubts as to the value of music. <milestone unit="section" n="29"/> They will at any rate admit that the poets should be
read by our future orator. But can they be read
without some knowledge of music? Or if any of
my critics be so blind as to have some doubts about
other forms of poetry, can the lyric poets at any
rate be read without such knowledge? If there
were anything novel in my insistence on the study
of music, I should have to treat the matter at
greater length. <milestone unit="section" n="30"/>  But in view of the fact that the
study of music has, from those remote times when
Chiron taught Achilles down to our own day, continued to be studied by all except those who
have a hatred for any regular course of study, it

<pb id="p.175"/>

would be a mistake to seem to cast any doubt upon
its value by showing an excessive zeal in its defence.
 <milestone unit="section" n="31"/>  It will, however, I think be sufficiently clear from
the examples I have already quoted, what I regard
as the value and the sphere of music in the training
of an orator. Still I think I ought to be more
emphatic than I have been in stating that the music
which I desire to see taught is not our modern music,
which has been emasculated by the lascivious melodies of our effeminate stage and has to no small
extent destroyed such manly vigour as we still
possessed. No, I refer to the music of old which was
employed to sing the praises of brave men and was
sung by the brave themselves. I will have none
of your psalteries and viols, that are unfit even for
the use of a modest girl. Give me the knowledge
of the principles of music, which have power to
excite or assuage the emotions of mankind. <milestone unit="section" n="32"/>  We
are told that Pythagoras on one occasion, when some
young men were led astray by their passions to
commit an outrage on a respectable family, calmed
them by ordering the piper to change her strain to a
spondaic measure, while Chrysippus selects a special
tune to be used by nurses to entice their little charges
to sleep. <milestone unit="section" n="33"/>  Further I may point out that among the
fictitious themes employed in declamation is one,
doing no little credit to its author's learning, in
which it is supposed that a piper is accused of manslaughter because he had played a tune in the Phrygian mode as an accompaniment to a sacrifice, with
the result that the person officiating went mad and
flung himself over a precipice. If an orator is
expected to declaim on such a theme as this, which
cannot possibly be handled without some knowledge

<pb id="p.177"/>

of music, how can my critics for all their prejudice
fail to agree that music is a necessary element in
the education of an orator?</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="34"/>  As regards geometry,<note>Geometry here includes all mathematics.</note> it is granted that portions of
this science are of value for the instruction of children:
for admittedly it exercises their minds, sharpens
their wits and generates quickness of perception.
But it is considered that the value of geometry
resides in the process of learning, and not as with
other sciences in the knowledge thus acquired.
Such is the general opinion. <milestone unit="section" n="35"/>  But it is not without
good reason that some of the greatest men have
devoted special attention to this science. Geometry
has two divisions; one is concerned with numbers,
the other with figures. Now knowledge of the former
is a necessity not merely to the orator, but to any
one who has had even an elementary education.
Such knowledge is frequently required in actual
cases, in which a speaker is regarded as deficient in education, I will not say if he hesitates
in making a calculation, but even if he contradicts
the calculation which he states in words by making
an uncertain or inappropriate gesture with his fingers.<note>There was a separate symbol for each number, depending
on the hand used and the position of the fingers. See <hi rend="italics">Class.
Review,</hi> 1911, p. 72</note>
Again linear geometry is frequently required in
cases, as in lawsuits about boundaries and measurements. <milestone unit="section" n="36"/>  But geometry and oratory are related in a
yet more important way than this. <milestone unit="section" n="37"/>  In the first
place logical development is one of the necessities
of geometry. And is it not equally a necessity for
oratory? Geometry arrives at its conclusions from
definite premises, and by arguing from what is certain
proves what was previously uncertain. Is not this
just what we do in speaking? Again are not the
problems of geometry almost entirely solved by the

<pb id="p.179"/>

syllogistic method, a fact which makes the majority
assert that geometry bears a closer resemblance to
logic than to rhetoric? But even the orator will
sometimes, though rarely, prove his point by formal
logic. <milestone unit="section" n="38"/>  For, if necessary, he will use the syllogism,
and he will certainly make use of the enthymeme
which is a rhetorical form of syllogism.<note>See v. xiv. I for an example from the <hi rend="italics">Pro Ligario.</hi>
<quote>The cause was then doubtful, as there were arguments on
both sides. Now, however, we must regard that cause as the
better, to which the gods have given their approval.</quote></note> Further
the most absolute form of proof is that which is
generally known as linear demonstration. And what
is the aim of oratory if not proof? <milestone unit="section" n="39"/>  Again oratory
sometimes detects falsehoods closely resembling the
truth by the use of geometrical methods. An
example of this may be found in connexion with
numbers in the so-called pseudographs, a favourite
amusement in our boyhood.<note>It is not known to what Quintilian refers.</note> But there are more
important points to be considered. Who is there
who would not accept the following proposition?
<quote>When the lines bounding two figures are equal in
length, the areas contained within those lines are
equal.</quote> But this is false, for everything depends on
the shape of the figure formed by these lines, <milestone unit="section" n="40"/>  and
historians have been taken to task by geometricians
for believing the time taken to circumnavigate an
island to be a sufficient indication of its size. For
the space enclosed is in proportion to the perfection
of the figure. <milestone unit="section" n="41"/>  Consequently if the bounding line
to which we have referred form a circle, the most
perfect of all plane figures, it will contain a greater
space than if the same length of line took the form
of a square, while a square contains a greater space
than a triangle having the same total perimeter, and
an equilateral triangle than a scalene triangle. <milestone unit="section" n="42"/>  But
there are other points which perhaps present greater

<pb id="p.181"/>

difficulty. I will take an example which is easy
even for those who have no knowledge of geometry.
There is scarcely anyone who does not know that
the Roman acre is 240 feet long and 120 feet
broad, and its total perimeter and the area enclosed
can easily be calculated. <milestone unit="section" n="43"/>  But a square of 180 feet
gives the same perimeter, yet contains a much
larger area within its four sides. If the calculation
prove irksome to any of my readers, he can learn the
same truth by employing smaller numbers. Take a
ten foot square: its perimeter is forty feet and it
contains 100 square feet. But if the dimensions be
fifteen feet by five, while the perimeter is the same,
the area enclosed is less by a quarter. <milestone unit="section" n="44"/>  On the other
hand if we draw a parallelogram measuring nineteen
feet by one, the number of square feet enclosed will
be no greater than the number of linear feet making
the actual length of the parallelogram, though the
perimeter will be exactly as that of the figure which
encloses an area of 100 square feet. Consequently the
area enclosed by four lines will decrease in proportion
as we depart from the form of a square. <milestone unit="section" n="45"/>  It further
follows that it is perfectly possible for the space
enclosed to be less, though the perimeter be greater.
This applies to plane figures only: for even one who
is no mathematician can see that, when we have to
consider hills or valleys, the extent of ground enclosed
is greater than the sky over it. <milestone unit="section" n="46"/>  But geometry soars
still higher to the consideration of the system of
the universe: for by its calculations it demonstrates
the fixed and ordained courses of the stars, and
thereby we acquire the knowledge that all things
are ruled by order and destiny, a consideration
which may at times be of value to an orator. <milestone unit="section" n="47"/>  When

<pb id="p.183"/>

Pericles dispelled the panic caused at Athens by the
eclipse of the sun by explaining the causes of the
phenomenon, or Sulpicius Gallus discoursed on the
eclipse of the moon to the army of Lucius Paulus to
prevent the soldiers being seized with terror at what
they regarded as a portent sent by heaven, did not
they discharge the function of an orator? <milestone unit="section" n="48"/>  If Nicias
had known this when he commanded in Sicily, he
would not have shared the terror of his men nor lost
the finest army that Athens ever placed in the field.
Dion for instance when he came to Syracuse to overthrow the tyranny of Dionysius, was not frightened
away by the occurrence of a similar phenomenon.
However we are not concerned with the uses of
geometry in war and need not dwell upon the fact
that Archimedes singlehanded succeeded in appreciably prolonging the resistance of Syracuse when it
was besieged. <milestone unit="section" n="49"/>  It will suffice for our purpose that
there are a number of problems which it is difficult
to solve in any other way, which are as a rule solved
by these linear demonstrations, such as the method
of division, section to infinity,<note>Quintilian is perhaps referring to the measurement of
the area of an irregular figure by dividing it into a number
of small equal and regular figures the size of which was
calculable.</note> and the ratio of increase in velocity. From this we may conclude that,
if as we shall show in the next book an orator has
to speak on every kind of subject, he can under
no circumstances dispense with a knowledge of
geometry.</p>

<p>XI. The comic actor will also claim a certain
amount of our attention, but only in so far as our
future orator must be a master of the art of delivery.
For I do not of course wish the boy, whom we are
training to this end, to talk with the shrillness of a
woman or in the tremulous accents of old age. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>  Nor
for that matter must he ape the vices of the

<pb id="p.185"/>

drunkard, or copy the cringing manners of a slave,
or learn to express the emotions of love, avarice or
fear. Such accomplishments are not necessary to
an orator and corrupt the mind, especially while it
is still pliable and unformed. For repeated imitation passes into habit. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>  Nor yet again must we
adopt all the gestures and movements of the actor.
Within certain limits the orator must be a master of
both, but he must rigorously avoid staginess and all
extravagance of facial expression, gesture and gait.
For if an orator does command a certain art in such
matters, its highest expression will be in the concealment of its existence.</p>

<p>What then is the duty of the teacher whom
we have borrowed from the stage? <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>  In the
first place he must correct all faults of pronunciation, and see that the utterance is distinct,
and that each letter has its proper sound.
There is an unfortunate tendency in the case of
some letters to pronounce them either too thinly
or too fully, while some we find too harsh and fail to
pronounce sufficiently, substituting others whose
sound is similar but somewhat duller. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>  For instance,
<hi rend="italics">lambda</hi> is substituted for <hi rend="italics">rho,</hi> a letter which was
always a stumbling-block to Demosthenes; our <hi rend="italics">l</hi>
and r have of course the same value.<note>The mis-spelling of <hi rend="italics">flagro</hi> as <hi rend="italics">fraglo</hi> exemplifies the confusion to which Quintilian refers. A similar, though correct,
substitution is found in <hi rend="italics">lavacrum</hi> for <hi rend="italics">lavaclum,</hi> etc. See
Lindsay, <hi rend="italics">Lat. Langu.,</hi> pp. 92 ff.</note> Similarly
when c and g are not given their full value, they
are softened into t and <hi rend="italics">d.</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>  Again our teacher must
not tolerate the affected pronunciation of <hi rend="italics">s</hi><note>Quintilian perhaps alludes to the habit of prefixing <hi rend="italics">i</hi> to
initial <hi rend="italics">st, sp, sc</hi> found in inscriptions of the later Empire.
See Lindsay, <hi rend="italics">op. cit.</hi> p. 102.</note> with
which we are painfully familiar, nor suffer words
to be uttered from the depths of the throat or

<pb id="p.187"/>

rolled out hollow-mouthed, or permit the natural
sound of the voice to be over-laid with a fuller
sound, a fault fatal to purity of speech; the
Greeks give this peculiarity the name <foreign lang="greek">katapeplasme/non</foreign> (plastered over), a term applied to the
tone produced by a pipe, <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>  when the stops which
produce the treble notes are closed, and a bass note
is produced through the main aperture only. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>  He
will also see that final syllables are not clipped, that
the quality of speech is continuously maintained,
that when the voice is raised, the strain falls upon
the lungs and not the mouth, and that gesture and
voice are mutually appropriate. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>  He will also insist
that the speaker faces his audience, that the lips
are not distorted nor the jaws parted to a grin,
that the face is not thrown back, nor the eyes fixed
on the ground, nor the neck slanted to left or right.
For there are a variety of faults of facial expression.
I have seen many, who raised their brows whenever
the voice was called upon for an effort, <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>  others who
wore a perpetual frown, and yet others who could
not keep their eyebrows level, but raised one
towards the top of the head and depressed the
other till it almost closed the eye. <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>  These are
details, but as I shall shortly show, they are of
enormous importance, for nothing that is unbecoming
can have a pleasing effect.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>  Our actor will also be required to show how a
narrative should be delivered, and to indicate the
authoritative tone that should be given to advice,
the excitement which should mark the rise of anger,
and the change of tone that is characteristic of
pathos. The best method of so doing is to select
special passages from comedy appropriate for the

<pb id="p.189"/>

purpose, that is to say, resembling the speeches of
a pleader. <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>  These are not only most useful in training the delivery, but are admirably adapted to
increase a speaker's eloquence. <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>  These are the
methods to be employed while the pupil is too young
to take in more advanced instruction; but when
the time has come for him to read speeches, and as
soon as he begins to appreciate their merits, he
should have a careful and efficient teacher at his
side not merely to form his style of reading aloud,
but to make him learn select passages by heart and
declaim them standing in the manner which actual
pleading would require: thus he will simultaneously
train delivery, voice and memory.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>  I will not blame even those who give a certain
amount of time to the teacher of gymnastics. I am
not speaking of those, who spend part of their life
in rubbing themselves with oil and part in winebibbing, and kill the mind by over-attention to the
body: indeed, I would have such as these kept
as far as possible from the boy whom we are
training. <milestone unit="section" n="16"/>  But we give the same name to those who
form gesture and motion so that the arms may be
extended in the proper manner, the management of
the hands free from all trace of rusticity and
inelegance, the attitude becoming, the movements
of the feet appropriate and the motions of the head
and eyes in keeping with the poise of the body. <milestone unit="section" n="17"/>  No
one will deny that such details form a part of the
art of delivery, nor divorce delivery from oratory;
and there can be no justification for disdaining to
learn what has got to be done, especially as
<hi rend="italics">chironomy,</hi> which, as the name shows, is <hi rend="italics">the law of
gesture,</hi> originated in heroic times and met with the

<pb id="p.191"/>

approval of the greatest Greeks, not excepting
Socrates himself, while it was placed by Plato among
the virtues of a citizen and included by Chrysippus
in his instructions relative to the education of
children. <milestone unit="section" n="18"/>  We are told that the Spartans even
regarded a certain form of dance as a useful
element in military training. Nor again did the
ancient Romans consider such a practice as disgraceful: this is clear from the fact that priestly and
ritual dances have survived to the present day, while
Cicero in the third book of his <hi rend="italics">de Oratore</hi><note>lix. 220.</note> quotes the
words of Crassus, in which he lays down the
principle that the orator <quote>should learn to move his
body in a bold and manly fashion derived not from
actors or the stage, but from martial and even from
gymnastic exercises.</quote> And such a method of training has persisted uncensured to our own time. <milestone unit="section" n="19"/>  In my
opinion, however, such training should not extend
beyond the years of boyhood, and even boys should
not devote too much time to it. For I do not wish
the gestures of oratory to be modelled on those
of the dance. But I do desire that such boyish
exercises should continue to exert a certain influence, and that something of the grace which we
acquired as learners should attend us in after life
without our being conscious of the fact.</p>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The question is not infrequently asked, as
to whether, admitting that these things ought to
be learned, it is possible for all of them to be
taught and taken in simultaneously. There are
some who say that this is impossible on the ground
that the mind is confused and tired by application
to so <hi rend="italics">many</hi> studies of different tendencies: neither
the intelligence nor the physique of our pupils, nor

<pb id="p.193"/>

the time at our disposal are sufficient, they say, and
even though older boys may be strong enough, it is
a sin to put such a burden on the shoulders of childhood. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>  These critics show an insufficient appreciation of the capacities of the human mind, which
is so swift and nimble and versatile, that it cannot
be restricted to doing one thing only, but insists on
devoting its attention to several different subjects not
merely in one day, but actually at one and the
same time. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>  Do not harpists simultaneously exert
the memory and pay attention to the tone and
inflexions of the voice, while the right hand runs
over certain strings and the left plucks, stops or
releases others, and even the foot is employed in
beating time, all these actions being performed at
the same moment? <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>  Again, do not we ourselves,
when unexpectedly called upon to plead, speak
while we are thinking what we are to say next,
invention of argument, choice of words, rhythm,
gesture, delivery, facial expression and movement all
being required simultaneously? If all these things
can be done with one effort in spite of their
diversity, why should we not divide our hours among
different branches of study? We must remember
that variety serves to refresh and restore the mind,
and that it is really considerably harder to work at
one subject without intermission. Consequently we
should give the pen a rest by turning to read, and
relieve the tedium of reading by changes of subject.
However manifold our activities, in a certain sense
we come fresh to each new subject. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>  Who can
maintain his attention, if he has to listen for a
whole day to one teacher harping on the same
subject, be it what it may? Change of studies is

<pb id="p.195"/>

like change of foods: the stomach is refreshed by
their variety and derives greater nourishment from
variety of viands. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>  If my critics disagree, let them
provide me with an alternative method. Are we
first to deliver ourselves up to the sole service of
the teacher of literature, and then similarly to the
teacher of geometry, neglecting under the latter
what was taught us by the former? And then are
we to go on to the musician, forgetting all that we
learned before? And when we study Latin literature, are we to do so to the exclusion of Greek? In
fine, to have done with the matter once and for all,
are we to do nothing except that which last comes
to our hand? <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>  On this principle, why not advise
farmers not to cultivate corn, vines, olives and
orchard trees at the same time? or from devoting
themselves simultaneously to pastures, cattle, gardens, bees and poultry? Why do we ourselves daily
allot some of our time to the business of the courts,
some to the demands of our friends, some to our
domestic affairs, some to the exercise of the body,
and some even to our pleasures? Any one of these
occupations, if pursued without interruption, would
fatigue us. So much easier is it to do many things
than to do one thing for a long time continuously.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>  We need have no fear at any rate that boys will
find their work too exhausting: there is no age more
capable of enduring fatigue. The fact may be surprising, but it can be proved by experiment. For
the mind is all the easier to teach before it is set. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>  This
may be clearly proved by the fact that within two
years after a child has begun to form words correctly,
he can speak practically all without any pressure
from outside. On the other hand how many years

<pb id="p.197"/>

it takes for our newly-imported slaves to become
familiar with the Latin language. Try to teach an
adult to read and you will soon appreciate the force
of the saying applied to those who do everything
connected with their art with the utmost skill <quote>he
started young!</quote> Moreover boys stand the strain of
work better than young men. <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>  Just as small children
suffer less damage from their frequent falls, from
their crawling on hands and knees and, a little later,
from their incessant play and their running about
from morn till eve, because they are so light in
weight and have so little to carry, even so their
minds are less susceptible of fatigue, because their
activity calls for less effort and application to study
demands no exertion of their own, since they are
merely so much plastic material to be moulded by
the teacher. <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>  And further owing to the general
pliability of childhood, they follow their instructors
with greater simplicity and without attempting to
measure their own progress: for as yet they do not
even appreciate the nature of their work. Finally, as
I have often noticed, the senses are less affected by
mere hard work than they are by hard thinking.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>  Moreover there will never be more time for such
studies, since at this age all progress is made through
listening to the teacher. Later when the boy has to
write by himself, or to produce and compose something out of his own head, he will neither have the time
nor the inclination for the exercises which we have
been discussing. <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>  Since, then, the teacher of literature
neither can nor ought to occupy the whole day, for
fear of giving his pupil a distaste for work, what are
the studies to which the spare time should preferably
be devoted? <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>  For I do not wish the student to wear

<pb id="p.199"/>

himself out in such pursuits: I would not have him sing
or learn to read music or dive deep into the minuter
details of geometry, nor need he be a finished actor in
his delivery or a dancer in his gesture: if I did demand all these accomplishments, there would yet be
time for them; the period allotted to education is
long, and I am not speaking of duller wits. <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>  Why did
Plato bear away the palm in all these branches of
knowledge which in my opinion the future orator
should learn? I answer, because he was not merely content with the teaching which Athens was able to provide or even with that of the Pythagoreans whom he
visited in Italy, but even approached the priests of
Egypt and made himself thoroughly acquainted with
all their secret lore.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="16"/>  The plea of the difficulty of the subject is put
forward merely to cloak our indolence, because we
do not love the work that lies before us nor seek to
win eloquence for our own because it is a noble art
and the fairest thing in all the world, but gird up
our loins for mercenary ends and for the winning of
filthy lucre. <milestone unit="section" n="17"/>  Without such accomplishments many may
speak in the courts and make an income; but it is
my prayer that every dealer in the vilest merchandise
may be richer than they and that the public crier
may find his voice a more lucrative possession. And
I trust that there is not one even among my readers
who would think of calculating the monetary value
of such studies. <milestone unit="section" n="18"/>  But he that has enough of the
divine spark to conceive the ideal eloquence, he who,
as the great tragic poet<note>Pacuvius (Ribbeck, 177).</note> says, regards <quote>oratory</quote> as
<quote>the queen of all the world</quote> and seeks not the transitory gains of advocacy, but those stable and lasting
rewards which his own soul and knowledge and

<pb id="p.201"/>

contemplation can give, <hi rend="italics">he</hi> will easily persuade himself to spend his time not, like so many, in the theatre
or in the Campus Martius, in dicing or in idle talk,
to say naught of the hours that are wasted in sleep
or long drawn banqueting, but in listening rather to
the geometrician and the teacher of music. For by
this he will win a richer harvest of delight than can
ever be gathered from the pleasures of the ignorant,
since among the many gifts of providence to man
not the least is this that the highest pleasure is the
child of virtue. <milestone unit="section" n="19"/>  But the attractions of my theme
have led me to say overmuch. Enough of those
studies in which a boy must be instructed, while he
is yet too young to proceed to greater things! My
next book will start afresh and will pass to the consideration of the duties of the teacher of rhetoric.</p></div1>



<pb id="p.205"/>

<div1 type="book" n="2"><head>Book II</head>


<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>THE custom has prevailed and is daily growing
commoner of sending boys to the schools of rhetoric
much later than is reasonable: this is always the
case as regards Latin rhetoric and occasionally
applies to Greek as well. The reason for this is
twofold: the rhetoricians, more especially our own,
have abandoned certain of their duties and the
teachers of literature have undertaken tasks which
rightly belong to others. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>  For the rhetorician considers that his duty is merely to declaim and give
instruction in the theory and practice of declamation
and confines his activities to deliberative and judicial
themes, regarding all others as beneath the dignity
of his profession; while the teacher of literature is
not satisfied to take what is left him (and we owe
him a debt of gratitude for this), but even presumes
to handle declamations in character and deliberative
themes,<note><hi rend="italics">suasoriae</hi> are declamations on deliberative themes (e.g.
Hannibal deliberates whether he should cross the Alps).</note> tasks which impose the very heaviest burden
on the speaker. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>  Consequently subjects which once
formed the first stages of rhetoric have come to
form the final stages of a literary education, and
boys who are ripe for more advanced study are kept
back in the inferior school and practise rhetoric
under the direction of teachers of literature. Thus
we get the absurd result that a boy is not regarded
as fit to go on to the schools of declamation till he
knows how to declaim.

<pb id="p.207"/>
</p>

<p>The two professions must each be assigned their
proper sphere. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>  <hi rend="italics">Grammatice,</hi> which we translate as
the science of letters, must learn to know its own
limits, especially as it has encroached so far beyond
the boundaries to which its unpretentious name
should restrict it and to which its earlier professors
actually confined themselves. Springing from a tiny
fountain-head, it has gathered strength from the
historians and critics and has swollen to the dimensions of a brimming river, since, not content with the
theory of correct speech, no inconsiderable subject,
it has usurped the study of practically all the highest
departments of knowledge. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>  On the other hand
rhetoric, which derives its name from the power of
eloquence, must not shirk its peculiar duties nor rejoice to see its own burdens shouldered by others.
For the neglect of these is little less than a surrender
of its birthright. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>  I will of course admit that there
may be a few professors of literature who have
acquired sufficient knowledge to be able to teach rhetoric as well; but when they do so, they are performing the duties of the rhetorician, not their own.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>  A further point into which we must enquire concerns the age at which a boy may be considered
sufficiently advanced to profit by the instructions of
the rhetorician. In this connexion we must consider
not the boy's actual age, but the progress he has
made in his studies. To put it briefly, I hold that
the best answer to the question <quote>When should a
boy be sent to the school of rhetoric?</quote> <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>  is this,
<quote>When he is fit.</quote> But this question is really dependent on that previously raised. For if the duties of
the teacher of literature are prolonged to include
instruction in deliberative declamation, this will

<pb id="p.209"/>

postpone the need for the rhetorician. On the other
hand if the rhetorician does not refuse to undertake
the first duties of his task, his instruction will be required from the moment the boy begins to compose
narratives and his first attempts at passages of praise
or denunciation. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>  We know that the orators of
earlier days improved their eloquence by declaiming
themes and common-places<note><hi rend="italics">communes loci</hi> = passages dealing with some general
principle or theme. For <hi rend="italics">theses</hi> see <milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>iv. 24.</note> and other forms of
rhetorical exercises not involving particular circumstances or persons such as provide the material for
real or imaginary causes.<note><hi rend="italics">controversiae</hi> are declamations on controversial or judicial
themes. A general rule or law is stated: then a special case,
which has to be solved in accordance with the law. An
abbreviated <hi rend="italics">controversia</hi> is to be found in I. x. 33, and they
occur frequently hereafter (cp. esp. <milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>vi. 96).</note> From this we can clearly
see what a scandalous dereliction of duty it is for
the schools of rhetoric to abandon this department
of their work, which was not merely its first, but
for a long time its sole task. <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>  What is there in
those exercises of which I have just spoken that
does not involve matters which are the special concern of rhetoric and further are typical of actual
legal cases? Have we not to narrate facts in
the law-courts? Indeed I am not sure that this is
not the most important department of rhetoric in
actual practice. <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>  Are not eulogy and denunciation
frequently introduced in the course of the contests
of the courts? Are not common-places frequently
inserted in the very heart of lawsuits, whether, like
those which we find in the works of Cicero, they are
directed against vice, or, like those published by
Quintus Hortensius, deal with questions of general
interest such as <quote>whether small points of argument should carry weight,</quote> or are employed to
defend or impugn the credibility of witnesses?
 <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>  These are weapons which we should always have
stored in our armoury ready for immediate use as
occasion may demand. The critic who denies that

<pb id="p.211"/>

such matters concern an orator is one who will
refuse to believe that a statue is being begun
when its limbs are actually being cast. Some will
think that I am in too great a hurry, but let no one
accuse me of thinking that the pupil who has been
entrusted to the rhetorician should forthwith be
withdrawn from the teacher of literature. <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>  The latter
will still have certain hours allotted him, and there
is no reason to fear that a boy will be overloaded by
receiving instruction from two different masters. It
will not mean any increase of work, but merely the
division among two masters of the studies which
were previously indiscriminately combined under one:
and the efficiency of either teacher will be increased.
This method is still in vogue among the Greeks, but
has been abandoned by us, not perhaps without some
excuse, as there were others ready to step into the
rhetorician's shoes.</p>

<p>II. As soon therefore as a boy has made sufficient
progress in his studies to be able to follow what I
have styled the first stage of instruction in rhetoric,
he should be placed under a rhetorician. Our first
task must be to enquire whether the teacher is of
good character. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>  The reason which leads me to deal
with this subject in this portion of my work is not
that I regard character as a matter of indifference
where other teachers are concerned, (I have already
shown how important I think it in the preceding
book), but that the age to which the pupil has now
attained makes the mention of this point especially
necessary. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>  For as a rule boys are on the verge of
manhood when transferred to the teacher of rhetoric
and continue with him even when they are young
men: consequently we must spare no effort to secure

<pb id="p.213"/>

that the purity of the teacher's character should
preserve those of tenderer years from corruption,
while its authority should keep the bolder spirits
from breaking out into licence. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>  Nor is it sufficient
that he should merely set an example of the highest
personal self-control; he must also be able to govern
the behaviour of his pupils by the strictness of his
discipline.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>  Let him therefore adopt a parental attitude to his
pupils, and regard himself as the representative of
those who have committed their children to his
charge. Let him be free from vice himself and
refuse to tolerate it in others. Let him be strict but
not austere, genial but not too familiar: for austerity
will make him unpopular, while familiarity breeds
contempt. Let his discourse continually turn on what
is good and honourable; the more he admonishes,
the less he will have to punish. He must control
his temper without however shutting his eyes to
faults requiring correction: his instruction must be
free from affectation, his industry great, his demands
on his class continuous, but not extravagant. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>  He
must be ready to answer questions and to put
them unasked to those who sit silent. In praising
the recitations of his pupils he must be neither
grudging nor over-generous: the former quality will
give them a distaste for work, while the latter will
produce a complacent self-satisfaction. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>  In correcting
faults he must avoid sarcasm and above all abuse:
for teachers whose rebukes seem to imply positive
dislike discourage industry. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>  He should declaim
daily himself and, what is more, without stint, that
his class may take his utterances home with them.
For however many models for imitation he may

<pb id="p.215"/>

give them from the authors they are reading, it will
still be found that fuller nourishment is provided by
the living voice, as we call it, more especially when
it proceeds from the teacher himself, who, if his
pupils are rightly instructed, should be the object
of their affection and respect. And it is scarcely
possible to say how much more readily we imitate
those whom we like.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>  I strongly disapprove of the prevailing practice of
allowing boys to stand up or leap from the seats in
the expression of their applause. Young men, even
when they are listening to others, should be
temperate in manifesting their approval. If this
be insisted upon, the pupil will depend on his
instructor's verdict and will take his approval as
a guarantee that he has spoken well. <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>  The worst
form of politeness, as it has come to be called, is
that of mutual and indiscriminate applause, a practice
which is unseemly, theatrical and unworthy of a
decently disciplined school, in addition to being the
worst foe to genuine study. For if every effusion is
greeted with a storm of ready-made applause, care
and industry come to be regarded as superfluous.
 <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>  The audience no less than the speaker should therefore keep their eyes fixed on their teacher's face, since
thus they will learn to distinguish between what is
praiseworthy and what is not: for just as writing
gives facility, so listening begets the critical
faculty. <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>  But in the schools of to-day we see boys
stooping forward ready to spring to their feet: at
the close of each period they not merely rise, but
rush forward with shouts of unseemly enthusiasm.
Such compliments are mutual and the success of a
declamation consists in this kind of applause. The

<pb id="p.217"/>

result is vanity and empty self-sufficiency, carried to
such an extent that, intoxicated by the wild enthusiasm of their fellow-pupils, they conceive a spite
against their master, if his praise does not come up
to their expectation. <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>  But teachers must also insist
on receiving an attentive and quiet hearing from the
class when they themselves declaim. For the
master should not speak to suit his pupil's standard,
but they should speak to suit his. Further he should,
if possible, keep his eyes open to note the points
which each boy praises and observe the manner in
which he expresses his approval, and should rejoice
that his words give pleasure not only for his own
sake, but for that of those who show sound judgment in their appreciation.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>  I do not approve of boys sitting mixed with young
men. For even if the teacher be such an one as we
should desire to see in charge of the morals and
studies of the young, and can keep his youthful
pupils under proper control, it is none the less
desirable to keep the weaker members separate from
the more mature, and to avoid not only the actual
charge of corruption but the merest suspicion of it.
 <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>  I have thought it worth while to put my views on
this subject quite briefly. For I do not think it
necessary even to warn the teacher that both he and
his school must be free from the grosser vices. And
should there be any father who does not trouble to
choose a teacher for his son who is free from the
obvious taint of immorality, he may rest assured
that all the other precepts, which I am attempting
to lay down for the benefit of our youth, will be
absolutely useless to him, if he neglects this.</p>

<p>III. I do not think that I should pass by in silence

<pb id="p.219"/>

even the opinion of those who, even when they
regard boys as ripe for the rhetorician, still do not
think that they should at once be placed under the
most eminent teacher available, but prefer to keep
them for a while under inferior masters, on the
ground that in the elementary stages a mediocre
instructor is easier to understand and to imitate, and
less reluctant to undertake the tiresome task of teaching the rudiments as being beneath his notice. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>  I do
not think that I need waste much time in pointing
out how much better it is to absorb the best possible
principles, or how hard it is to get rid of faults which
have once become engrained; for it places a double
burden on the shoulders of the later teacher and
the preliminary task of unteaching is harder than
that of teaching. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>  It is for this reason that the
famous piper Timotheus is said to have demanded
from those who had previously been under another
master a fee double the amount which he charged
for those who came to him untaught. The mistake
to which I am referring is, however, twofold. First
they regard these inferior teachers as adequate for
the time being and are content with their instruction
because they have a stomach that will swallow anything: <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>  this indifference, though blameworthy in
itself, would yet be tolerable, if the teaching provided
by these persons were merely less in quantity and
not inferior in quality as well. Secondly, and this
is a still commoner delusion, they think that those
who are blest with greater gifts of speaking will not
condescend to the more elementary details, and that
consequently they sometimes disdain to give attention to such inferior subjects of study and sometimes
are incapable of so doing. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>  For my part I regard the

<pb id="p.221"/>

teacher who is unwilling to attend to such details
as being unworthy of the name of teacher: and as
for the question of capacity, I maintain that it is the
most capable man who, given the will, is able to do
this with most efficiency. For in the first place it is a
reasonable inference that a man blest with abnormal
powers of eloquence will have made careful note of
the various steps by which eloquence is attained,
and in the second place the reasoning faculty, <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>  which
is specially developed in learned men, is all-important
in teaching, while finally no one is eminent in the
greater things of his art if he be lacking in the lesser.
Unless indeed we are asked to believe that while
Phidias modelled his Jupiter to perfection, the
decorative details of the statue would have been
better executed by another artist, or that an orator
does not know how to speak, or a distinguished
physician is incapable of treating minor ailments.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>  <quote>Yes</quote> it may be answered <quote>but surely you do not
deny that there is a type of eloquence that is
too great to be comprehended by undeveloped
boys?</quote> Of course there is. But this eloquent
teacher whom they fling in my face must be a
sensible man with a good knowledge of teaching and
must be prepared to stoop to his pupil's level, just as
a rapid walker, if walking with a small child, will
give him his hand and lessen his own speed and
avoid advancing at a pace beyond the powers of his
little companion. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>  Again it frequently happens that
the more learned the teacher, the more lucid and
intelligible is his instruction. For clearness is the
first virtue of eloquence, and the less talented a man
is, the more he will strive to exalt and dilate himself,
just as short men tend to walk on tip-toe and weak

<pb id="p.223"/>

men to use threats. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>  As for those whose style is
inflated or vicious, and whose language reveals a
passion for high-sounding words or labours under
any other form of affectation, in my opinion they
suffer not from excess of strength but of weakness,
like bodies swollen not with the plumpness of
health but with disease, or like men who weary of
the direct road betake them to bypaths. Consequently the worse a teacher is, the harder he will
be to understand.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>  I have not forgotten that I stated in the preceding book, when I urged that school was preferable
to home education, that pupils at the commencement of their studies, when progress is as yet
but in the bud, are more disposed to imitate their
schoolfellows than their masters, since such imitation
comes more easily to them. Some of my readers
may think that the view which I am now maintaining
is inconsistent with my previous statement. <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>  But I
am far from being inconsistent: for my previous
assertion affords the strongest reason for selecting the
very best teachers for our boys; since pupils of a
first rate master, having received a better training,
will when they speak say something that may be
worthy of imitation, while if they commit some
mistake, they will be promptly corrected. But the
incompetent teacher on the other hand is quite
likely to give his approval to faulty work and by the
judgment which he expresses to force approval
on the audience. <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>  The teacher should therefore be
as distinguished for his eloquence as for his good
character, and like Phoenix in the <hi rend="italics">Iliad</hi> be able to
teach his pupil both how to behave and how to
speak.

<pb id="p.225"/>
</p>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>I shall now proceed to indicate what I think
should be the first subjects in which the rhetorician
should give instruction, and shall postpone for a
time our consideration of the art of rhetoric in the
narrow sense in which that term is popularly used.
For in my opinion it is most desirable that we
should commence with something resembling the
subjects already acquired under the teacher of
literature.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>  Now there are three forms of narrative, without
counting the type used in actual legal cases. First
there is the fictitious narrative as we get it in
tragedies and poems, which is not merely not true
but has little resemblance to truth.<note>With special reference to the element of the miraculous.
Ovid's <hi rend="italics">Metamorphoses</hi> would give a good example.</note> Secondly, there
is the realistic narrative as presented by comedies,
which, though not true, has yet a certain verisimilitude. Thirdly there is the historical narrative, which
is an exposition of actual fact. Poetic narratives
are the property of the teacher of literature. The
rhetorician therefore should begin with the historical narrative, whose force is in proportion to its
truth. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>  I will, however, postpone my demonstration
of what I regard as the best method of narration
till I come to deal with narration as required in the
courts.<note>Book IV. chap. ii.</note> In the meantime, it will be sufficient to
urge that it should be neither dry nor jejune (for
why spend so much labour over our studies if a bald
and naked statement of fact is regarded as sufficiently
expressive?); nor on the other hand must it be
tortuous or revel in elaborate descriptions, such
as those in which so many are led to indulge
by a misguided imitation of poetic licence. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>  Both
these extremes are faults; but that which springs
from poverty of wit is worse than that which is due

<pb id="p.227"/>

to imaginative excess. For we cannot demand or
expect a perfect style from boys. But there is
greater promise in a certain luxuriance of mind, in
ambitious effort and an ardour that leads at times to
ideas bordering on the extravagant. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>  I have no objection to a little exuberance in the young learner.
Nay, I would urge teachers too like nurses to be
careful to provide softer food for still undeveloped
minds and to suffer them to take their fill of the milk
of the more attractive studies. For the time being
the body may be somewhat plump, but maturer years
will reduce it to a sparer habit. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>  Such plumpness
gives hope of strength; a child fully formed in
every limb is likely to grow up a puny weakling.
The young should be more daring and inventive
and should rejoice in their inventions, even though
correctness and severity are still to be acquired.
Exuberance is easily remedied, but barrenness is
incurable, be your efforts what they may. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>  To my
mind the boy who gives least promise is one in
whom the critical faculty develops in advance of the
imagination. I like to see the first fruits of the mind
copious to excess and almost extravagant in their
profusion. The years as they pass will skim off
much of the froth, reason will file away many
excrescences, and something too will be removed
by what I may perhaps call the wear and tear of
life, so long as there is sufficient material to admit
of cutting and chiselling away. And there will
be sufficient, if only we do not draw the plate too
thin to begin with, so that it runs the risk of being
broken if the graver cut too deep. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>  Those of my
readers who know their Cicero will not be surprised

<pb id="p.229"/>

that I take this view: for does he not say <quote>I would
have the youthful mind run riot in the luxuriance of
its growth</quote>?<note><hi rend="italics">de Or.</hi> i. xxi. 88.</note></p>
<p>We must, therefore, take especial care, above
all where boys are concerned, to avoid a dry
teacher, even as we avoid a dry and arid soil for
plants that are still young and tender. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>  For with
such a teacher their growth is stunted and their
eyes are turned earthwards, and they are afraid to
rise above the level of daily speech. Their leanness
is regarded as a sign of health and their weakness as
a sign of sound judgment, and while they are content that their work should be devoid of faults they
fall into the fault of being devoid of merit. So let
not the ripeness of vintage come too soon nor the
must turn harsh while yet in the vat; thus it will
last for years and mellow with age.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>  It is worth while too to warn the teacher that
undue severity in correcting faults is liable at times
to discourage a boy's mind from effort. He loses
hope and gives way to vexation, then last of all
comes to hate his work and fearing everything attempts nothing. <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>  This phenomenon is familiar to
farmers, who hold that the pruning-hook should not
be applied while the leaves are yet young, for they
seem to <quote>shrink from the steel</quote><note><hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> Verg. <hi rend="italics">G.</hi> ii. 369, <hi rend="italics">ante reformidat ferrum.</hi></note> and to be unable
as yet to endure a scar. <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>  The instructor therefore
should be as kindly as possible at this stage; remedies, which are harsh by nature, must be applied with
a gentle hand: some portions of the work must be
praised, others tolerated and others altered: the
reason for the alterations should however be given,
and in some cases the master will illumine an
obscure passage by inserting something of his own.

<pb id="p.231"/>

Occasionally again the teacher will find it useful to
dictate whole themes himself that the boy may
imitate them and for the time being love them as if
they were his own. <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>  But if a boy's composition is so
careless as not to admit of correction, I have found
it useful to give a fresh exposition of the theme and
to tell him to write it again, pointing out that he
was capable of doing better: for there is nothing
like hope for making study a pleasure. <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>  Different
ages however demand different methods: the task
set and the standard of correction must be proportioned to the pupil's strength. When boys ventured
on something that was too daring or exuberant, I
used to say to them that I approved of it for the
moment, but that the time would come when I
should no longer tolerate such a style. The result
was that the consciousness of ability filled them with
pleasure, without blinding their judgment.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>  However, to return to the point from which I had
digressed. Written narratives should be composed
with the utmost care. It is useful at first, when a
child has just begun to speak, to make him repeat
what he has heard with a view to improving his
powers of speech; and for the same purpose, and
with good reason, I would make him tell his story
from the end back to the beginning or start in the
middle and go backwards or forwards, but only so
long as he is at his teacher's knee and while he is
incapable of greater effort and is beginning to connect words and things, thereby strengthening the
memory. Even so when he is beginning to understand the nature of correct and accurate speech,
extempore effusions, improvised without waiting
for thought to supply the matter or a moment's

<pb id="p.233"/>

hesitation before rising to the feet, must not be permitted: they proceed from a passion for display that
would do credit to a common mountebank. <milestone unit="section" n="16"/>  Such
proceedings fill ignorant parents with senseless pride,
while the boys themselves lose all respect for their
work, adopt a conceited bearing, and acquire the
habit of speaking in the worst style and actually practising their faults, while they develop an arrogant conviction of their own talents which often proves fatal
even to the most genuine proficiency. <milestone unit="section" n="17"/>  There will be
a special time for acquiring fluency of speech and I
shall not pass the subject by unnoticed. For the meantime it will suffice if a boy, by dint of taking pains and
working as hard as his age will permit, manages to
produce something worthy of approval. Let him get
used to this until it becomes a second nature. It is
only he who learns to speak correctly before he can
speak with rapidity who will reach the heights that
are our goal or the levels immediately below them.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="18"/>  To narratives is annexed the task of refuting and
confirming them, styled <hi rend="italics">anaskeue</hi> and <hi rend="italics">kataskeue,</hi> from
which no little advantage may be derived. This may
be done not merely in connexion with fiction and
stories transmitted by the poets, but with the actual
records of history as well. For instance we may discuss the credibility of the story that a raven settled
on the head of Valerius in the midst of a combat and
with its wings and beak struck the eyes of the Gaul
who was his adversary, and a quantity of arguments
may be produced on either side: <milestone unit="section" n="19"/>  or we may discuss
the tradition that Scipio<note>See Aul. Gell. VII. i.</note> was begotten by a serpent,
or that Romulus was suckled by the she-wolf, or the
story of Numa and Egeria. As regards Greek history, it allows itself something very like poetic

<pb id="p.235"/>

licence. Again the time and place of some particular occurrence and sometimes even the persons concerned often provide matter for discussion: Livy for
instance is frequently in doubt as to what actually
occurred and historians often disagree.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="20"/>  From this our pupil will begin to proceed to more
important themes, such as the praise of famous men
and the denunciation of the wicked. Such tasks are
profitable in more than one respect. The mind is
exercised by the variety and multiplicity of the subject matter, while the character is moulded by the
contemplation of virtue and vice. Further wide
knowledge of facts is thus acquired, from which examples may be drawn if circumstances so demand,
such illustrations being of the utmost value in every
kind of case. <milestone unit="section" n="21"/>  It is but a step from this to practice
in the comparison of the respective merits of two
characters. This is of course a very similar theme
to the preceding, but involves a duplication of the
subject matter and deals not merely with the nature
of virtues and vices, but with their degree as well.
But the method to be followed in panegyric and invective will be dealt with in its proper place, as it
forms the third department of rhetoric.<note>Book III. chap. vii.</note></p>
<p> <milestone unit="section" n="22"/>  As to <hi rend="italics">commonplaces</hi> (I refer to those in which
we denounce vices themselves such as adultery,
gambling or profligacy without attacking particular persons), they come straight from the courts
and, if we add the name of the defendant, amount
to actual accusations. As a rule, however, the
general character of a commonplace is usually
given a special turn: for instance we make our
adulterer blind, our gambler poor and our profligate
far advanced in years. Sometimes too they entail

<pb id="p.237"/>

defence: <milestone unit="section" n="23"/>  for we may speak on behalf of luxury or
love, while a pimp or a parasite may be defended in
such a way that we appeal as counsel not for the
character itself, but to rebut some specific charge
that is brought against him.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="24"/>  <hi rend="italics">Theses</hi> on the other hand are concerned with
the comparison of things and involve questions such
as <quote>Which is preferable, town or country life?</quote>
or <quote>Which deserves the greatest praise, the lawyer
or the soldier?</quote> These provide the most attractive
and copious practice in the art of speaking, and are
most useful whether we have an eye to the duties
of deliberative oratory or the arguments of the
courts. For instance Cicero in his <hi rend="italics">pro Murena</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Pro Mur.</hi> ix. 21 <hi rend="italics">sqq.</hi></note> deals
very fully with the second of the two problems
mentioned above. <milestone unit="section" n="25"/>  Other <hi rend="italics">theses</hi> too belong entirely
to the deliberative class of oratory, as for instance
the questions as to <quote>Whether marriage is desirable</quote> or <quote>Whether a public career is a proper
object of ambition.</quote> Put such discussions into
the mouths of specific persons and they become
deliberative declamations at once.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="26"/>  My own teachers used to prepare us for conjectural cases by a form of exercise which was at once
useful and attractive: they made us discuss and
develop questions such as <quote>Why in Sparta is Venus
represented as wearing armour?</quote><note>The reason according to Lactantius (<hi rend="italics">Inst. Div.</hi> i. 20) was
the bravery of the Spartan women in one of the Messenian wars.</note> or <quote>Why is Cupid
believed to be a winged boy armed with arrows and
a torch?</quote> and the like. In these exercises our aim
was to discover the intention implied, a question
which frequently occurs in controversial declamations.
Such themes may perhaps be regarded as a kind of
<hi rend="italics">chria</hi> or moral essay.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="27"/>  That certain topics such as the question as to

<pb id="p.239"/>

whether we should always believe a witness or
whether we should rely on circumstantial evidence,
are part and parcel of actual forensic pleading is so
obvious that certain speakers, men too who have
held civil office with no small distinction, have
written out passages dealing with such themes, committed them to memory and kept them ready for
immediate use, with a view to employing them when
occasion arose as a species of ornament to be inserted
into their extempore speeches. <milestone unit="section" n="28"/>  This practice&mdash;
for I am not going to postpone expressing my judgment on it&mdash;I used to regard a confession of extreme weakness. For how can such men find appropriate arguments in the course of actual cases which
continually present new and different features?
How can they answer the points that their opponents
may bring up? how deal a rapid counterstroke in
debate or cross-examine a witness? if, even in those
matters which are of common occurrence and crop
up in the majority of cases, they cannot give expression to the most familiar thoughts except in words
prepared so far in advance. <milestone unit="section" n="29"/>  And when they produce
the same passage in a number of different cases, they
must come to loathe it like food that has grown cold
or stale, and they can hardly avoid a feeling of shame
at displaying this miserable piece of furniture to an
audience whose memory must have detected it so
many times already: like the furniture of the
ostentatious poor, it is sure to shew signs of wear
through being used for such a variety of different
purposes. <milestone unit="section" n="30"/>  Also it must be remembered that there
is hardly a single commonplace of such universal
application that it will fit any actual case, unless
some special link is provided to connect it with

<pb id="p.241"/>

the subject: otherwise it will seem to have been
tacked on to the speech, not interwoven in its
texture, <milestone unit="section" n="31"/>  either because it is out of keeping with the
circumstances or like most of its kind is inappropriately
employed not because it is wanted, but because it is
ready for use. Some speakers, for example, introduce
the most long-winded commonplaces just for the sake
of the sentiments they contain, whereas rightly the
sentiments should spring from the context. <milestone unit="section" n="32"/>  Such
disquisitions are at once ornamental and useful, only if
they arise from the nature of the case. But the most
finished eloquence, unless it tend to the winning of
the case, is to say the least superfluous and may even
defeat its own purpose. However I must bring this
digression to a close.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="33"/>  The praise or denunciation of laws requires greater
powers; indeed they should almost be equal to the
most serious tasks of rhetoric. The answer to the
question as to whether this exercise is more nearly
related to deliberative or controversial oratory
depends on custom and law and consequently varies
in different states. Among the Greeks the proposer
of a law was called upon to set forth his case before
a judge,<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> a court of <hi rend="italics">nomothetae</hi> appointed by the Athenian
assembly, who examined the provisions of the proposed law.</note> while in Rome it was the custom to urge
the acceptance or rejection of a law before the public
assembly. But in any case the arguments advanced
in such cases are few in number and of a definite
type. For there are only three kinds of law, <hi rend="italics">sacred,
public</hi> and <hi rend="italics">private.</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="34"/>  This division is of rhetorical value
chiefly when a law is to be praised. For example the
orator may advance from praise to praise by a series of
gradations, praising an enactment first because it is
<hi rend="italics">law,</hi> secondly because it is <hi rend="italics">public,</hi> and, finally, designed
for the support of <hi rend="italics">religion.</hi> As regards the questions

<pb id="p.243"/>

which generally arise, they are common to all cases.
 <milestone unit="section" n="35"/>  Doubts may be raised as to whether the mover is
legally in a position to propose a law, as happened in
the case of Publius Clodius, whose appointment as
tribune of the plebs was alleged to be unconstitutional.<note>Clodius was a patrician and got himself made a plebeian
by adoption to enable him to hold the tribunate. The
question of the legality of this procedure is discussed by
Cicero in the <hi rend="italics">de Domo,</hi> 13&ndash;17.</note> Or the legality of the proposal itself may
be impugned in various ways; it may for instance be
urged that the law was not promulgated within
seventeen<note>Lit. within the space of three market-days. <hi rend="italics">nundinum</hi>
=9 days, the second market-day being the ninth, and
forming the last day of the first <hi rend="italics">nundinum</hi> and the first of the second. Similarly the third market-day is the last day
of the second <hi rend="italics">nundinum</hi> and the first of the third.</note> days, or was proposed, or is being proposed on an improper day, or in defiance of the
tribunicial veto or the auspices or any other legal
obstacle, or again that it is contrary to some existing law. <milestone unit="section" n="36"/>  But such points are not suitable to
elementary rhetorical exercises, which are not concerned with persons, times or particular cases.
Other subjects, whether the dispute be real or fictitious, are generally treated on the following lines.
 <milestone unit="section" n="37"/>  The fault must lie either in the words or the
matter. As regards the words, the question will
be whether they are sufficiently clear or contain
some ambiguity, and as regards the matter whether
the law is consistent with itself or should be retrospective or apply to special individuals. The point
however which is most commonly raised is the
question whether the law is right or expedient. <milestone unit="section" n="38"/>  I
am well aware that many rhetoricians introduce a
number of sub-divisions in connexion with this latter
enquiry. I however include under the term <hi rend="italics">right</hi>
all such qualities as justice, piety and religion.
Justice is however usually discussed under various
aspects. A question may be raised about the acts
with which the law is concerned, as to whether they

<pb id="p.245"/>

deserve punishment or reward or as to the degree of
punishment or reward that should be assigned, since
excess in either direction is open to criticism. <milestone unit="section" n="39"/>  Again
expediency is sometimes determined by the nature
of things, sometimes by the circumstances of the time.
Another common subject of controversy is whether
a law can be enforced, while one must not shut one's
eyes to the fact that exception is sometimes taken
to laws in their entirety, but sometimes only in
part, examples of both forms of criticism being
found in famous speeches. <milestone unit="section" n="40"/>  I am well aware, too,
that there are laws which are not proposed with
a view to perpetuity, but are concerned with temporary honours or commands, such as the <hi rend="italics">lex Manilia</hi><note>The <hi rend="italics">lex Manilia</hi> proposed to give Pompey the command
against Mithridates.</note>
which is the subject of one of Cicero's speeches.
This however is not the place for instructions on
this topic, since they depend on the special circumstances of the matters under discussion, not on their
general characteristics.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="41"/>  Such were the subjects on which the ancients as
a rule exercised their powers of speaking, though
they called in the assistance of the logicians as well
to teach them the theory of argument. For it is
generally agreed that the declamation of fictitious
themes in imitation of the questions that arise in
the law courts or deliberative assemblies came into
vogue among the Greeks about the time of Demetrius of Phalerum. <milestone unit="section" n="42"/>  Whether this type of exercise was actually invented by him I have failed to
discover, as I have acknowledged in another work.<note>Probably the lost treatise on <quote>The causes of the
decline of oratory</quote> (<hi rend="italics">De causis corruptae eloquentiae).</hi></note>
But not even those who most strongly assert his
claim to be the inventor, can produce any adequate
authority in support of their opinion. As regards
Latin teachers of rhetoric, of whom Plotius was the

<pb id="p.247"/>

most famous, Cicero<note>See Cic. <hi rend="italics">de Or.</hi> iii. 24, 93.</note> informs us that they came into
existence towards the end of the age of Crassus.</p>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>I will speak of the theory of declamation a
little later. In the mean time, as we are discussing
the elementary stages of a rhetorical education, I
think I should not fail to point out how greatly the
rhetorician will contribute to his pupils' progress, if
he imitates the teacher of literature whose duty it is
to expound the poets, and gives the pupils whom he
has undertaken to train, instruction in the reading
of history and still more of the orators. I myself
have adopted this practice for the benefit of a few
pupils of suitable age whose parents thought it
would be useful. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>  But though my intentions were
excellent, I found that there were two serious obstacles to success: long custom had established a
different method of teaching, and my pupils were
for the most part full-grown youths who did not
require this form of teaching, but were taking my
work as their model. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>  However, the fact that I
have been somewhat late in making the discovery is
not a reason why I should be ashamed to recommend
it to those who come after me. I now know that this
form of teaching is practised by the Greeks, but is
generally entrusted to assistants, as the professors
themselves consider that they have no time to give
individual instruction to each pupil as he reads. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/> And I admit that the form of lecture which this
requires, designed as it is to make boys follow the
written word with ease and accuracy, and even that
which aims at teaching the meaning of any rare
words that may occur, are to be regarded as quite
below the dignity of the teacher of rhetoric. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>  On
the other hand it is emphatically part of his

<pb id="p.249"/>

prosession and the undertaking which he makes in
offering himself as a teacher of eloquence, to point
out the merits of authors or, for that matter, any
faults that may occur: and this is all the more the
case, as I am not asking teachers to undertake the
task of recalling their pupils to standat their knee once
more and of assisting them in the reading of whatever book they may select. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>  It seems to me at once
an easier and more profitable method to call for
silence and choose some one pupil&mdash;and it will be
best to select them by turns&mdash;to read aloud, in
order that they may at the same time learn the
correct method of elocution. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>  The case with which
the speech selected for reading is concerned should
then be explained, for if this be done they will
have a clearer understanding of what is to be read.
When the reading is commenced, no important
point should be allowed to pass unnoticed either
as regards the resourcefulness or the style shown
in the treatment of the subject: the teacher must
point out how the orator seeks to win the favour
of the judge in his <hi rend="italics">exordium,</hi> what clearness, brevity
and sincerity, and at times what shrewd design and
well-concealed artifice is shown in the statement of
facts. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>  For the only true art in pleading is that
which can only be understood by one who is a
master of the art himself. The teacher will proceed
further to demonstrate what skill is shown in the division into heads, how subtle and frequent are the thrusts
of argument, what vigour marks the stirring and
what charm the soothing passage, how fierce is the
invective and how full of wit the jests, and in
conclusion how the orator establishes his sway
over the emotions of his audience, forces his way

<pb id="p.251"/>

into their very hearts and brings the feelings of the
jury into perfect sympathy with all his words.
 <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>  Finally as regards the style, he will emphasise the
appropriateness, elegance or sublimity of particular
words, will indicate where the amplification of the
theme is deserving of praise and where there is
virtue in a diminuendo; and will call attention to
brilliant metaphors, figures of speech and passages
combining smoothness and polish with a general
impression of manly vigour.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>  It will even at times be of value to read speeches
which are corrupt and faulty in style, but still meet
with general admiration thanks to the perversity of
modern tastes, and to point out how many expressions in them are inappropriate, obscure, high-flown,
grovelling, mean, extravagant or effeminate, although
they are not merely praised by the majority of critics,
but, worse still, praised just because they are bad. <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>  For
we have come to regard direct and natural speech
as incompatible with genius, while all that is in any
way abnormal is admired as exquisite. Similarly we
see that some people place a higher value on figures
which are in any way monstrous or distorted than
they do on those who have not lost any of the advantages of the normal form of man. <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>  There are
even some who are captivated by the shams of artifice
and think that there is more beauty in those who
pluck out superfluous hair or use depilatories, who
dress their locks by scorching them with the curling
iron and glow with a complexion that is not their
own, than can ever be conferred by nature pure and
simple, so that it really seems as if physical beauty
depended entirely on moral hideousness.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>  It will, however, be the duty of the rhetorician

<pb id="p.253"/>

not merely to teach these things, but to ask frequent
questions as well, and test the critical powers of his
class. This will prevent his audience from becoming
inattentive and will secure that his words do not fall
on deaf ears. At the same time the class will be led
to find out things for themselves and to use their
intelligence, which is after all the chief aim of this
method of training. For what else is our object in
teaching, save that our pupils should not always
require to be taught? <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>  I will venture to say that
this particular form of exercise, if diligently pursued,
will teach learners more than all the text-books of
all the rhetoricians: these are no doubt of very
considerable use, but being somewhat general in
their scope, it is quite impossible for them to deal
with all the special cases that are of almost daily
occurrence. <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>  The art of war will provide a parallel:
it is no doubt based on certain general principles,
but it will none the less be far more useful to know
the methods employed, whether wisely or the reverse, by individual generals under varying circumstances and conditions of time and place. For there
are no subjects in which, as a rule, practice is not
more valuable than precept. <milestone unit="section" n="16"/>  Is a teacher to declaim
to provide a model for his audience, and will not
more profit be derived from the reading of Cicero or
Demosthenes? Is a pupil to be publicly corrected
if he makes a mistake in declaiming, and will it not
be more useful, and more agreeable too, to correct
some actual speech? For everyone has a preference
for hearing the faults of others censured rather than
his own. I might say more on the subject. <milestone unit="section" n="17"/>  But
every one can see the advantages of this method.
Would that the reluctance to put it into practice

<pb id="p.255"/>

were not as great as the pleasure that would undoubtedly be derived from so doing!</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="18"/>  This method once adopted, we are faced by the
comparatively easy question as to what authors
should be selected for our reading. Some have recommended authors of inferior merit on the ground
that they were easier to understand. Others on the
contrary would select the more florid school of writers
on the ground that they are likely to provide the
nourishment best suited to the minds of the young.
 <milestone unit="section" n="19"/>  For my part I would have them read the best authors
from the very beginning and never leave them,
choosing those, however, who are simplest and most
intelligible. For instance, when prescribing for boys,
I should give Livy the preference over Sallust;
for, although the latter is the greater historian,
one requires to be well-advanced in one's studies
to appreciate him properly. <milestone unit="section" n="20"/>  Cicero, in my opinion,
provides pleasant reading for beginners and is sufficiently easy to understand: it is possible not only
to learn much from him, but to come to love him.
After Cicero I should, following the advice of Livy,
place such authors as most nearly resemble him.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="21"/>  There are two faults of taste against which boys
should be guarded with the utmost care. Firstly
no teacher suffering from an excessive admiration
of antiquity, should be allowed to cramp their
minds by the study of Cato and the Gracchi and
other similar authors. For such reading will give
them a harsh and bloodless style, since they will as
yet be unable to understand the force and vigour of
these authors, and contenting themselves with a
style which doubtless was admirable in its day, but
is quite unsuitable to ours, will come to think (and

<pb id="p.257"/>

nothing could be more fatal) that they really resemble great men. <milestone unit="section" n="22"/>  Secondly the opposite extreme must
be equally avoided: they must not be permitted to
fall victims to the pernicious allurements of the
precious blooms produced by our modern euphuists,
thus acquiring a passion for the luscious sweetness
of such authors, whose charm is all the more attractive to boyish intellects because it is so easy of
achievement. <milestone unit="section" n="23"/>  Once, however, the judgment is
formed and out of danger of perversion, I should
strongly recommend the reading of ancient authors,
since if, after clearing away all the uncouthness of
those rude ages, we succeed in absorbing the robust
vigour and virility of their native genius, our more
finished style will shine with an added grace:
I also approve the study of the moderns at
this stage, since even they have many merits.
 <milestone unit="section" n="24"/>  For nature has not doomed us to be dullards,
but we have altered our style of oratory and indulged our caprices over much. It is in their ideals
rather than their talents that the ancients show
themselves our superiors. It will therefore be
possible to select much that is valuable from modern
writers, but we must take care that the precious
metal is not debased by the dross with which it is
so closely intermingled. <milestone unit="section" n="25"/>  Further I would not
merely gladly admit, but would even contend that
we have recently had and still have certain authors
who deserve imitation in their entirety. <milestone unit="section" n="26"/>  But it is
not for everyone to decide who these writers are.
Error in the choice of earlier authors is attended
with less danger, and I have therefore postponed
the study of the moderns, for fear that we should
imitate them before we are qualified to judge of
their merits.

<pb id="p.259"/>
</p>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>I come now to another point in which the
practice of teachers has differed. Some have not been
content with giving directions as to the arrangement of the subjects set them as themes for
declamation, but have developed them at some
length themselves, supplying not merely the proofs,
but the lines upon which the emotional passages
should proceed. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>  Others have merely suggested a
bare outline, and then when the declamations were
over, have indicated the points missed by each
speaker and worked up certain passages with no less
care than they would have used, had they been going
to stand up to speak themselves. Both practices
have their advantages, and therefore I will not give
either the pre-eminence. But if we must choose one
of the two, it will be found more profitable to point
out the right road at the outset, and not merely to
recall the pupil from his error when he has already
gone astray, <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>  since in the first place the correction
is only received by the ear, whereas when he is
given a sketch of the various heads of the declamation, he has to take them down and think about
them: secondly instruction is always more readily
received than reproof. Indeed those of our pupils
who have a lively disposition are liable in the
present condition of manners to lose their temper
when admonished and to offer silent resistance.
 <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>  That, however, is no reason for refraining from
the public correction of faults; for we must take
the rest of the class into account, who will believe
that whatever has not been corrected by the master
is right. The two methods should be employed
conjointly and in such a way as circumstances may
demand. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>  Beginners must be given a subject

<pb id="p.261"/>

sketched out ready for treatment and suitable to
their respective powers. But when they show that
they have formed themselves sufficiently closely on
the models placed before them, it will be sufficient
to give them a few brief hints for their guidance
and to allow them to advance trusting in their own
strength and without external support. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>  Sometimes
they should be left entirely to their own devices,
that they may not be spoilt by the bad habit of
always relying on another's efforts, and so prove incapable of effort and originality. But as soon as
they seem to have acquired a sound conception of
what they ought to say, the teacher's work will be
near completion: if they still make some mistakes,
they must be brought back under his guidance. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>  We
may draw a lesson from the birds of the air, whom
we see distributing the food which they have collected in their bills among their weak and helpless
nestlings; but as soon as they are fledged, we see
them teaching their young to leave the nest and fly
round about it, themselves leading the way; finally,
when they have proved their strength, they are given
the freedom of the open sky and left to trust in
themselves.</p>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>There is one practice at present in vogue
for boys of the age under discussion, which ought
in my opinion undoubtedly to be changed. They
should not be forced to commit all their own compositions to memory and to deliver them on an
appointed day, as is at present the custom. This
practice is especially popular with the boys' fathers,
who think that their sons are not really studying
unless they declaim on every possible occasion,
although as a matter of fact progress depends

<pb id="p.263"/>

mainly on industry. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>  For though I strongly approve of boys writing compositions and would have
them spend as much time as possible over such
tasks, I had much rather that for the purpose of
learning by heart passages should be selected from
the orators or historians or any other works that
may be deserving of such attention. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>  For it is a
better exercise for the memory to learn the words
of others than it is to learn one's own, and those
who have practised this far harder task will find
no difficulty in committing to memory their own
compositions with which they are already familiar.
Further they will form an intimate acquaintance
with the best writings, will carry their models
with them and unconsciously reproduce the style
of the speech which has been impressed upon the
memory. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>  They will have a plentiful and choice
vocabulary and a command of artistic structure and
a supply of figures which will not have to be
hunted for, but will offer themselves spontaneously from the treasure-house, if I may so call it,
in which they are stored. In addition they will
be in the agreeable position of being able to
quote the happy sayings of the various authors, a
power which they will find most useful in the
courts. For phrases which have not been coined
merely to suit the circumstances of the lawsuit of
the moment carry greater weight and often win
greater praise than if they were our own. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>  I
would however allow boys occasionally to declaim
their own compositions that they may reap the reward of their labours in the applause of a large
audience, that most coveted of all prizes. But this
should not be permitted until they have produced

<pb id="p.265"/>

something more finished than usual: they will thus
be rewarded for their industry and rejoice in the
thought that the privilege accorded them is the
recompense of merit.</p>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It is generally and not unreasonably regarded
as the sign of a good teacher that he should be able
to differentiate between the abilities of his respective
pupils and to know their natural bent. The gifts of
nature are infinite in their variety, and mind differs
from mind almost as much as body from body. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>  This
is clear from a consideration of the orators themselves, who differ in style to such an extent that no
one is like another, in spite of the fact that numbers
have modelled their style on that of their favorite
authors. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>  Many again think it useful to direct their
instruction to the fostering of natural advantages and
to guide the talents of their pupils along the lines
which they instinctively tend to follow. Just as an
expert gymnast, when he enters a gymnasium full of
boys, after testing body and mind in every way, is
able to decide for what class of athletic contest they
should be trained, even so, they say, <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>  a teacher of
oratory after careful observation of a boy's stylistic
preferences, be they for terseness and polish, energy,
dignity, charm, roughness, brilliance or wit, will so
adapt his instructions to individual needs that each
pupil will be pushed forward in the sphere for which
his talents seem specially to design him; <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>  for nature,
when cultivated, goes from strength to strength,
while he who runs counter to her bent is ineffective
in those branches of the art for which he is less
suited and weakens the talents which he seemed
born to employ. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>  Now, since the critic who is
guided by his reason is free to dissent even from

<pb id="p.267"/>

received opinions, I must insist that to my thinking this view is only partially true. It is undoubtedly necessary to note the individual gifts of
each boy, <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>  and no one would ever convince me
that it is not desirable to differentiate courses of
study with this in view. One boy will be better
adapted for the study of history, another for poetry,
another for law, while some perhaps had better be
packed off to the country. The teacher of rhetoric
will distinguish such special aptitudes, just as our
gymnast will turn one pupil into a runner, another
into a boxer or wrestler or an expert at some other
of the athletic accomplishments for which prizes are
awarded at the sacred games. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>  But on the other
hand, he who is destined for the bar must study not
one department merely, but must perfect himself in
all the accomplishments which his profession demands, even though some of them may seem too hard
for him when he approaches them as a learner. For if
natural talent alone were sufficient, education might
be dispensed with. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>  Suppose we are given a pupil
who, like so many, is of depraved tastes and swollen
with his own conceit; shall we suffer him to go his
own sweet way? If a boy's disposition is naturally
dry and jejune, ought we not to feed it up or at any
rate clothe it in fairer apparel? For, if in some cases
it is necessary to remove certain qualities, surely
there are others where we may be permitted to add
what is lacking. <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>  Not that I would set myself against
the will of nature. No innate good quality should be
neglected, but defects must be made good and weaknesses made strong. <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>  When Isocrates, the prince of
instructors, whose works proclaim his eloquence no
less than his pupils testify to his excellence as a

<pb id="p.269"/>

teacher, gave his opinion of Ephorus and Theopompus
to the effect that the former needed the spur and the
latter the curb, what was his meaning? Surely not
that the sluggish temperament of the one and the
headlong ardour of the other alike required modification by instruction, but rather that each would gain
from an admixture of the qualities of the other.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>  In the case of weaker understandings however some
concession must be made and they should be directed
merely to follow the call of their nature, since thus
they will be more effective in doing the only thing
that lies in their power. But if we are fortunate
enough to meet with richer material, such as justifies
us in the hope of producing a real orator, we must
leave no oratorical virtue uncared for. <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>  For though he
will necessarily have a natural bent for some special
department of oratory, he will not feel repelled by
the others, and by sheer application will develop his
other qualities until they equal those in which he
naturally excels. The skilled gymnast will once again
provide us with a parallel: if he undertakes to train
a pancratiast,<note>The <hi rend="italics">pancration</hi> was a mixture of wrestling and boxing.</note> he will not merely teach him how
to use his fists or his heels, nor will he restrict
his instructions to the holds in wrestling, giving
special attention to certain tricks of this kind,
but will train him in every department of the
science. Some will no doubt be incapable of attaining proficiency in certain exercises; these must
specialise on those which lie within their powers.
 <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>  For there are two things which he must be most
careful to avoid: first, he must not attempt the impossible, secondly he must not switch off his pupil
from what he can do well to exercises for which he is
less well suited. But if his pupil is like the famous

<pb id="p.271"/>

Nicostratus, whom we saw when he was old and we
were boys, he will train him equally in every department of the science and will make him a champion
both in boxing and wrestling, like Nicostratus himself
who won the prize for both contests within a few days
of each other. <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>  And how much more important is the
employment of such methods where our future orator
is concerned! It is not enough to be able to speak
with terseness, subtlety or vehemence, any more than
it would be for a singing master to excel in the upper,
middle or lower register only, or in particular sections
of these registers alone. Eloquence is like a harp
and will never reach perfection, unless all its strings
be taut and in tune.</p>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Though I have spoken in some detail of the
duties of the teacher, I shall for the moment confine
my advice to the learners to one solitary admonition,
that they should love their masters not less than
their studies, and should regard them as the parents
not indeed of their bodies but of their minds. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>  Such
attachments are of invaluable assistance to study.
For under their influence they find it a pleasure to
listen to their teachers, believe what they say and
long to be like them, come cheerfully and gladly to
school, are not angry when corrected, rejoice when
praised, and seek to win their master's affection by
the devotion with which they pursue their studies. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For as it is the duty of the master to teach, so it is
the duty of the pupil to show himself teachable. The
two obligations are mutually indispensable. And just
as it takes two parents to produce a human being,
and as the seed is scattered in vain, if the ground is
hard and there is no furrow to receive it and bring it
to growth, even so eloquence can never come to

<pb id="p.273"/>

maturity, unless teacher and taught are in perfect
sympathy.</p>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>These elementary stages are in themselves
no small undertaking, but they are merely members
and portions of the greater whole; when therefore
the pupil has been thoroughly instructed and exercised in these departments, the time will as a rule
have come for him to attempt deliberative and
forensic themes. But before I begin to discuss
these, I must say a few words on the theory of
declamation, which is at once the most recent and
most useful of rhetorical exercises. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>  For it includes
practically all the exercises of which we have been
speaking and is in close touch with reality. As a
result it has acquired such a vogue that many think
that it is the sole training necessary to the formation
of an orator, since there is no excellence in a formal
speech which is not also to be found in this type of
rhetorical exercise. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>  On the other hand the actual
practice of declamation has degenerated to such an
extent owing to the fault of our teachers, that it has
come to be one of the chief causes of the corruption
of modern oratory; such is the extravagance and
ignorance of our declaimers. But it is possible to
make a sound use of anything that is naturally sound.
 <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>  The subjects chosen for themes should, therefore, be
as true to life as possible, and the actual declamation
should, as far as may be, be modelled on the pleadings for which it was devised as a training. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>  For we
shall hunt in vain among <hi rend="italics">sponsions</hi><note><hi rend="italics">sponsio (=</hi> a wager) was a form of lawsuit in which the
litigant promised to pay a certain sum of money if he lost
his case. The <hi rend="italics">interdict</hi> was an order issued by the praetor
commanding or prohibiting certain action. It occurred
chiefly in disputes about property.</note> and <hi rend="italics">interdicts</hi>
for magicians and plagues and oracles and stepmothers more cruel than any in tragedy, and other

<pb id="p.275"/>

subjects still more unreal than these.<note>The themes of the <hi rend="italics">controversiae</hi> often turned on the
supernatural and on crimes and incidents such as rarely or
never occur in actual life.</note> What then?
are we never to permit young men to handle unreal
or, to be more accurate, poetic themes that they may
run riot and exult in their strength and display their
full stature? <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>  It were best to prohibit them absolutely.
But at any rate the themes, however swelling and
magnificent, should not be such as to seem foolish
and laughable to the eye of an intelligent observer.
Consequently, if we must make some concession, let
us allow the declaimer to gorge himself occasionally, as long as he realises that his case will be like
that of cattle that have blown themselves out with a
surfeit of green food: they are cured of their disorder
by blood-letting and then put back to food such as
will maintain their strength; similarly the declaimer
must be rid of his superfluous fat, and his corrupt
humours must be discharged, if he wants to be
strong and healthy. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>  Otherwise, the first time he
makes any serious effort, his swollen emptiness will
stand revealed. Those, however, who hold that
declamation has absolutely nothing in common with
pleading in the courts, are clearly quite unaware of
the reasons which gave rise to this type of exercise.
 <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>  For if declamation is not a preparation for the actual
work of the courts, it can only be compared to the
rant of an actor or the raving of a lunatic. For what
is the use of attempting to conciliate a non-existent
judge, or of stating a case which all know to be
false, or of trying to prove a point on which judgment will never be passed? Such waste of effort
is, however, a comparative trifle. But what can be
more ludicrous than to work oneself into a passion
and to attempt to excite the anger or grief of
our hearers, unless we are preparing ourselves by

<pb id="p.277"/>

such mimic combats for the actual strife and the
pitched battles of the law-courts? <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>  Is there then no
difference between our declamations and genuine
forensic oratory? I can only reply, that if we speak
with a desire for improvement, there will be no
difference. [ wish indeed that certain additions
could be made to the existing practice; that we made
use of names, that our fictitious debates dealt with
more complicated cases and sometimes took longer
to deliver, that we were less afraid of words drawn
from everyday speech and that we were in the habit
of seasoning our words with jests. For as regards
all these points, we are mere novices when we come
to actual pleading, however elaborate the training
that the schools have given us on other points. <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>  And
even if display is the object of declamation, surely
we ought to unbend a little for the entertainment of
our audience. <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>  For even in those speeches which,
although undoubtedly to some extent concerned
with the truth, are designed to charm the multitude (such for instance as panegyrics and the oratory
of display in all its branches), it is permissible to
be more ornate and not merely to disclose all the
resources of our art, which in cases of law should as
a rule be concealed, but actually to flaunt them
before those who have been summoned to hear us.
 <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>  Declamation therefore should resemble the truth,
since it is modelled on forensic and deliberative
oratory. On the other hand it also involves an
element of display, and should in consequence
assume a certain air of elegance. <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>  In this connexion
I may cite the practice of comic actors, whose delivery is not exactly that of common speech, since
that would be inartistic, but is on the other hand not

<pb id="p.279"/>

far removed from the accents of nature, for, if it were,
their mimicry would be a failure: what they do therefore is to exalt the simplicity of ordinary speech
by a touch of stage decoration. <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>  So too we shall
have to put up with certain inconveniences arising
from the nature of our fictitious themes; such drawbacks occur more especially in connexion with those
numerous details which are left uncertain and which
we presume to suit our purpose, such as the ages of
our characters, their wealth, their families, or the
strength, laws and manners of the cities where our
scenes are laid, and the like. <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>  Sometimes we even
draw arguments from the actual flaws of the assumptions involved by the theme. But each of these
points shall be dealt with in its proper place. For
although the whole purpose of this work is the
formation of an orator, I have no intention of passing
over anything that has a genuine connexion with the
practice of the schools, for fear that students may
complain of the omission.</p>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>I have now arrived at the point when I must
begin to deal with that portion of the art at which
those who have omitted the preceding stages generally commence. I can see, however, that certain
critics will attempt to obstruct my path at the very
outset: for they will urge that eloquence can dispense with rules of this kind and, in smug satisfaction with themselves and the ordinary methods
and exercises of the schools, will laugh at me for
my pains; in which they will be only following the
example of certain professors of no small reputation.
One of these gentlemen, I believe, when asked to
define a <hi rend="italics">figure</hi> and a <hi rend="italics">thought,</hi> replied that he did not
know what they were, but that, if they had anything

<pb id="p.281"/>

to do with the subject, they would be found in
his declamation. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>  Another when asked whether he
was a follower of Theodorus or Apollodorus, replied,
<quote>Oh! as for me, I am all for the Thracians.</quote><note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> I care naught for your rival schools of rhetoric. I
give all my favour to the men armed with the buckler (the
gladiators known as <hi rend="italics">Thraces).</hi> Such contests of the amphitheatre interest me far more than the contests between rival
schools of rhetoric.</note>
To do him justice, he could hardly have found a
neater way to avoid confessing his ignorance. These
persons, just because, thanks to their natural gifts,
they are regarded as brilliant performers and have,
as a matter of fact, uttered much that deserves to
be remembered, think that, while most men share
their careless habits, few come near them for talent.
 <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>  Consequently they make it their boast that they
speak on impulse and owe their success to their
native powers; they further assert that there is no
need of proof or careful marshalling of facts when
we are speaking on fictitious themes, but only of
some of those sounding epigrams, the expectation of
which has filled the lecture-room; and these they
say are best improvised on the spur of the moment.
 <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>  Further, owing to their contempt for method, when
they are meditating on some future effusion, they
spend whole days looking at the ceiling in the hope
that some magnificent inspiration may occur to
them, or rock their bodies to and fro, booming
inarticulately as if they had a trumpet inside them
and adapting their agitated movements, not to the
delivery of the words, but to their pursuit. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>  Some
again settle on certain definite openings long before they have thought what they are going to say,
with a view to using them as pegs for subsequent
snatches of eloquence, and then after practising
their delivery first in silent thought and then
aloud for hours together, in utter desperation of
providing any connecting links, abandon them and

<pb id="p.283"/>

take refuge in one formula after another, each no
less hackneyed and familiar than the last. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>  The
least unreasonable of them devote their attention not to the actual cases, but to their purple
patches, in the composition of which they pay no
attention to the subject-matter, but fire off a series
of isolated thoughts just as they happen to come to
hand. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>  The result is a speech which, being composed of disconnected passages having nothing in
common with each other, must necessarily lack
cohesion and can only be compared to a schoolboy's
notebook, in which he jots down any passages from
the declamations of others that have come in for a
word of praise. None the less they do occasionally
strike out some good things and some fine epigrams,
such as they make their boast. Why not? slaves
and barbarians sometimes achieve the same effects,
and if we are to be satisfied with this sort of thing,
then good-bye to any theory of oratory.</p>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>I must, however, admit that the general
opinion is that the untrained speaker is usually
the more vigorous. This opinion is due primarily
to the erroneous judgment of faulty critics, who
think that true vigour is all the greater for its lack
of art, regarding it as a special proof of strength to
force what might be opened, to break what might
be untied and to drag what might be led. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>  Even a
gladiator who plunges into the fight with no skill at
arms to help him, and a wrestler who puts forth the
whole strength of his body the moment he has got
a hold, is acclaimed by them for his outstanding
vigour, although it is of frequent occurrence in such
cases for the latter to be overthrown by his own
strength and for the former to find the fury of his

<pb id="p.285"/>

onslaught parried by his adversary with a supple
turn of the wrist. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>  But there are many details in this
department of our art which the unskilled critic will
never notice. For instance, careful division under
heads, although of the utmost importance in actual
cases, makes the outward show of strength seem
less than the reality; the unhewn block is larger
than the polished marble, and things when scattered
seem more numerous than when placed together.
 <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>  There is moreover a sort of resemblance between
certain merits and certain defects: abuse passes for
freedom of speech, rashness for courage, prodigality
for abundance. But the untrained advocate will
abuse too openly and too often, even though by so
doing he imperils the success of the case which he
has undertaken and not seldom his own personal
safety as well. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>  But even such violence will win
men's good opinion, since they are only too pleased
to hear another say things which nothing would
have induced them to utter themselves. Such
speakers are also less careful to avoid that other
peril, the pitfall of style, and are so reckless in their
efforts that sometimes in their passion for extravagance they light upon some really striking expression. But such success is rare and does not
compensate for their other defects.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>  For the same reason the uninstructed sometimes
appear to have a richer flow of language, because
they say everything that can be said, while the
learned exercise discrimination and self-restraint.
To this must be added the fact that such persons
take no trouble to prove their contentions, and
consequently steer clear of the chilly reception
given in our decadent law-courts to arguments and

<pb id="p.287"/>

questions and seek only for such themes as may
beguile the ears of the public even at the cost of
appealing to the most perverted tastes. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>  Again,
their epigrams, the sole objects of their quest, seem
all the more striking because of the dreariness and
squalor of their context, since flashes are more
clearly seen against a background, not of mere
<quote>shade,</quote> as Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">de Or.</hi> III. xxvi. 101.</note> says, but of pitchy darkness.
Well, let the world credit them with as much genius
as it pleases, so long as it is admitted that such
praise is an insult to any man of real eloquence.
 <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>  None the less it must be confessed that learning
does take something from oratory, just as the file
takes something from rough surfaces or the whetstone from blunt edges or age from wine; it takes
away defects, and if the results produced after subjection to the polish of literary study are less, they
are less only because they are better.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>  But these creatures have another weapon in their
armoury: they seek to obtain the reputation of
speaking with greater vigour than the trained orator
by means of their delivery. For they shout on all
and every occasion and bellow their every utterance
<quote>with uplifted hand,</quote> to use their own phrase,
dashing this way and that, panting, gesticulating
wildly and wagging their heads with all the frenzy
of a lunatic. <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>  Smite your hands together, stamp
the ground, slap your thigh, your breast, your forehead, and you will go straight to the heart of the
dingier members of your audience.<note><hi rend="italics">pullatus</hi> = wearing dark clothes, <hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> the common people,
as opposed to the upper classes wearing the white or purple bordered <hi rend="italics">toga.</hi></note> But the educated speaker, just as he knows how to moderate
his style, and to impart variety and artistic form to
his speech, is an equal adept in the matter of delivery and will suit his action to the tone of each

<pb id="p.289"/>

portion of his utterances, while, if he has any one
canon for universal observance, it is that he should
both possess the reality and present the appearance
of self-control. <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>  But the ranters confer the title of
force on that which is really violence. You may
also occasionally find not merely pleaders, but, what
is far more shameful, teachers as well, who, after a
brief training in the art of speaking, throw method
to the winds and, yielding to the impulse of the
moment, run riot in every direction, abusing those
who hold literature in higher respect as fools without life, courage or vigour, and calling them the
first and worst name that occurs to them. <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>  Still let
me congratulate these gentlemen on attaining eloquence without industry, method or study. As for
myself I have long since retired from the task of
teaching in the schools and of speaking in the
courts, thinking it the most honourable conclusion to
retire while my services were still in request, and all
I ask is to be allowed to console my leisure by
making such researches and composing such instructions as will, I hope, prove useful to young men of
ability, and are, at any rate, a pleasure to myself.</p>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Let no one however demand from me a rigid
code of rules such as most authors of textbooks have
laid down, or ask me to impose on students of rhetoric a system of laws immutable as fate, a system in
which injunctions as to the <hi rend="italics">exordium</hi> and its nature
lead the way; then come the <hi rend="italics">statement of facts</hi> and
the laws to be observed in this connexion: next the
<hi rend="italics">proposition</hi> or, as some prefer, the <hi rend="italics">digression,</hi> followed
by prescriptions as to the order in which the various
questions should be discussed, with all the other rules,
which some speakers follow as though they had no

<pb id="p.291"/>

choice but to regard them as orders and as if it were
a crime to take any other line. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>  If the whole of rhetoric could be thus embodied in one compact code,
it would be an easy task of little compass: but
most rules are liable to be altered by the nature of
the case, circumstances of time and place, and by
hard necessity itself. Consequently the all-important
gift for an orator is a wise adaptability since he is
called upon to meet the most varied emergencies.
 <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>  What if you should instruct a general, as often as he
marshals his troops for battle, to draw up his front in
line, advance his wings to left and right, and station
his cavalry to protect his flank? This will perhaps be
the best plan, if circumstances allow. But it may
have to be modified owing to the nature of the ground,
if, for instance, he is confronted by a mountain, if a
river bars his advance, or his movements are hampered
by hills, woods or broken country. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>  Or again it may
be modified by the character of the enemy or the
nature of the crisis by which he is faced. On one
occasion he will fight in line, on another in column,
on one he will use his auxiliary troops, on another his
legionaries; while occasionally a feint of flight may
win the day. So, too, with the rules of oratory. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>  Is
the <hi rend="italics">exordium</hi> necessary or superfluous? should it be
long or short? addressed entirely to the judge or
sometimes directed to some other quarter by the
employment of some figure of speech?<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> by the figure known as <hi rend="italics">apostrophe,</hi> in which the
orator diverts his speech from the judge to some other
person: see IX. ii. 38.</note> Should the
statement of facts be concise or developed at some
length? continuous or divided into sections? and
should it follow the actual or an artificial order of
events? The orator will find the answers to all these
questions in the circumstances of the case. So, too,
with the order in which questions should be discussed,

<pb id="p.293"/>

since in any given debate it may often suit one party
best that such and such a question come up first, <milestone unit="section" n="6"/> while their opponents would be best suited by another.
For these rules have not the formal authority of laws
or decrees of the plebs, but are, with all they contain,
the children of expediency. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>  I will not deny that it
is generally expedient to conform to such rules, otherwise I should not be writing now; but if our friend
expediency suggests some other course to us, why,
we shall disregard the authority of the professors
and follow her.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>  For my part above all things

<quote rend="blockquote">
<cit><quote><l>This I enjoin and urge and urge anew</l></quote> <bibl>Verg. Aen. iii. 436.</bibl></cit></quote>

that in all his pleadings the orator should keep two
things constantly in view, what is becoming and what
is expedient. But it is often expedient and occasionally becoming to make some modification in the
time-honoured order. We see the same thing in
pictures and statues. Dress, expression and attitude
are frequently varied. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>  The body when held bolt
upright has but little grace, for the face looks straight
forward, the arms hang by the side, the feet are
joined and the whole figure is stiff from top to toe.
But that curve, I might almost call it motion, with
which we are so familiar, gives an impression of action
and animation. So, too, the hands will not always be
represented in the same position, and the variety
given to the expression will be infinite. <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>  Some figures
are represented as running or rushing forward, others
sit or recline, some are nude, others clothed, while
some again are half-dressed, half-naked. Where can
we find a more violent and elaborate attitude than
that of the Discobolus of Myron? Yet the critic who

<pb id="p.295"/>

disapproved of the figure because it was not upright,
would merely show his utter failure to understand the
sculptor's art, in which the very novelty and difficulty
of execution is what most deserves our praise. <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>  A
similar impression of grace and charm is produced by
rhetorical figures, whether they be <hi rend="italics">figures of thought</hi>
or <hi rend="italics">figures of speech.</hi> For they involve a certain departure from the straight line and have the merit of
variation from the ordinary usage. <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>  In a picture the
full face is most attractive. But Apelles painted
Antigonus in profile, to conceal the blemish caused
by the loss of one eye. So, too, in speaking, there
are certain things which have to be concealed, either
because they ought not to be disclosed or because
they cannot be expressed as they deserve. <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>  Timanthes,
who was, I think, a native of Cythnus, provides an
example of this in the picture with which he won the
victory over Colotes of Teos. It represented the
sacrifice of Iphigenia, and the artist had depicted an
expression of grief on the face of Calchas and of still
greater grief on that of Ulysses, while he had given
Menelaus an agony of sorrow beyond which his art
could not go. Having exhausted his powers of emotional expression he was at a loss to portray the
father's face as it deserved, and solved the problem
by veiling his head and leaving his sorrow to the
imagination of the spectator. <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>  Sallust<note><hi rend="italics">Jug.</hi> xix.</note> did something similar when he wrote <quote>I think it better to say
nothing of Carthage rather than say too little.</quote> It
has always, therefore, been my custom not to tie myself down to <hi rend="italics">universal</hi> or <hi rend="italics">general</hi> rules (this being the
nearest equivalent I can find for the Greek <hi rend="italics">catholic
rules</hi>). For rules are rarely of such a kind that their
validity cannot be shaken and overthrown in some

<pb id="p.297"/>

particular or other. <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>  But I must reserve each of these
points for fuller treatment in its proper place. For
the present I will only say that I do not want young
men to think their education complete when they
have mastered one of the small text-books of which
so many are in circulation, or to ascribe a talismanic
value to the arbitrary decrees of theorists. the art
of speaking can only be attained by hard work and
assiduity of study, by a variety of exercises and repeated trial, the highest prudence and unfailing
quickness of judgement. <milestone unit="section" n="16"/>  But rules are helpful all the
same so long as they indicate the direct road and do
not restrict us absolutely to the ruts made by others.
For he who thinks it an unpardonable sin to leave the
old, old track, must be content to move at much the
same speed as a tight-rope walker. Thus, for example,
we often leave a paved military road to take a short
cut or, finding that the direct route is impossible
owing to floods having broken down the bridges, are
forced to make a circuit, while if our house is on fire
and flames bar the way to the front door, we make
our escape by breaking through a party wall. <milestone unit="section" n="17"/>  The
orator's task covers a large ground, is extremely
varied and develops some new aspect almost every
day, so that the last word on the subject will never
have been said. I shall however try to set forth the
traditional rules and to point out their best features,
mentioning the changes, additions and subtractions
which seem desirable.</p>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Rhetoric is a Greek term which has been
translated into Latin by <hi rend="italics">oratoria</hi> or <hi rend="italics">oratrix. I</hi> would
not for the world deprive the translators of the
praise which is their due for attempting to increase
the vocabulary of our native tongue; but translations

<pb id="p.299"/>

from Greek into Latin are not always satisfactory,
just as the attempt to represent Latin words
in a Greek dress is sometimes equally unsuccessful.
 <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>  And the translations in question are fully as
harsh as the <hi rend="italics">essentia</hi> and <hi rend="italics">queentia</hi><note><hi rend="italics">sc.</hi> essence and possibility.</note> of Plautus,<note>A Stoic. <hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> x. i. 124.</note>
and have not even the merit of being exact.
For <hi rend="italics">oratoria</hi> is formed like <hi rend="italics">elocutoria</hi> and <hi rend="italics">oratrix</hi>
like <hi rend="italics">elocutrix,</hi> whereas the rhetoric with which
we are concerned is rather to be identified with
<hi rend="italics">eloquentia,</hi> and the word is undoubtedly used in two
senses by the Greeks. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>  In the one case it is an
adjective i.e. <hi rend="italics">ars rhetorica,</hi> the rhetorical art, like
piratic in the phrase <hi rend="italics">nauis piratica,</hi> in the other it is
a noun like philosophy or friendship. It is as a substantive that we require it here; now the correct
translation of the Greek <hi rend="italics">grammatice</hi> is <hi rend="italics">litteratura</hi> not
<hi rend="italics">litteratrix or litteratoria,</hi> which would be the forms
analogous to <hi rend="italics">oratrix</hi> and <hi rend="italics">oratoria.</hi> But in the case of
<quote>rhetoric</quote> there is no similar Latin equivalent. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>  It is
best therefore not to quarrel about it, more especially
as we have to use Greek terms in many other cases.
For I may at least use the words <hi rend="italics">philosophus, musicus</hi>
and <hi rend="italics">geometres</hi> without outraging them by changing
them into clumsy Latin equivalents. Finally,
since Cicero gave a Greek title<note>See &sect; 6 of next chapter.</note> to the earlier works
which he wrote on this subject, I may without fear
of rashness accept the great orator as sufficient
authority for the name of the art which he professed.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>  To resume, then, rhetoric (for I shall now use the
name without fear of captious criticism) is in my
opinion best treated under the three following heads,
the art, the artist and the work. The art is that
which we should acquire by study, and is the art of

<pb id="p.301"/>

speaking well. The artist is he who has acquired the
art, that is to say, he is the orator whose task it is
to speak well. The work is the achievement of
the artist, namely good speaking. Each of these
three <hi rend="italics">general</hi> divisions is in its turn divided into
<hi rend="italics">species.</hi> Of the two latter divisions I shall speak
in their proper place. For the present I shall proceed to a discussion of the first.</p>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The first question which confronts us is
<quote>What is rhetoric?</quote> Many definitions have been
given; but the problem is really twofold. For the
dispute turns either on the quality of the thing
itself or on the meaning of the words in which it
is defined. The first and chief disagreement on the
subject is found in the fact that some think that
even bad men may be called orators, while others,
of whom I am one, restrict the name of orator and
the art itself to those who are good. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>  Of those who
divorce eloquence from that yet fairer and more desirable title to renown, a virtuous life, some call
rhetoric merely a power, some a science, but not a
virtue, some a practice, some an art, though they will
not allow the art to have anything in common with
science or virtue, while some again call it a perversion of art or <foreign lang="greek">kakotexni/a.</foreign> <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>  These persons have as a
rule held that the task of oratory lies in persuasion
or speaking in a persuasive manner: for this is
within the power of a bad man no less than a good.
Hence we get the common definition of rhetoric as
the power of persuading. What I call a power,
many call a capacity, and some a faculty. In order
therefore that there may be no misunderstanding I
will say that by power I mean <foreign lang="greek">du/namis.</foreign> <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>  This view
is derived from Isocrates, if indeed the treatise on

<pb id="p.303"/>

rhetoric<note>This treatise is lost. It may have been the work of the
younger Isocrates.</note> which circulates under his name is really
from his hand. He, although far from agreeing
with those whose aim is to disparage the duties of
an orator, somewhat rashly defined rhetoric as
<foreign lang="greek">peiqou=s dhmiourgo/s,</foreign> the <quote>worker of persuasion</quote>: for
I cannot bring myself to use the peculiar derivative
which Ennius<note><hi rend="italics">Ann.</hi> ix. 309 (Vahlen). The derivative to which he
objects is the rare word <hi rend="italics">suada.</hi></note> applies to Marcus Cethegus in the
phrase <hi rend="italics">suadae medulla,</hi> the <quote>marrow of persuasion.</quote>
 <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>  Again Gorgias,<note><hi rend="italics">Gorg.</hi> 453 A.</note>in the dialogue of Plato that takes
its title from his name, says practically the same
thing, but Plato intends it to be taken as the opinion
of Gorgias, not as his own. Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">de Inv.</hi> I. v. 6, <hi rend="italics">de Or.</hi> I. xxxi. 138</note> in more than
one passage defined the duty of an orator as <quote>speaking in a persuasive manner.</quote> <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>  In his <hi rend="italics">Rhelorica</hi><note><hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> III. i. 20 and Cic. <hi rend="italics">de Or.</hi> I. ii. 5. The work in question
is better known as the <hi rend="italics">de Inventione.</hi></note> too,
a work which it is clear gave him no satisfaction, he
makes the end to be persuasion. But many other
things have the power of persuasion, such as money,
influence, the authority and rank of the speaker, or
even some sight unsupported by language, when
for instance the place of words is supplied by the
memory of some individual's great deeds, by his
lamentable appearance or the beauty of his person.
 <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>  Thus when Antonius in the course of his defence of
Manius Aquilius tore open his client's robe and revealed the honourable scars which he had acquired
while facing his country's foes, he relied no longer
on the power of his eloquence, but appealed directly
to the eyes of the Roman people. And it is believed
that they were so profoundly moved by the sight as
to acquit the accused. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>  Again there is a speech of
Cato, to mention no other records, which informs us
that Servius Galba escaped condemnation solely by

<pb id="p.305"/>

the pity which he aroused not only by producing his
own young children before the assembly, but by
carrying round in his arms the son of Sulpicius
Gallus. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>  So also according to general opinion Phryne
was saved not by the eloquence of Hyperides, admirable as it was, but by the sight of her exquisite
body, which she further revealed by drawing aside
her tunic. And if all these have power to persuade, the end of oratory, which we are discussing,
cannot adequately be defined as persuasion. <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>  Consequently those who, although holding the same
general view of rhetoric, have regarded it as the
<hi rend="italics">power of persuasion by speaking,</hi> pride themselves on
their greater exactness of language. This definition
is given by Gorgias, in the dialogue<note><hi rend="italics">Gorg.</hi> p. 452 E.</note> mentioned
above, under compulsion from the inexorable logic of
Socrates. Theodectes agrees with him, whether the
treatise on rhetoric which has come down to us
under his name is really by him or, as is generally
believed, by Aristotle. In that work the end of
rhetoric is defined as the <hi rend="italics">leading of men by the
power of speech to the conclusion desired by the orator.</hi>
 <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>  But even this definition is not sufficiently comprehensive, since others besides orators persuade by
speaking or lead others to the conclusion desired, as
for example harlots, flatterers and seducers. On
the other hand the orator is not always engaged on
persuasion, so that sometimes persuasion is not his
special object, while sometimes it is shared by
others who are far removed from being orators. <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>  And
yet Apollodorus is not very far off this definition
when he asserts that the first and all-important task
of forensic oratory is <hi rend="italics">to persuade the judge and lead
his mind to the conclusions desired by the speaker.</hi> For

<pb id="p.307"/>

even Apollodorus makes the orator the sport of fortune by refusing him leave to retain his title if he
fails to persuade. <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>  Some on the other hand pay no
attention to results, as for example Aristotle,<note><hi rend="italics">Rhet.</hi> i. 2.</note> who
says <quote><hi rend="italics">rhetoric is the power of discovering all means of
persuading by speech.</hi></quote> This definition has not merely
the fault already mentioned, but the additional defect of including merely the power of invention,
which without style cannot possibly constitute
oratory. <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>  Hermagoras, who asserts that its end is to
<hi rend="italics">speak persuasively,</hi> and others who express the same
opinion, though in different words, and inform us
that the end is to <hi rend="italics">say everything which ought to be
said with a view to persuasion,</hi> have been sufficiently
answered above, when I proved that persuasion was
not the privilege of the orator alone. <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>  Various additions
have been made to these definitions. For some hold
that rhetoric is concerned with everything, while
some restrict its activity to politics. The question
as to which of these views is the nearer to the truth
shall be discussed later in its appropriate place. <milestone unit="section" n="16"/>  Aristotle seems to have implied that the sphere of the
orator was all-inclusive when he defined rhetoric as
the <hi rend="italics">power to detect every element in any given subject
which might conduce to persuasion;</hi> so too does Patrocles who omits the words <hi rend="italics">in any given subject,</hi> but
since he excludes nothing, shows that his view is
identical. For he defines rhetoric as the <hi rend="italics">power to
discover whatever is persuasive in speech.</hi> These definitions like that quoted above include no more than
the power of <hi rend="italics">invention</hi> alone. Theodorus avoids this
fault and holds that it is the <hi rend="italics">power to discover and to
utter forth in elegant language whatever is credible in
every subject of oratory.</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="17"/>  But, while others besides

<pb id="p.309"/>

orators may discover what is credible as well as persuasive, by adding the words <hi rend="italics">in every subject</hi> he, to a
greater extent than the others, concedes the fairest
name in all the world to those who use their gifts as
an incitement to crime <milestone unit="section" n="18"/>  . Plato makes Gorgias<note><hi rend="italics">Gorg.</hi> 454 B.</note> say
that he is a master of persuasion in the law-courts
and other assemblies, and that his themes are justice
and injustice, while in reply Socrates allows him the
power of persuading, but not of teaching. <milestone unit="section" n="19"/>  Those
who refused to make the sphere of oratory allinclusive, have been obliged to make somewhat forced
and long-winded distinctions: among these I may
mention Ariston, the pupil of the Peripatetic Critolaus, who produced the following definition, <quote><hi rend="italics">Rhetoric
is the science of seeing and uttering what ought to be
said on political questions in language that is likely to
prove persuasive to the people.</hi></quote> <milestone unit="section" n="20"/>  Being a Peripatetic he
regards it as a science, not, like the Stoics, as a
virtue, while in adding the words <quote><hi rend="italics">likely to prove
persuasie to the people</hi></quote> he inflicts a positive insult on
oratory, in implying that it is not likely to persuade the
learned. The same criticism will apply to all those who
restrict oratory to political questions, for they exclude thereby a large number of the duties of an
orator, as for example panegyric, the third department of oratory, which is entirely ignored. <milestone unit="section" n="21"/>  Turning
to those who regard rhetoric as an art, but not as a
virtue, we find that Theodorus of Gadara is more
cautious. For he says (I quote the words of his
translators), <quote><hi rend="italics">rhetoric is the art which discovers and
judges and expresses, mith an elegance duly proportioned
to the importance of all such elements of persuasion as
may exist in any subject in the field of politics.</hi></quote> <milestone unit="section" n="22"/>  Similarly Cornelius Celsus defines the end of rhetoric as

<pb id="p.311"/>

<hi rend="italics">to speak persuasively on any doubtful subject within the
field of politics.</hi> Similar definitions are given by
others, such for instance as the following:&mdash;<quote><hi rend="italics">rhetoric
is the power of judging and holding forth on such political subjects as come before it with a certain persuasiveness, a certain action of the body and delivery of the
words.</hi></quote> <milestone unit="section" n="23"/>  There are countless other definitions,
either identical with this or composed of the same
elements, which I shall deal with when I come to
the questions concerned with the subject matter of
rhetoric. Some regard it as neither a power, a
science or an art; Critolaus calls it the <hi rend="italics">practice of
speaking</hi> (for this is the meaning of <foreign lang="greek">tribh/</foreign>),
Athenaeus styles it the <hi rend="italics">art of deceiving,</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="24"/>  while the
majority, content with reading a few passages from
the Gorgias of Plato, unskilfully excerpted by
earlier writers, refrain from studying that dialogue
and the remainder of Plato's writings, and thereby
fall into serious error. For they believe that in
Plato's view rhetoric was not an art, but a certain
<hi rend="italics">adroitness in the production of delight and gratification,</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Gorg.</hi> 462 c.</note> <milestone unit="section" n="25"/>  or with reference to another passage the
<hi rend="italics">shadow of a small part of politics</hi><note><hi rend="italics">ib.</hi> 463 <hi rend="italics">p.</hi></note> and the <hi rend="italics">fourth department of flattery.</hi> For Plato assigns<note><hi rend="italics">ib.</hi> 464 B.</note> two departments of politics to the body, namely medicine and
gymnastic, and two to the soul, namely law and
justice, while he styles the art of cookery<note><hi rend="italics">ib.</hi> 464 B-465 E.</note> a form of
flattery of medicine, the art of the slave-dealer a
flattery of gymnastic, for they produce a false complexion by the use of paint and a false robustness
by puffing them out with fat: sophistry he calls a
dishonest counterfeit of legal science, and rhetoric of
justice. <milestone unit="section" n="26"/>  All these statements occur in the <hi rend="italics">Gorgias</hi> and
are uttered by Socrates who appears to be the

<pb id="p.313"/>

mouthpiece of the views held by Plato. But some of his
dialogues were composed merely to refute his
opponents and are styled <hi rend="italics">refutative,</hi> while others are
for the purpose of teaching and are called <hi rend="italics">doctrinal.</hi>
 <milestone unit="section" n="27"/>  Now it is only rhetoric as practised in their own day
that is condemned by Plato or Socrates, for he
speaks of it as <quote>the manner in which you engage in
public affairs</quote><note>500 c.</note>: rhetoric in itself he regards as a
genuine and honourable thing, and consequently the
controversy with Gorgias ends with the words, <quote>The
rhetorician therefore must be just and the just man
desirous to do what is just.</quote><note>460 c.</note> <milestone unit="section" n="28"/>  To this Gorgias
makes no reply, but the argument is taken up by
Polus, a hot-headed and headstrong young fellow,
and it is to him that Socrates makes his remarks
about <quote>shadows</quote> and <quote>forms of flattery.</quote> Then
Callicles,<note>508 c.</note> who is even more hot-headed, intervenes,
but is reduced to the conclusion that <quote>he who would
truly be a rhetorician ought to be just and possess a
knowledge of justice.</quote> It is clear therefore that
Plato does not regard rhetoric as an evil, but holds
that true rhetoric is impossible for any save a just
and good man. In the <hi rend="italics">Phaedrus</hi><note>261 A-273 E.</note> <milestone unit="section" n="29"/>  he makes it even
clearer that the complete attainment of this art is
impossible without the knowledge of justice, an
opinion in which I heartily concur. Had this not
been his view, would he have ever written the
Apology of Socrates or the Funeral Oration<note><hi rend="italics">Menexenus.</hi></note> in
praise of those who had died in battle for their
country, both of them works falling within the
sphere of oratory. <milestone unit="section" n="30"/>  It was against the class of men
who employed their glibness of speech for evil purposes that he directed his denunciations. Similarly
Socrates thought it incompatible with his honour to

<pb id="p.315"/>

make use of the speech which Lysias composed for
his defence, although it was the usual practice in
those days to write speeches for the parties concerned to speak in the courts on their own behalf,
a device designed to circumvent the law which forbade the employment of advocates. <milestone unit="section" n="31"/>  Further the
teachers of rhetoric were regarded by Plato as quite
unsuited to their professed task. For they divorced
rhetoric from justice and preferred plausibility to
truth, as he states in the <hi rend="italics">Phaedrus.</hi><note>267 A, with special reference to Tisias and Gorgias.</note> <milestone unit="section" n="32"/>  Cornelius Celsus
seems to have agreed with these early rhetoricians,
for he writes <quote>The orator only aims at the semblance
of truth,</quote> and again a little later <quote>The reward of
the party to a suit is not a good conscience, but victory.</quote> If this were true, only the worst of men
would place such dangerous weapons at the disposal
of criminals or employ the precepts of their art for
the assistance of wickedness. However I will leave
those who maintain these views to consider what
ground they have for so doing.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="33"/>  For my part, I have undertaken the task of moulding the ideal orator, and as my first desire is that he
should be a good man, I will return to those who
have sounder opinions on the subject. Some however identify rhetoric with politics, Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">de Inv.</hi> I. v. 6.</note> calls it a
<hi rend="italics">department of the science of politics</hi> (and science of
politics and philosophy are identical terms), while
others again call it a <hi rend="italics">branch of philosophy,</hi> among
them Isocrates. <milestone unit="section" n="34"/>  The definition which best suits its
real character is that which makes rhetoric the <hi rend="italics">science
of speaking well.</hi> For this definition includes all the
virtues of oratory and the character of the orator as
well, since no man can speak well who is not good
himself. <milestone unit="section" n="35"/>  The definition given by Chrysippus, who

<pb id="p.317"/>

derived it from Cleanthes, to the effect that it is the
<hi rend="italics">science of speaking rightly,</hi> amounts to the same thing.
The same philosopher also gives other definitions,
but they concern problems of a different character
from that on which we are now engaged. Another
definition defines oratory as the power of <hi rend="italics">persuading
men to do what ought to be done,</hi> and yields practically
the same sense save that it limits the art to the result
which it produces. <milestone unit="section" n="36"/>  Areus again defines it well as
<hi rend="italics">speaking according to the excellence of speech.</hi> Those who
regard it as the science of political obligations, also
exclude men of bad character from the title of orator,
if by science they mean virtue, but restrict it overmuch by confining it to political problems. Albutius,
a distinguished author and professor of rhetoric,
agrees that rhetoric is the science of speaking well,
but makes a mistake in imposing restrictions by the
addition of the words <hi rend="italics">on political questions</hi> and <hi rend="italics">with
credibility;</hi> with both of these restrictions I have
already dealt. <milestone unit="section" n="37"/>  Finally those critics who hold that
the aim of rhetoric is <hi rend="italics">to think and speak rightly,</hi> were
on the correct track.</p>

<p>These are practically all the most celebrated and
most discussed definitions of rhetoric. It would be
both irrelevant and beyond my power to deal with all.
For I strongly disapprove of the custom which has
come to prevail among writers of text-books of refusing
to define anything in the same terms as have been
employed by some previous writer. I will have
nothing to do with such ostentation. <milestone unit="section" n="38"/>  What I say
will not necessarily be my own invention, but it will
be what I believe to be the right view, as for instance
that oratory is the science of speaking well. For
when the most satisfactory definition has been

<pb id="p.319"/>

found, he who seeks another, is merely looking for a
worse one.</p>

<p>Thus much being admitted we are now in
a position to see clearly what is the end, the
highest aim, the ultimate goal of rhetoric, that <foreign lang="greek">te/los</foreign>
in fact which every art must possess. For if rhetoric
is the science of speaking well, its end and highest
aim is to speak well.</p>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>There follows the question as to whether
rhetoric is useful. Some are in the habit of
denouncing it most violently and of shamelessly
employing the powers of oratory to accuse oratory
itself. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>  <quote>It is eloquence</quote> they say <quote>that snatches
criminals from the penalties of the law, eloquence
that from time to time secures the condemnation of the innocent and leads deliberation astray,
eloquence that stirs up not merely sedition and
popular tumult, but wars beyond all expiation, and
that is most effective when it makes falsehood prevail
over the truth.</quote> <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>  The comic poets even accuse
Socrates of teaching how to make the worse cause
seem the better, while Plato says that Gorgias and
Tisias made similar professions. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>  And to these they
add further examples drawn from the history of
Rome and Greece, enumerating all those who used
their pernicious eloquence not merely against individuals but against whole states and threw an ordered
commonwealth into a state of turmoil or even brought
it to utter ruin; and they point out that for this
very reason rhetoric was banished from Sparta, while
its powers were cut down at Athens itself by the fact
that an orator was forbidden to stir the passions of
his audience. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>  On the showing of these critics not only
orators but generals, magistrates, medicine and

<pb id="p.321"/>

philosophy itself will all be useless. For Flaminius was a
general, while men such as the Gracchi, Saturninus
and Glaucia were magistrates. Doctors have been
caught using poisons, and those who falsely assume the
name of philosopher have occasionally been detected
in the gravest crimes. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>  Let us give up eating, it
often makes us ill; let us never go inside houses,
for sometimes they collapse on their occupants;
let never a sword be forged for a soldier, since
it might be used by a robber. And who does
not realise that fire and water, both necessities of
life, and, to leave mere earthly things, even the sun
and moon, the greatest of the heavenly bodies, are
occasionally capable of doing harm.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>  On the other hand will it be denied that it was
by his gift of speech that Appius the Blind broke
off the dishonourable peace which was on the point
of being concluded with Pyrrhus? Did not the
divine eloquence of Cicero win popular applause
even when he denounced the Agrarian laws,<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> though denouncing laws which would naturally be
popular.</note> did it
not crush the audacious plots of Catiline and win,
while he still wore the garb of civil life, the highest
honour that can be conferred on a victorious general,
a public thanksgiving to heaven? <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>  Has not oratory
often revived the courage of a panic-stricken army
and persuaded the soldier faced by all the perils of
war that glory is a fairer thing than life itself? Nor
shall the history of Sparta and Athens move me
more than that of the Roman people, who have
always held the orator in highest honour. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>  Never in
my opinion would the founders of cities have induced their unsettled multitudes to form communities had they not moved them by the magic of their
eloquence: never without the highest gifts of oratory

<pb id="p.323"/>

would the great legislators have constrained mankind to submit themselves to the yoke of law. <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>  Nay,
even the principles which should guide our life,
however fair they may be by nature, yet have greater
power to mould the mind to virtue, when the beauty
of things is illumined by the splendour of eloquence.
Wherefore, although the weapons of oratory may
be used either for good or ill, it is unfair to regard
that as an evil which can be employed for good.
 <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>  These problems, however, may be left to those
who hold that rhetoric is the power to persuade. If
our definition of rhetoric as the science of speaking
well implies that an orator must be a good man,
there can be no doubt about its usefulness. <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>  And
in truth that god, who was in the beginning, the
father of all things and the architect of the universe,
distinguished man from all other living creatures
that are subject to death, by nothing more than
this, that he gave him the gift of speech. <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>  For as
regards physical bulk, strength, robustness, endurance or speed, man is surpassed in certain cases by
dumb beasts, who also are far more independent of
external assistance. They know by instinct without
need of any teacher how to move rapidly, to feed
themselves and swim. <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>  Many too have their bodies
clothed against cold, possess natural weapons and
have not to search for their food, whereas in all
these respects man's life is full of toil. Reason
then was the greatest gift of the Almighty, who
willed that we should share its possession with the
immortal gods. <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>  But reason by itself would help us
but little and would be far less evident in us, had
we not the power to express our thoughts in speech;
for it is the lack of this power rather than thought

<pb id="p.325"/>

and understanding, which they do to a certain extent possess, that is the great defect in other living
things. <milestone unit="section" n="16"/>  The construction of a soft lair, the weaving
of nests, the hatching and rearing of their young, and
even the storing up of food for the coming winter,
together with certain other achievements which we
cannot imitate, such as the making of honey and
wax, all these perhaps indicate the possession of a
certain degree of reason; but since the creatures that
do these things lack the gift of speech they are called
dumb and unreasoning beasts. <milestone unit="section" n="17"/>  Finally, how little
the heavenly boon of reason avails those who are
born dumb. If therefore we have received no fairer
gift from heaven than speech, what shall we regard
as so worthy of laborious cultivation, or in what
should we sooner desire to excel our fellow-men,
than that in which mankind excels all other living
things? <milestone unit="section" n="18"/>  And we should be all the more eager to do
so, since there is no art which yields a more grateful
recompense for the labour bestowed upon it. This
will be abundantly clear if we consider the origins
of oratory and the progress it has made; and it is
capable of advancing still further. <milestone unit="section" n="19"/>  I will not stop
to point out how useful and how becoming a task it is
for a good man to defend his friends, to guide the
senate by his counsels, and to lead peoples or armies
to follow his bidding; I merely ask, is it not a
noble thing, by employing the understanding which
is common to mankind and the words that are used
by all, to win such honour and glory that you seem
not to speak or plead, but rather, as was said of
Pericles, to thunder and lighten?<note><hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> Aristoph. <hi rend="italics">Ach. 530:</hi> <quote>Then in his wrath Pericles
the Olympian lightened and thundered and threw all Greece
into confusion.</quote></note></p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>However, if I were to indulge my own inclinations in expatiating on this subject, I should go

<pb id="p.327"/>

on for ever. Let us therefore pass to the next
question and consider whether rhetoric is an art. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/> No one of those who have laid down rules for
oratory has ever doubted that it is an art. It is clear
even from the titles of their books that their theme
is the art of rhetoric, while Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">de Inv.</hi> I. v. 6. The titles in question are such as <hi rend="italics">Ars
rhetorica, Ars Hermagorae,</hi> etc.</note> defines rhetoric
as <hi rend="italics">artistic eloquence.</hi> And it is not merely the orators
who have claimed this distinction for their studies
with a view to giving them an additional title to
respect, but the Stoic and Peripatetic philosophers for
the most part agree with them. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>  Indeed I will confess
that I had doubts as to whether I should discuss this
portion of my inquiry, for there is no one, I will not
say so unlearned, but so devoid of ordinary sense, as
to hold that building, weaving or moulding vessels
from clay are arts, and at the same time to consider
that rhetoric, which, as I have already said, is the
noblest and most sublime of tasks, has reached such
a lofty eminence without the assistance of art. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>  For
my own part I think that those who have argued
against this view did not realise what they were
saying, but merely desired to exercise their wits by
the selection of a difficult theme, like Polycrates,
when he praised Busiris and Clytemnestra; I may
add that he is credited with a not dissimilar performance, namely the composition of a speech which
was delivered against Socrates.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>  Some would have it that rhetoric is a natural gift
though they admit that it can be developed by practice.
So Antonius in the <hi rend="italics">de Oralore</hi><note>II. lvii. 232.</note> of Cicero styles it a <hi rend="italics">knack
derived from experience,</hi> but denies that it is an art: <milestone unit="section" n="6"/> this statement is however not intended to be accepted
by us as the actual truth, but is inserted to make
<pb id="p.329"/>

Antonius speak in character, since he was in the
habit of concealing his art. Still Lysias is said to
have maintained this same view, which is defended
on the ground that uneducated persons, barbarians
and slaves, when speaking on their own behalf, say
something that resembles an <hi rend="italics">exordiam,</hi> state the facts
of the case, prove, refute and plead for mercy just as
an orator does in his peroration. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>  To this is added
the quibble that nothing that is based on art can
have existed before the art in question, whereas men
have always from time immemorial spoken in their
own defence or in denunciation of others: the
teaching of rhetoric as an art was, they say, a later
invention dating from about the time of Tisias and
Corax: oratory therefore existed before art and
consequently cannot be an art. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>  For my part I am not
concerned with the date when oratory began to be
taught. Even in Homer we find Phoenix<note><hi rend="italics">Il.</hi> ix. 432.</note> as an
instructor not only of conduct but of speaking, while
a number of orators are mentioned, the various styles
are represented by the speeches of three of the
chiefs<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> the copious style by Nestor, the plain by Menelaus,
the intermediate by Ulysses.</note> and the young men are set to contend among
themselves in contests of eloquence:<note><hi rend="italics">Il.</hi> xv. 284.</note> moreover lawsuits and pleaders are represented in the engravings
on the shield of Achilles.<note><hi rend="italics">Il.</hi> xviii. 497 <hi rend="italics">sqq.</hi></note> <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>  It is sufficient to call
attention to the fact that everything which art has
brought to perfection originated in nature. Otherwise we might deny the title of art to medicine,
which was discovered from the observation of
sickness and health, and according to some is
entirely based upon experiment: wounds were bound
up long before medicine developed into an art, and
fevers were reduced by rest and abstention from food,
long before the reason for such treatment was

<pb id="p.331"/>

known, simply because the state of the patient's
health left no choice. <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>  So too building should not be
styled an art; for primitive man built himself a hut
without the assistance of art. Music by the same
reasoning is not an art; for every race indulges in
some kind of singing and dancing. If therefore any
kind of speech is to be called eloquence, I will admit
that it existed before it was an art. <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>  If on the other
hand not every man that speaks is an orator and
primitive man did not speak like an orator, my
opponents must needs acknowledge that oratory is
the product of art and did not exist before it. This
conclusion also rules out their argument that men
speak who have never learnt how to speak, and that
which a man does untaught can have no connexion
with art. <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>  In support of this contention they adduce
the fact that Demades was a waterman and Aeschines
an actor, but both were orators. Their reasoning is
false. For no man can be an orator untaught and it
would be truer to say that these orators learned
oratory late in life than that they never learned at all;
although as a matter of fact Aeschines had an
acquaintance with literature from childhood since his
father was a teacher of literature, while as regards
Demades, it is quite uncertain that he never studied
rhetoric and in any case continuous practice in
speaking was sufficient to bring him to such proficiency as he attained: for experience is the best of all
schools. <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>  On the other hand it may fairly be asserted
that he would have achieved greater distinction, if he
had received instruction: for although he delivered
his speeches with great effect, he never ventured to
write them for others. <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>  Aristotle, it is true, in his
<hi rend="italics">Gryllus</hi><note>A lost treatise, named after Gryllus, the son of
Xenophon.</note> produces some tentative arguments to

<pb id="p.333"/>

the contrary, which are marked by characteristic
ingenuity. On the other hand he also wrote three
books on the art of rhetoric, in the first of which
he not merely admits that rhetoric is an art, but
treats it as a department of politics and also of
logic. <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>  Critolaus and Athenodorus of Rhodes have
produced many arguments against this view, while
Agnon renders himself suspect by the very title of
his book in which he proclaims that he is going to
indict rhetoric. As to the statements of Epicurus
on this subject, they cause me no surprise, for he is
the foe of all systematic training.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="16"/>  These gentlemen talk a great deal, but the
arguments on which they base their statements are
few. I will therefore select the most important of
them and will deal with them briefly, to prevent the
discussion lasting to all eternity. <milestone unit="section" n="17"/>  Their first contention is based on the subject-matter; for they
assert that all arts have their own subject-matter
(which is true) and go on to say that rhetoric has
none, which I shall show in what follows to be false.
 <milestone unit="section" n="18"/>  Another slander is to the effect that no art will
acquiesce in false opinions: since an art must be
based on direct perception, which is always true:
now, say they, rhetoric does give its assent to false
conclusions and is therefore not an art. <milestone unit="section" n="19"/>  I will admit
that rhetoric sometimes substitutes falsehood for
truth, but I will not allow that it does so because its
opinions are false, since there is all the difference
between holding a certain opinion oneself and
persuading someone else to adopt an opinion. For
instance a general frequently makes use of falsehood: Hannibal when hemmed in by Fabius
persuaded his enemy that he was in retreat by

<pb id="p.335"/>

tying brushwood to the horns of oxen, setting fire
to them by night and driving the herds across
the mountains opposite.<note>See Livy, XXII. xvi.</note> But though he deceived
Fabius, he himself was fully aware of the truth.
 <milestone unit="section" n="20"/>  Again when the Spartan Theopompus changed
clothes with his wife and escaped from custody
disguised as a woman, he deceived his guards,
but was not for a moment deceived as to his own
identity.<note>Probably a king of Sparta, 770&ndash;720 B.C.</note> Similarly an orator, when he substitutes
falsehood for the truth, is aware of the falsehood
and of the fact that he is substituting it for the
truth. <milestone unit="section" n="21"/>  He therefore deceives others, but not himself. When Cicero boasted that he had thrown
dust in the eyes of the jury in the case of
Cluentius, he was far from being blinded himself.
And when a painter by his artistic skill makes us
believe that certain objects project from the picture,
while others are withdrawn into the background, he
knows perfectly well that they are really all in the
same plane. <milestone unit="section" n="22"/>  My opponents further assert that every
art has some definite goal towards which it directs its
efforts, but that rhetoric as a rule has no such goal,
while at other times it professes to have an aim, but
fails to perform its promise. They lie: I have already
shown that rhetoric has a definite purpose and have
explained what it is. <milestone unit="section" n="23"/>  And, what is more, the orator
will always make good his professions in this respect,
for he will always speak well. On the other hand
this criticism may perhaps hold good as against those
who think persuasion the end of oratory. But our
orator and his art, as we define it, are independent of
results. The speaker aims at victory, it is true, but if
he speaks well, he has lived up to the ideals of his art,
even if he is defeated. <milestone unit="section" n="24"/>  Similarly a pilot will desire

<pb id="p.337"/>

to bring his ship safe to harbour; but if he is swept
out of his course by a storm, he will not for that
reason cease to be a pilot, but will say in the wellknown words of the old poet<note>Ennius, <hi rend="italics">Ann.</hi> 483 (Vahlen).</note> <quote>Still let me steer
straight on!</quote> <milestone unit="section" n="25"/>  So too the doctor seeks to heal the
sick; but if the violence of the disease or the refusal
of the patient to obey his regimen or any other
circumstance prevent his achieving his purpose, he
will not have fallen short of the ideals of his art,
provided he has done everything according to reason.
So too the orator's purpose is fulfilled if he has spoken
well. For the art of rhetoric, as I shall show later,
is realised in action, not in the result obtained. <milestone unit="section" n="26"/>  From
this it follows that there is no truth in yet another
argument which contends that arts know when they
have attained their end, whereas rhetoric does not.
For every speaker is aware when he is speaking well.
These critics also charge rhetoric with doing what
no art does, namely making use of vices to serve its
ends, since it speaks the thing that is not and excites
the passions. <milestone unit="section" n="27"/>  But there is no disgrace in doing
either of these things, as long as the motive be good:
consequently there is nothing vicious in such action.
Even a philosopher is at times permitted to tell a lie,
while the orator must needs excite the passions, if
that be the only way by which he can lead the
judge to do justice. <milestone unit="section" n="28"/>  For judges are not always
enlightened and often have to be tricked to prevent
them falling into error. Give me philosophers as
judges, pack senates and assemblies with philosophers,
and you will destroy the power of hatred, influence,
prejudice and false witness; consequently there will
be very little scope for eloquence whose value will
lie almost entirely in its power to charm. <milestone unit="section" n="29"/>  But if, as is
<pb id="p.339"/>

the case, our hearers are fickle of mind, and truth is
exposed to a host of perils, we must call in art to aid
us in the fight and employ such means as will help
our case. He who has been driven from the right road
cannot be brought back to it save by a fresh detour.
 <milestone unit="section" n="30"/>  The point, however, that gives rise to the greatest
number of these captious accusations against rhetoric,
is found in the allegation that orators speak indifferently on either side of a case. From which they
draw the following arguments: no art is self-contradictory, but rhetoric does contradict itself; no art
tries to demolish what itself has built, but this does
happen in the operations of rhetoric; or again:&mdash;
rhetoric teaches either what ought to be said or what
ought not to be said; consequently it is not an art
because it teaches what ought not to be said, or
because, while it teaches what ought to be said, it
also teaches precisely the opposite. <milestone unit="section" n="31"/>  Now it is obvious
that all such charges are brought against that type
of rhetoric with which neither good men nor virtue
herself will have anything to do; since if a case be
based on injustice, rhetoric has no place therein and
consequently it can scarcely happen even under the
most exceptional circumstances that an orator, that
is to say, a good man, will speak indifferently on either
side. <milestone unit="section" n="32"/>  Still it is in the nature of things conceivable
that just causes may lead two wise men to take
different sides, since it is held that wise men may fight
among themselves, provided that they do so at the
bidding of reason. I will therefore reply to their
criticisms in such a way that it will be clear that these
arguments have no force even against those who concede the name of orator to persons of bad character.
For rhetoric is not self-contradictory. <milestone unit="section" n="33"/>  The conflict is

<pb id="p.341"/>

between case and case, not between rhetoric and
itself. And even if persons who have learned the
same thing fight one another, that does not prove
that what they have learned is not an art. Were
that so, there could be no art of arms, since gladiators
trained under the same master are often matched
against each other; <milestone unit="section" n="34"/>  nor would the pilot's art exist,
because in sea-fights pilots may be found on different
sides; nor yet could there be an art of generalship,
since general is pitted against general. In the same
way rhetoric does not undo its own work. For the
orator does not refute his own arguments, nor does
rhetoric even do so, because those who regard persuasion as its end, or the two good men whom chance has
matched against one another seek merely for probabilities: and the fact that one thing is more credible
than another, does not involve contradiction between
the two. <milestone unit="section" n="35"/>  There is no absolute antagonism between
the probable and the more probable, just as there is
none between that which is white and that which is
whiter, or between that which is sweet and that
which is sweeter. Nor does rhetoric ever teach that
which ought not to be said, or that which is contrary
to what ought to be said, but solely what ought to be
said in each individual case. <milestone unit="section" n="36"/>  But though the orator
will as a rule maintain what is true, this will not
always be the case: there are occasions when the
public interest demands that he should defend what
is untrue.</p>

<p>The following objections are also put forward in
the second book of Cicero's <hi rend="italics">de Oratore:</hi><note>II. vii. 30.</note>&mdash;<quote>Art deals
with things that are known. But the pleading of an
orator is based entirely on opinion, not on knowledge,
because he speaks to an audience who do not know,

<pb id="p.343"/>

and sometimes himself states things of which he has
no actual knowledge.</quote> <milestone unit="section" n="37"/>  Now one of these points,
namely whether the judges have knowledge of what
is being said to them, has nothing to do with the art
of oratory. The other statement, that art is concerned
with things that are known, does however require an
answer. Rhetoric is the art of speaking well and the
orator knows how to speak well. <milestone unit="section" n="38"/>  <quote>But,</quote> it is urged,
<quote>he does not know whether what he says is true.</quote>
Neither do they, who assert that all things derive
their origin from fire or water or the four elements
or indivisible atoms; nor they who calculate the
distances of the stars or the size of the earth and sun.
And yet all these call the subject which they teach
an art. But if reason makes them seem not merely
to hold opinions but, thanks to the cogency of the
proofs adduced, to have actual knowledge, reason will
do the same service to the orator. <milestone unit="section" n="39"/>  <quote>But,</quote> they say,
<quote>he does not know whether the cause which he has
undertaken is true.</quote> But not even a doctor can tell
whether a patient who claims to be suffering from a
headache, really is so suffering: but he will treat him
on the assumption that his statement is true, and
medicine will still be an art. Again what of the fact
that rhetoric does not always aim at telling the truth,
but always at stating what is probable? The answer
is that the orator knows that what he states is no
more than probable. <milestone unit="section" n="40"/>  My opponents further object
that advocates often defend in one case what they
have attacked in another. This is not the fault of the
art, but of the man. Such are the main points that
are urged against rhetoric; there are others as well,
but they are of minor importance and drawn from the
same sources.

<pb id="p.345"/>
</p>

<p>That rhetoric is an art may, however, <milestone unit="section" n="41"/>  be proved in
a very few words. For if Cleanthes<note>Fr. 790.</note> definition be
accepted that <quote>Art is a power reaching its ends by a
definite path, that is, by ordered methods,</quote> no one
can doubt that there is such method and order in
good speaking: while if, on the other hand, we accept
the definition which meets with almost universal
approval that art consists in perceptions agreeing
and cooperating to the achievement of some useful
end, we shall be able to show that rhetoric lacks none
of these characteristics. <milestone unit="section" n="42"/>  Again it is scarcely necessary
for me to point out that like other arts it is based on
examination and practice. And if logic is an art, as
is generally agreed, rhetoric must also be an art, since
it differs from logic in <hi rend="italics">species</hi> rather than in <hi rend="italics">genus.</hi>
Nor must I omit to point out that where it is possible
in any given subject for one man to act without art
and another with art, there must necessarily be an
art in connexion with that subject, as there must also
be in any subject in which the man who has received
instruction is the superior of him who has not. <milestone unit="section" n="43"/>  But
as regards the practice of rhetoric, it is not merely
the case that the trained speaker will get the better
of the untrained. For even the trained man will
prove inferior to one who has received a better
training. If this were not so, there would not be so
many rhetorical rules, nor would so many great men
have come forward to teach them. The truth of this
must be acknowledged by everyone, but more
especially by us, since we concede the possession of
oratory to none save the good man.<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> since our ideals are so high.</note></p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Some arts, however, are based on examination, that is to say on the knowledge and proper
appreciation of things, as for instance astronomy,

<pb id="p.347"/>

which demands no action, but is content to understand
the subject of its study: such arts are called <hi rend="italics">theoretical.</hi>
Others again are concerned with action: this is their
end, which is realised in action, so that, the action
once performed, nothing more remains to do: these
arts we style <hi rend="italics">practical,</hi> and dancing will provide us
with an example. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>  Thirdly there are others which
consist in producing a certain result and achieve their
purpose in the completion of a visible task: such we
style <hi rend="italics">productive,</hi> and <hi rend="italics">painting</hi> may be quoted as an
illustration. In view of these facts we must come to
the conclusion that, in the main, rhetoric is concerned
with action; for in action it accomplishes that which
it is its duty to do. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>  This view is universally accepted,
although in my opinion rhetoric draws largely on the
two other kinds of art. For it may on occasion be
content with the mere examination of a thing.
Rhetoric is still in the orator's possession even though
he be silent, while if he gives up pleading either
designedly or owing to circumstances over which he
has no control, he does not therefore cease to be an
orator, any more than a doctor ceases to be a doctor
when he withdraws from practice. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>  Perhaps the
highest of all pleasures is that which we derive from
private study, and the only circumstances under
which the delights of literature are unalloyed are
when it withdraws from action, that is to say from
toil, and can enjoy the pleasure of self-contemplation. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But in the results that the orator obtains by writing
speeches or historical narratives, which we may reasonably count as part of the task of oratory, we shall
recognise features resembling those of a productive
art. Still, if rhetoric is to be regarded as one of these
three classes of art, since it is with action that its

<pb id="p.349"/>

practice is chiefly and most frequently concerned, let
us call it an active or administrative art, the two
terms being identical.</p>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="19"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>I quite realise that there is a further question as to whether eloquence derives most from
nature or from education. This question really lies
outside the scope of our inquiry, since the ideal
orator must necessarily be the result of a blend of
both. But I do regard it as of great importance
that we should decide how far there is any real
question on this point. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>  For if we make an absolute
divorce between the two, nature will still be able to
accomplish much without the aid of education,
while the latter is valueless without the aid of
nature. If, on the other hand, they are blended in
equal proportions, I think we shall find that the
average orator owes most to nature, while the perfect orator owes more to education. We may take
a parallel from agriculture. A thoroughly barren
soil will not be improved even by the best cultivation,
while good land will yield some useful produce
without any cultivation; but in the case of really
rich land cultivation will do more for it than its own
natural fertility. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>  Had Praxiteles attempted to carve
a statue out of a millstone, I should have preferred
a rough block of Parian marble to any such statue.
On the other hand, if the same artist had produced
a finished statue from such a block of Parian marble,
its artistic value would owe more to his skill than
to the material. To conclude, nature is the raw
material for education: the one forms, the other is
formed. Without material art can do nothing,
material without art does possess a certain value,
while the perfection of art is better than the best
material.

<pb id="p.351"/>
</p>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>More important is the question whether rhetoric is to be regarded as one of the indifferent arts,
which in themselves deserve neither praise nor blame,
but are useful or the reverse according to the character of the artist; or whether it should, as not a few
even among philosophers hold, be considered as a
virtue. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>  For my own part I regard the practice of rhetoric which so many have adopted in the past and still
follow to-day, as either no art at all, or, as the Greeks
call it, <foreign lang="greek">a)texni/a</foreign> (for I see numbers of speakers without the least pretension to method or literary training rushing headlong in the direction in which
hunger or their natural shamelessness calls them);
or else it is a bad art such as is styled <foreign lang="greek">kakotexni/a.</foreign>
For there have, I think, been many persons and
there are still some who have devoted their powers
of speaking to the destruction of their fellow-men. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There is also an unprofitable imitation of art, a kind
of <foreign lang="greek">mataiotexni/a</foreign> which is neither good nor bad, but
merely involves a useless expenditure of labour, reminding one of the man who shot a continuous
stream of vetch-seeds from a distance through the
eye of a needle, without ever missing his aim, and
was rewarded by Alexander, who was a witness of
the display, with the present of a bushel of vetch-seeds, a most appropriate reward. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>  It is to such men
that I would compare those who spend their whole
time at the expense of much study and energy in
composing declamations, which they aim at making
as unreal as possible. The rhetoric on the other
hand, which I am endeavouring to establish and the
ideal of which I have in my mind's eye, that rhetoric
which befits a good man and is in a word the only
true rhetoric, will be a virtue. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>  Philosophers arrive

<pb id="p.353"/>

at this conclusion by a long chain of ingenious
arguments; but it appears to me to be perfectly
clear from the simpler proof of my own invention
which I will now proceed to set forth.</p>

<p>The philosophers state the case as follows. If
self-consistency as to what should and should not
be done is an element of virtue (and it is to this
quality that we give the name of prudence), the
same quality will be revealed as regards what should
be said and what should not be said, <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>  and if there are
virtues, of which nature has given us some rudimentary sparks, even before we were taught anything
about them, as for instance justice, of which there are
some traces even among peasants and barbarians, it
is clear that man has been so formed from the
beginning as to be able to plead on his own behalf,
not, it is true, with perfection, but yet sufficiently to
show that there are certain sparks of eloquence
implanted in us by nature. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>  The same nature, however, is not to be found in those arts which have no
connexion with virtue. Consequently, since there are
two kinds of speech, the continuous which is called
rhetoric, and the concise which is called dialectic (the
relation between which was regarded by Zeno as being
so intimate that he compared the latter to the closed
fist, the former to the open hand), even the art of
disputation will be a virtue. Consequently there can
be no doubt about oratory whose nature is so much
fairer and franker.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>  I should like, however, to consider the point
more fully and explicitly by appealing to the
actual work of oratory. For how will the orator
succeed in panegyric unless he can distinguish between what is honourable and the reverse? How

<pb id="p.355"/>

can he urge a policy, unless he has a clear perception of what is expedient? How can he plead in
the law-courts, if he is ignorant of the nature of
justice? Again, does not oratory call for courage,
since it is often directed against the threats of
popular turbulence and frequently runs into peril
through incurring the hatred of the great, while
sometimes, as for instance in the trial of Milo, the
orator may have to speak in the midst of a crowd of
armed soldiers? Consequently, if oratory be not a
virtue, perfection is beyond its grasp. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>  If, on the
other hand, each living thing has its own peculiar
virtue, in which it excels the rest or, at any rate, the
majority (I may instance the courage of the lion
and the swiftness of the horse), it may be regarded
as certain that the qualities in which man excels
the rest are, above all, reason and powers of speech.
Why, therefore, should we not consider that the
special virtue of man lies just as much in eloquence as in reason? It will be with justice then
that Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">de Or.</hi> III. xiv. 55.</note> makes Crassus say that <quote>eloquence is
one of the highest virtues,</quote> and that Cicero himself
calls it a virtue in his letters to Brutus<note>Lost.</note> and in
other passages. <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>  <quote>But,</quote> it may be urged, <quote>a bad
man will at times produce an <hi rend="italics">exordium</hi> or a <hi rend="italics">statement
of facts,</hi> and will argue a case in a manner that
leaves nothing to be desired.</quote> No doubt; even a
robber may fight bravely without courage ceasing to
be a virtue; even a wicked slave may bear torture
without a groan, and we may still continue to regard
endurance of pain as worthy of praise. We can
point to many acts which are identical with those of
virtue, but spring from other sources. However,
what I have said here must suffice, as I have already
dealt with the question of the usefulness of oratory.

<pb id="p.357"/>
</p>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="21"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>As to the material of oratory, some have
asserted that it is speech, as for instance Gorgias<note><hi rend="italics">Gorg.</hi> 449 <hi rend="italics">E.</hi></note> in
the dialogue of Plato. If this view be accepted in
the sense that the word <quote>speech</quote> is used of a discourse composed on any subject, then it is not the
material, but the work, just as a statue is the work
of the sculptor. For speeches like statues require
art for their production. If on the other hand
we interpret <quote>speech</quote> as indicating the words
themselves, they can do nothing unless they are
related to facts. Some again hold that the material
consists of persuasive arguments. But they form
part of the work, are produced by art and require
material themselves. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>  Some say that political
questions provide the material. The mistake made
by these lies not in the quality of their opinion
but in its limitation. For political questions are
material for eloquence but not the only material.
 <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>  Some, on the ground that rhetoric is a virtue, make the
material with which it deals to be the whole of life.
Others, on the ground that life regarded as a whole
does not provide material for every virtue, since
most of them are concerned only with departments
of life (justice, courage and self-control each having
their own duties and their own end), would consequently restrict oratory to one particular department
of life and place it in the practical or pragmatic
department of ethics, that is to say the department
of morals which deals with the business of life.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>  For my own part, and I have authority to support
me, I hold that the material of rhetoric is composed of
everything that may be placed before it as a subject
for speech. Plato, if I read him aright, makes
Socrates<note><hi rend="italics">Gorg.</hi> 449 E.</note> say to Gorgias that its material is to be

<pb id="p.359"/>

found in things not words; while in the <hi rend="italics">Phaedrus</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Phaedr.</hi> 261 A.</note>
he clearly proves that rhetoric is concerned not
merely with law-courts and public assemblies, but with
private and domestic affairs as well: from which it is
obvious that this was the view of Plato himself. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>  Cicero
also in a passage<note><hi rend="italics">de Inv.</hi> i. 5.</note> of one of his works, states that
the material of rhetoric is composed of the things
which are brought before it, but makes certain restrictions as to the nature of these things. In
another passage,<note><hi rend="italics">de Or.</hi> I. vi. 21. <quote>I will not demand omniscience from
an orator, although</quote> etc.</note> however, he expresses his opinion
that the orator has to speak about all kinds of things;
I will quote his actual words: <quote>although the very
meaning of the name of orator and the fact that
he professes to speak well seem to imply a promise
and undertaking that the orator will speak with
elegance and fullness on any subject that may be
put before him.</quote> <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>  And in another passage<note><hi rend="italics">ib.</hi> iii. xiv. 54.</note> he says,
<quote>It is the duty of the true orator to seek out, hear,
read, discuss, handle and ponder everything that befalls in the life of man, since it is with this that the
orator is concerned and this that forms the material
with which he has to deal.</quote></p>
<p> <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>  But this material, as we call it, that is to say
the things brought before it, has been criticised by
some, at times on the ground that it is limitless, and
sometimes on the ground that it is not peculiar to
oratory, which they have therefore dubbed a <hi rend="italics">discursive</hi> art, because all is grist that comes to its mill.
 <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>  I have no serious quarrel with these critics, for they
acknowledge that rhetoric is concerned with every
kind of material, though they deny that it has any
peculiar material just because of that material's multiplicity. But in spite of this multiplicity, rhetoric
is not unlimited in scope, and there are other minor
<pb id="p.361"/>

arts whose material is characterised by the same
multiplicity: such for instance is architecture, which
deals with everything that is useful for the purpose
of building: such too is the engraver's art which
works on gold, silver, bronze, iron. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>  As for sculpture,
its activity extends to wood, ivory, marble, glass and
precious stones in addition to the materials already
mentioned. <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>  And things which form the material for
other artists, do not for that reason cease forthwith
to be material for rhetoric. For if I ask what is the
material of the sculptor, I shall be told bronze; and
if I ask what is the material of the maker of vessels
(I refer to the craft styled <foreign lang="greek">xalkeutikh/</foreign> by the Greeks),
the answer will again be bronze: and yet there is
all the difference in the world between vessels and
statues. <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>  Similarly medicine will not cease to be an
art, because, like the art of the gymnast, it prescribes rubbing with oil and exercise, or because it
deals with diet like the art of cookery. <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>  Again, the
objection that to discourse of what is good, expedient
or just is the duty of philosophy presents no difficulty. For when such critics speak of a philosopher,
they mean a good man. Why then should I feel
surprised to find that the orator whom I identify with
the good man deals with the same material? <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>  There
is all the less reason, since I have already shown in
the first book<note>Pref. &sect; 10 <hi rend="italics">sqq.</hi></note> that philosophers only usurped this
department of knowledge after it had been abandoned by the orators: it was always the peculiar
property of rhetoric and the philosophers are really
trespassers. Finally, since the discussion of whatever is brought before it is the task of dialectic,
which is really a concise form of oratory, why should
not this task be regarded as also being the appropriate material for continuous oratory?</p>

<pb id="p.363"/>

<p>There is a further objection made by certain
critics, who say <quote>Well then, <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>  if an orator has to speak on
every subject, he must be the master of all the arts.</quote>
I might answer this criticism in the words of Cicero,<note><hi rend="italics">de Or.</hi> I. vi. 20.</note>
in whom I find the following passage:&mdash;<quote>In my
opinion no one can be an absolutely perfect orator
unless he has acquired a knowledge of all important
subjects and arts.</quote> I however regard it as sufficient that an orator should not be actually ignorant
of the subject on which he has to speak. <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>  For he
cannot have a knowledge of all causes, and yet he
should be able to speak on all. On what then
will he speak? On those which he has studied.
Similarly as regards the arts, he will study those
concerning which he has to speak, as occasion may
demand, and will speak on those which he has
studied.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="16"/>  What then?&mdash;I am asked&mdash;will not a builder
speak better on the subject of building and a musician on music? Certainly, if the orator does not
know what is the question at issue. Even an illiterate peasant who is a party to a suit will speak
better on behalf of his case than an orator who does
not know what the subject in dispute may be. But
on the other hand if the orator receive instruction
from the builder or the musician, he will put forward what he has thus learned better than either,
just as he will plead a case better than his client,
once he has been instructed in it. <milestone unit="section" n="17"/>  The builder and
the musician will, however, speak on the subject of
their respective arts, if there should be any technical
point which requires to be established. Neither will
be an orator, but he will perform his task like an
orator, just as when an untrained person binds up a

<pb id="p.365"/>

wound, he will not be a physician, but he will be
acting as one. <milestone unit="section" n="18"/>  Is it suggested that such topics
never crop up in panegyric, deliberative or forensic
oratory? When the question of the construction of
a port at Ostia came up for discussion, had not the
orator to state his views? And yet it was a subject
requiring the technical knowledge of the architect.
 <milestone unit="section" n="19"/>  Does not the orator discuss the question whether
livid spots and swellings on the body are symptomatic of ill-health or poison? And yet that is a
question for the qualified physician. Will he not
deal with measurements and figures? And yet we
must admit that they form part of mathematics. For
my part I hold that practically all subjects are
under certain circumstances liable to come up for
treatment by the orator. If the circumstances do
not occur, the subjects will not concern him.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="20"/>  We were therefore right in asserting that the
material of rhetoric is composed of everything that
comes before the orator for treatment, an assertion
which is confirmed by the practice of everyday
speech. For when we have been given a subject
on which to speak, we often preface our remarks by
calling attention to the fact that the matter has
been laid before us. <milestone unit="section" n="21"/>  Gorgias indeed felt so strongly
that it was the orator's duty to speak on every subject, that he used to allow those who attended his
lectures to ask him questions on any subject they
pleased. Hermagoras also asserted that the material
of oratory lay in the cause and the questions it
involved, thereby including every subject that can
be brought before it. <milestone unit="section" n="22"/>  If he denies that general
questions<note>See III V. 12&ndash;16.</note> are the concern of oratory, he disagrees
with me: but if they do concern rhetoric, that

<pb id="p.367"/>

supports my contention. For there is nothing which
may not crop up in a cause or appear as a question
for discussion. <milestone unit="section" n="23"/>  Aristotle<note><hi rend="italics">Rhet.</hi> I. iii. 3.</note> himself also by his tripartite
division of oratory, into forensic, deliberative and
demonstrative, practically brought everything into the
orator's domain, since there is nothing that may not
come up for treatment by one of these three kinds of
rhetoric.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="24"/>  A very few critics have raised the question as to
what may be the <hi rend="italics">instrument</hi> of oratory. My definition of an instrument is <hi rend="italics">that without which the material
cannot be brought into the shape necessary for the effecting of our object.</hi> But it is not the art which requires an instrument, but the artist. Knowledge
needs no instruments, for it may be complete
although it produces nothing, but the artist must
have them. The engraver cannot work without his
chisel nor the painter without his brush. I shall
therefore defer this question until I come to treat of
the orator as distinct from his art.</p></div1>

<div1 type="book" n="3"><head>Book III</head>



<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>IN the second book the subject of inquiry
was the nature and the end of rhetoric, and I proved
to the best of my ability that it was an art, that it
was useful, that it was a virtue and that its material
was all and every subject that might come up for
treatment. I shall now discuss its origin, its component parts, and the method to be adopted in handling and forming our conception of each. For most
authors of text-books have stopped short of this,
indeed Apollodorus confines himself solely to forensic
oratory. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>  I know that those who asked me to write
this work were specially interested in that portion on
which I am now entering, and which, owing to the
necessity of examining a great diversity of opinions, at
once forms by far the most difficult section of this work,
and also, I fear, may be the least attractive to my
readers, since it necessitates a dry exposition of rules. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In other portions of this work I have attempted to
introduce a certain amount of ornateness, not, I may
say, to advertise my style (if I had wished to do that, I
could have chosen a more fertile theme), but in order
that I might thus do something to lure our young
men to make themselves acquainted with those principles which I regarded as necessary to the study of
rhetoric: for I hoped that by giving them something
which was not unpleasant to read I might induce a
greater readiness to learn those rules which I feared

<pb id="p.373"/>

might, by the dryness and aridity which must necessarily characterise their exposition, revolt their minds
and offend their ears which are nowadays grown
somewhat over-sensitive. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>  Lucretilus has the same
object in mind when he states that he has set forth
his philosophical system in verse; for you will remember the well known simile which he uses<note>iv. 11. See also i. 936.</note>:&mdash;

and the rest. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>  But I fear that this book will have
too little honey and too much wormwood, and that
though the student may find it a healthy draught,
it will be far from agreeable. I am also haunted by
the further fear that it will be all the less attractive
from the fact that most of the precepts which it contains are not original, but derived from others, and
because it is likely to rouse the opposition of certain
persons who do not share my views. For there are
a large number of writers, who though they are all
moving toward the same goal, have constructed
different roads to it and each drawn their followers
into their own. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>  The latter, however, approve of
the path on which they have been launched whatever its nature, and it is difficult to change the convictions implantted in boyhood, for the excellent reason
that everybody prefers to have learned rather than
to be in process of learning. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>  But, as will appear in
the course of this book, there is an infinite diversity
of opinions among writers on [his subject, since some
have added their own discoveries to those portions
of the art which were still shapeless and unformed,

<pb id="p.375"/>

and subsequently have altered even what was perfectly sound in order to establish a claim to
originality.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>  The first writer after those recorded by the poets
who is said to have taken any steps in the direction
of rhetoric is Empedocles. But the earliest writers
of text-books are the Sicilians, Corax and Tisias,
who were followed by another from the same island,
namely Gorgias of Leontini, whom tradition asserts
to have been the pupil of Empedocles. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>  He, thanks to
his length of days, for he lived to a hundred and nine,
flourished as the contemporary of many rhetoricians,
was consequently the rival of those whom I have
just mentioned, and lived on to survive Socrates.
 <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>  In the same period flourished Thrasymachus of
Chalcedon, Prodicus of Ceos, Protagoras of Abdera,
for whose instructions, which he afterwards published
in a text-book, Euathlus is said to have paid 10,000<note>About &pound;312.</note>
denarii, Hippias of Elis and Alcidamas of Elaea whom
Plato<note><hi rend="italics">Phaedr.</hi> 261 D.</note> calls Palamedes. <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>  There was Antiphon also,
who was the first to write speeches and who also wrote
a text-book and is said to have spoken most eloquently in his own defence; Polycrates, who, <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>  as
have already said, wrote a speech against Socrates,
and Theodorus of Byzantium, who was one of those
called <quote>word-artificers</quote> by Plato.<note><hi rend="italics">Phaedr. 266</hi> E.</note> <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>  Of these Protagoras and Gorgias are said to have been the
first to treat commonplaces, Prodicus, Hippias,
Protagoras and Thrasymachus the first to handle
emotional themes. Cicero in the <hi rend="italics">Brutus</hi><note>vii. 27.</note> states
that nothing in the ornate rhetorical style was
ever committed to writing before Pericles, and that
certain of his speeches are still extant. For my
part I have been unable to discover anything in

<pb id="p.377"/>

the least worthy of his great reputation for eloquence,<note><hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> XII, ii. 22: x. 49, where Quintilian asserts that all
the writings of Pericles have been lost.</note>
and am consequently the less surprised that there
should be some who hold that he never committed
anything to writing, and that the writings circulating under his name are the works of others. <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>  These
rhetoricias had many successors, but the most
famous of (Gorgias' pupils was Isocrates, although
our authorities are not agreed as to who was his
teacher: I however accept the statement of Aristotle
on the subject. <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>  From this point the roads begin to
part. The pupils of Isocrates were eminent in every
branch of study, and when he was already advanced
in years (and he lived to the age of ninety-eight),
Aristotle began to teach the art of rhetoric in his
afternoon lectures,<note>Aristotle gave his esoteric lectures in the morning,
reserving the afternoon for those of more general interest:
see Aul. Gell. xx. v.</note> in which he frequently quoted
the wel-known line from the <hi rend="italics">Philoctetes</hi><note>Probably the <hi rend="italics">Philoctetes</hi> of Euripides. The original line
was <foreign lang="greek">ai)sxro\n siwpa=n, barba/rous d' e)a=n le/gein,</foreign> which Aristotle
travestied by substituting <foreign lang="greek">*)isokra/thn</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">barba/rous.</foreign></note> in the form

<quote rend="blockquote">
<l>Isocrates still speaks. 'Twere shame should I
Sit silent.</l></quote>

Both Aristotle and Isocrates left text-books on
rhetoric, but that by Aristotle is the larger and contains more books. Theodectes, whose work I mentioned above, <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>  also lived about the same period: while
Theophrastus, the pupil of Aristotle, produced some
careful work on rhetoric. After him we may note
that the philosophers, more especially the leaders of
the Stoic and Peripatetic schools, surpassed even
the rhetoricians in the zeal which they devoted to
the subject. <milestone unit="section" n="16"/>  Hermagoras next carved out a path of
his own, which numbers have followed: of his rivals
Athenaeus seems to have approached him most

<pb id="p.379"/>

nearly. Later still much work was done by Apollonius Molon, Areus, Caecilius and Dionysius of
Halicarnassus. <milestone unit="section" n="17"/>  But the rhetoricians who attracted
the most enthusiastic following were Apollodorus of
Pergamus, who was the instructor of Augustus Caesar
at Apollonia, and Theodorus of Gadara, who preferred
to be called Theodorus of Rhodes: it is said that
Tiberius Caesar during his retirement in that island
was a constant attendant at his lectures. <milestone unit="section" n="18"/>  These
rhetoricians taught different systems, and two schools
have arisen known as the Apollodoreans and the
Theodoreans, these names being modelled on the
fashion of nomenclature in vogue with certain schools
of philosophy. The doctrines of Apollodorus are
best learned from his pupils, among whom Cains
Valgius was the best interpreter of his master's views
in Latin, Atticus in Greek. The only text-book by
Apollodorus himself seems to be that addressed to
Matius, as his letter to Domitius does not acknowledge the other works attributed to him. The
writings of Theodorus were more numerous, and
there are some still living who have seen his pupil
Herinagoras.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="19"/>  The first Roman to handle the subject was, to the
best of my belief, Marcus Cato, the famous censor,
while after him Marcus Antonius began a treatise on
rhetoric: I say <quote>began,</quote> because only this one work of
his survives, and that is incomplete. he was followed
by others of less note, whose names I will not omit to
mention, should occasion demand. <milestone unit="section" n="20"/>  But it was Cicero
who shed the greatest light not only on the practice
but on the theory of oratory; for he stands alone
among Romans as combining the gift of actual eloquence with that of teaching the art. With him for

<note>The younger Hermagoras, a rhetorician of the Augustan
age.</note>

<pb id="p.381"/>

predecessor it would be more modest to be silent, but
for the fact that he himself describes his Rhetorica<note><hi rend="italics">sc.</hi> the <hi rend="italics">de Inventione.</hi></note>
as a youthful indiscreition, while in his later works on
oratory he deliberately omitted the discussion of
certain minor points, on which instruction is generally
desired. <milestone unit="section" n="21"/>  Cornificius wrote a good deal, Stertinius
something, and the elder Gallio a little on the same
subject. But Gallio's predecessors, Celsus and Laenas,
and in our own day Verginius, Pliny and Tutilius,
have treated rhetoric with greater accuracy. Even
to-day we have some distinguished writers on oratory
who, if they had dealt with the subject more comprehensively, would have saved me the trouble of
writing this book. But I will spare the names of the
living. The time will come when they will reap their
meed of praise; for their merits will endure to after
generations, while the calunmies of envy will perish
utterly.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="22"/>  Still, although so many writers have preceded me,
I shall not shrink from expressing my own opinion on
certain points. I am not a superstitious adherent of
any school, and as this book will contain a collection
of the opinions of many different authurs, it was desirable to leave it to my readers to selcet what they
will. I shall be content if they praise me for my
industry, wherever there is no scope for originality.</p>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The question as to the origin of rhetoric need
not keep us long. For who can doubt that mankind
received the gift of speech from nature at its birth
(for we can hardly go further back than that), while
the usefulness of speech brought improvement and
study, and finally method and exercise gave perfection? <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>  I cannot understand why some hold that
the elaboration of speech originated in the fact that

<pb id="p.383"/>

those who were in peril owing to some accusation
being made against them, set themselves to speak
with studied care for the purpose of their own defence. This, however, though a more honourable origin, cannot possibly be the earlier, for
accusation necessarily precedes defence. You might
as well assert that the sword was invented for the
purpose of self-defence and not for aggression. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>  It
was, then, nature that created speech, and observation that originated the art of speaking. Just as men
discovered the art of medicine by observing that some
things were healthy and some the reverse, so they
observed that some things were useful and some useless in speaking, and noted them for imitation or
avoidance, while they added certain other precepts
according as their nature suggested. These observations were confirmed by experience and each man
proceeded to teach what he knew. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>  Cicero,<note><hi rend="italics">de Inv.</hi> i. 2.</note> it is
true, attributes the origin of oratory to the founders
of cities and the makers of laws, who must needs
have possessed the gift of eloquence. But why he
thinks this the actual origin, I cannot understand,
since there still exist certain nomad peoples without
cities or laws, and yet members of these peoples perform the duties of ambassadors, accuse and defend,
and regard one man as a better speaker than
another.</p>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The art of oratory, as taught by most authorities, and those the best, consists of five parts:-
<hi rend="italics">invention, arrangement, expression, memory,</hi> and <hi rend="italics">delivery</hi>
or <hi rend="italics">action</hi> (the two latter terms being used synonymously). But all speech expressive of purpose involves
also a <hi rend="italics">subject</hi> and <hi rend="italics">words.</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>  If such expression is brief

<pb id="p.385"/>

and contained within the limits of one sentence, it
may demand nothing more, but longer speeches
require much more. For not only what we say
and how we say it is of importance, but also
the circumstances under which we say it. It is here
that the need of arrangement comes in. But it will
be impossible to say everything demanded by the
subject, putting each thing in its proper place, without
the aid of memory. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>  It is for this reason that memory
forms the fourth department. But a delivery, which
is rendered unbecoming cither by voice or gesture,
spoils everything and almost entirely destroys the
effect of what is said. Delivery therefore must be
assigned the fifth place.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>  Those (and Albutins is among them), who maintain
that there are only three departments on the ground
that memory and delivery (for which I shall give
instructions in their proper place<note>Book II. claps. ii. and iii.</note>) are given us by
nature not by art, may be disregarded, although
Thrasymachus held the same views as regards delivery. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>  Some have added a sixth department, subjoining <hi rend="italics">judgment</hi> to <hi rend="italics">invention,</hi> on the ground that it is
necessary first to <hi rend="italics">invented</hi> and then to <hi rend="italics">exercise our judgment.</hi> For my own part I do not believe that <hi rend="italics">invention</hi>
can exist apart from <hi rend="italics">judgement,</hi> since we do not say that a
speaker has <hi rend="italics">invented</hi> incousistent, two-edged or foolish
arguments, but merely that he has failed to avoid
them. It is true that Cicero in his Rhetorica<note>No such statement is found in the <hi rend="italics">de Inventione.</hi></note> <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>  includes <hi rend="italics">judgment</hi> under <hi rend="italics">mention;</hi> but in my opinion
<hi rend="italics">judgment</hi> is so inextricably mingled with the first
three departments of rhetoric (for without <hi rend="italics">judgment</hi>
neither <hi rend="italics">expression</hi> nor <hi rend="italics">arrangement</hi> are possible), that
I think that even delivery owes much to it. I say
this with all the greater confidence because Cicero in

<pb id="p.387"/>

his <hi rend="italics">Partitiones oratoriae</hi><note>i. 3.</note> arrives at the same five-fold
division of which I have just spoken. For after an
initial division of oratory into <hi rend="italics">invention</hi> and <hi rend="italics">expression,</hi>
he assigns <hi rend="italics">matter and</hi> <hi rend="italics">arrangement</hi> to <hi rend="italics">invention, words</hi>
and <hi rend="italics">delivery</hi> to <hi rend="italics">expression,</hi> and makes <hi rend="italics">memory</hi> a fifth
department common to them all and acting as their
guardian. Again in the <hi rend="italics">Orator</hi><note>14&ndash;17.</note> he states that eloquence consists of five things, and in view of the fact
that this is a later work we may accept this as his
more settled opinion. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>  Others, who seem to me to
have been no less desirous than those mentioned
above to introduce some novelty, have added <hi rend="italics">order,</hi>
although they had already mentioned arrangement,
as though <hi rend="italics">arrangement</hi> was anything else than the
marshalling of arguments in the best possible order.
Dion taught that oratory consisted only of <hi rend="italics">invention</hi>
and <hi rend="italics">arrangement,</hi> but added that each of these departments was twofold in nature, being concerned with
words and things, so that <hi rend="italics">expression</hi> comes under
<hi rend="italics">invention,</hi> and <hi rend="italics">delivery</hi> under <hi rend="italics">arrangement,</hi> while <hi rend="italics">memory</hi>
must be added as a fifth department. The followers
of Theodorus divide <hi rend="italics">invention</hi> into two parts, the one
concerned with <hi rend="italics">matter</hi> and the other with <hi rend="italics">expression,</hi>
and then add the three remaining departments.
 <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>  Hermagoras places <hi rend="italics">judgment, division, order</hi> and
everything relating to <hi rend="italics">expression</hi> under the heading
<hi rend="italics">of economy,</hi> a Greek word meaning the management
of domestic affairs which is applied metaphorically to
oratory and has no Latin equivalent.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>  A further question arises at this point, since
some make <hi rend="italics">memory</hi> follow <hi rend="italics">invention</hi> in the list of
departments, while others make it follow <hi rend="italics">arrangement.</hi>
Personally I prefer to place it fourth. For we ought
not merely to retain in our minds the fruits of our

<pb id="p.389"/>

<hi rend="italics">invention,</hi> in order that we may be able to arrange
them, or to remember our <hi rend="italics">arraangement</hi> in order that
we may express it, but we must also commit to
memory the words which we propose to use, since
<hi rend="italics">memory</hi> embraces everything that goes to the compposition of a speech. <milestone unit="section" n="11"/> There are also not a few who have held that these
are not <hi rend="italics">parts</hi> of rhetoric, but rather <hi rend="italics">duties</hi> to be
observed by the orator. For it is his business to
invent, arrange, express, etcetera. If, however, we
accept this view, we leave nothing to art. <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>  For
although the orator's task is to speak well, rhetoric
is the science of speaking well. Or if we adopt
another view, the task of the artist is to persuade,
while the power of persuasion resides in the art.
Consequently, while it is the duty of the orator to
invent and arrange, <hi rend="italics">intention</hi> and <hi rend="italics">arrangement</hi> may be
regarded as belonging to rhetoric. <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>  At this point
there has been much disagreement, as to whether
these are <hi rend="italics">parts</hi> or <hi rend="italics">duties</hi> of rhetoric, or, as Athenaeus
believes, <hi rend="italics">elements</hi> of rhetoric, which the Greeks call
<foreign lang="greek">stoixei=a</foreign> But they cannot correctly be called <hi rend="italics">elements.</hi> For in that case we should have to regard
them merely as first-principles, like the moisture, fire,
matter or atoms of which the universe is said to be
composed. Nor is it correct to call them duties, since
they are not preformed by others, but perform something themselves. We must therefore conclude that
they are <hi rend="italics">parts.</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>  For since rhetoric is composed of
them, it follows that:, since a whole consists of parts,
these must be parts of the whole which they compose. Those who have called them <hi rend="italics">duties</hi> seem to
me to have been further influenced by the fact that
they wished to reserve the name of <hi rend="italics">parts</hi> for another

<pb id="p.391"/>

division of rhetoric: for they asserted that the <hi rend="italics">parts</hi>
of rhetoric were, <hi rend="italics">panegyric, deliberative</hi> and <hi rend="italics">forensic</hi>
oratory. But if these are parts, they are parts rather
of the material than of the art. <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>  For each of them
contains the whole of rhetoric, since each of them
requires <hi rend="italics">invention, arrangement, expression, memory</hi> and
<hi rend="italics">delivery.</hi> Consequently some writers have thought
it better to say that there are three <hi rend="italics">kinds</hi> of oratory;
those whom Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">de Or.</hi> I. xxxi. 141; <hi rend="italics">Top.</hi> xxiv. 91.</note> has followed seem to me to
have taken the wisest course in terming them <hi rend="italics">kinds
of causes.</hi></p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>There is, however, a dispute as to whether
there are three kinds or more. But it is quite certain that all the most eminent authorities among
ancient writers, following Aristotle who merely substituted the term <hi rend="italics">public</hi> for <hi rend="italics">deliberative,</hi> have been
content with the threefold division. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>  Still a feeble
attempt has been made by certain Greeks and by
Cicero in his <hi rend="italics">de Oratore,</hi><note><hi rend="italics">de Or.</hi> ii. 10 <hi rend="italics">sq.</hi></note> to prove that there are not
merely more than three, but that the number of
kinds is almost past calculation: and this view has
almost been thrust down our throats by the greatest
authority<note>Unknown. Perhaps the elder Pliny.</note> of our own times. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>  Indeed if we place the
task of praise and denunciation in the third division,
on what kind of oratory are we to consider ourselves
to be employed, when we complain, console, pacify,
excite, terrify, encourage, instruct, explain obscurities,
narrate, plead for mercy, thank, congratulate, reproach, abuse, describe, command, retract, express
our desires and opinions, to mention no other of the
many possibilities? <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>  As an adherent of the older view
I must ask for indulgence and must enquire what was
the reason that led earlier writers to restrict a subject

<pb id="p.393"/>

of such variety to such narrow bounds. Those who
think such authorities in error hold that they were
influenced by the fact that these three subjects
practically exhausted the range of ancient oratory.
 <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>  For it was customary to write panegyrics and denunciations and to deliver funeral orations, while the
greater part of their activities was devoted to the
law-courts and deliberative assemblies; as a result,
they say, the old writers of text-books only included
those kinds of oratory which were most in vogue. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>  The
defenders of antiquity point out that there are three
kinds of audience: one which comes simply for the
sake of getting pleasure, a second which meets to receive advice, a third to give judgement on causes.
In the course of a thorough enquiry into the question
it has occurred to me that the tasks of oratory must
either be concerned with the law-courts or with themes
lying outside the law-courts. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>  The nature of the
questions into which enquiry is made in the courts is
obvious. As regards those matters which do not
come before a judge, they must necessarily be concerned either with the past or the future. We praise
or denounce past actions, we deliberate about the
future. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>  Again everything on which we have to
speak must be either certain or doubtful. We praise
or blame what is certain, as our inclination leads us:
on the other hand where doubt exists, in some cases
we are free to form our own views, and it is here that
deliberation comes in, while in others, we leave the
problem to the decision of others, and it is on these
that litigation takes place.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>  Anaximenes regarded forensic and public oratory
as <hi rend="italics">genera</hi> but held that there were seven <hi rend="italics">species</hi>:&mdash;
exhortation, dissuasion, praise, denunciation,

<pb id="p.395"/>

accusation, defence, inquiry, or as he called it <foreign lang="greek">e)cetastiko/n.</foreign>
The first two, however, clearly belong to deliberative, the next to demonstrative, the three last to
forensic oratory. <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>  I say nothing of Protagoras, who
held that oratory was to be divided only into the
following heads: question and answer, command and
entreaty, or as he calls it <foreign lang="greek">eu)xwlh/.</foreign> Plato in his
<hi rend="italics">Sophist</hi><note>222 o.</note> in addition to public and forensic oratory
introduces a third kind which he styles <foreign lang="greek">prosomilhtikh/,</foreign>
which I will permit myself to translate by <quote>conversational.</quote> This is distinct from forensic oratory and
is adapted for private discussions, and we may regard
it as identical with dialectic. <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>  Isocrates<note>Fr. 3 <hi rend="italics">s.</hi></note> held that
praise and blame find a place in every kind of
oratory.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>  The safest and most rational course seems to be to
follow the authority of the majority. There is,
then, as I have said, one kind concerned with praise
and blame, which, however, derives its name from
the better of its two functions and is called <hi rend="italics">laudatory;</hi> others however call it <hi rend="italics">demonstrative.</hi> Both
names are believed to be derived from the Greek in
which the corresponding terms are <hi rend="italics">encomiastic,</hi> and
<hi rend="italics">epideictic.</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>  The term <hi rend="italics">epideictic</hi> seems to me however
to imply display rather than demonstration, and to
have a very different meaning from <hi rend="italics">encomiastic.</hi> For
although it includes laudatory oratory, it does not
confine itself thereto. <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>  Will any one deny the title
of <hi rend="italics">epideictic</hi> to <hi rend="italics">panegyric?</hi> But yet <hi rend="italics">panegyrics</hi> are advisory in form and frequently discuss the interests
of Greece. We may therefore conclude that, while
there are three kinds of oratory, all three devote
themselves in part to the matter in land, and in
part to display. But it may be that Romans are not

<pb id="p.397"/>

borrowing from Greek when they apply the title
<hi rend="italics">demonstrative</hi> but are merely led to do so because
praise and blame demonstrate the nature of the
object with which they are concerned. <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>  The second
kind is deliberative, the third forensic oratory. All
other <hi rend="italics">species</hi> fall under these three <hi rend="italics">genera:</hi> you will
not find one in which we have not to praise or
blame, to advise or dissuade, to drive home or refute
a charge, while conciliation, narration, proof, exaggeration, extenuation and the moulding of the minds
of the audience by exciting or allaying their passions, are common to all three kind of oratory. <milestone unit="section" n="16"/>  I
cannot even agree with those who hold that <hi rend="italics">laudalory</hi> subjects are concerned with the question of
what is honourable, deliberative with the question of
what is expedient, and forensic with tie question of
what is just: the division thus made is easy and
neat rather than true: for all three kinds rely on
the mutual assistance of the other. For we deal
with justice and expediency in <hi rend="italics">punegyric</hi> and with
honour in <hi rend="italics">(deliberations,</hi> while you will rarely find a
<hi rend="italics">forensic</hi> case, in part of which at any rate something
of those questions just mentioned is not to be found.</p>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Every speech however consists at once of that
which is expressed and that which expresses, that is
to say of matter and words. Skill in speaking is
perfected by nature, art and practice, to which some
add a fourth department, namely imitation, which I
however prefer to include under art. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>  There are also
three aims which the orator must always have in
view; he must instruct, move and charm his hearers.
This is a clearer division than that made by those
who divide the task of oratory into that which relates
to things and that which concerns the emotions,

<pb id="p.399"/>

since both of these will not always be present in the
subjects which we shall have to treat. For some
themes are far from calling for any appeal to the
emotions, which, although room cannot always be
found for them, produce a most powerful effect
wherever they do succeed in forcing their way. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>  The
best authorities hold that there are some things in
oratory which require proof and others which do not,
a view with which I agree. Some on the other hand,
as for instance Celsus, think that the orator will not
speak on any subject unless there is some question
involved in it; but the majority of writers on rhetoric
are against him, as is also the threefold division of
oratory, unless indeed to praise what is allowed to be
honourable and to denounce what is admittedly disgraceful are no part of an orator's duty.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>  It is, however, universally agreed that all questions
must be concerned either with something that is
written or something that is not. Those concerned with
what is written are questions of law, those which concern what is not written are questions of fact. Hermagoras calls the latter <hi rend="italics">rational</hi> questions, the former
<hi rend="italics">legal</hi> questions, for so we may translate <foreign lang="greek">logiko/n</foreign> and
<foreign lang="greek">nomiko/n.</foreign> <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>  Those who hold that every question concerns either things or words, mean much the same.</p>

<p>It is also agreed that questions are either <hi rend="italics">definite</hi>
or <hi rend="italics">indefinite. Indefinite</hi> questions are those which may
be maintained or impugned without reference to
persons, time or place and the like. The Greeks call
them <hi rend="italics">theses,</hi> Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">Top.</hi> xxi. 79.</note> <hi rend="italics">propositions,</hi> others <hi rend="italics">general questions
relating to civil life,</hi> others again <hi rend="italics">questions suited for
philosophical discussion,</hi> while Athenaeus calls them
<hi rend="italics">parts of a cause.</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>  Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">Top.</hi> 81; <hi rend="italics">Part. Or.</hi> xviii. 62.</note> distinguishes two kinds,
the one concerned with <hi rend="italics">knowledge,</hi> the other with
<hi rend="italics">action.</hi> Thus <quote>Is the world governed by

<pb id="p.401"/>

providence?</quote> is a question of knowledge, while <quote>Should
we enter politics?</quote> is a question of action. The
first involves three questions, whether a thing
is, what it is, and of what nature: for all these
things may be unknown: the second involves two,
how to obtain power and how to use it. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>  <hi rend="italics">Definite</hi>
questions involve facts, persons, time and the like.
The Greeks call them <hi rend="italics">hypotheses,</hi> while we call them
<hi rend="italics">causes.</hi> In these the whole question turns on persons and facts. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>  An <hi rend="italics">indefinite</hi> question is always the
more comprehensive, since it is from the <hi rend="italics">indefinite</hi>
question that the <hi rend="italics">definite</hi> is derived. I will illustrate
what I mean by an example. The question <quote>Should
a man marry?</quote> is <hi rend="italics">indefinite;</hi> the question <quote>Should
Cato marry?</quote> is <hi rend="italics">definite,</hi> and consequently may be
regarded as a subject for a <hi rend="italics">deliberative</hi> theme. But
even those which have no connexion with particular
persons are generally given a specific reference.
For instance the question <quote>Ought we to take a share
in the government of our country?</quote> is abstract,
whereas <quote>Ought we to take part in the government
of our country under the sway of a tyrant?</quote> has a
specific reference. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>  But in this latter case we may
say that a person is tacitly implied. For the
mention of a tyrant doubles the question, and
there is an implicit admission of time and quality;
but all the same you would scarcely be justified in
calling it a cause or definite question. Those questions which I have styled indefinite are also called
<hi rend="italics">general:</hi> if this is correct, we shall have to call definite
questions <hi rend="italics">special</hi> questions. But in every special
question the general question is implicit, since the
<hi rend="italics">genus</hi> is logically prior to the <hi rend="italics">species.</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>  And perhaps
even in actual causes wherever the notion of quality
comes into question, there is a certain intrusion of

<pb id="p.403"/>

the abstract. <quote>Milo killed Clodius: he was justified
in killing one who lay in wait for him.</quote> Does not
this raise the general question as to whether we
have the right to kill a man who lies in wait for us?
What again of conjectures? May not they be of a
general character, as for instance, <quote>What was the
motive for the crime? hatred? covetousness?</quote> or
<quote>Are we justified in believing confessions made under
torture?</quote> or <quote>Which should carry greater weight,
evidence or argument?</quote> As for definitions, everything that they contain is undoubtedly of a general
nature. <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>  There are some who hold that even those
questions which have reference to persons and particular cases may at times be called <hi rend="italics">theses,</hi> provided
only they are put slightly differently: for instance,
if Orestes be accused, we shall have a <hi rend="italics">cause:</hi> whereas
if it is put as question, namely <quote>Was Orestes rightly
acquitted?</quote> it will be a <hi rend="italics">thesis.</hi> To the same class
as this last belongs the question <quote>Was Cato right
in transferring Marcia to Hortensius?</quote> These persons distinguish a <hi rend="italics">thesis</hi> from a <hi rend="italics">cause</hi> as follows: a
<hi rend="italics">thesis</hi> is theoretical in character, while a <hi rend="italics">cause</hi> has
relation to actual facts, since in the former case we
argue merely with a view to abstract truth, while in
the latter we have to deal with some particular act. <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>  </p>

<p>Some, however, think that general questions are
useless to an orator, since no profit is to be derived
from proving that we ought to marry or to take
part in politics, if we are prevented from so doing
by age or ill health. But not all general questions
are liable to this kind of objection. For instance
questions such as <quote>Is virtue an end in itself?</quote> or
<quote>Is the world governed by providence?</quote> cannot
be countered in this way. <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>  Further in questions

<pb id="p.405"/>

which have reference to a particular person, although
it is not sufficient merely to handle the general
question, we cannot arrive at any conclusion on
the special point until we have first discussed the
general question. For how is Cato to deliberate
<quote>whether he personally is to marry,</quote> unless the
general question <quote>whether marriage is desirable</quote>
is first settled? And how is he to deliberate
<quote>whether he should marry Marcia,</quote> unless it is
proved that it is the duty of Cato to marry? <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>  There
are, however, certain books attributed to Hermagoras which support this erroneous opinion, though
whether the attribution is spurious or whether they
were written by another Hermagoras is an open
question. For they cannot possibly be by the
famous Hermagoras, who wrote so much that was
admirable on the art of rhetoric, since, as is clear
from the first book of the Rhetorica of Cicero,<note><hi rend="italics">de Inv.</hi> i. 6.</note> he
divided the material of rhetoric into <hi rend="italics">theses and causes.</hi>
Cicero objects to this division, contends that <hi rend="italics">theses</hi>
have nothing to do with an orator, and refers all
this class of questions to the philosophers. <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>  But
Cicero has relieved me of any feeling of shame
that I might have in controverting his opinion, since
he has not only expressed his disapproval of his Rhetorica, but in the <hi rend="italics">Orator,</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Orator</hi> xiv. 45.</note> the <hi rend="italics">de Oratore</hi> and the
<hi rend="italics">Topica</hi><note><hi rend="italics">de Or.</hi> iii. 30; <hi rend="italics">Top.</hi> 21.</note> instructs us to abstract such discussions
from particular persons and occasions, <quote>because
we can speak more fully on general than on special
themes, and because what is proved of the whole
must also be proved of the part.</quote> <milestone unit="section" n="16"/>  In all general
questions, however, the essential <hi rend="italics">basis</hi> is the same as
in a cause or definite question. It is further
pointed out that there are some questions which

<pb id="p.407"/>

concern <quote>things in themselves,</quote> while others have
a particular reference; an example of the former
will be the question <quote>Should a man marry?</quote> of the
latter <quote>Should an old man marry?</quote>; or again the
question whether a man is brave will illustrate the
first, while the question whether he is braver than
another will exemplify the second.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="17"/>  Apollodorus defines a <hi rend="italics">cause</hi> in the following terms
(I quote the translation of his pupil Valgius):&mdash;<quote>A
cause is a matter which in all its parts bears on the
question at issue,</quote> or again <quote>a cause is a matter of
which the question in dispute is the object.</quote>
He then defines a <hi rend="italics">matter</hi> in the following terms:&mdash;
" A matter is a combination of persons, circumstances
of place and time, motives, means, incidents, acts,
instruments, speeches, the letter and the spirit of the
law. <milestone unit="section" n="18"/>  Let us then understand a <hi rend="italics">cause</hi> in the sense of
the Greek <hi rend="italics">hypothesis</hi> or subject, and a <hi rend="italics">matter</hi> in the
sense of the Greek <hi rend="italics">peristasis</hi> or collection of circumstances. But some, however, have defined a <hi rend="italics">cause</hi> in
the same way that Apollodorus defines a <hi rend="italics">matter.</hi>
Isocrates<note>Fr. 13 Sheehan.</note> on the other hand defines a <hi rend="italics">cause</hi> as <hi rend="italics">some
definite question concerned with some point of civil affairs,
or a dispute in which definite persons are involved;</hi> while
Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">Top.</hi> xxi. 80.</note> uses the following words:&mdash;<quote>A <hi rend="italics">cause</hi> may be
known by its being concerned with certain definite
persons, circumstances of time and place, actions, and
business, and will relate either to all or at any rate to
most of these.</quote></p>
<p>VI.<note>This chapter is highly technical and of little interest for
the most part to any save professed students of the technique
of the ancient schools of rhetoric. Its apparent obscurity will,
however, he found to disappear on careful analysis. The one
passage of general interest it contains is to be found in the
extremely ingenious fictitious theme discussed in sections
96 <hi rend="italics">sqq.</hi></note> Since every cause, then, has a certain essential
<hi rend="italics">basis</hi><note>There is no exact English equivalent for <hi rend="italics">status. Basis</hi> or
<hi rend="italics">ground</hi> are perhaps the nearest equivalents.</note> on which it rests, before I proceed to set forth
how each kind of cause should be handled, I think I

<pb id="p.409"/>

should first examine a question that is common to all
of them, namely, what is meant by <hi rend="italics">basis,</hi> whence it
is derived and how many and of what nature such
<hi rend="italics">bases</hi> may be. Some, it is true, have thought that
they were peculiar merely to forensic themes, but
their ignorance will stand revealed when I have
treated of all three kinds of oratory. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>  That which I
call the <hi rend="italics">basis</hi> some style the <hi rend="italics">constitution,</hi> others the
<hi rend="italics">question,</hi> and others again <hi rend="italics">that which may be inferred
from the question,</hi> while Theodorus calls it the most <hi rend="italics">general head,</hi> <foreign lang="greek">kefa/laion genikw/taton,</foreign> to which everything
must be referred. These different names, however, all
mean the same thing, nor is it of the least importance
to students by what special name things are called,
as long as the thing itself is perfectly clear. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>  The
Greeks call this essential <hi rend="italics">basis</hi> <foreign lang="greek">sta/sis,</foreign> a name which
they hold was not invented by Hermagoras, but
according to some was introduced by Naucrates, the
pupil of Isocrates, according to others by Zopyrus of
Clazomenae, although Aeschines in his speech against
Ctesiphon<note>&sect; 206.</note> seems to employ the word, when he asks
the jury not to allow Demosthenes to be irrelevant
but to keep him to the <hi rend="italics">stasis</hi> or <hi rend="italics">basis</hi> of the case. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The term seems to be derived from the fact that it
is on it that the first collision between the parties to
the dispute takes place, or that it forms the <hi rend="italics">basis or
standing</hi> of the whole case. So much for the origin of
the name. Now for its nature. Some have defined
the <hi rend="italics">basis</hi> as being the <hi rend="italics">first conflict of the causes.</hi> The
idea is correct, but the expression is faulty. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>  For the
essential <hi rend="italics">basis</hi> is not the first conflict, which we may
represent by the clauses <quote>You did such and such
a thing</quote> and <quote>I did not do it.</quote> It is rather the
kind of question which arises from the first conflict,

<pb id="p.411"/>

which we may represent as follows. <quote>You did it,</quote>
<quote>I did not,</quote> <quote>Did he do it?,</quote> or <quote>You did this,</quote> <quote>I
did not do this,</quote> <quote>What did he do?</quote> It is clear
from these examples, that the first sort of question
depends on <hi rend="italics">conjecture,</hi> the second on <hi rend="italics">definition,</hi> and
that the contending parties rest their respective cases
on these points: the <hi rend="italics">bases</hi> of these questions will
therefore be of a <hi rend="italics">conjectural</hi> or <hi rend="italics">definitive</hi> character
respectively. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>  Suppose it should be asserted that
sound is the conflict between two bodies, the statement would in my opinion be erroneous. For sound
is not the actual conflict, but a result of the conflict.
The error is, however, of small importance: for the
sense is clear, whatever the expression. But this
trivial mistake has given rise to a very serious error
in the minds of those who have not understood what
was meant: for on reading that the essential <hi rend="italics">basis</hi> was
the first conflict, they immediately concluded that the
<hi rend="italics">basis</hi> was always to be taken from the first question,
which is a grave mistake. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>  For every question has
its <hi rend="italics">basis,</hi> since every question is based on assertion by
one party and denial by another. But there are some
questions which form an essential part of causes, and
it is on these that we have to express an opinion;
while others are introduced from without and are,
strictly speaking, irrelevant, although they may
contribute something of a subsidiary nature to the
general contention. It is for this reason that there
are said to be several questions in one matter of
dispute. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>  Of these questions it is often the most
trivial which occupies the first place. For it is a
frequent artifice to drop those points in which we
place least confidence, as soon as we have dealt with
them; sometimes we make a free gift of them to our

<pb id="p.413"/>

opponents, while sometimes we are content to use
them as a step to arguments which are of greater
importance. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>  A simple cause, however, although it
may be defended in various ways, cannot have more
than one point on which a decision has to be given,
and consequently the <hi rend="italics">basis</hi> of the cause will be that
point which the orator sees to be the most important
for him to make and on which the judge sees that he
must fix all his attention. For it is on this that the
cause will stand or fall. On the other hand questions
may have more <hi rend="italics">bases</hi> than one.<note>See &sect; 21.</note> <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>  A brief example
will show what I mean. When the accused says
<quote>Admitting that I did it, I was right to do it,</quote> he
makes the <hi rend="italics">basis</hi> one of <hi rend="italics">quality;</hi> but when he adds <quote>but
I did not do it,</quote> he introduces an element of
<hi rend="italics">conjecture.</hi><note>See &sect; 30 <hi rend="italics">aqq.</hi></note> But denial of the facts is always the
stronger line of defence, and therefore I conceive the
<hi rend="italics">basis</hi> to reside in that which I should say, if I were
confined to one single line of argument. <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>  We are
right therefore in speaking of the first conflict of
<hi rend="italics">causes</hi> in contradistinction to the conflict of <hi rend="italics">questions.</hi>
For instance in the first portion of his speech on
behalf of Rabirius Postumus Cicero contends that the
action cannot lie against a Roman knight, while in
the second he asserts that no money ever came into
his client's hands. Still I should say that the <hi rend="italics">basis</hi>
was to be found in the latter as being the stronger of
the two. <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>  Again in the case of Milo I do not consider
that the conflict is raised by the opening questions, but
only when the orator devotes all his powers to prove that
Clodius lay in wait for Milo and was therefore rightly
killed. The point on which above all the orator must
make up his mind, even although he may be going to

<pb id="p.415"/>

take up various lines of argument in support of his
case, is this: what is it that he wishes most to impress
upon the mind of the judge? But although this
should be the first point for his consideration, it does
not follow that it should be the first that he will make
in his actual speech.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>  Others have thought that the <hi rend="italics">basis</hi> lay in the first
point raised by the other side in its defence. Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">Top.</hi> xxv. 93.</note>
expresses this view in the following words:&mdash;<quote>the
argument on which the defence first takes its stand
with a view to rebutting the charge.</quote> This involves
a further question as to whether the <hi rend="italics">basis</hi> can only be
determined by the defence. Cornelius Celsus is
strongly against this view, and asserts that the <hi rend="italics">basis</hi>
is derived not from the denial of the charge, but from
him who affirms his proposition. Thus if the accused
denies that anyone has been killed, the <hi rend="italics">basis</hi> will
originate with the accuser, because it is the latter
who desires to prove: if on the other hand the
accused asserts that the homicide was justifiable, the
burden of proof has been transferred and the <hi rend="italics">basis</hi>
will proceed from the accused and be affirmed by him.
I do not, however, agree. <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>  For the contrary is nearer
to the truth, that there is no point of dispute if the
defendant makes no reply, and that consequently the
<hi rend="italics">basis</hi> originates with the defendant. <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>  But in my
opinion the origin of the <hi rend="italics">basis</hi> varies and depends on
the circumstances of the individual case. For instance
in conjectural causes the affirmation may be regarded
as determining the <hi rend="italics">basis,</hi> since <hi rend="italics">conjecture</hi> is employed
by the plaintiff rather than the defendant, and consequently some have styled the <hi rend="italics">basis</hi> originated
by the latter <hi rend="italics">negative.</hi> Again in any <hi rend="italics">syllogism</hi><note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> where the law forms the major premise, while the
minor premiss is the act which is brought under the law.</note>
the whole of the reasoning proceeds from him who

<pb id="p.417"/>

affirms. <milestone unit="section" n="16"/>  But on the other hand he who in such cases<note>Conjectural causes and the syllogism.</note>
denies appears to impose the burden of dealing with
such <hi rend="italics">bases</hi> upon his opponent. For if he says <quote>I did not
do it,</quote> he will force his opponent to make use of con-
<hi rend="italics">jecture,</hi> and again, if he says <quote>The law is against you,</quote>
he will force him to employ the <hi rend="italics">syllogism.</hi> Therefore
we must admit that a <hi rend="italics">basis</hi> can originate in denial.
All the same we are left with our previous conclusion
that the <hi rend="italics">basis</hi> is determined in some cases by the
plaintiff, in some by the defendant. <milestone unit="section" n="17"/>  Suppose the
accuser to affirm that the accused is guilty of homicide: if the accused denies the charge, it is he who
will determine the <hi rend="italics">basis.</hi> Or again, if he admits that
he has killed a man, but states that the victim was
an adulterer and justifiably killed (and we know that
the law permits homicide under these circumstances),
there is no matter in dispute, unless the accuser has
some answer to make. Suppose the accuser does
answer however and deny that the victim was guilty
of adultery, it will be the accuser that denies, and it
is by him that the <hi rend="italics">basis</hi> is determined. The <hi rend="italics">basis,</hi>
then, will originate in the first denial of facts, but
that denial is made by the accuser and not the
accused. <milestone unit="section" n="18"/>  Again the same question may make the
same person either accuser or accused. <quote>He who has
exercised the profession of an actor, is under no circumstances to be allowed a seat in the first fourteen
rows of the theatre.</quote><note>Reserved for <hi rend="italics">eguites.</hi></note> An individual who had performed before the praetor in his private gardens, but
had never been presented on the public stage, has
taken his seat in one of the fourteen rows. <milestone unit="section" n="19"/>  The
accuser of course affirms that he has exercised the
profession of an actor: the accused denies that he has
exercised the profession. The question then arises

<pb id="p.419"/>

as to the meaning of the <quote>exercise of the profession
of actor.</quote> If he is accused under the law regarding
the seats in the theatre, the denial will proceed from
the accused; if on the other hand he is turned out
of the theatre and demands compensation for assault,
the denial will be made by the accuser. <milestone unit="section" n="20"/>  The view
of the majority of writers<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> that the defendant makes the <hi rend="italics">basis</hi> or <hi rend="italics">status. See</hi>
&sect; 13.</note> on this subject will,
however, hold good in most cases. Some have evaded
these problems by saying that a <hi rend="italics">basis</hi> is that which
emerges from affirmations and denials, such as <quote>You
did it,</quote> <quote>I did not do it,</quote> or <quote>I was justified in
doing it.</quote> <milestone unit="section" n="21"/>  But let us see whether this is the <hi rend="italics">basis</hi>
itself or rather that in which the <hi rend="italics">basis</hi> is to be found.
Hermagoras calls a <hi rend="italics">basis</hi> that which enables the
matter in question to be understood and to which the
proofs of the parties concerned will also be directed.
My own opinion has always been that, whereas there
are frequently different <hi rend="italics">bases</hi> of questions in connexion
with a cause, the <hi rend="italics">basis</hi> of the cause itself is its most
important point on which the whole matter turns.
If anyone prefers to call that the <hi rend="italics">general question</hi> or
<hi rend="italics">general head</hi> of the cause, I shall not quarrel with him,
any more than I have done hitherto if he produced
a different technical term to express the same thing,
although I know that whole volumes have been
written on such disputes. I prefer however to call
it the <hi rend="italics">basis.</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="22"/>  There is the greatest possible disagreement among writers about this as about everything
else, but in this case as elsewhere they seem to me to
have been misled by a passion for saying something
different from their fellow-teachers. As a result
there is still no agreement as to the number and
names of <hi rend="italics">bases,</hi> nor as to which are general and which
special.

<pb id="p.421"/>
</p>

<p>To begin with Aristotle<note><hi rend="italics">Categ.</hi> ii. 7.</note> lays down that there are
ten categories on which every question seems to turn.
 <milestone unit="section" n="23"/>  First there is <foreign lang="greek">ou)si/a</foreign> which Plautus calls <hi rend="italics">essence,</hi> the
only available translation: under this category we inquire <hi rend="italics">whether a thing is.</hi> Secondly there is <hi rend="italics">quality,</hi>
the meaning of which is self-evident. Third comes
<hi rend="italics">quantity,</hi> which was subdivided by later philosophers
as dealing with two questions as to <hi rend="italics">magnitude</hi> and
<hi rend="italics">number.</hi> Next <hi rend="italics">relation,</hi> involving questions of <hi rend="italics">competence</hi><note>See &sect;&sect; 52, 68 <hi rend="italics">sqq.,</hi> 84&ndash;86, which make the meaning of
<hi rend="italics">translatio</hi> fairly clear. No exact rendering is satisfactory.
Literally it means <quote>transference of the charge</quote>: the sense
is virtually the same as that of <hi rend="italics">exceptio</hi> (a plea made by
defendant in bar of plaintiff's action). <quote>Exception</quote> is
too unfamiliar and technical a term. <quote>Competence,</quote> despite
its vagueness, is perhaps the least unsatisfactory rendering.</note> and <hi rend="italics">comparison.</hi> This is followed by <hi rend="italics">when</hi>
and <hi rend="italics">where.</hi> Then come <hi rend="italics">doing, suffering</hi> and <hi rend="italics">possessing,</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="24"/> which for example are concerned with a person's being
armed or clothed. Lastly comes <foreign lang="greek">kei=sqai</foreign> or <hi rend="italics">position,</hi>
which means to be in a certain position, such for instance as being warm, standing or angry. Of these
categories the first four concern <hi rend="italics">bases,</hi> the remainder
concern only certain <hi rend="italics">topics for argument.</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="25"/>  Others
make the number of categories to be nine. <hi rend="italics">Person,</hi>
involving questions concerning the mind, body or
external circumstances, which clearly has reference
to the means by which we establish <hi rend="italics">conjecture</hi> or
<hi rend="italics">quality. Time,</hi> or <foreign lang="greek">xro/nos,</foreign> from which we get questions
such as whether a child is born a slave, if his mother
is delivered of him while assigned<note><hi rend="italics">addicti</hi> were not technically <hi rend="italics">servi,</hi> though in a virtual
condition of servitude, being the bondsmen of their creditors
till their debt was paid.</note> to her creditors.
<hi rend="italics">Place,</hi> from which we get such disputes as to whether
it is permissible to kill a tyrant in a temple, or
whether one who has hidden himself at home can be
regarded as an exile. <milestone unit="section" n="26"/>  Then comes <hi rend="italics">time</hi> in another
sense, called <foreign lang="greek">kairo/s</foreign> by the Greeks, by which they
refer to a period of time, such as summer or winter;

<pb id="p.423"/>

under this heading come problems such as that about
the man who held high revel in a time of pestilence.<note>There is no other reference to this theme.</note>
<hi rend="italics">Action</hi> or <foreign lang="greek">pra=cis,</foreign> to which they refer questions as to
whether an act was committed wittingly or unwittingly, by accident or under compulsion and the like.
<hi rend="italics">Number,</hi> which falls under the category of quantity,
under which come questions such as whether the
state owes Thrasybulus thirty talents for ridding it of
the same number of tyrants. <milestone unit="section" n="27"/>  <hi rend="italics">Cause,</hi> under which
heading come a large number of disputes, whenever
a fact is not denied, but the defence pleads that the
act was just and reasonable. <foreign lang="greek">tro/pos</foreign> or <hi rend="italics">manner,</hi> which
is involved when a thing is said to have been done in
one way when it might have been done in another:
under this category come cases of such as that of the
adulterer who is scourged with thongs or starved to
death.<note>An adulterer caught <hi rend="italics">flagrante delicto</hi> might be killed by
the husband or beaten. But to starve him to death in cold
blood would be illegal.</note> <hi rend="italics">Opportunity</hi> for action, the meaning of which
is too obvious to need explanation or illustration:
the Greeks however call it <foreign lang="greek">e)/rgwn a)formai/</foreign> <milestone unit="section" n="28"/>  These
authorities like Aristotle hold that no question can
arise which does not come under one of these heads.
Some subtract two of them, namely <hi rend="italics">number</hi> and <hi rend="italics">opportunity,</hi> and substitute for what I have called <hi rend="italics">action,
things,</hi> or in Greek <foreign lang="greek">pra/gmata.</foreign> I have thought it sufficient to notice these doctrines, for fear someone might
complain of their omission. Still I do not consider
that <hi rend="italics">bases</hi> are sufficiently determined by these categories, nor that the latter cover every possible kind
of topic, as will be clear to any that read carefully
what I have to say on both points. For there will be
found to be many topics that are not covered by
these categories.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="29"/>  I find it stated in many authors that some rhetoricians only recognise one kind of <hi rend="italics">basis,</hi> the <hi rend="italics">con-</hi>

<pb id="p.425"/>

<hi rend="italics">jectural.</hi> But they have not mentioned who these
rhetoricians are nor have I been able to discover.
They are however stated to have taken this view on
the ground that all our knowledge is a matter of
inference from indications. On this line of reasoning they might regard all <hi rend="italics">bases</hi> as <hi rend="italics">qualitative,</hi> because
we inquire into the nature of the subject in every
case. But the adoption of either view leads to inextricable confusion. <milestone unit="section" n="30"/>  Nor does it matter whether one
recognises only one kind of <hi rend="italics">basis</hi> or none at all, if
all causes are of the same nature. <hi rend="italics">Coniectura</hi> is derived from <hi rend="italics">conicere</hi> <quote><hi rend="italics">to</hi> throw together,</quote> because it
implies the concentration of the reason on the truth.
For this reason interpreters of dreams and all other
phenomena are called <hi rend="italics">coniectores</hi> <quote>conjecturers.</quote> But
the <hi rend="italics">conjectural basis</hi> has received more names than
one, as will appear in the sequel.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="31"/>  Some have recognised only two <hi rend="italics">bases.</hi> Archedemus<note>Fr. 11, Arnim.</note> for instance admits only the <hi rend="italics">conjectural</hi> and
<hi rend="italics">definitive</hi> and refuses to admit the <hi rend="italics">qualitative,</hi> since
he held that questions of <hi rend="italics">quality</hi> take the form of
<quote>What is unfair? what is unjust? what is disobedience?</quote> which he terms questions about <hi rend="italics">identity</hi> and
<hi rend="italics">difference.</hi><note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> the question may be stated <quote>Does it conform to
our conception of injustice or is it something different?</quote>
Questions of quality are regarded as questions of definition.</note> <milestone unit="section" n="32"/>  A different view was held by those who
likewise only admitted two <hi rend="italics">bases,</hi> but made them
the <hi rend="italics">negative</hi> and <hi rend="italics">juridical.</hi> The <hi rend="italics">negative basis is</hi>
identical with that which we call the <hi rend="italics">conjectural, to</hi>
which some give the name of <hi rend="italics">negative</hi> absolutely,
others only in part, these latter holding that <hi rend="italics">conjecture</hi> is employed by the accuser, <hi rend="italics">denial</hi> only by the
accused. <milestone unit="section" n="33"/>  The <hi rend="italics">juridical is</hi> that known in Greek as
<foreign lang="greek">dikaiologiko/s</foreign> But just as Archedemus would not
recognise the <hi rend="italics">qualitative basis,</hi> so these reject the
<hi rend="italics">definitive</hi> which they include in <hi rend="italics">the juridical,</hi> holding

<pb id="p.427"/>

that in these questions we have to enquire whether
it is just that the act with which the accused is
charged should be called sacrilege or theft or madness. <milestone unit="section" n="34"/>  Pamplihlus held this opinion but subdivided
<hi rend="italics">quality</hi> into several different species. The majority
of later writers have classified <hi rend="italics">bases</hi> as follows, involving however no more than a change of names:&mdash;
those dealing with ascertained facts and those
dealing with matters where there is a doubt. For
a thing must either be certain or uncertain: if
it is uncertain, the <hi rend="italics">basis</hi> will be <hi rend="italics">conjectural;</hi> if
certain, it will be some one of the other <hi rend="italics">bases.</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="35"/> Apollodorus says the same thing when he states that
a question must either lie in <hi rend="italics">things external,</hi><note><hi rend="italics">e.g.</hi> circumstantial evidence.</note> which give
play to <hi rend="italics">conjecture,</hi> or in our own <hi rend="italics">opinions:</hi> the former
he calls <foreign lang="greek">pragmatiko/s</foreign> the latter <foreign lang="greek">peri\ e)nnoi/as</foreign> The same
is said by those who employ the terms <foreign lang="greek">a)prolhpto\s</foreign><note><foreign lang="greek">a)prolhpto/s</foreign> lit. = unpresumed.</note>
and <foreign lang="greek">prolhptiko/s,</foreign> that is to say <hi rend="italics">doubtful</hi> and <hi rend="italics">presumptive,</hi> by this latter term meaning those facts which
are beyond a doubt. <milestone unit="section" n="36"/>  Theodorus agrees with them,
for he holds that the question is either as to whether
such and such a thing is really so, or is concerned
with the <hi rend="italics">accidents</hi> of something which is an admitted
fact: that is to say it is either <foreign lang="greek">peri\ ou)si/as</foreign> or
<foreign lang="greek">peri\ sumbebhko/twn</foreign> For in all these cases the first
<hi rend="italics">basis</hi> is <hi rend="italics">conjectural,</hi> while the second belongs to one
of the other classes. As for these other classes of
<hi rend="italics">basis,</hi> Apollodorus holds that there are two, one concerned with <hi rend="italics">quality</hi> and the other with the <hi rend="italics">names of</hi>
things, that is to say a <hi rend="italics">definitive basis.</hi> Theodorus
makes them four, concerned with <hi rend="italics">existence, quality,
quantity</hi> and <hi rend="italics">relation.</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="37"/>  There are some too who make
questions of <hi rend="italics">identity</hi> and <hi rend="italics">difference</hi> come under the
head of <hi rend="italics">quality,</hi> others who place it under the head

<pb id="p.429"/>

of <hi rend="italics">definition.</hi> Posidonius<note>Fr. p. 232, Bake.</note> divides them into two
classes, those concerned with <hi rend="italics">words</hi> and those concerned with <hi rend="italics">things.</hi> In the first case he thinks that
the question is whether a word has any meaning; if
so, what is its meaning, how many meanings has it,
and how does it come to mean what it means? In
the latter case, we employ <hi rend="italics">conjecture,</hi> which he calls
<foreign lang="greek">kat' ai)/sqhsin,</foreign> or inference from perception, <hi rend="italics">quality,
definition</hi> which he calls <foreign lang="greek">kat' e)/nnoian,</foreign> or rational inference, and <hi rend="italics">relation.</hi> Hence also comes the division
into things written and unwritten. <milestone unit="section" n="38"/>  Even Cornelius
Celsus stated that there were two general <hi rend="italics">bases,</hi> one
concerned with the question <hi rend="italics">whether a thing is,</hi> the
other with the question <hi rend="italics">of what kind it is.</hi> He included <hi rend="italics">definition</hi> under the first of these, because
enquiry may equally be made as to whether sacrilege
has been committed, when a man denies that he
has stolen anything from a temple, and when he
admits that he has stolen private money from a
temple. He divides <hi rend="italics">quality into fact</hi> and the <hi rend="italics">letter
of the law.</hi> Under the head of the <hi rend="italics">letter of the law</hi> he
places four classes, excluding questions of <hi rend="italics">competence:</hi><note><hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> &sect; 23; <hi rend="italics">translatio</hi> and <hi rend="italics">exceptio</hi> are virtually identical.
The four classes are Intention, Ambiguity, Contradictory
Laws, Syllogism.</note> <hi rend="italics">quantity</hi> and <hi rend="italics">intention</hi> he places under the
head of <hi rend="italics">conjecture.</hi><note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> the <hi rend="italics">conjectural basis</hi> concerned with questions of fact.</note> <milestone unit="section" n="39"/>  There is also another method of
dividing <hi rend="italics">bases</hi> into two classes: according to this
disputes are either about <hi rend="italics">substance</hi> or <hi rend="italics">quality,</hi> while
<hi rend="italics">quality</hi> is treated either in its most general sense or
in its special senses. <milestone unit="section" n="40"/>  <hi rend="italics">Substance</hi> is dealt with by <hi rend="italics">conjecture:</hi> for in enquiring into anything, we ask
whether it has been done, is being done, or is likely
to be done, and sometimes also consider its <hi rend="italics">intention:</hi>
this method is preferable to that adopted by those
who style the conjectural <hi rend="italics">basis</hi> a <hi rend="italics">basis of fact,</hi> as
though we only enquired into the past and what has

<pb id="p.431"/>

actually been done. <milestone unit="section" n="41"/>  The consideration of <hi rend="italics">quality</hi>
under its most general aspect rarely comes up in
the courts; I refer to questions such as <quote>whether
that is honourable which is generally praised.</quote> With
regard to the special aspects of <hi rend="italics">quality,</hi> questions
sometimes occur about some common term, such as
whether sacrilege has been committed when a man
has stolen private money from a temple, or about
some act with a definite name, when there is no
doubt either as to the commission or the nature of
the act. Under this heading come all questions
about what is honourable, just or expedient. <milestone unit="section" n="42"/>  These
<hi rend="italics">bases</hi> are said to contain others as well, because
<hi rend="italics">quantity</hi> is sometimes concerned with <hi rend="italics">conjectural bases,</hi>
as in the question whether the sun is bigger than
the earth, and sometimes with <hi rend="italics">qualitative bases,</hi> as in
the question what reward or punishment it would
be just to assign to some particular person, while
questions of <hi rend="italics">competence</hi> undoubtedly are concerned
with <hi rend="italics">quality,</hi> and <hi rend="italics">definition</hi> with questions of <hi rend="italics">competence.</hi><note>See &sect; 11 and the case cited in 38, where the accused
would argue that he was guilty not of sacrilege, but of
simple theft.</note> <milestone unit="section" n="43"/>  <hi rend="italics">ratiocinative
basis or syllogism</hi><note>When we argue that a certain case comes under a certain law. <hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> &sect; 15.</note> and the majority of questions dealing with the <hi rend="italics">letter of the law</hi> and <hi rend="italics">intention</hi> are based
on equity, with the exception that this last question
sometimes admits of <hi rend="italics">conjecture</hi> as, for instance, concerning the <hi rend="italics">intentions</hi> of the legislator: <hi rend="italics">ambiguity,</hi>
however, must always be explained by <hi rend="italics">conjecture,</hi>
because as it is clear that the words admit of two
interpretations the only question is as to the
<hi rend="italics">intention.</hi></p>
<p> <milestone unit="section" n="44"/>  A large number of writers recognise <hi rend="italics">general bases;</hi>
Cicero adopts them in his <hi rend="italics">Orator,</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Or.</hi> xiv. 45.</note> and holds that
everything that can form the subject of dispute or
discussion is covered by the three questions, <hi rend="italics">whether</hi>

<pb id="p.433"/>

<hi rend="italics">it is, what it is,</hi> and <hi rend="italics">of what kind it is.</hi> The names
of these three <hi rend="italics">bases</hi> are too obvious for mention.<note>Conjectural, definitive, and qualitative.</note>
The same view is asserted by Patrocles. <milestone unit="section" n="45"/>  Marcus
Antonius stated that there were three <hi rend="italics">bases</hi>
in the following words:&mdash;<quote>The things which form
the ground of every speech are few and are as
follows:&mdash;' Was a thing done or not done? 'Was it
just or unjust?' 'Was it good or bad?'</quote> But since,
when we are said to have been justified in doing
anything, this does not merely mean that our action
was legal, but further implies that it was just, those
who follow Antonius attempt to differentiate these
<hi rend="italics">bases</hi> with greater exactness. They therefore called
them <hi rend="italics">conjectural, legal</hi> and <hi rend="italics">juridical,</hi> a division which
meets with the approval of Verginius as well. <milestone unit="section" n="46"/>  These
they then subdivided into species, placing <hi rend="italics">definition</hi>
under the head of the <hi rend="italics">legal basis,</hi> together with all
others which are concerned with the letter of the law:
such as that of <hi rend="italics">contradictory laws,</hi> or <foreign lang="greek">a)ntinomi/a</foreign> that
which rests on the <hi rend="italics">letter of the law</hi> and on <hi rend="italics">meaning</hi>
or <hi rend="italics">intention</hi> (which the Greeks call <foreign lang="greek">kata\ r(hto\n kai\ dia/noian</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">meta/lhyis</foreign> to which latter we give various
names, styling it the <hi rend="italics">translative, transumptive</hi> or <hi rend="italics">transpositive basis</hi><note>Concerned with questions of competence.</note>; the <hi rend="italics">syllogism,</hi> which we call the

they are called <hi rend="italics">bases</hi> by most writers, though some
prefer to call them <hi rend="italics">legal questions.</hi></p>
<p> <milestone unit="section" n="47"/>  Athenaeus laid down that there were four <hi rend="italics">bases:</hi>
the <foreign lang="greek">protreptikh\</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">parormhtikh/,</foreign> that is, the
<hi rend="italics">hortative,</hi> which is peculiar to deliberative themes;
the <foreign lang="greek">suntelikh/</foreign><note><foreign lang="greek">suntelikh/</foreign> lit. = contributory.</note> which is shown to be the <hi rend="italics">conjectural,</hi> not
so much from the name itself, but from what

<pb id="p.435"/>

follows; the <foreign lang="greek">u(pallaktikh/</foreign> or <hi rend="italics">definitive,</hi> for it consists
in a change of terms.<note>The defendant admits the act, but gives it a different
name, <hi rend="italics">e.g.</hi> theft, not sacrilege. <foreign lang="greek">u(pallaktikh/</foreign> = changing.</note>; and the <hi rend="italics">juridical</hi> to which
he gives the name employed by other Greek writers.<note><foreign lang="greek">dikaiologiko/s</foreign></note>
 <milestone unit="section" n="48"/>  For, as I have said, there is a great variety in the
names employed. There are some who, arguing from
its meaning of change, hold that <foreign lang="greek">u(pallaktikh/</foreign> is the
<hi rend="italics">translative basis,</hi> which is concerned with <hi rend="italics">competence.</hi>
Others, Caecilius<note>Caec. fr. 49, Burkh.</note> and Theon for instance, hold
that there are the same number of <hi rend="italics">bases,</hi> but make
them of a different kind, namely, those covered by
the questions whether a thing is, what it is, of what
kind it is and how great it is. <milestone unit="section" n="49"/>  Aristotle<note>Ar. <hi rend="italics">Rhet.</hi> 1416 <hi rend="italics">b</hi>: 1374 <hi rend="italics">a</hi>.</note> in his
<hi rend="italics">Rhetoric</hi> states that all enquiry turns on the questions <hi rend="italics">whether a thing is, of what kind it is, how great
it is,</hi> and <hi rend="italics">of how many parts it consists.</hi> In one
place however he recognises the force of <hi rend="italics">definition</hi>
as well, saying that certain points are defended
on the following lines:&mdash;<quote>I took it, but did not
steal it.</quote> <quote>I struck him, but did not commit an
assault.</quote> <milestone unit="section" n="50"/>  Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">de Inv.</hi> I. viii. 10.</note> again in his Rhetorica makes the
number of <hi rend="italics">bases</hi> to be four, namely those concerned
with <hi rend="italics">fact, names, kinds,</hi> and <hi rend="italics">legal action,</hi> that is to say
<hi rend="italics">conjecture</hi> is concerned with <hi rend="italics">fact, definition</hi> with
<hi rend="italics">names, quality</hi> with <hi rend="italics">kinds,</hi> and <hi rend="italics">law</hi> with <hi rend="italics">action:</hi>
under this latter head of <hi rend="italics">law</hi> he included questions of <hi rend="italics">competence.</hi> But in another passage he
treats<note><hi rend="italics">Part. Or.</hi> 31 and 38.</note> legal questions as a species of <hi rend="italics">action.</hi></p>
<p>Some writers have held that there are five <hi rend="italics">bases:</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="51"/> the <hi rend="italics">conjectural, definitive, qualitative, quantitative</hi> and
<hi rend="italics">relative.</hi> Theodorus, also, as I have said,<note>&sect; 36.</note> adopts the
same number of general heads, <hi rend="italics">whether a thing is, what
it is, of what kind it is, how great it is,</hi> and <hi rend="italics">to what it refers.</hi>
The last he considers to be chiefly concerned with
<hi rend="italics">comparison,</hi> since better and worse, greater and less

<pb id="p.437"/>

are meaningless terms unless referred to some
standard. <milestone unit="section" n="52"/>  But questions of <hi rend="italics">relation,</hi> as I have already
pointed out, enter also into <hi rend="italics">translative</hi> questions, that
is, questions of <hi rend="italics">competence,</hi> since in cases such as
<quote>Has this man a right to bring an action?</quote> or <quote>Is
it fitting that he should do such and such a thing,
or against this man, or at this time, or in this
manner?</quote> For all these questions must be referred
to a certain standard. <milestone unit="section" n="53"/>  Others hold that there are
six <hi rend="italics">bases: conjecture</hi> or <foreign lang="greek">ge/nesis,</foreign> <hi rend="italics">quality, particularity</hi> or
<foreign lang="greek">i)dio/ths</foreign> by which word they mean <hi rend="italics">definition, quantity</hi>
or <foreign lang="greek">a)ci/a,</foreign> <hi rend="italics">comparison</hi> and <hi rend="italics">competence, for</hi> which a new
term has been found in <foreign lang="greek">meta/stasis</foreign> I call it new
when applied to a <hi rend="italics">basis,</hi> for Hermagoras employs it
to describe a species of <hi rend="italics">juridical question.</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="54"/>  Others
think there are seven, while refusing to recognise
<hi rend="italics">competence, quantity</hi> or <hi rend="italics">comparison,</hi> in place of which
they substitute four <hi rend="italics">legal bases,</hi><note>See &sect; 46.</note> completing the
seven by the addition of those three which they call
<hi rend="italics">rational.</hi><note>Conjectural, definitive, qualitative.</note> <milestone unit="section" n="55"/>  Others again make eight by the addition
of <hi rend="italics">competence</hi> to the above-mentioned seven. Some
on the other hand have introduced a fresh method
of division, reserving the name of <hi rend="italics">bases</hi> for the
<hi rend="italics">rational,</hi> and giving the name of <hi rend="italics">questions</hi> to the <hi rend="italics">legal,</hi>
as I mentioned above,<note>&sect; 46.</note> since in the former the
problem is concerned with <hi rend="italics">facts,</hi> in the latter with
the <hi rend="italics">letter of the law.</hi> Some on the contrary reverse
this nomenclature calling the legal questions <hi rend="italics">bases</hi>
and the rational grounds <hi rend="italics">questions.</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="56"/>  But others have
thought that there are only three <hi rend="italics">rational bases,</hi>
covered by the questions <hi rend="italics">whether a thing is, what it is,</hi>
and <hi rend="italics">of what kind it is?</hi> Hermagoras is alone in
thinking that there are four, namely <hi rend="italics">conjecture, particularity, competence,</hi> and <hi rend="italics">quality:</hi> to the latter he

<pb id="p.439"/>

appends the phrase <foreign lang="greek">kata\ sumbebhko/s</foreign> <quote>according to
its accidents,</quote> illustrating his meaning by putting a
case where it is enquired whether a man <hi rend="italics">happen</hi> to
be good or bad. He then subdivides <hi rend="italics">quality</hi> into
four species: first that which is concerned with
<hi rend="italics">things to he sought or avoided,</hi> which belongs to <hi rend="italics">deliberative</hi> oratory: <milestone unit="section" n="67"/>  secondly those concerned <hi rend="italics">with
persons,</hi> by which he indicates <hi rend="italics">panegyric:</hi> thirdly the
<hi rend="italics">practical or pragmatic,</hi> which is concerned <hi rend="italics">with things
in general</hi> without reference to persons, and may be
illustrated by questions such as whether he is free
who is claimed as a slave and waiting the trial of his
case,<note><hi rend="italics">assertio</hi> = a trial in which the question of a person's
liberty is involved. When waiting trial, this person is
described as <hi rend="italics">in assertiolle.</hi></note> whether riches beget insolence, and whether a
thing is just or good; lastly there is the <hi rend="italics">juridical</hi>
species, under which practically the same questions
arise, but in relation to certain definite persons, as for
instance when it is asked whether that particular man
has done well or ill. <milestone unit="section" n="58"/>  I am aware that another explanation is given by Cicero in the first book of his
Rhetorica<note><hi rend="italics">de Inv.</hi> i. xi. 14.</note> of the species known as <hi rend="italics">practical,</hi>
where he says that it is <quote>the department under
which we consider what is right according to civil
usage and equity: this department is regarded by
us as the special sphere of the lawyer.</quote> <milestone unit="section" n="59"/>  But I have
already mentioned<note><hi rend="italics">de Inv.</hi> i. xi. 14.</note> what his opinion was about this
particular work. The Rhetorica are simply a collection of school-notes on rhetoric which he worked
up into this treatise while quite a young man. Such
faults as they possess are due to his instructor. In the
present instance he may have been influenced by the
fact that the first examples given by Hermagoras of
this species are drawn from legal questions, or by the
fact that the Greeks call interpreters of the law
<foreign lang="greek">pragmatikoi/.</foreign> <milestone unit="section" n="60"/>  But for these early efforts Cicero

<pb id="p.441"/>

substituted his splendid <hi rend="italics">de Oratore</hi> and therefore cannot be
blamed for giving false instruction. I will now
return to Hermagoras. He was the first rhetorician
to teach that there was a <hi rend="italics">basis</hi> concerned with <hi rend="italics">competence,</hi> although the elements of this doctrine are
found in Aristotle,<note><hi rend="italics">Rhet.</hi> II. xv. 8.</note> without however any mention of
the name. <milestone unit="section" n="61"/>  The legal questions were according to
Hermagoras of five kinds. First the letter of the
law and its intention; the names which he gives to
these are <foreign lang="greek">kata\ r(hto/n</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">u(pecai/resis,</foreign> that is to say
<hi rend="italics">the letter of the law</hi> and the <hi rend="italics">exceptions</hi> thereto: the
first of these classes is found in all writers, but the
term <hi rend="italics">exception</hi> is less in use. The number is
completed by the <hi rend="italics">ratiocinative basis</hi> and those
dealing with <hi rend="italics">ambiguity</hi> and <hi rend="italics">contradictory laws.</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="62"/>  Albutius
adopts this classification, but eliminates <hi rend="italics">competence,</hi>
including it under the juridical <hi rend="italics">basis.</hi> Further he
holds that in legal questions there is no <hi rend="italics">ratiocinative
basis.</hi> I know that those who are prepared to
read ancient writers on rhetoric more carefully than
I have, will be able to discover yet more on this
subject, but I fear that I may have been too lengthy
even in saying what I have said.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="63"/>  I must admit that I am now inclined to take a
different view from that which I once held. It would
perhaps be safer for my reputation if I were to make
no modification in views which I not only held for so
many years, but of which I expressed my open approbation. <milestone unit="section" n="64"/>  But I cannot bear to be thought guilty of
concealment of the truth as regards any portion of
my views, more especially in a work designed for the
profit of young men of sound disposition. For Hippocrates,<note><hi rend="italics">Epidem</hi> V. 14.</note> the great physician, in my opinion took the
most honourable course in acknowledging some of

<pb id="p.443"/>

his errors to prevent those who came after from
being led astray, while Cicero had no hesitation about
condemning some of his earlier works in books which
he published later: I refer to his condemnation of
his <hi rend="italics">Lucullus</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Catulus</hi><note>The two books of the first edition of the <hi rend="italics">Academica.</hi></note> and the books<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> the Rhetorica, better known as <hi rend="italics">de Inventione.</hi></note> on rhetoric
which I have already mentioned. <milestone unit="section" n="65"/>  Indeed we should
have no justification for protracting our studies if we
were forbidden to improve upon our original views.
Still none of my past teaching was superfluous: for
the views which I am now going to produce will be
found to be based on the same principles, and consequently no one need be sorry to have attended my
lectures, since all that I am now attempting to do is to
collect and rearrange my original views so that they
may be somewhat more instructive. But I wish to
satisfy everybody and not to lay myself open to the
accusation that I have allowed a long time to elapse
between the formation and publication of my views. <milestone unit="section" n="66"/> I used to follow the majority of authorities in adhering to three <hi rend="italics">rational bases,</hi> the <hi rend="italics">conjectural, qualitative</hi> and <hi rend="italics">definitive,</hi> and to one <hi rend="italics">legal basis.</hi><note>See III. v. 4.</note> These were
my <hi rend="italics">general bases.</hi> The <hi rend="italics">legal basis</hi> I divided into five
<hi rend="italics">species,</hi> dealing with the <hi rend="italics">letter of the law and intention,
contradictory laws,</hi> the <hi rend="italics">syllogism, ambiguity</hi> and <hi rend="italics">competence.</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="67"/>  It is now clear to me that the fourth of the
<hi rend="italics">general bases</hi> may be removed, since the original
division which I made into <hi rend="italics">rational</hi> and <hi rend="italics">legal bases is</hi>
sufficient. The fourth therefore will not be a <hi rend="italics">basis,</hi>
but a kind of <hi rend="italics">question;</hi> if it were not, it would form
one of the <hi rend="italics">rational bases.</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="68"/>  Further I have removed
<hi rend="italics">competence</hi> from those which I called <hi rend="italics">species.</hi> For I
often asserted, as all who have attended my lectures
will remember, and even those discourses which
were published against my will<note>See I. Proem. 7.</note> included the

<pb id="p.445"/>

statement, that the <hi rend="italics">basis</hi> concerned with competence
hardly ever occurs in any dispute under such circumstances that it cannot more correctly be given some
other name, and that consequently some rhetoricians
exclude it from their list of <hi rend="italics">bases.</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="69"/>  I am, however,
well aware that the point of <hi rend="italics">competence</hi> is raised in
many cases, since in practically every case in which
a party is said to have been ruled out of court through
some error of form, questions such as the following
arise: whether it was lawful for this person to bring
an action, or to bring it against some particular
person, or under a given law, or in such a court, or
at such a time, and so on <milestone unit="section" n="70"/>  But the question of <hi rend="italics">competence</hi> as regards persons, times, legal actions and
the rest originates in some pre-existent cause:
the question turns therefore not on <hi rend="italics">competence</hi>
itself, but on the cause with which the point of
<hi rend="italics">competence</hi> originates. <quote>You ought to demand the
return of a deposit not before the praetor but before
the consuls, as the sum is too large to come under
the praetor's jurisdiction.</quote> The question then arises
whether the sum is too large, and the dispute is one
 <milestone unit="section" n="71"/>  of fact. <quote>You have no right to bring an action against
me, as it is impossible for you to have been appointed
to represent the actual plaintiff.</quote> It then has to be
decided whether he could have been so appointed.
<quote>You ought not to have proceeded by interdict,<note><hi rend="italics">sc.</hi> by getting an order for restitution.</note> but
to have put in a plea for possession.</quote> The point
in doubt is whether the interdict is legal. All these
points fall under the head of <hi rend="italics">legal questions.</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="72"/>  not even those special pleas, in which questions of
<hi rend="italics">competence</hi> make themselves most evident, give rise to
the same species of question as those laws under
which the action is brought, so that the enquiry is

<pb id="p.447"/>

really concerned with the name of a given act,<note><hi rend="italics">e. g.</hi> murder or manslaughter: sacrilege or theft.</note> with
the letter of the law and its meaning, or with something that requires to be settled by argument? The
<hi rend="italics">basis</hi> originates from the question, and in cases of
<hi rend="italics">competence</hi> it is not the question concerning which
the advocate argues that is involved, but the question
on account of which he argues.<note>See &sect; 70.</note> <milestone unit="section" n="73"/>  An example will make
this clearer. <quote>You have killed a man.</quote> <quote>I did not kill
him.</quote> The <hi rend="italics">question</hi> is whether he has killed him;
the <hi rend="italics">basis</hi> is the <hi rend="italics">conjectural.</hi> But the following case is
very different. <quote>I have the right to bring this action.</quote>
<quote>You have not the right.</quote> The question is whether he
has the right, and it is from this that we derive the <hi rend="italics">basis.</hi>
For whether he is allowed the right or not depends
on the event, not on the cause itself, and on the decision of the judge, not on that on account of which
he gives such a decision. <milestone unit="section" n="74"/>  The following is a similar
example. <quote>You ought to be punished.</quote> <quote>I ought
not.</quote> The judge will decide whether he should be
punished, but it is not with this that the <hi rend="italics">question</hi> or
the <hi rend="italics">basis</hi> is concerned. Where then does the <hi rend="italics">question</hi>
lie? <quote>You ought to be punished, for you have killed
a man.</quote> <quote>I did not kill him.</quote> The <hi rend="italics">question</hi> is
whether he killed him. <quote>I ought to receive some
honour.</quote> <quote>You ought not.</quote> Does this involve a
<hi rend="italics">basis?</hi> I think not. <quote>I ought to receive some honour
for killing a tyrant.</quote> <quote>You did not kill him.</quote> Here
there is a <hi rend="italics">question</hi> and a <hi rend="italics">basis</hi><note><hi rend="italics">sc.</hi> the conjectural.</note> as well. <milestone unit="section" n="75"/>  So, too, <quote>You
are not entitled to bring this action,</quote> <quote>I have,</quote> involves no <hi rend="italics">basis.</hi> Where then is it to be found? <quote>You
have no right to bring this action, because you have
been deprived of civil rights.</quote> In this case the
question is whether he has been so deprived, or
whether loss of civil rights debars a person from

<pb id="p.449"/>

bringing an action. Here on the other hand we find
both <hi rend="italics">questions and bases.</hi><note>sc. the conjectural or definitive basis and the qualitative.</note> It is therefore to <hi rend="italics">kinds of
causes,</hi> not to <hi rend="italics">bases</hi> that the term <hi rend="italics">competence</hi> applies:
other <hi rend="italics">kinds of cause</hi> are the <hi rend="italics">comparative</hi> and the <hi rend="italics">recriminatory.</hi><note>See III. x. 3 and 4.</note> <milestone unit="section" n="76"/>  <quote>But,</quote> it is urged, <quote>the case 'I have a
right,' 'You have not,' is similar to 'You have killed
a man,' 'I was justified in so doing.'</quote> I do not deny
it, but this does not make it a <hi rend="italics">basis.</hi> For these statements are not propositions until the reasons for them
are added. If they were propositions as they stand,
the case could not proceed. <quote>Horatius has committed
a crime, for he has killed his sister.</quote> <quote>He has not
committed a crime, since it was his duty to kill her
for mourning the death of an enemy.</quote> The question
is whether this was a justifiable reason, and the <hi rend="italics">basis</hi>
is one of <hi rend="italics">quality.</hi> So too as regards <hi rend="italics">competence.</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="77"/>  <quote>You
have no right to disinherit, since a person who has
been deprived of civil rights is not allowed to take
legal action.</quote> <quote>I have the right, since disinheriting
is not legal action.</quote><note>Disinheritance could only be effected by legal action.</note> The question here is what is legal
action. And we shall arrive at the conclusion that the
son's disinheritance is unlawful, by use of the <hi rend="italics">syllogism.</hi><note>See &sect; 15.</note>
The case will be similar with all the <hi rend="italics">rational</hi> and <hi rend="italics">legal
bases.</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="78"/>  I am aware that there have been some who
placed <hi rend="italics">competence</hi> among <hi rend="italics">rational bases,</hi> using as
illustrations cases such as, <quote>I killed a man under
orders from my general,</quote> <quote>I gave the votive offerings
in a temple to a tyrant under compulsion,</quote> <quote>I deserted owing to the fact that storms or floods or ill health prevented me from rejoining.</quote> That is to say
it was not due to me, but some external cause. <milestone unit="section" n="79"/>  From
these writers I differ even more widely: for it is not
the nature of the <hi rend="italics">legal action</hi> itself which is involved
in the question of <hi rend="italics">competence,</hi> but the cause of the act;

<pb id="p.451"/>

and this is the case in almost every defence. Finally
he who adopts this line of defence, does not thereby
abandon the <hi rend="italics">qualitative basis;</hi> for he states that he himself is free from blame, so that we really should
differentiate between two kinds of <hi rend="italics">quality</hi><note>(<hi rend="italics">A</hi>) Absolute, when the deed is shown to be right. (<hi rend="italics">B</hi>)
Relative, when the act is not defended, but the agent is
cleared of the guilt of the act.</note> one of
which comes into play when both the accused person
and his act are defended, and the other when the
accused person alone is defended.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="80"/>  We must therefore accept the view of the authorities followed by Cicero,<note>See &sect; 44.</note> to the effect that there are
three things on which enquiry is made in every case:
we ask <hi rend="italics">whether a thing is, that it is, and of that kind it
is.</hi> Nature herself imposes this upon us. For first of all
there must be some subject for the question, since we
cannot possibly determine <hi rend="italics">what a thing is,</hi> or <hi rend="italics">of what
kind it is,</hi> until we have first ascertained <hi rend="italics">whether it is,</hi>
and therefore the first question raised is <hi rend="italics">whether it is.</hi>
But even when it is clear that a thing <hi rend="italics">is,</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="81"/>  it is not
immediately obvious <hi rend="italics">what it is.</hi> And when we have
decided what it is, there remains the question of its
<hi rend="italics">quality.</hi> These three points once ascertained, there
is no further question to ask. These heads cover both
<hi rend="italics">definite</hi> and <hi rend="italics">indefinite questions.</hi> One or more of them
is discussed in every demonstrative, deliberative or
forensic theme. <milestone unit="section" n="82"/>  These heads again cover all cases in
the courts, whether we regard them from the point
of view of <hi rend="italics">rational</hi> or <hi rend="italics">legal questions.</hi> For no legal
problem can be settled save by the aid of <hi rend="italics">definition,
quality</hi> and <hi rend="italics">conjecture.</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="83"/>  Those, however, who are
engaged in instructing the ignorant will find it useful
at first to adopt a slightly less rigid method: the road
will not be absolutely straight to begin with, but it
will be more open and will provide easier going. I
would have them therefore learn above all things

<pb id="p.453"/>

that there are four different methods which may be
employed in every case, and he who is going to plead
should study them as first essentials. For, to begin
with the defendant, far the strongest method of self-defence is, if possible, to deny the charge. The
second best is when it is possible to reply that the
particular act with which you are charged was never
committed. The third and most honourable is to
maintain that the act was justifiable. If none of
these lines of defence are feasible, there remains the
last and only hope of safety: if it is impossible either
to deny the charge or justify the act, we must evade
the charge with the aid of some point of law, making
it appear that the action has been brought against us
illegally <milestone unit="section" n="84"/>  Hence arise those questions of <hi rend="italics">legal action</hi>
or <hi rend="italics">competence.</hi> For there are some things, which,
although not laudable in themselves, are yet permitted by law; witness the passage in the Twelve Tables
authorising creditors to divide up a debtor's body
amongst themselves, a law which is repudiated by
public custom. There are also certain things which
although equitable are prohibited by law; witness the
restrictions placed on testamentary disposition.<note>e.g. that the legal heir must receive at least a quarter of
the property.</note> <milestone unit="section" n="85"/>  The
accuser likewise has four things which he must keep
in mind: he must prove that something was done,
that a particular act was done, that it was wrongly
done, and that he brings his charge according to law.
Thus every cause will turn on the same sorts of
questions, though the parts of plaintiff and defendant
will sometimes be interchanged: for instance in the
case of a claim for a reward, it will be the plaintiffs
task to show that what was done was right.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="86"/>  These four schemes or forms of action which I then
called <hi rend="italics">general bases</hi> fall into two classes as I have

<pb id="p.455"/>

shown,<note>&sect; 67, and III. <hi rend="italics">v.</hi> 4.</note> namely, the <hi rend="italics">rational</hi> and the <hi rend="italics">legal.</hi> The
<hi rend="italics">rational</hi> is the simpler, as it involves nothing more
than the consideration of the nature of things. In
this connection, therefore, a mere mention of <hi rend="italics">conjeclure, definition</hi> and <hi rend="italics">quality</hi> will suffice. <milestone unit="section" n="87"/>  <hi rend="italics">Legal questions</hi>
necessarily have a larger number of species, since
there are many laws and a variety of forms. In the
case of one law we rely on the letter, in others on the
spirit. Some laws we force to serve our turn, when
we can find no law to support our case, others we
compare with one another, and on others we put some
novel interpretation. <milestone unit="section" n="88"/>  Thus from these three <hi rend="italics">bases</hi> we
get three resemblances of <hi rend="italics">bases:</hi> sometimes simple,
sometimes complex, but all having a character of their
own, as, for instance, when questions of the <hi rend="italics">letter of
the law</hi> and its <hi rend="italics">intention</hi> are involved, for these clearly
come under <hi rend="italics">conjecture</hi> or <hi rend="italics">quality;</hi> or again where the
syllogism is involved, for this is specially connected
with <hi rend="italics">quality;</hi> or where contradictory laws are involved,
for these are on the same footing as the <hi rend="italics">letter of the
law and intention;</hi> or yet again in cases of <hi rend="italics">ambiguity,</hi>
which is always resolved by <hi rend="italics">conjecture.</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="89"/>  <hi rend="italics">Definition</hi> also
belongs to both classes of question, namely those
concerned with the consideration of <hi rend="italics">facts</hi> and those
concerned with the <hi rend="italics">letter of the law.</hi> All these
questions, although they come under the three <hi rend="italics">bases,</hi>
yet since, as I have mentioned,<note>&sect; 87.</note> they have certain
characteristic features of their own, require to be
pointed out to learners; and we must allow them
to be called <hi rend="italics">legal bases</hi> or <hi rend="italics">questions</hi> or <hi rend="italics">minor heads,</hi> as
long as it is clearly understood that none of them
involve any other <hi rend="italics">questions</hi> than the three I have
mentioned.<note>&sect; 80.</note> <milestone unit="section" n="90"/>  As regards questions of <hi rend="italics">quantity, number,
relation,</hi> and, as some have thought, <hi rend="italics">comparison,</hi> the

<pb id="p.457"/>

case is different. For these have no connexion with
the complexities of the law, but are concerned with
reason only. Consequently they must always be
regarded as coming under <hi rend="italics">conjecture</hi> or <hi rend="italics">quality,</hi> as, for
instance, when we ask with what purpose, or at what
time, or place something was done.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="91"/>  But I will speak of individual questions when I
come to handle the rules for <hi rend="italics">division.</hi><note>Book VII.</note> This much is
agreed to by all writers, that one <hi rend="italics">cause</hi> possesses one
<hi rend="italics">basis,</hi> but that as regards secondary questions related
to the main issue of the trial, there may frequently
be a number in one single cause. <milestone unit="section" n="92"/>  I also think there
is at times some doubt as to which <hi rend="italics">basis</hi> should be
adopted, when many different lines of defence are
brought to meet a single charge; and, just as in regard to the complexion to be given to the statement
of the facts of the case, that complexion is said to be
the best which the speaker can best maintain, so in
the present connexion I may say that the best <hi rend="italics">basis</hi>
to choose is that which will permit the orator to develop a maximum of force. <milestone unit="section" n="93"/>  It is for this reason that
we find Cicero and Brutus taking up different lines
in defence of Milo. Cicero says that Clodius was
justifiably killed because he sought to waylay Milo,
but that Milo had not designed to kill him; while
Brutus, who wrote his speech merely as a rhetorical
exercise, also exults that Milo has killed a bad citizen.
 <milestone unit="section" n="94"/>  In complicated causes, however, two or three <hi rend="italics">bases</hi> may
be found, or different <hi rend="italics">bases:</hi> for instance a man may
plead that he did not do one thing, and that he was
justified in doing another, or to take another similar
class of case, a man may deny two of the charges.
 <milestone unit="section" n="95"/>  The same thing occurs when there is a question
about some one thing which is claimed by a number

<pb id="p.459"/>

of persons, who may all of them rely on the same
kind of plea (for instance, on the right of the next of
kin), or may put in different claims, one urging that
the property was left him by will, another that he is
next of kin. Now whenever a different defence has
to be made against different claimants, there must be
different <hi rend="italics">bases,</hi> as for example the well-known controversial theme: <milestone unit="section" n="96"/>  <quote>Wills that are made in accordance
with law shall be valid. When parents die intestate,
their children shall be the heirs. A disinherited son
shall receive none of his father's property. A bastard,
if born before a legitimate son, shall be treated as
legitimate, but if born after a legitimate son shall be
treated merely as a citizen. It shall be lawful to give
a son in adoption. Every son given in adoption shall
have the right to re-enter his own family if his natural
father has died childless. <milestone unit="section" n="97"/>  A father of two legitimate
sons gave one in adoption, disinherited the other,
and acknowledged a bastard, who was born to him
later. Finally after making the disinherited son his
heir he died. All three sons lay claim to the
property.</quote> <hi rend="italics">Nothbus</hi> is the Greek word for a bastard;
Latin, as Cato emphasized in one of his speeches, has
no word of its own and therefore borrows the foreign
term. But I am straying from the point. <milestone unit="section" n="98"/>  The son
who was made heir by the will finds his way barred
by the law <quote>A disinherited son shall receive none of
his father's property.</quote> The <hi rend="italics">basis</hi> is one resting on
the <hi rend="italics">letter of the law</hi> and <hi rend="italics">intention,</hi> and the problem is
whether he can inherit by any means at all? can he
do so in accordance with the intention of his father?
or in virtue of the fact that he was made heir by the
will? The problem confronting the bastard is twofold, since he was born after the two legitimate sons

<pb id="p.461"/>

and was not born before a legitimate son. <milestone unit="section" n="91"/>  The first
problem involves a syllogism: are those sons who
have been cast out from their own family to be regarded as though they had never been born? The
second is concerned with the letter of the law and
intention. For it is admitted that he was not born
before any legitimate son, but he will defend his
claim by appealing to the intention of the law, which
he will maintain to imply that the bastard, born when
there was no legitimate son in the family, should
rank as legitimate. <milestone unit="section" n="100"/>  He will dismiss the letter of the
law, pointing out that in any case the position of a
bastard is not prejudiced by the fact that no legitimate
son was born after him, and arguing as follows:&mdash;
<quote>Suppose that the only son is a bastard, what will
his position be? Merely that of a citizen? and yet
he was not born after any legitimate son. Or
will he rank as a son in all respects? But he
was not born before the legitimate sons. As it is
impossible to stand by the letter of the law we
must stand by its intentions.</quote> <milestone unit="section" n="101"/>  It need disturb no one
that one law should originate two <hi rend="italics">bases.</hi> The law is
twofold, and therefore has the force of two laws.<note>101</note>
To the son who desires to re-enter the family, the
disinherited's first reply is, <quote>Even though you are
allowed to re-enter the family, I am still the heir.</quote>
The <hi rend="italics">basis</hi> will be the same as in the claim put forward
by the disinherited son, since the question at issue is
whether a disinherited son can inherit. <milestone unit="section" n="102"/>  Both the
disinherited and the bastard will object, <quote>You cannot
re-enter the family, for our father did not die childless.</quote> But in this connexion each will rely on
his own particular question. For the disinherited son
will say that even a disinherited man does not cease

<pb id="p.463"/>

to be a son, and will derive an argument from that
very law which denies his claim to the inheritance;
namely that it was unnecessary for a disinherited son
to be excluded from possession of his father's property
if he had ceased to be one of the family; but now,
since in virtue of his rights as son he would have
been his father's heir if he had died intestate, the
law is brought to bar his claim; and yet the law does
not deprive him of his position as son, but only of his
position as heir. Here the <hi rend="italics">basis</hi> is <hi rend="italics">definitive,</hi> as turning
on the definition of a son. <milestone unit="section" n="103"/>  Again the bastard in his
turn will urge that his father did not die childless,
employing the same arguments that he had used in
putting forward his claim that he ranked as a son;
unless indeed he too has recourse to definition, and
raises the question whether even bastards are not sons.
Thus in one case we shall have either two special
<hi rend="italics">legal bases,</hi> namely the <hi rend="italics">letter of the law and</hi> <hi rend="italics">intention,</hi>
with the <hi rend="italics">syllogism</hi> and also <hi rend="italics">definition,</hi> or those three<note>See &sect; 82.</note>
which are really the only <hi rend="italics">bases</hi> strictly so called, <hi rend="italics">conjecture</hi> as regards the <hi rend="italics">letter of the law and intention,
quality</hi> in the <hi rend="italics">syllogism,</hi><note>See &sect; 88.</note> and <hi rend="italics">definition,</hi> which needs no
explanation.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="104"/>  Further every kind of case will contain a <hi rend="italics">cause,</hi> a
<hi rend="italics">point for the decision of the judge,</hi> and a <hi rend="italics">central argument.</hi><note>For discussion of these technical terms see chap. xi.</note>
For nothing can be said which does not contain a
reason, something to which the decision of the judge
is directed, and finally something which, more than
aught else, contains the substance of the matter at
issue. But as these vary in different cases and are as
a rule explained by writers on judicial causes, I will
postpone them to the appropriate portion of my work.
For the present I shall follow the order which I
prescribed by my division<note>Chaps. iii. and iv.</note> of <hi rend="italics">causes</hi> into three classes.

<pb id="p.465"/>
</p>

<p>VII. I will begin with the class of <hi rend="italics">causes</hi> which are
concerned with praise and blame. This class appears
to have been entirely divorced by Aristotle,<note><hi rend="italics">Rhet.</hi> 1358 b. 2.</note> and
following him by Theophrastus, from the practical
side of oratory (which they call <foreign lang="greek">pragmatikh=|,</foreign>) and to
have been reserved solely for the delectation of
audiences, which indeed is shown to be its peculiar
function by its name, which implies display.<note><hi rend="italics">sc.</hi> <foreign lang="greek">e)pideiktikh/.</foreign></note> <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>  Roman
usage on the other hand has given it a place in the
practical tasks of life. For funeral orations are
often imposed as a duty on persons holding public
office, or entrusted to magistrates by decree of the
senate. Again the award of praise or blame to a
witness may carry weight in the courts, while it is
also a recognised practice to produce persons to
praise the character of the accused. Further the
published speeches of Cicero directed against his
rivals in the election to the consulship,<note>The speech was known as <hi rend="italics">in Toga Candida.</hi> Only fragments survive.</note> and
against Lucius Piso, Clodius and Curio,<note>The <hi rend="italics">in Pisonem</hi> survives, the <hi rend="italics">in Clodium et Curionem,</hi>
to which he refers again (v. x. 92), is lost.</note> are full of
denunciation, and were notwithstanding delivered in
the senate as formal expressions of opinion in the
course of debate. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>  I do not deny that some compositions of this kind are composed solely with a view
to display, as, for instance, panegyrics of gods and
heroes of the past, a consideration which provides
the solution of a question which I discussed a little
while back,<note>III. v. 3.</note> and proves that those are wrong who
hold that an orator will never speak on a subject
unless it involves some problem. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>  But what problem
is involved by the praise of Jupiter Capitolinus, a
stock theme of the sacred Capitoline contest,<note>The quinquennial contest in honour of Jupiter
Capitolinus, founded by Domitian in 86.</note> which
is undoubtedly treated in regular rhetorical form?

<pb id="p.467"/>
</p>

<p>However, just as panegyric applied to practical
matters requires proof, so too a certain semblance of
proof is at times required by speeches composed
entirely for display. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>  For instance, a speaker who tells
how Romulus was the son of Mars and reared by the
she-wolf, will offer as proofs of his divine origin the
facts that when thrown into a running stream he
escaped drowning, that all his achievements were such
as to make it credible that he was the offspring of the
god of battles, and that his contemporaries unquestionably believed that he was translated to heaven.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>  Some arguments will even wear a certain semblance
of defence: for example, if the orator is speaking
in praise of Hercules, he will find excuses for his
hero having changed raiment with the Queen of
Lydia and submitted to the tasks which legend tells
us she imposed upon him. The proper function
however of panegyric is to amplify and embellish its
themes.</p>

<p>This form of oratory is directed in the main to
the praise of gods and men, but may occasionally be
applied to the praise of animals or even of inanimate objects. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>  In praising the gods our first step
will be to express our veneration of the majesty of
their nature in general terms. next we shall proceed
to praise the special power of the individual god and
the discoveries whereby he has benefited the human
race. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>  For example, in the case of Jupiter, we shall
extol his power as manifested in the governance of
all things, with Mars we shall praise his power in war,
with Neptune his power over the sea; as regards
inventions we shall celebrate Minerva's discovery of
the arts, Mercury's discovery of letters, Apollo's of
medicine, Ceres' of the fruits of the earth, Bacchus'

<pb id="p.469"/>

of wine. Next we must record their exploits as
handed down from antiquity. Even gods may derive honour from their descent, as for instance is
the case with the sons of Jupiter, or from their
antiquity, as in the case of the children of Chaos, or
from their offspring, as in the case of Latona, the
mother of Apollo and Diana. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>  Some again may be
praised because they were born immortal, others
because they won immortality by their valour, a theme
which the piety of our sovereign has made the glory
even of these present times.<note><hi rend="italics">sc.</hi> by Donitian's deification of his father Vespasian and
his brother Titus.</note></p>
<p> <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>  There is greater variety required in the praise of
men. In the first place there is a distinction to be
made as regards time between the period in which
the objects of our praise lived and the time preceding their birth; and further, in the case of the
dead, we must also distinguish the period following
their death. With regard to things preceding a
man's birth, there are his country, his parents and his
ancestors, a theme which may be handled in two
ways. For either it will be creditable to the objects of
our praise not to have fallen short of the fair fame of
their country and of their sires or to have ennobled
a humble origin by the glory of their achievements. <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>  Other topics to be drawn from the period preceding
their birth will have reference to omens or prophecies foretelling their future greatness, such as the
oracle which is said to have foretold that the son of
Thetis would be greater than his father. <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>  of the individual himself will be based on his
character, his physical endowments and external
circumstances. Physical and accidental advantages
provide a comparatively unimportant theme, which
requires variety of treatment. At times for instance

<pb id="p.471"/>

we extol beauty and strength in honorific terms, as
Homer does in the case of Agamemnon<note><hi rend="italics">Iliad,</hi> ii. 477.</note> and
Achilles<note><hi rend="italics">Iliad,</hi> ii. 180.</note>; at times again weakness may contribute
largely to our admiration, as when Homer says<note><hi rend="italics">Iliad,</hi> v. 801.</note> that
Tydeus was small of stature but a good fighter.
 <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>  Fortune too may confer dignity as in the case of
kings and princes (for they have a fairer field for
the display of their excellences) but on the other
hand the glory of good deeds may be enhanced by
the smallness of their resources. Moreover the
praise awarded to external and accidental advantages
is given, not to their possession, but to their honourable employment. <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>  For wealth and power and influence, since they are the sources of strength, are the
surest test of character for good or evil; they make us
better or they make us worse. <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>  Praise awarded to
character is always just, but may be given in various
ways. It has sometimes proved the more effective
course to trace a man's life and deeds in due chronological order, praising his natural gifts as a child, then
his progress at school, and finally the whole course of
his life, including words as well as deeds. At times
on the other hand it is well to divide our praises,
dealing separately with the various virtues, fortitude, justice, self-control and the rest of them and
to assign to each virtue the deeds performed under
its influence. <milestone unit="section" n="16"/>  We shall have to decide which of
these two methods will be the more serviceable,
according to the nature of the subject; but we
must bear in mind the fact that what most pleases
an audience is the celebration of deeds which our
hero was the first or only man or at any rate one of
the very few to perform: and to these we must add
any other achievements which surpassed hope or

<pb id="p.473"/>

expectation, emphasising what was done for the sake
of others rather than what he performed on his
own behalf. <milestone unit="section" n="17"/>  It is not always possible to deal with
the time subsequent to our hero's death: this is
due not merely to the fact that we sometimes praise
him, while still alive, but also that there are but few
occasions when we have a chance to celebrate the
award of divine honours, posthumous votes of thanks,
or statues erected at the public expense. <milestone unit="section" n="18"/>  Among
such themes of panegyric I would mention monuments of genius that have stood the test of time.
For some great men like Menander have received
ampler justice from the verdict of posterity than
from that of their own age. Children reflect glory
on their parents, cities on their founders, laws on
those who made them, arts on their inventors and
institutions on those that first introduced them; for
instance Numa first laid down rules for the worship
of the gods, and Publicola first ordered that the
lictors' rods should be lowered in salutation to the
people.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="19"/>  The same method will be applied to denunciations
as well, but with a view to opposite effects. For humble
origin has been a reproach to many, while in some
cases distinction has merely served to increase the
notoriety and unpopularity of vices. In regard to
some persons, as in the story of Paris, it has been
predicted that they would be the cause of destruction
to many, some like Thersites and Irus have been
despised for their poverty and mean appearance,
others have been loathed because their natural advantages were nullified by their vices: the poets for
instance tell us that Nireus<note>the handsomest warrior among the Greeks of Troy.</note> was a coward and
Pleisthenes<note>Son of Atreus: the allusion is not known.</note> a debauchee. <milestone unit="section" n="20"/>  The mind too has as

<pb id="p.475"/>

many vices as virtues, and vice may be denounced,
as virtue may be praised, in two different ways.
Some have been branded with infamy after death
like Maelius, whose house was levelled with the
ground, or Marcus Manlius, whose first name was
banished from his family for all generations to
come. <milestone unit="section" n="21"/>  The vices of the children bring hatred on
their parents; founders of cities are detested for
concentrating a race which is a curse to others, as
for example the founder of the Jewish superstition;<note>Moses.</note> the laws of Gracchus are hated, and we
abhor any loathsome example of vice that has been
handed down to posterity, such as the criminal form of
lust which a Persian is said to have been the first to
practise on a woman of Samos. <milestone unit="section" n="22"/>  And even in the
case of the living the judgment of mankind serves
as a proof of their character, and the fairness or
foulness of their fame proves the orator's praise or
blame to be true.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="23"/>  Aristotle<note><hi rend="italics">Rhet.</hi> i. 9.</note> however thinks that the place and subject of panegyrics or denunciations make a very considerable difference. For much depends on the
character of the audience and the generally received
opinion, if they are to believe that the virtues of
which they approve are pre-eminently characteristic
of the person praised and the vices which they hate
of the person denounced. For there can be
little doubt as to the attitude of the audience,
if that attitude is already determined prior to
the delivery of the speech. <milestone unit="section" n="24"/>  It will be wise
too for him to insert some words of praise for
his audience, since this will secure their good
will, and wherever it is possible this should be done
in such a manner as to advance his case. Literature

<pb id="p.477"/>

will win less praise at Sparta than at Athens, endurance and courage more. Among some races the life
of a freebooter is accounted honourable, while others
regard it as a duty to respect the laws. Frugality
might perhaps be unpopular with the Sybarites,
whilst luxury was regarded as a crime by the ancient Romans. <milestone unit="section" n="25"/>  Similar differences of opinion are
found in individuals. A judge is most favourable to
the orator whose views he thinks identical with his
own. Aristotle also urges a point, which at a later
date Cornelius Celsus emphasised almost to excess,
to the effect that, since the boundary between vice
and virtue is often ill-defined, it is desirable to use
words that swerve a little from the actual truth,
calling a rash man brave, a prodigal generous, a mean
man thrifty; or the process may, if necessary, be reversed. But this the ideal orator, that is to say a
good man, will never do, unless perhaps he is led to
do so by consideration for the public interest.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="26"/>  Cities are praised after the same fashion as men.
The founder takes the place of the parent, and antiquity carries great authority, as for instance in the
case of those whose inhabitants are said to be sprung
from the soil. The virtues and vices revealed by
their deeds are the same as in private individuals.
The advantages arising from site or fortifications are
however peculiar to cities. Their citizens enhance
their fame just as children bring honour to their
parents.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="27"/>  Praise too may be awarded to public works,
in connexion with which their magnificence,
utility, beauty and the architect or artist must
be given due consideration. Temples for instance
will be praised for their magnificence, walls for

<pb id="p.479"/>

their utility, and both for their beauty or the skill of
the architect. Places may also be praised, witness
the praise of Sicily in Cicero.<note><hi rend="italics">in Verr.</hi> ii. 1 <hi rend="italics">sqq.,</hi> iv. 48.</note> In such cases
we consider their beauty and utility: beauty calls for
notice in places by the sea, in open plains and
pleasant situations, utility in healthy or fertile
localities. <milestone unit="section" n="28"/>  Again praise in general terms may be
awarded to noble sayings or deeds. Finally things
of every kind may be praised. Panegyrics have
been composed on sleep and death, and physicians
have written eulogies on certain kinds of food.</p>

<p>While therefore I do not agree that panegyric
concerns only questions regarding what is honourable, I do think that it comes as a rule under
the heading of <hi rend="italics">quality,</hi> although all three <hi rend="italics">bases</hi><note>Quality, conjecture, definition. See chap. vi. for explanation of this term.</note> may
he involved in Panegyric and it was observed by
Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">Top.</hi> xxv. 94.</note> that all were actually used by Gaius Caesar
in his denunciation of Cato. But <hi rend="italics">panegyric</hi> is akin
to <hi rend="italics">deliberative</hi> oratory inasmuch as the same things
are usually praised in the former as are advised
in the latter.</p>

<p>VIII. I am surprised that <hi rend="italics">deliberative</hi> oratory also
has been restricted by some authorities to questions
of expediency. If it should be necessary to assign
one single aim to deliberative I should prefer
Cicero's<note><hi rend="italics">de Or.</hi> II. lxxxii. 334.</note> view that this kind of oratory is primarily
concerned with what is honourable. I do not doubt
that those who maintain the opinion first mentioned
adopt the lofty view that nothing can be expedient
which is not good. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>  That opinion is perfectly sound
so long as we are fortunate enough to have wise and
good men for counsellors. But as we most often
express our views before an ignorant audience, and
more especially before popular assemblies, of which

<pb id="p.481"/>

the majority is usually uneducated, we must distinguish between what is honourable and what is expedient and conform our utterances to suit ordinary
understandings. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>  For there are many who do not
admit that what they really believe to be the honourable course is sufficiently advantageous, and are
misled by the prospect of advantage into approving
courses of the dishonourable nature of which there
can be no question: witness the Numantine treaty
and the surrender of the Caudine Forks.<note>Mancinus was surrounded on retreat from Numiantia in
137 B. C., while the surrender at the Caudine Forks took
place in 321 B. C. In both cases the Senate refused to ratify
the humiliating treaties which had been made the price of
the release of the Roman armies.</note> <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>  Nor does
it suffice to restrict deliberative oratory to the <hi rend="italics">basis</hi>
of <hi rend="italics">quality</hi> which is concerned with questions of
honour and expediency. For there is often room
for conjecture as well. Sometimes again <hi rend="italics">definition</hi>
is necessary or <hi rend="italics">legal</hi> problems require handling; this
is especially the case when advice has to be given
on private matters, where there is some doubt of
the legality of the course under consideration. Of
<hi rend="italics">conjecture'</hi><note>For <hi rend="italics">conjecture</hi> see III. vi. 30 <hi rend="italics">sqq.</hi></note> <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>  I shall speak more fully a little later
on. Returning to <hi rend="italics">definition</hi> for the moment, we
find it in the question raised by Demosthenes,
<quote>whether Philip should give or restore Halonnesus,</quote><note>Halonnesus had belonged to Athens, but had been seized
by pirates. Philip ejected the pirates. The Athenians asked
him to restore it; he replied that it belonged to him and
that there could be no question of restoration, but if they
asked for it as a gift he promised to give it them.</note>
and to that discussed by Cicero in the <hi rend="italics">Philippics</hi><note>VIII. i. 2, where the question is discussed as to
whether the war with Antony is <hi rend="italics">bellum</hi> or <hi rend="italics">tumultus,</hi> the
latter being the technical name for any grave national
emergency such as civil war or a Gallic invasion within the
bounds of Italy.</note> as
to the nature of a <hi rend="italics">tumultus.</hi> Again does not the
question raised in connection with the statue of
Servius Sulpicius<note><hi rend="italics">Phil.</hi> ix. 1.</note> as to <quote>whether statues should be
erected only in honour of those ambassadors who
perish by the sword</quote> bear a strong resemblance to
the questions that are raised in the law courts? <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>  The
<hi rend="italics">deliberative</hi> department of oratory (also called the

<pb id="p.483"/>

<hi rend="italics">advisory</hi> department), while it deliberates about the
future, also enquires about the past, while its functions are twofold and consist in advising and
dissuading.</p>

<p><hi rend="italics">Deliberative</hi> oratory does not always require an
<hi rend="italics">exordium,</hi> such as is necessary in forensic speeches,
since he who asks an orator for his opinion is naturally
well disposed to him. But the commencement, whatever be its nature, must have some resemblance to an
<hi rend="italics">exordium.</hi> For we must not begin abruptly or just at
the point where the fancy takes us, since in every
subject there is something which naturally comes first.
 <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>  In addressing the senate or the people the same
methods apply as in the law courts, and we must aim
as a rule at acquiring the goodwill of our audience.
This need cause no surprise, since even in <hi rend="italics">panegyric</hi>
we seek to win the favour of our hearers when our
aim is praise pure and simple, and not the acquisition
of any advantage. Aristotle,<note><hi rend="italics">Rhet.</hi> iii. 14</note> <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>  it is true, holds, not
without reason, that in <hi rend="italics">deliberative</hi> speeches we may
often begin with a reference either to ourselves or to
our opponent, borrowing this practice <hi rend="italics">from</hi> <hi rend="italics">forensic</hi>
oratory, and sometimes producing the impression that
the subject is of greater or less importance than it
actually is. On the other hand he thinks that in
<hi rend="italics">demonstrative</hi> oratory the <hi rend="italics">exordium</hi> may be treated with
the utmost freedom, <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>  since it is sometimes drawn from
irrelevant material, as for example in Isocrates' Praise
of Helen,<note>The speech opens with a disquisition on the absurd and
trivial nature of much that is contained in the speeches of
sophists and rhetoricians.</note> or from something akin to the subject,
as for instance in the <hi rend="italics">Panegyricus</hi> of the same author,
when he complains that more honour is given to physical than to moral excellence, or as Gorgias in his
speech delivered at the Olympic games praises the
founders of the great national games. Sallust seems

<pb id="p.485"/>

to have imitated these authors in his <hi rend="italics">Jugurthine War</hi>
and in the introduction to his <hi rend="italics">Catiline,</hi> which has no
connection with his narrative.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>  But it is time for me to return to <hi rend="italics">deliberative</hi> oratory
in which, even when we introduce an <hi rend="italics">exordium,</hi> we
must content ourselves with a brief prelude, which
may amount to no more than a mere heading. As
regards the <hi rend="italics">statement of facts,</hi> this is never required in
speeches on private subjects, at least as regards the
subject on which an opinion has to be given, because
everyone is acquainted with the question at issue.
 <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>  Statements as to external matters which are relevant
to the discussion may however frequently be introduced. In addressing public assemblies it will often
be necessary to set forth the order of the points
which have to be treated. <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>  As regards appeals to the
emotions, these are especially necessary in <hi rend="italics">deliberative</hi>
oratory. Anger has frequently to be excited or
assuaged and the minds of the audience have to be
swayed to fear, ambition, hatred, reconciliation. At
times again it is necessary to awaken pity, whether it
is required, for instance, to urge that relief should be
sent to a besieged city, or we are engaged in deploring the overthrow of an allied state. But what really
carries greatest weight in <hi rend="italics">deliberative</hi> speeches is the
authority of the speaker. <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>  For he, who would have
all men trust his judgment as to what is expedient
and honourable, should both possess and be regarded as possessing genuine wisdom and excellence
of character. In <hi rend="italics">forensic</hi> speeches the orator may,
according to the generally received opinion, indulge
his passion to some extent. But all will agree that
the advice given by a speaker should be in keeping
with his moral character.

<pb id="p.487"/>
</p>

<p>The majority of Greek writers have held that this
kind of oratory is entirely concerned with addressing
public assemblies and have restricted it to politics.
 <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>  Even Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">de Orat.</hi> ii. 82.</note> himself deals chiefly with this department. Consequently those who propose to offer advice
upon peace, war, troops, public works or revenue must
thoroughly acquaint themselves with two things, the
resources of the state and the character of its people,
so that the method employed in tendering their advice may be based at once on political realities and
the nature of their hearers. <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>  This type of oratory
seems to me to offer a more varied field for eloquence,
since both those who ask for advice and the answers
given to them may easily present the greatest diversity.</p>

<p>Consequently there are three points which must
be specially borne in mind in advice or dissuasion:
first the nature of the subject under discussion,
secondly the nature of those who are engaged in the
discussion, and thirdly the nature of the speaker who
offers them advice. <milestone unit="section" n="16"/>  As to the subject under discussion
its practicability is either certain or uncertain. In
the latter case this will be the chief, if not
the only point for consideration; for it will often
happen that we shall assert first that something
ought not to be done, even if it can be done, and
secondly, that it cannot be done. Now when
the question turns on such points as to whether the
Isthmus can be cut through, the Pontine Marshes
drained, or a harbour constructed at Ostia, or whether
Alexander is likely to find land beyond the Ocean,<note>the theme of a <hi rend="italics">suasoria</hi> of the elder Seneca (<hi rend="italics">Suas.</hi> i.).
<quote>Alexander deliberates whether to sail forth into the ocean.</quote></note>
we make use of <hi rend="italics">conjecture.</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="17"/>  But even in connection
with things that are undoubtedly feasible, there may
at times be room for <hi rend="italics">conjecture,</hi> as for instance in
questions such as whether Rome is ever likely to

<pb id="p.489"/>

conquer Carthage, whether Hannibal will return to
Africa if Scipio transports his army thither, or whether
the Samnites are likely to keep faith if the Romans
lay down their arms.<note><hi rend="italics">sc.</hi> at the Caudine Forks: see above, &sect; 3.</note> There are some things too
which we may believe to be both feasible and likely
to be carried into effect, but at another time or place
or in another way.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="18"/>  When there is no scope for conjecture, our attention will be fixed on other points. In the first place
advice will be asked either on account of the actual
thing on which the orator is required to express his
views, or on account of other causes which affect it
from without. It is on the actual thing that the
senate for instance debates, when it discusses such
questions as whether it is to vote pay for the troops.
In this case the material is simple. <milestone unit="section" n="19"/>  To this however
may be added reasons for taking action or the reverse,
as for example if the senate should discuss whether
it should deliver the Fabii to the Gauls when the
latter threaten war,<note>See Livy, v. 36.</note> or Gaius Caesar should deliberate
whether he should persist in the invasion of Germany,
when his soldiers on all sides are making their wills.<note>See Caesar, <hi rend="italics">Gallic War,</hi> i. 39, where this detail is
recorded, also 40 where the speech made to his troops is
given.</note>
These deliberative themes are of a twofold nature.
 <milestone unit="section" n="20"/>  In the first case the reason for deliberation is the
Gallic threat of war, but there may still be a further
question as to whether even without such threat of
war they should surrender those who, contrary to the
law of nations, took part in a battle when they had
been sent out as ambassadors and killed the king
with whom they had received instructions to treat.
 <milestone unit="section" n="21"/>  In the second case Caesar would doubtless never deliberate on the question at all, but for the perturbation
shown by his soldiers; but there is still room for
enquiry whether quite apart from this occurrence it

<pb id="p.491"/>

would be wise to penetrate into Germany. But it
must be remembered that we shall always speak first
on that subject which is capable of discussion quite
apart from the consequences.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="22"/>  Some have held that the three main considerations
in an advisory speech are honour, expediency and
necessity. I can find no place for the last. For however great the violence which may threaten us, it may
be necessary for us to suffer something, but we are not
compelled to do anything; whereas the subject of
deliberation is primarily whether we shall do anything.
 <milestone unit="section" n="23"/>  Or if by necessity they mean that into which we are
driven by fear of worse things, the question will be one
of expediency. For example, if a garrison is besieged
by overwhelmingly superior forces and, owing to the
failure of food and water supplies, discusses surrender
to the enemy, and it is urged that it is a matter of
necessity, the words <quote>otherwise we shall perish</quote> must
needs be added: consequently there is no necessity
arising out of the circumstances themselves, for death
is a possible alternative. And as a matter of fact the
Saguntines<note>In 218 B. C., when besieged by Hannibal. See Livy,
xxi. 14.</note> did not surrender, nor did those who were
surrounded on the raft from Opitergium.<note>C. Antonius was blockaded in an island off the Dalmatian
coast which he held for Caesar 49 B. C. Reinforcements on
rafts were sent to his rescue. Most were captured; but in
one case, of a raft carrying 1,000 men from Opitergium in
Venetia, surrender was scorned and the men slew each other
rather than yield. See Lucan, iv. 462; Florus, ii. 33.</note> <milestone unit="section" n="24"/>  It follows
that in such cases also the question will be either one
of expediency alone or of a choice between expediency and honour. <quote>But,</quote> it will be urged, <quote>if a man
would beget children, he is under the necessity of
taking a wife.</quote> Certainly. But he who wishes to
become a father must needs be quite clear that he
must take a wife. <milestone unit="section" n="25"/>  It appears to me, therefore, that
where necessity exists, there is no room for deliberation, any more than where it is clear that a thing is

<pb id="p.493"/>

not feasible. For deliberation is always concerned
with questions where some doubt exists. Those
therefore are wiser who make the third consideration
for deliberative oratory to be <foreign lang="greek">to\ dunato/n</foreign> or <quote>possibility</quote>
as we translate it; the translation may seem clumsy,
but it is the only word available. <milestone unit="section" n="26"/>  That all these
considerations need not necessarily obtrude themselves in every case is too obvious to need explanation.
Most writers, however, say that there are more than
three. But the further considerations which they
would add are really but <hi rend="italics">species</hi> of the three <hi rend="italics">general</hi>
considerations just mentioned. For right, justice,
piety, equity and mercy (for thus they translate <foreign lang="greek">to\</foreign>
<foreign lang="greek">h(/meron</foreign>), with any other virtues that anyone may be
pleased to add, all come under the heading of that
which is honourable. <milestone unit="section" n="27"/>  On the other hand, if the question
be whether a thing is easy, great, pleasant or free from
danger, it comes under questions of expediency. Such
topics arise from some contradiction; for example a
thing is expedient, but difficult, or trivial, or unpleasant, or dangerous. <milestone unit="section" n="28"/>  Some however hold that at
times deliberation is concerned solely with the question
whether a thing is pleasant, as for instance when discussion arises as to whether a theatre should be built or
games instituted. But in my opinion you will never
find any man such a slave to luxury as not to consider
anything but pleasure when he delivers an advisory
speech. <milestone unit="section" n="29"/>  For there must needs be something on every
occasion that takes precedence of pleasure: in proposing the institution of public games there is the honour
due to the gods; in proposing the erection of a
theatre the orator will consider the advantages to be
derived from relaxation from toil, and the unbecoming
and undesirable struggle for places which will arise if

<pb id="p.495"/>

there is no proper accommodation; religion, too, has
its place in the discussion, for we shall describe the
theatre as a kind of temple for the solemnization of a
sacred feast. <milestone unit="section" n="30"/>  Often again we shall urge that honour
must come before expediency; as for instance when
we advise the men of Opitergium not to surrender to
the enemy, even though refusal to do so means
certain death. At times on the other hand we prefer
expediency to honour, as when we advise the arming
of slaves in the Punic War.<note>After the battle of Cannae: Livy, xxii. 57.</note> <milestone unit="section" n="31"/>  But even in this case we
must not openly admit that such a course is dishonourable: we can point out that all men are free by
nature and composed of the same elements, while
the slaves in question may perhaps be sprung
from some ancient and noble stock; and in the
former case when the danger is so evident,
we may add other arguments, such as that they
would perish even more cruelly if they surrendered,
should the enemy fail to keep faith, or Caesar (a
more probable supposition) prove victorious. <milestone unit="section" n="32"/>  But
in such a conflict of principles it is usual to modify
the names which we give them. For expediency is
often ruled out by those who assert not merely that
honour comes before expediency, but that nothing
can be expedient that is not honourable, while others
say that what we call honour is vanity, ambition and
folly, as contemptible in substance as it is fair in
sound. <milestone unit="section" n="33"/>  Nor is expediency compared merely with
inexpediency. At times we have to choose between
two advantageous courses after comparison of their
respective advantages. The problem may be still
more complicated, as for instance when Pompey
deliberated whether to go to Parthia, Africa or
Egypt.<note>After his defeat at Pharsalus.</note> In such a case the enquiry is not which of

<pb id="p.497"/>

two courses is better or worse, but which of three or
more. <milestone unit="section" n="34"/>  On the other hand in <hi rend="italics">deliberative</hi> oratory there
will never be any doubt about circumstances wholly
in our favour. For there can clearly be no doubt about
points against which there is nothing to be said.
Consequently as a rule all <hi rend="italics">deliberative</hi> speeches are
based simply on comparison, and we must consider
what we shall gain and by what means, that it may be
possible to form an estimate whether there is more
advantage in the aims we pursue or greater disadvantage in the means we employ to that end. <milestone unit="section" n="35"/>  A
question of expediency may also be concerned with
time (for example, <quote>it is expedient, but not now</quote>)
or with place (<quote>it is expedient, but not here</quote>) or
with particular persons (<quote>it is expedient, but not for
us</quote> or <quote>not as against these</quote>) or with our method of
action (<quote>it is expedient, but not thus</quote>) or with
degree (<quote>it is expedient, but not to this extent</quote>).</p>

<p>But we have still more often to consider personality with reference to what is becoming, and we
must consider our own as well as that of those
before whom the question is laid. <milestone unit="section" n="36"/>  Consequently,
though examples are of the greatest value in
deliberative speeches, because reference to historical parallels is the quickest method of securing assent, it matters a great deal whose authority
is adduced and to whom it is commended. For
the minds of those who deliberate on any subject differ from one another and our audience may
be of two kinds. <milestone unit="section" n="37"/>  For those who ask us for advice are either single individuals or a number, and
in both cases the factors may be different. For
when advice is asked by a number of persons it
makes a considerable difference whether they are
<pb id="p.499"/>

the senate or the people, the citizens of Rome or
Fidenae, Greeks or barbarians, and in the case of
single individuals, whether we are urging Cato or
Gaius Marius to stand for office, whether it is the
elder Scipio or Fabius who is deliberating on his plan
of campaign. <milestone unit="section" n="38"/>  Further sex, rank, and age, must be
taken into account, though it is character that will
make the chief difference. It is an easy task to
recommend an honourable course to honourable
men, but if we are attempting to keep men of bad
character to the paths of virtue, we must take care
not to seem to upbraid a way of life unlike our own. <milestone unit="section" n="39"/> The minds of such an audience are not to be moved
by discoursing on the nature of virtue, which they
ignore, but by praise, by appeals to popular opinion,
and if such vanities are of no avail, by demonstration
of the advantage that will accrue from such a policy,
or more effectively perhaps by pointing out the
appalling consequences that will follow the opposite
policy. <milestone unit="section" n="40"/>  For quite apart from the fact that the minds
of unprincipled men are easily swayed by terror, I
am not sure that most men's minds are not more
easily influenced by fear of evil than by hope of
good, for they find it easier to understand what is
evil than what is good. <milestone unit="section" n="41"/>  Sometimes again we urge
good men to adopt a somewhat unseemly course,
while we advise men of poor character to take a
course in which the object is the advantage of
those who seek our advice. I realise the thought
that will immediately occur to my reader: <quote>Do you
then teach that this should be done or think it
right?</quote> Cicero<note>The letter is lost. the argument of the quotation is as
follows. The policy <hi rend="italics">which</hi> I advise is honorable, but it
would be wrong for me to urge Caesar to follow it, since it is
contrary to his interests.</note> might clear me from blame in the
matter; for he writes to Brutus in the following
terms, after setting forth a number of things that

<pb id="p.501"/>

might honourably be urged on Caesar: <quote>Should I be
a good man to advise this? No. For the end of him
who gives advice is the advantage of the man to
whom he gives it. But, you say, your advice is right.
Certainly, but there is not always room for what
is right in giving advice.</quote> However, this is a
somewhat abstruse question, and does not concern
deliberative oratory alone. I shall therefore reserve
it for my twelfth and concluding book.<note>Chap. xii.</note> <milestone unit="section" n="43"/>  For my part
I would not have anything done dishonourably. But
for the meantime let us regard these questions as at
least belonging to the rhetorical exercises of the
schools: for knowledge of evil is necessary to enable
us the better to defend what is right. <milestone unit="section" n="44"/>  For the
present I will only say that if anyone is going to urge
a dishonourable course on honourable man, he
should remember not to urge it as being dishonourable, and should avoid the practice of certain declaimers who urge Sextus Pompeius to piracy just
because it is dishonourable and cruel. Even when we
address bad men, we should gloss over what is unsightly. For there is no man so evil as to wish to
seem so. <milestone unit="section" n="45"/>  Thus Sallust makes Catiline<note><hi rend="italics">Cat.</hi> xx.</note> speak as one
who is driven to crime not by wickedness but by indignation, and Varius makes Atreus say:

<quote rend="blockquote">
<l>My wrongs are past all speech,</l>
<l>And such shall be the deeds they force me to.</l></quote>

How much more has this pretence of honour to be
kept up by those who have a real regard for their
own good name! <milestone unit="section" n="46"/>  Therefore when we advise Cicero
to beg Antonius for mercy or even to burn the
<hi rend="italics">Philippics</hi> if Antonius promises to spare him on that
condition,<note>For examples of this theme see the elder Seneca (<hi rend="italics">Suas.</hi>
vi. and vii.).</note> we shall not empliasise the love of life in
our advice (for if that passion has any force with

<pb id="p.503"/>

him, it will have it none the less if we are silent),
but we shall exhort him to save himself in the interest of the state. <milestone unit="section" n="47"/>  For he needs some such reason
as that to preserve him from feeling shame at entreating such a one as Antony. Again if we urge
Gaius Caesar<note>Julius Caesar.</note> to accept the crown we shall assert
that the state is doomed to destruction unless controlled by a monarchy. For the sole aim of the man
who is deliberating about committing a criminal act
is to make his act appear as little wicked as possible.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="48"/>  It also makes a great deal of difference who it is
that is offering the advice: for if his past has been
illustrious, or if his distinguished birth or age or
fortune excite high expectations, care must be taken
that his words are not unworthy of him. If on the
other hand he has none of these advantages he will
have to adopt a humbler tone. For what is regarded
as liberty in some is called licence in others. Some
receive sufficient support from their personal
authority, while others find that the force of reason
itself is scarce sufficient to enable them to maintain
their position.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="49"/>  Consequently I regard <hi rend="italics">impersonation</hi> as the most
difficult of tasks, imposed as it is in addition to the
other work involved by a deliberative theme. For
the same speaker has on one occasion to impersonate
Caesar, on another Cicero or Cato. But it is a most
useful exercise because it demands a double effort
and is also of the greatest use to future poets and
historians, while for orators of course it is absolutely
necessary. <milestone unit="section" n="50"/>  For there are many speeches composed
by Greek and Latin orators for others to deliver, the
words of which had to be adapted to suit the position and character of those for whom they were

<pb id="p.505"/>

written. Do you suppose that Cicero thought in the
same way or assumed the same character when he
wrote for Gnaeus Pompeius and when he wrote for
Titus Ampius and the rest?<note>Nothing is <hi rend="italics">known</hi> of these speeches.</note> Did he not rather bear
in mind the fortune, rank and achievements of each
single individual and represent the character of all
to whom he gave a voice so that though they spoke
better than they could by nature, they still might
seem to speak in their own persons? <milestone unit="section" n="51"/>  For a speech
which is out of keeping with the man who delivers
it is just as faulty as the speech which fails to suit
the subject to which it should conform. It is for
this reason that Lysias is regarded as having shown
the highest art in the speeches which he wrote for
uneducated persons, on account of their extraordinary realism. In the case of declaimers indeed it is
of the first importance that they should consider
what best suits each character: for they rarely play
the role of advocates in their declamations. As a
rule they impersonate sons, parents, rich men, old
men, gentle or harsh of temper, misers, superstitious persons, cowards and mockers, so that hardly
even comic actors have to assume more numerous
roles in their performances on the stage than
these in their declamations. <milestone unit="section" n="52"/>  All these r&ocirc;les may
be regarded as forming part of <hi rend="italics">impersonation,</hi>
which I have included under <hi rend="italics">delibertive</hi> themes,
from which it differs merely in that it involves the
assumption of a role. It is sometimes introduced
even with controversial themes, which are drawn
from history and involve the appearance of definite
historical characters as pleaders. <milestone unit="section" n="53"/>  I am aware also
that historical and poetical themes are often set for
the sake of practice, such as Priam's speech to

<pb id="p.507"/>

Achilles or Sulla's address to the people on his
resignation of the dictatorship. But these will fall
under one or other of the three classes into which
I have divided causes. For entreaty, statement,
and argument, with other themes already mentioned,
are all of frequent occurrence in <hi rend="italics">forensic, deliberative</hi>
or <hi rend="italics">demonstrative</hi> subjects, according as circumstances
demand, <milestone unit="section" n="54"/>  and we often introduce fictitious speeches
of historical persons, whom we select ourselves.
Cicero for instance in the <hi rend="italics">pro Caelio</hi><note>xiv. <hi rend="italics">sqq</hi></note> makes both
Appius Caecus and her brother Clodius address
Clodia, the former rebuking her for her immorality,
the latter exhorting her thereto.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="55"/>  In scholastic declamations the fictitious themes for
deliberative speeches are often not unlike those of
controversial speeches and are a compromise between
the two forms, as for instance when the theme set is
a discussion in the presence of Gaius Caesar of the
punishment to be meted out to Theodotus; for it consists of accusation and defence, both of them peculiar
to forensic oratory. <milestone unit="section" n="56"/>  But the topic of expediency also
enters into the case, in such questions as whether it
was to Caesar's advantage that Pompeius should be
slain; whether the execution of Theodotus would
involve the risk of a war with the king of Egypt;
whether such a war would be highly inopportune at
such a critical moment, would prove dangerous and
be certain to last a long time. <milestone unit="section" n="57"/>  There is also a question
of honour. Does it befit Caesar to avenge Pompeius'
death? or is it to be feared that an admission that
Pompeius did not deserve death will injure the cause
of the Caesarian party? <milestone unit="section" n="58"/>  It may be noted that discussions of such a kind may well occur in actual
cases.

<pb id="p.509"/>
</p>

<p>Declaimers have however often been guilty of an
error as regards deliberative themes which has involved a series of consequences. They have considered deliberative themes to be different and
absolutely opposed to forensic themes. For they have
always affected abrupt openings, an impetuous style
and a generous embellishment, as they call it, in their
language, and have been especially careful to make
shorter notes for <hi rend="italics">deliberative</hi> than for <hi rend="italics">forensic</hi> themes.
 <milestone unit="section" n="59"/>  For my part while I realise that <hi rend="italics">deliberative</hi> themes
do not require an <hi rend="italics">exordium,</hi> for reasons which I have
already stated, I do not, however, understand why
they should open in such a wild and exclamatory
manner. When a man is asked to express his opinion
on any subject, he does not, if he is sane, begin to
shriek, but endeavours as far as possible to win the
assent of the man who is considering the question by
a courteous and natural opening. <milestone unit="section" n="60"/>  Why, I ask, in review of the fact that deliberations require moderation
above all else, should the speaker on such themes indulge in a torrential style of eloquence kept at one
high level of violence? I acknowledge that in controversial speeches the tone is often lowered in the
<hi rend="italics">exordium, the</hi> <hi rend="italics">statement of facts</hi> and the <hi rend="italics">argument,</hi> and
that if you subtract these three portions, the remainder is more or less of the <hi rend="italics">deliberative</hi> type of
speech, but what remains must likewise be of a more
even flow, avoiding all violence and fury. <milestone unit="section" n="61"/>  With
regard to manificence of language, deliblerative declaimers should avoid straining after it more than
others, but it comes to them more naturally. For
there is a preference among those who invent such
themes for selecting great personages, such as kings,
princes, senators and peoples, while the theme itself

<pb id="p.511"/>

is generally on a grander scale. Consequently since
the words are suited to the theme, they acquire
additional splendour from the magnificence of the
matter. <milestone unit="section" n="62"/>  In actual deliberations the case is different,
and consequently Theophrastus laid it down that in
the <hi rend="italics">deliberative</hi> class of oratory the language should
as far as possible be free from all affectation: in
stating this view he followed the authority of his instructor, although as a rule he is not afraid to differ
from him. For Aristotle<note><hi rend="italics">Rhet.</hi> iii. 12.</note> <milestone unit="section" n="63"/>  held that the <hi rend="italics">demonstrative</hi>
type of oratory was the best suited for writing and
that the next best was <hi rend="italics">forensic</hi> oratory: his reason for
this view was that the first type is entirely concerned
with display, while the second requires art, which
will even be employed to deceive the audience, if
expedience should so demand, whereas advice requires
only truth and prudence. <milestone unit="section" n="64"/>  I agree with this view as
regards <hi rend="italics">demonstrative</hi> oratory (in fact all writers are
agreed on this point), but as regards <hi rend="italics">forensic</hi> and <hi rend="italics">deliberative</hi> themes I think that the style must be suited to
the requirements of the subject which has to be treated.
 <milestone unit="section" n="65"/>  For I notice that the <hi rend="italics">Philippics</hi> of Demosthenes
are pre-eminent for the same merits as his forensic
speeches, and that the opinions expressed by Cicero
before the senate or the people are as remarkable for
the splendour of their eloquence as the speeches
which he delivered in accusing or defending persons
before the courts. And yet Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">Part. or.</hi> xxvii. 97.</note> says of <hi rend="italics">deliberative</hi> oratory that the whole speech should be simple
and dignified, and should derive its ornament rather
from the sentiments expressed than the actual words.
 <milestone unit="section" n="66"/>  As regards the use of examples practically all authorities are with good reason agreed that there is no
subject to which they are better suited, since as a

<pb id="p.513"/>

rule history seems to repeat itself and the experience
of the past is a valuable support to reason. <milestone unit="section" n="67"/>  Brevity
and copiousness are determined not so much by the
nature as by the compass of the subject. For, just as
in <hi rend="italics">deliberations</hi> the question is generally less complicated, so in <hi rend="italics">forensic</hi> cases it is often of less
importance.</p>

<p>Anyone who is content to read not merely speeches,
but history as well, in preference to growing grey over
the notebooks of the rhetoricians, will realise the
truth of what I say: for in the historians the speeches
delivered to the people and the opinions expressed
in the senate often provide examples of advice and
dissuasion. <milestone unit="section" n="68"/>  he will find an avoidance of abrupt
openings in <hi rend="italics">deliberatire</hi> speeches and will note that
the <hi rend="italics">forensic</hi> style is often the more impetuous of the
two, while in both cases the words are suited to the
matter and <hi rend="italics">forensic</hi> speeches are often shorter than
<hi rend="italics">deliberative.</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="69"/>  Nor will he find in them those faults into
which some of our declaimers fall, namely a coarse
abuse of those who hold opposite opinions and a
general tendency to speak in such a way as to make
it seem that the speaker's views are in opposition to
those of the persons who ask his advice. Consequently
their aim seems to be invective rather than persuasion. <milestone unit="section" n="70"/> I would have my younger readers realise that these
words are penned for their special benefit that they
may not desire to adopt a different style in their
exercises from that in which they will be required to
speak, and may not be hampered by having to unlearn what they have acquired. For the rest if they
are ever summoned to take part in the counsels of
their friends, or to speak their opinions in the senate,
or advise the emperor on some point on which he

<pb id="p.515"/>

may consult them, they will learn from practice
what they cannot perhaps put to the credit of the
schools.</p>

<p>IX. I now come to the forensic kind of oratory,
which presents the utmost variety, but whose duties
are no more than two, the bringing and rebutting
of charges. Most authorities divide the forensic
speech into five parts: the <hi rend="italics">exordium,</hi> the <hi rend="italics">statement of
facts,</hi> the <hi rend="italics">proof,</hi> the <hi rend="italics">refutation,</hi> and the <hi rend="italics">peroration.</hi>
To these some have added the <hi rend="italics">partition into heads,
proposition</hi> and <hi rend="italics">digression,</hi> the two first of which
form part of the <hi rend="italics">proof.</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>  For it is obviously
necessary to <hi rend="italics">propound</hi> what you are going to <hi rend="italics">prove</hi>
as well as to conclude. Why then, if <hi rend="italics">proposition</hi> is a
part of a speech, should not <hi rend="italics">conclusion</hi> be also? <hi rend="italics">Partition</hi> on the other hand is merely one aspect of
<hi rend="italics">arrangement,</hi> and <hi rend="italics">arrangement</hi> is a part of rhetoric
itself, and is equally distributed through every theme
of oratory and their whole body, just as are <hi rend="italics">invention</hi>
and <hi rend="italics">style.</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>  Consequently we must regard <hi rend="italics">partition</hi>
not as one part of a whole speech, but as a part of
each individual question that may be involved. For
what question is there in which an orator cannot
set forth the order in which he is going to make
his points? And this of course is the function of <hi rend="italics">partition.</hi> But how ridiculous it is to make each question an aspect of <hi rend="italics">proof,</hi> but <hi rend="italics">partition</hi> which is an
aspect of a question a part of the whole speech. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>  As
for <hi rend="italics">digression (egressio,</hi> now more usually styled
<hi rend="italics">excessus</hi>), if it lie outside the case, it cannot be part
of it, while, if it lie within it, it is merely an accessory or ornament of that portion of the case from
which <hi rend="italics">digression</hi> is made. For if anything that lies
within the case is to be called part of it, why not

<pb id="p.517"/>

call <hi rend="italics">argument, comparison, commonplace, pathos, illustration</hi> parts of the case? <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>  On the other hand I
disagree with those who, like Aristotle,<note><hi rend="italics">Rhet.</hi> ii. 26.</note> would remove <hi rend="italics">refuation</hi> from the list on the ground that it
forms part of the <hi rend="italics">proof:</hi> for the <hi rend="italics">proof</hi> is constructive, and the <hi rend="italics">reputation</hi> destructive. Aristotle<note><hi rend="italics">Rhet.</hi> iii. 13.</note> also
introduces another slight novelty in making <hi rend="italics">proposition,</hi> not <hi rend="italics">statement of facts,</hi> follow the <hi rend="italics">exordium.</hi> This
however he does because he regards <hi rend="italics">proposition</hi> as
the <hi rend="italics">genus</hi> and <hi rend="italics">statement of facts</hi> as the <hi rend="italics">species,</hi> with
the result that he holds that, whereas the former is
always and everywhere necessary, the latter may
sometimes be dispensed with.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>  It is however necessary to point out as regards
these five parts which I have established, that that
which has to be spoken first is not necessarily that
which requires our first consideration. But above
all we must consider the nature of the case,
the question at issue and the arguments for and
against. Next we must consider what points are
to be made, and what refuted, and then how the
facts are to be stated. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>  For the <hi rend="italics">stalement of facts</hi> is
designed to prepare the way for the <hi rend="italics">proofs</hi> and must
needs be unprofitable, unless we have first determined what <hi rend="italics">proofs.</hi> are to be promised in the <hi rend="italics">statement.</hi> Finally we must consider how best to win the
judge to take our view. For we cannot be sure until
we have subjected all the parts of the case to careful
scrutiny, what sort of impression we wish to make
upon the judge: are we to mollify him or increase
his severity, to excite or relax his interest in the
case, to render him susceptible to influence or the
reverse?</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>  I cannot however approve the view of those who

<pb id="p.519"/>

think that the <hi rend="italics">exordium</hi> should actually be written last.
For though we must collect all our material and determine the proper place for each portion of it, before
we begin to speak or write, we must commence with
what naturally comes first. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>  No one begins a portrait
by painting or modelling the feet, and no art finds its
completion at the point where it should begin.
Otherwise what will happen if we have not time to
write our speech? Will not the result of such a
reversal of the proper order of things be that we
shall be caught napping? We must therefore review the subject-matter in the order laid down, but
write our speech in the order in which we shall
deliver it.</p>

<p>X. Every cause in which one side attacks and the
other defends consists either of one or more controversial questions. In the first case it is called <hi rend="italics">simple,</hi>
in the second <hi rend="italics">complex.</hi> An example of the first is
when the subject of enquiry is a theft or an adultery
taken by itself. In <hi rend="italics">complex</hi> cases the several questions may all be of the same kind, as in cases of
extortion, or of different kinds, as when a man is
accused at one and the same time of homicide and
sacrilege. Such cases no longer arise in the public
courts, since the praetor allots the different charges
to different courts in accordance with a definite rule;
but they still are of frequent occurrence in the
Imperial or Senatorial courts, and were frequent in
the days when they came up for trial before the
people.<note>In the permanent courts (<hi rend="italics">quaestiones perpetuae</hi>). There
were separate courts for, different offences. In cases brought
before the Senate or the Emperor a number of different
charges might be dealt with at once.</note> Private suits again are often tried by one
judge, who may have to determine many different
points of law. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>  There are no other <hi rend="italics">species of forensic</hi>
causes, not even when one person brings the same
suit on the same grounds against two different

<pb id="p.521"/>

persons, or two persons bring the same suit against
one, or several against several, as occasionally occurs
in lawsuits about inheritances. Because although a
number of parties may be involved, there is still only
one suit, unless indeed the different circumstances
of the various parties alter the questions at issue.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>  There is however said to be a third and different
class, the <hi rend="italics">comparative.</hi> Questions of comparison frequently require to be handled in portions of a cause,
as for instance in the centum viral court,<note>A civil court specially concerned with questions of
inheritance.</note> when after
other questions have been raised the question is discussed as to which of two claimants is the more deserving of an inheritance. It is rare however for a
case to be brought into court on such grounds alone,
as in <hi rend="italics">divinations</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Divinatio</hi> is a trial to decide between the claims of two
persons to appear as accuser, there being no public prosecutor
at Rome. <hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> Cicero's <hi rend="italics">Divinatio in Caecilium.</hi></note> which take place to determine who
the accuser shall be, and occasionally when two informers dispute as to which has earned the reward.
 <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>  Some again have added a fourth class, namely
<hi rend="italics">mutual accusation,</hi> which they call <foreign lang="greek">a)ntikathgori/a</foreign>
Others, however, regard it as belonging to the <hi rend="italics">comparative</hi> group, to which indeed the common case of
reciprocal suits on different grounds bears a strong
resemblance. If this latter case should also be called
<foreign lang="greek">a)ntikathgori/a</foreign> (for it has no special name of its own), we
must divide <hi rend="italics">mutual accusation</hi> into two classes, in one
of which the parties bring the same charge against
each other, while in the other they bring different
charges. The same division will also apply to claims.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>  As soon as we are clear as to the kind of cause on
which we are engaged, we must then consider
whether the act that forms the basis of the charge
is denied or defended, or given another name or
excepted from that class of action. Thus we determine the <hi rend="italics">basis</hi> of each case.

<pb id="p.523"/>
</p>

<p>XI. As soon as these points are ascertained, the
next step, according to Hermagoras, should be to
consider what is the <hi rend="italics">question at issue,</hi> the <hi rend="italics">line of defence,</hi>
the <hi rend="italics">point for the judge's decision</hi> and the <hi rend="italics">central point,</hi>
or, as others call it, <hi rend="italics">the foundation</hi> of the case.<note>This highly technical chapter will be largely unintelligible
to those who have not read chapter vi. Those who have no
stomach for such points would do well to skip &sect;&sect; 1&ndash;20; they
will however find consolation in &sect; 21 <hi rend="italics">sqq.,</hi> where Quintilian
says what he really thinks of such technicalities.</note> The
<hi rend="italics">question</hi> in its more general sense is taken to mean
everything on which two or more plausible opinions
may be advanced. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>  In <hi rend="italics">forensic</hi> subjects however it
must be taken in two senses: first in the sense in
which we say that a controversial matter involves
many questions, thereby including all minor questions; secondly in the sense of the main question on
which the case turns. It is of this, with which the
<hi rend="italics">basis</hi> originates, that I am now speaking. We ask
whether a thing has been done, what it is that has
been done, and whether it was rightly done. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>  To these Hermagoras and Apollodorus and many other
writers have given the special name of <hi rend="italics">questions;</hi>
Theodorus on the other hand, as I have already said,
calls them <hi rend="italics">general heads,</hi> while he designates minor
questions or questions dependent on these <hi rend="italics">general
heads</hi> as <hi rend="italics">special heads.</hi> For it is agreed that question
may spring from question, and species be subdivided
into other species. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>  This main question, then, they
call the <foreign lang="greek">zh/thma.</foreign> The <hi rend="italics">line of defence</hi> is the method by
which an admitted act is defended. I see no reason
why I should not use the same example to illustrate
this point that has been used by practically all my
predecessors. Orestes has killed his mother: the
fact is admitted. He pleads that he was justified in
so doing: the <hi rend="italics">basis</hi> will be one of quality, the
<hi rend="italics">question,</hi> whether he was justified in his action, the
<hi rend="italics">line of defence</hi> that Clytemnestra killed her husband,
Orestes' father. This is called the <foreign lang="greek">ai)/tion</foreign> or <hi rend="italics">motive.</hi>

<pb id="p.525"/>

The point for the decision of the judge is known as
the <foreign lang="greek">krino/menon</foreign> and in this case is whether it was
right that even a guilty mother should be killed by
her son. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>  Some have drawn a distinction between
<foreign lang="greek">ai)/tion</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ai)ti/an</foreign> making <foreign lang="greek">ai)/tion</foreign> mean the cause of the
trial, namely the murder of Clytemnestra, <foreign lang="greek">ai)ti/a</foreign> the
motive urged in defence, namely the murder of
Agamemnon. But there is such lack of agreement
over these two words, that some make <foreign lang="greek">ai)ti/a</foreign> the cause
of the trial and <foreign lang="greek">ai)/tion</foreign> the motive of the deed, while
others reverse the meanings. If we turn to Latin
writers we find that some have given these causes the
names of <hi rend="italics">initinum,</hi> the beginning, and <hi rend="italics">ratio,</hi> the reason,
while others give the same name to both. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>  Moreover
<hi rend="italics">cause</hi> seems to spring from <hi rend="italics">cause,</hi> or as the Greeks say
<foreign lang="greek">ai)/tion e)c ai)ti/on</foreign> as will be seen from the following:&mdash;
Clytemnestra killed Agamemnon, because he had
sacrificed their daughter and brought home a captive
woman as his paramour. The same authors think
that there may be several <hi rend="italics">lines of defence</hi> to one
<hi rend="italics">question:</hi> for instance Orestes may urge that he
killed his mother because driven to do so by oracles.
But the number of <hi rend="italics">points for the decision of the judge</hi>
will be the same as the number of alleged <hi rend="italics">motives</hi> for
the deed: in this case it will be whether he ought to
have obeyed the oracles. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>  But one alleged <hi rend="italics">motive</hi> may
also in my opinion involve several questions and several
points for the decision of the judge, as for instance
in the case when the husband caught his wife in
adultery and slew her and later slew the adulterer,
who had escaped, in the market place. The <hi rend="italics">motive</hi> is
but one: <quote>he was an adulterer.</quote> But there arise
as <hi rend="italics">questions</hi> and <hi rend="italics">points for decision by the judge,</hi> whether

<pb id="p.527"/>

it was lawful to kill him at that time and at that
place. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>  But just as, although there be several <hi rend="italics">questions,</hi>
each with its special <hi rend="italics">basis,</hi> the <hi rend="italics">basis</hi> of the case is but
one, namely that to which all else is referred, even so
the real <hi rend="italics">point for the decision of the judge</hi> is, strictly
speaking, that on which judgment is given. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>  As for
the <foreign lang="greek">su/nexon</foreign> the <hi rend="italics">central argument,</hi> as I have mentioned
it is called by some, or the <hi rend="italics">foundation</hi> as it is called by
others, or as Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">De Inv.</hi> I. xiv. 19.</note> styles it <hi rend="italics">the strongest argument of
the defender and the most relevant to the decision of the
judge,</hi> some regard it as being the point after which
all enquiry ceases, others as the main point for
adjudication. <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>  The <hi rend="italics">motive</hi> of the deed does not arise
in all controversial cases. For how can there be a
<hi rend="italics">motive</hi> for the deed, when the deed is denied? But
when the <hi rend="italics">motive</hi> for the deed does come up for
discussion, they deny that the <hi rend="italics">point for the decision of
the judge</hi> rests on the same ground as <hi rend="italics">the main question
at issue,</hi> and this view is maintained by Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">De Inv. I. c.: Part. Or.</hi> xxx. 104.</note> in his
Rhetorica and <hi rend="italics">Partitiones.</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>  For when it has been
asserted and denied that a deed was done, the question whether it was done is resolved by <hi rend="italics">conjecture,</hi> and
the <hi rend="italics">decision of the judge</hi> and the <hi rend="italics">main question</hi> rest on
the same ground, since the first question and the
final decision are concerned with the same point.
But when it is stated and denied that Orestes was
justified in killing his mother, considerations of <hi rend="italics">quality</hi>
are introduced: the <hi rend="italics">question</hi> is whether he was justified in killing her, but this is not yet the point for the
<hi rend="italics">decision of the judge.</hi> When, then, does it become so?
<quote>She killed my father.</quote> <quote>Yes, but that did not
make it your duty to murder your mother.</quote> The
<hi rend="italics">point for the decision of the judge</hi> is whether it was his
duty to kill her. <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>  As regards the <hi rend="italics">foundation,</hi> I will put

<pb id="p.529"/>

it in the words of Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">de Inv. l. c.</hi></note> himself:&mdash;<quote>The foundation
is the strongest argument for the defence, as for
instance, if Orestes were ready to say that the disposition of his mother towards his father, himself and
his sisters, the kingdom, the reputation of the race
and the family were such that it was the peculiar duty
of her children to punish her.</quote> <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>  Others again use illustrations such as the following:&mdash;<quote>He who has
spent his patrimony, is not allowed to address the
people.</quote> <quote>But he spent it on public works.</quote> The
<hi rend="italics">question</hi> is whether everyone that spends his patrimony
is to be prohibited, while the <hi rend="italics">point for decision is</hi>
whether he who spent it in such a way is to be
prohibited. <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>  Or again take the case of the soldier
Arruntius, who killed the tribune Lusius for assaulting
his honour. The <hi rend="italics">question</hi> is whether he was justified
in so doing, <hi rend="italics">the line of defence,</hi> that the murdered man
made an assault upon his honour, <hi rend="italics">the point for the
decision of the judge,</hi> whether it was right that a man
should be killed uncondemned or a tribune by a
soldier. <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>  Some even regard the <hi rend="italics">basis</hi> of the <hi rend="italics">question</hi>
as being different from the <hi rend="italics">basis</hi> of the <hi rend="italics">decision.</hi>
The <hi rend="italics">question</hi> as to whether Milo was justified in
killing Clodius, is one of <hi rend="italics">quality.</hi> The <hi rend="italics">point for the
decision of the judge,</hi> namely whether Clodius lay in
wait for Milo, is a matter for <hi rend="italics">conjecture.</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="16"/>  They also
urge that a case is often diverted to the consideration
of some matter irrelevant to the <hi rend="italics">question,</hi> and that it is
on this matter that judgment is given. I strongly
disagree. Take the question whether all who have
spent their patrimony are to be prohibited from
addressing the people. This <hi rend="italics">question</hi> must have its
<hi rend="italics">point for decision,</hi> and therefore the <hi rend="italics">question</hi> and the
<hi rend="italics">point for decision</hi> are not different, but there are more

<pb id="p.531"/>

than one <hi rend="italics">question</hi> and more than one <hi rend="italics">point for decision</hi>
in the case. Again, in the case of Milo, <milestone unit="section" n="17"/>  is not the
<hi rend="italics">question of fact</hi> ultimately referred to the <hi rend="italics">question of
quality</hi>? For if Clodius lay in wait for Milo, it follows
that he was justifiably killed. But when the case is
shifted to some other point far removed from the
original question, even in this case the <hi rend="italics">question</hi> will
be found to reside in the <hi rend="italics">point for decision.</hi></p>
<p> <milestone unit="section" n="18"/>  As regards these questions Cicero is slightly inconsistent with himself. For in the Rhetorica, as I
have already mentioned, he followed Hermagoras,
while in the <hi rend="italics">Topicai</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Top.</hi> xxv. 95.</note> he holds that the <foreign lang="greek">krino/menon</foreign> or
<hi rend="italics">disputed point</hi> is originated by the <hi rend="italics">basis,</hi> and in
addressing the lawyer Trebatius on this subject he
calls it the <hi rend="italics">point at issue,</hi> and describes the elements
in which it resides as <hi rend="italics">central arguments</hi> or <hi rend="italics">foundations
of the defence which hold it together and the removal of
which causes the whole defence to fall to the ground.</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="19"/>  But
in the <hi rend="italics">Partitiones Oratoriae</hi><note>xxix. 103.</note> he gives the name of
<hi rend="italics">foundation</hi> to that which is advanced against the defence, on the ground that the <hi rend="italics">central argument,</hi> as it
logically comes first, is put forward by the accuser,
while <hi rend="italics">the line of defence</hi> is put forward by the accused,
and the <hi rend="italics">point for the decision of the judge</hi> arises from
the question jointly raised by the <hi rend="italics">central argument</hi>
and the <hi rend="italics">line of defence.</hi></p>
<p>The view therefore of those who make the <hi rend="italics">basis,</hi>
the <hi rend="italics">central argument,</hi> and the <hi rend="italics">point for the decision of
the judge</hi> identical, is at once more concise and nearer
to the truth. The <hi rend="italics">central argument,</hi> they point out,
is that the removal of which makes the whole case fall
to the ground. <milestone unit="section" n="20"/>  In this <hi rend="italics">central argument</hi> they seem to
me to have included both the alleged causes, that

<pb id="p.533"/>

Orestes killed his mother and that Clytemnestra
killed Agamemnon. the same authorities have likewise always held that the <hi rend="italics">basis</hi> and the <hi rend="italics">point for the
decision</hi> of the judge are in agreement; any other
opinion would have been inconsistent with their
general views.</p>

<p> <milestone unit="section" n="21"/>  But this affectation of subtlety in the invention of
technical terms is mere laborious ostentation: I have
undertaken the task of discussing them solely that I
might not be regarded as having failed to make sufficient inquiry into the subject which I have chosen as
my theme. But it is quite unnecessary for an instructor proceeding on less technical lines to destroy
the coherence of his teaching by attention to such
minute detail. <milestone unit="section" n="22"/>  Many however suffer from this drawback, more especially Hermagoras who, although he
labours these points with such anxious diligence, was
a man of penetrating intellect and in most respects
deserves our admiration, so that even where we must
needs blame him, we cannot withhold a certain meed
of praise. <milestone unit="section" n="23"/>  But the shorter method, which for that
very reason is also by far the most lucid, will not
fatigue the learner by leading him through a maze of
detail, nor destroy the coherence of his eloquence by
breaking it up into a number of minute departments.
For he who has a clear view of the main issue of a dispute, and divines the aims which his own side and his
opponents intend to follow and the means they intend
to employ (and it is to the intentions of his own side
that he must pay special attention), will without a
doubt be in possession of a knowledge of all the points
which I have discussed above. <milestone unit="section" n="24"/>  And there is hardly
anyone, unless he be a born fool without the least
acquaintance with the practice of speaking, who does

<pb id="p.535"/>

not know what is the main issue of a dispute (or as
they call it the <hi rend="italics">cause</hi> or <hi rend="italics">central argument</hi>) and what is
the <hi rend="italics">question</hi> between the parties and the <hi rend="italics">point on which
the judge has to decide,</hi> these three being identical.
For the <hi rend="italics">question</hi> is concerned with the matter in dispute and the <hi rend="italics">decision of the judge</hi> is given on the
point involved in the <hi rend="italics">question.</hi> <milestone unit="section" n="25"/>  Still we do not keep
our attention rigidly fixed on such details, but the
desire to win praise by any available means and the
sheer delight in speaking make us wander away from
the subject, since there is always richer material for
eloquence outside the strict theme of the case, inasmuch as the points of any given dispute are always
few, and there is all the world outside, and in the one
case we speak according to our instructions, in the
other on the subjects of our own choice. <milestone unit="section" n="26"/>  We should
teach not so much that it is our duty to discover the
<hi rend="italics">question, the</hi> <hi rend="italics">central argument,</hi> and the <hi rend="italics">point for the decision of the judge</hi> (an easy task), as that we should
continually keep our attention on our subject, or if
we digress, at least keep looking back to it, lest in
our desire to win applause we should let our weapons
drop from our grasp. <milestone unit="section" n="27"/>  The school of Theodorus, as I
have said, groups everything under <hi rend="italics">heads,</hi> by which
they mean several things. First they mean the <hi rend="italics">main
question,</hi> which is to be identified with the <hi rend="italics">basis;</hi>
secondly they mean the other questions dependent
on the <hi rend="italics">main question,</hi> thirdly the <hi rend="italics">proposition</hi> and the
<hi rend="italics">statement of the proofs.</hi> The word is used as we use it
when we say <quote>It is the head of the whole business,</quote>
or, as Menander says, <foreign lang="greek">kefa/laio/n e)stin.</foreign><note>Perhaps a gloss referring to the late rhetorician Menander. If genuine, the words must refer to the comic poet.</note> But generally
speaking, anything which has to be proved will be a
head of varying degrees of importance.

at a greater length than was necessary. I have
