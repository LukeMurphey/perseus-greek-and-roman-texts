<body><div1 type="book" n="7"><head>Book VII</head>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="pr"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>I think that enough has been said on the subject
of invention. For I have dealt not merely with the
methods by which we may instruct the judge, but
also with the means of appealing to his emotions.
But just as it is not sufficient for those who are
erecting a building merely to collect stone and timber
and other building materials, but skilled masons are
required to arrange and place them, so in speaking,
however abundant the matter may be, it will merely
form a confused heap unless arrangement be employed to reduce it to order and to give it connexion
and firmness of structure.<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Nor is it without good
reason that arrangement is treated as the second of
the five departments of oratory,<note><hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> vi. iv. 1. Invention, arrangement, style, memory,
delivery.</note> since without it the
first is useless. For the fact that all the limbs of a
statue have been cast does not make it a statue: they
must be put together; and if you were to interchange some one portion of our bodies or of those
of other animals with another, although the body
would be in possession of all the same members

<pb id="p.5"/>

as before, you would none the less have produced
a monster. Again even a slight dislocation will
deprive a limb of its previous use and vigour, and
disorder in the ranks will impede the movements of an army.<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Nor can I regard as an error
the assertion that order is essential to the existence
of nature itself, for without order everything would
go to wrack and ruin. Similarly if oratory lack this
virtue, it cannot fail to be confused, but will be
like a ship drifting without a helmsman, will lack
cohesion, will fall into countless repetitions and
omissions, and, like a traveller who has lost his way
in unfamiliar country, will be guided solely by chance
without fixed purpose or the least idea either of
starting-point or goal.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The whole of this book, therefore, will be devoted
to arrangement, an art the acquisition of which would
never have been such a rarity, had it been possible to
lay down general rules which would suit all subjects.
Put since cases in the courts have always presented
an infinite variety, and will continue to do so, and
since through all the centuries there has never been
found one single case which was exactly like any
other, the pleader must rely upon his sagacity, keep
his eyes open, exercise his powers of invention and
judgment and look to himself for advice. On the
other hand, I do not deny that there are some points
which are capable of demonstration and which
accordingly I shall be careful not to pass by.</p>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><hi rend="italics">Division,</hi> as I have already stated,<note>v. x. 63.</note> means the
division of a group of things into its component
parts, <hi rend="italics">partition</hi> is the separation of an individual
whole into its elements, <hi rend="italics">order</hi> the correct disposition

<pb id="p.7"/>

of things in such a way that what follows coheres
with what precedes, while <hi rend="italics">arrangement</hi> is the distribution of things and parts to the places which it is
expedient that they should occupy.<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But we must
remember that <hi rend="italics">arrangement</hi> is generally dependent
on expediency, and that the same question will not
always be discussed first by both parties. An
example of what I mean, to quote no others, is
provided by Demosthenes and Aeschines, who adopt
a different order in the trial of Ctesiphon, since the
accuser begins by dealing with the legal question
involved, in which he thought he had the advantage,
whereas the advocate for the defence treats practically every other topic before coming to the question
of law, with a view to preparing the judges for a
consideration of the legal aspect of the case.<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For
it will often be expedient for the parties to place
different points first; otherwise the pleading would
always be determined by the good pleasure of the
prosecution. Finally, in a case of mutual accusation,<note><hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> III. <hi rend="italics">x.</hi> 4.</note>
where both parties have to defend themselves before
accusing their antagonist, the order of everything
must necessarily be different. I shall therefore set
forth the method adopted by myself, about which I
have never made any mystery: it is the result in
part of instruction received from others, in part of
my own reasoning.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>When engaged in forensic disputes I made it a
point to make myself familiar with every circumstance connected with the case.<note><hi rend="italics">cp</hi> iv. iv. 8; IV. ii. 28.</note> (In the schools,
of course, the facts of the case are definite and
limited in number and are moreover set out before
we begin to declaim: the Greeks call them <hi rend="italics">themes,</hi>
which Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">Top.,</hi> 21.</note> translates by <hi rend="italics">propositions.</hi>) When I

<pb id="p.9"/>

had formed a general idea of these circumstances, I
proceeded to consider them quite as much from my
opponent's point of view as from my own.<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The
first point which I set myself to determine (it is
easy enough to state, but is still all-important) was
what each party desired to establish and then what
means he was likely to adopt to that end. My
method was as follows. I considered what the
prosecutor would say first: his point must either be
admitted or controversial: if admitted, no question
could arise in this connexion.<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> I therefore passed to
the answer of the defence and considered it from the
same standpoint: even there the point was sometimes one that was admitted. It was not until the
parties ceased to agree that any question arose.
'fake for example the following case. <quote>You killed
a man.</quote> <quote>Yes, I killed him.</quote> Agreed, I pass to
the defence,<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> which has to produce the motive for
the homicide. <quote>It is lawful,</quote> lie urges, <quote>to kill an
adulterer with his paramour.</quote> Another admitted
point, for there is no doubt about the law. We
must look for a third point where the two parties are
at variance. <quote>They were not adulterers,</quote> say the
prosecution; <quote>They were,</quote> say the defence. Here
then is the question at issue: there is a doubt as to
the facts, and it is therefore a question of <hi rend="italics">conjecure.</hi><note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> a question as to facts. <hi rend="italics">cv.</hi> VII. ii.</note>
Sometimes even the third point may be admitted;<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>
it is granted that they were adulterers. <quote>But,</quote> says
the accuser, <quote>you had no right to kill them, for you
were an exile</quote> or <quote>had forfeited your civil rights.</quote>
The question is now one of law. On the other
hand, if when the prosecution says, <quote>You killed
them,</quote> the defence at once replies, <quote>I did not,</quote> the
issue is raised without more delay.</p>

<pb id="p.11"/>

<p>If it requires some search to discover where the
dispute really begins, we must consider what constitutes the first question. The charge may be simple,<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>
as for example <quote>Rabirius killed Saturninus,</quote><note><hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> v. xi. 6.</note> or
complex like the following: <quote>The offence committed
by Lucius Varenus falls under the law of assassination
for he procured the murder of Gaius Varenus, the
wounding of Gnaeus Varenus and also the murder
of Salarius.</quote><note><hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> v. xiii. 38.</note> In the latter case there will be a
number of propositions, a statement which also
applies to civil suits as well. But in a complex case
there may be a number of <hi rend="italics">questions</hi> and <hi rend="italics">bases</hi>:<note><hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> III. vi. 1 <hi rend="italics">sq.</hi></note> for
instance the accused may deny one fact, justify
another and plead technical grounds to show<note><hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> III. vi. 23 and 52.</note> that
a third fact is not actionable. In such cases the
pleader will have to consider what requires refutation
and where that refutation should be placed.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>As regards the prosecutor, I do not altogether
disagree with Celsus, who, though no doubt in so
doing he is following the practice of Cicero, insists
with some vehemence on the view that the first
place should be given to some strong argument,
but that the strongest should be reserved to the end,
while the weaker arguments should be placed in the
middle, since the judge has to be moved at the beginning and forcibly impelled to a decision at the end.
But with the defence it is different:<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> the strongest
arguments as a rule require to be disposed of first,
for fear that the judge through having his thoughts
fixed on those arguments should regard the defence
of other points with disfavour. Sometimes, however,
this order is subject to alteration; for example if the
minor arguments are obviously false and the refutation of the most serious argument a matter of some

<pb id="p.13"/>

difficulty, we should attack it last of all, after discrediting the prosecution by demonstrating the falsity
of the former, thereby disposing the judges to believe that all their arguments are equally unreliable.
We shall, however, require to preface our remarks by
explaining why we postpone dealing with the most
serious charge, and by promising that we will deal
with it at a later stage: otherwise the fact that we do
not dispose of it at once may give the impression that
we are afraid of it.<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Charges brought against the
past life of the accused should generally be dealt
with first in order that the judge may be well disposed to listen to our defence on that point on which
lie has to give his verdict. But Cicero in the <hi rend="italics">pro
Vareno</hi> postpones his treatment of such charges to
the conclusion, being guided not by the general rule,
but by the special circumstances of the case.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="13"/>When the accusation is simple, we must consider
whether to give a single answer to the charge or
several. In the former case, we must decide
whether the question is one of fact or of law: if it is
one of fact, we must deny the fact or justify it: if, on
the other hand, it is a question of law, we must decide
on what special point the dispute arises and whether
the question turns on the letter or the intention of
the law.<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> We shall do this by considering what the
law is which gives rise to the dispute, that is to say
under what law the court has been constituted. In
scholastic themes, for example, the laws are sometimes stated merely with a view to connecting the
arguments of the cases. Take the following case:
<quote>A father who recognises a son whom he has exposed in infancy, shall only take him back after paying
for his keep. A disobedient son may be disinherited.

<pb id="p.15"/>

A man who took back a son whom he had exposed
orders him to marry a wealthy neighbour. The son
desires to marry the daughter of the poor man who
brought him up.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="15"/> The law about children who have
been exposed affords scope for emotional treatment,
while the decision of the court turns on the law of
disinheritance.<note>The first law is strictly irrelevant to the case, but can
be employed by the son to stir the jury's emotions. He owes
a deep debt of gratitude to his poor foster-father, and his
love for his foster-sister is based on life-long acquaintance.
The father, on the other hand, will urge that his payment
for his son's nurture has discharged the debt due to the poor
man and that his son is once more under the <hi rend="italics">patria potestas.</hi>
The introduction of the first law thus enables the pleader to
introduce fresh arguments and is thus said to link up the
arguments.</note> On the other hand, a question may
turn on more laws than one, as in cases of <foreign lang="greek">a)ntinomi/a</foreign>
or contradictory laws.<note><hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> III. vi. 46. and vii.</note> It is by consideration of such
points as these that we shall be able to determine
the point of law out of which the dispute arises.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="16"/>As an example of complex defence I may quote
the <hi rend="italics">pro Rabirio:</hi> <quote>If he had killed him, he would
have been justified in so doing: but he did not kill
him.</quote> But when we advance a number of points in
answer to a single proposition, we must first of all
consider everything that can be said on the subject,
and then decide which out of these points it is expedient to select and where to put them forward.
My views on this subject are not identical with
those which I admitted a little while ago<note>&sect; 10.</note> on the
subject of <hi rend="italics">propositions</hi> and on that of <hi rend="italics">arguments</hi> in
the section which I devoted to <hi rend="italics">proofs,</hi><note>v. xii. 14.</note> to the effect
that we may sometimes begin with the strongest.<milestone unit="section" n="17"/>
For when we are defending, there should always be an
increase of force in the treatment of questions and we
should proceed from the weaker to the stronger,
whether the points we raise are of the same or of a
different character.<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> Questions of law will often arise
from one ground of dispute after another, whereas
questions of fact are always concerned with one point;<note>This statement amounts to no more than that there may
be infinite complication where questions of law are concerned, but questions of fact are simple and there is but one
point to be considered, <quote>was such and such an act
committed?</quote></note>

<pb id="p.17"/>

but the order to be followed is the same in both
cases. We must, however, deal first with points that
differ in character. In such cases the weakest
should always be handled first, for the reason that
there are occasions when after discussing a question
we make a concession or present of it to our opponents: for we cannot pass on to others without
dropping those which come first.<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> This should be
done in such a way as to give the impression not
that we regard the points as desperate, but that we
have deliberately dropped them because we can
prove our case without them. Suppose that the
agent for a certain person claims the interest on a
loan as due under an inheritance. The question may
here arise whether such a claim can be made by an
agent.<note>See IV. iv. 6.</note> Assume that, after discussing the question,<milestone unit="section" n="20"/>
we drop it or that the argument is refuted. We
then raise the question whether the person in whose
name the action is brought has the right to employ
an agent. Let us yield this point also.<note><hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> III. 6, 8.</note> The case
will still admit of our raising the question whether
the person in whose name the suit is brought is
heir to the person to whom the interest was due
and again whether he is sole heir.<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> Grant these
points also and we can still raise the question whether
the sum is due at all? On the other hand, no one
will be so insane as to drop what he considers his
strongest point and pass to others of minor importance. The following case from a scholastic theme
is of a similar character. <quote>You may not disinherit
your adopted son. And if you may disinherit him
<hi rend="italics">qu&acirc;</hi> adopted son, you may not disinherit one who is
so brave. And if you may disinherit one who is so
brave, you may not disinherit him because he has

<pb id="p.19"/>

not obeyed your every command; and if he was
bound to obey you in all else, you may not disinherit
him on the ground of his choice of a reward; and
even if the choice of a reward may give just ground
for disinheriting, that is not true of such a choice
as he actually made.<note>The adopted son has done some heroic deed, bringing
him under the scholastic law <hi rend="italics">vir fortis optet quod uolet,</hi> <quote>Let
a hero choose what reward he will</quote> (<hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> v. x. 97). A
scandalous choice might give ground for disinheriting him
(cp. &sect; 24 below), but the choice in question is not
scandalous.</note><milestone unit="section" n="22"/></quote> Such is the nature of
dissimilarity where points of law are concerned.
Where, however, the question is one of fact, there
may be several points all tending to the same result,
of which some may be dropped as not essential to
the main issue, as for instance if a man accused of
theft should say to his accuser, <quote>Prove that you had
the property, prove that you lost it, prove that it
was stolen, prove that it was stolen by me.</quote> The
first three can be dropped, but not the last.</p>
<p>I used also to employ the following method.<milestone unit="section" n="23"/> I
went back from the ultimate <hi rend="italics">species</hi> (which generally
contains the vital point of the case) to the first
general question or descended from the <hi rend="italics">genus</hi> to the
ultimate <hi rend="italics">species,</hi><note><hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> v. x. 5, 6. The statement <quote>man is an animal</quote> is
insufficient as a definition, <quote>animal</quote> being the <hi rend="italics">genus.</hi> <quote>Man
is mortal</quote> introduces a <hi rend="italics">species,</hi> but one common to other
animals. <quote>Man is rational</quote> introduces the <hi rend="italics">ultima species.</hi></note> applying this method even to deliberative themes.<milestone unit="section" n="24"/> For example, Numa is deliberating
whether to accept the crown offered him by the
Romans. First he considers the general question,
<quote>Ought I to be a king?</quote> Then, <quote>Ought I to be
king in a foreign state? Ought I to be king at
Rome? Are the Romans likely to put up with such
a king as myself?</quote> So too in controversial themes.
Suppose a brave man to choose another man's wife
as his reward. The ultimate <hi rend="italics">species</hi> is found in the
question whether lie is allowed to choose another
man's wife. The <hi rend="italics">general</hi> question is whether he
should be given whatever he chooses. Next come
questions such as whether he can choose his reward
from the property of private individuals, whether he

<pb id="p.21"/>

can choose a bride as his reward, and if so, whether
he can choose one who is already married.<milestone unit="section" n="25"/> But in
our search for such questions we follow an order
quite different from that which we employ in actual
speaking.<note><hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> III. ix. 6.</note> For that which as a rule occurs to us first,
is just that which ought to come last in our speech:
as for instance the conclusion, <quote>You have no right
to choose another man's wife.</quote> Consequently undue
haste will spoil our division of the subject. We
must not therefore be content with the thoughts
that first offer themselves, but should press our
inquiry further till we reach conclusions such as
that he ought not even to choose a widow: a further
advance is made when we reach the conclusion that
be should choose nothing that is private property, or
last of all we may go back to the question next in
order to the general question, and conclude that he
should choose nothing inequitable.<milestone unit="section" n="26"/> Consequently
after surveying our opponent's proposition, an easy
task, we should consider, if possible, what it is most
natural to answer first. And, if we imagine the case
as being actually pleaded and ourselves as under the
necessity of making a reply, that answer will probably suggest itself. On the other hand,<milestone unit="section" n="27"/> if this is
impossible, we should put aside whatever first <hi rend="italics">occurs</hi>
to us and reason with ourselves as follows: <quote>What
if this were not the case?</quote> We must then repeat
the process a second and a third time and so on,
until nothing is left for consideration. Thus we
shall examine even minor points, by our treatment
of which we may perhaps make the judge all the
better disposed to us when we come to the main
issue.<milestone unit="section" n="28"/> The rule that we should descend from the
<hi rend="italics">common</hi> to the <hi rend="italics">particular</hi> is much the same, since

<pb id="p.23"/>

what is <hi rend="italics">common</hi> is usually <hi rend="italics">general.</hi> For example,
<quote>He killed a tyrant</quote> is <hi rend="italics">common,</hi> while <quote>A tyrant
was killed by his son, by a woman or by his wife</quote>
are all <hi rend="italics">particular.</hi></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="29"/>I used also to note down separately whatever was
admitted both by my opponent and myself, provided
it suited my purpose, and not merely to press any
admissions that he might make, but to multiply
them by partition, as for example in the following
controversial theme:&mdash;<quote>A general, who had stood
against his father as a candidate and defeated him,
was captured: the envoys who went to ransom him
met his father returning from the enemy. He said
to the envoys, 'You are too late.'<milestone unit="section" n="30"/> They searched
the father and found gold in his pockets. They
pursued their journey and found the general crucified. He cried to them, ' Beware of the traitor.'
The father is accused.</quote> What points are admitted
by both parties? <quote>We were told that there had
been treason and told it by the general.</quote> We try
to find the traitor. <quote>You admit that you went to the
enemy, that you did so by stealth, that you returned
unscathed, that you brought back gold and had it
concealed about your person.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="31"/> For an act of the
accused may sometimes be stated in such a way as
to tell heavily against him, and if our statement
makes a real impression on the mind of the judge,
it may serve to close his ears to all that is urged by
the defence. For as a general rule it is of advantage
to the accuser to mass his facts together and to the
defence to separate them.</p>
<p>I used also, with reference to the whole material
of the case, to do what I have already mentioned<note>V. x. 66.</note>
as being done with arguments, namely, after first

<pb id="p.25"/>

setting forth all the facts without exception, I then
disposed of all of them with the one exception
of the fact which I wished to be believed. For
example, in charges of collusion it may be argued
as follows.<milestone unit="section" n="32"/> <quote>The means for securing the acquittal
of an accused person are strictly limited. His innocence may be established, some superior authority
may intervene, force or bribery may be employed,
his guilt may be difficult to prove, or there may be
collusion between the advocates. You admit that
he was guilty; no superior authority intervened, no
violence was used and you make no complaint that
the jury was bribed, while there was no difficulty
about proving his guilt. What conclusion is left to
us save that there was collusion?</quote><milestone unit="section" n="33"/> If I could not
dispose of all the points against me, I disposed of
the majority. <quote>It is acknowledged that a man was
killed: but he was not killed in a solitary place,
such as might lead me to suspect that he was the
victim of robbers; he was not killed for the sake of
plunder, for nothing was taken from him; he was
not killed in the hope of inheriting his property, for
he was poor: the motive must therefore have been
hatred, since you are his enemy.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="34"/> The task not
merely of division, but of invention as well, is rendered materially easier by this method of examining
all possible arguments and arriving at the best by a
process of elimination. Milo is accused of killing
Clodius. Either he did or did not do the deed.
The best policy would be to deny the fact, but that
is impossible. It is admitted then that he killed
him. The act must then have been either right or
wrong. We urge that it was right. If so, the act
must have either been deliberate or under

<pb id="p.27"/>

compulsion of necessity, for it is impossible to plead
ignorance.<milestone unit="section" n="35"/> The intention is doubtful, but as it is
generally supposed to have existed, some attempt
must he made to defend it and to show that it was
for the good of the state. On the other hand, if we
plead necessity, we shall argue that the fight was
accidental and unpremeditated. One of the two
parties then must have lain in wait for the other.
Which was it? Clodius without doubt. Do you
see how inevitably we are led to the right method
of defence by the logical necessity of the facts?<milestone unit="section" n="36"/> We
may carry the process further: either he wished to
kill Clodius, who lay in wait for him, or he did not.
The safer course is to argue that he did not wish
to kill him. It was then the slaves of Milo who did
the deed without Milo's orders or knowledge. But
this line of defence shows a lack of courage and
lessens the weight of our argument that Clodius
was rightly killed.<milestone unit="section" n="37"/> We shall therefore add the
words, <quote>As every man would have wished his slaves
to do under similar circumstances.</quote><note><hi rend="italics">pro Mil.</hi> x. 29.
V. iv. 8.</note> This method is
all the more useful from the fact that often we can
find nothing to say that really pleases us and yet
have got to say something. Let us therefore consider every possible point; for thus we shall discover what is the best line for us to pursue, or at
any rate what is least bad. Sometimes, as I have
already said in the appropriate context,<note><hi rend="italics">pro Mil.</hi> x. 29.
V. iv. 8.</note> we may
make good use of the statement of our opponent,
since occasionally it is equally to the purpose of
both parties.</p>
<p>I am aware that some authors have written
thousands of lines to show how we may discover
which party ought to speak first. But in the actual

<pb id="p.29"/>

practice of the courts this is decided either by some
brutally rigid formula, or by the character of the
suit, or finally by lot.<milestone unit="section" n="38"/> In the schools, on the other
hand, such an enquiry is mere waste of time, since
the prosecution and the defence are indifferently
permitted to state a case and refute it in the same
declamation. But in the majority of controversial
themes it is not even possible to discover who
should speak first, as for instance in the following:
<quote>A certain man had three sons, an orator, a
philosopher and a physician. In his will he divided
his property into four portions, three of which he
distributed equally among his sons, while the fourth
was to go to the son who rendered the greatest
service to his country.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="39"/> The sons dispute the point.
It is uncertain who should speak first, but our
course is clear enough. For we shall begin with the
son whose role we assume. So much for the general
rules by which we should be guided in making our
<hi rend="italics">division.</hi></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="40"/>But how shall we discover those <hi rend="italics">questions</hi> which
present abnormal difficulty? Just as we discover
reflexions, words, figures or the appropriate <hi rend="italics">nuances</hi>
of style,<note>Or perhaps <quote>glosses,</quote> <hi rend="italics">i. e.</hi> the giving of a special aspect
to the case by skilful representation of facts.</note> namely by native wit, by study and by
practice. None the less it will be rare for anyone
who is not a fool to fail to discover them, so long as
he is content, as I have said,<note>&sect; 26.</note> to accept nature for a
guide.<milestone unit="section" n="41"/> Many, however, in their passionate desire to
win a reputation for eloquence are content to produce
showy passages which contribute nothing to the
proof of their case, while others think that their
enquiry need not proceed further than that which
meets the eye.</p>
<p>To make my meaning clearer, I will cite a

<pb id="p.31"/>

solitary example from the controversial themes of
the schools; it is neither novel nor complicated.
<milestone unit="section" n="42"/><quote>The man who refuses to appear in defence
of his father when accused of treason shall be
disinherited: the man who is condemned for treason
shall be banished together with his advocate. A
father accused of treason was defended by one
son who was a fluent speaker, while another son,
who was uneducated, refused to appear for him.
The father was condemned and banished with his
advocate. The uneducated son performed some
heroic act and demanded as a reward the restoration
of his father and brother. The father returned and
died intestate. The uneducated son claims a portion
of his estate, the orator claims the whole for himself.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="43"/> In this case those paragons of eloquence,
who laugh at us because we trouble our heads about
cases that rarely occur, will always assume the
popular r&ocirc;le. They will defend the uneducated
against the eloquent son, the brave against the
coward, the son who secured the recall of his kin
against the ungrateful son, the son who is content
with a portion of the inheritance against the son
who would refuse his brother a share in their
patrimony.<milestone unit="section" n="44"/> All these points are actually to be
found in the case and are of considerable importance, but they are not such as to render victory
a certainty. In such a case they will, as far as
possible, search for daring or obscure reflexions (for
to-day obscurity is accounted a virtue), and they
will think they have given the theme a brilliant
treatment by ranting and raving over it. Those, on
the other hand, whose ideals are higher, but who
restrict themselves merely to the obvious, will note

<pb id="p.33"/>

the following points, which are, however, purely
superficial.<milestone unit="section" n="45"/> The uneducated son may be excused
for not appearing at the trial on the ground that he
could contribute nothing to his father's defence: but
even the orator has no claim on the gratitude of
the accused, since the latter was condemned:<note><hi rend="italics">Sc.</hi> in spite of his own eloquence.</note> the
man who secured the recall of his kin deserves
to receive the inheritance, while the man who
refuses to divide it with his brother, more especially with a brother who has deserved so well
of him, is avaricious, unnatural and ungrateful:
they will further note that the first and essential
question is that which turns on the letter and intention of the law; unless this is first disposed of,
all subsequent arguments must fall to the ground.<milestone unit="section" n="46"/>
He, however, who follows the guidance of nature
will assuredly reflect as follows: the first argument
of the uneducated son will be, <quote>My father died
intestate and left two sons, my brother and myself;
I claim a share in his estate by the law of nations.</quote>
Who is so ignorant or so lacking in education as
not to make this his opening, even though he
does not know what is meant by a proposition?<note>See IV. iv.</note><milestone unit="section" n="47"/>
He will then proceed to extol, though with due
moderation, the justice of this common law of
nations. The next point for our consideration is
what reply can be made to so equitable a demand?
The answer is clear:&mdash;<quote>There is a law which disinherits the man who fails to appear in his father's
defence when the latter is accused of treason, and
you failed to appear.</quote> This statement will be
followed by the necessary praise of the law and
denunciation of the man who failed to appear.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="48"/>So far we have been dealing entirely with

<pb id="p.35"/>

admitted facts. Let us now return to the claimant.
Unless he is hopelessly unintelligent, surely the
following argument will suggest itself:&mdash;<quote>If the law
bars the way, there is no ground for action and the
trial becomes a farce. But it is beyond question that
the law exists and that the uneducated son did
commit the offence for which it enacts a punishment.</quote> What then shall we say? <quote>I had no
education.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="49"/> But if the law applies to all men, it
will be of no avail to plead lack of education. We
must therefore try to discover whether there be not
some point on which the law can be invalidated.
We turn for guidance to nature (a point on which
I cannot insist too often); what does she suggest
save that when the letter of the law is against us,
we should discuss its intention? This introduces
the general question whether we are to stand by the
letter or the spirit. But if we argue this question
on general grounds with reference to law in the
abstract, we shall go on for ever; it is a question
that has never been decided. We must therefore
restrict our enquiry to the particular law on which
our case turns and try to find some argument
against adhesion to the strict letter.<milestone unit="section" n="50"/> Well, then, is
everyone who fails to appear in defence of his father
to be disinherited? Are there no exceptions to the
rule? At this point the following arguments will
spontaneously suggest themselves. <quote>Is an infant
liable to the law?</quote> For we may imagine a case
where the son is an infant and has failed to appear
in his father's support. Again <quote>does the law apply
to a man who was away from home or absent on
military service or on an embassy?</quote> We have
gained a considerable amount of ground; for we

<pb id="p.37"/>

have established the fact that a man may fail to
appear for his father and still inherit.<milestone unit="section" n="51"/> Our declaimer,
who has thought out this line of argument, must now
pass over like a Latin flute-player, as Cicero says,<note><hi rend="italics">Pro Mur.</hi> xii. 26. The flute-player went from one actor
to another, according as each required accompaniment.</note>
to the side of the eloquent son and reply, <quote>Granted,
but you are not an infant, you were not away from
home nor absent on military service.</quote> Is there any
answer to this except the previous reply, <quote>I am an
uneducated man</quote>?<milestone unit="section" n="52"/> But to this there is the obvious
retort, <quote>Even if you could not actually plead,
you might have supported him by your presence,</quote>
which is no more than the simple truth. The uneducated son must therefore return to the intention
of the legislator. <quote>He wished to punish unfilial
conduct, but I am not unfilial.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="53"/> To this the
eloquent son will reply, <quote>The action whereby you
deserved disinheritance was unfilial, although penitence or desire for display may have subsequently
led you to choose this as your reward. Further,
it was owing to you that our father was condemned,
since by absenting yourself you appeared to imply
that you thought him guilty.</quote> The uneducated son
replies, <quote>Nay, you contributed to his condemnation, for you had given offence to many and made
our family unpopular.</quote> These arguments are based
on conjecture, as also will be the excuse put forward
by the uneducated son to the effect that his father
advised his absence, as he did not wish to emperil
his whole family. All these arguments are involved
in the preliminary question as to the letter and the
intention of the law.<milestone unit="section" n="54"/> Let us pursue the matter
further and see if we can discover any additional
arguments. How is that to be done? I am deliberately imitating the actual train of thought of one

<pb id="p.39"/>

who is engaged in such an enquiry with a view to
showing how such enquiry should be conducted. I
shall therefore put aside the more showy kind of
composition, and concern myself solely with such as
may be of real profit to the student.</p>
<p>So far we have derived all our questions from the
character of the claimant. But why should we not
make some enquiries into the character of the father?
Does not the law say that whoever fails to appear
for his father is to be disinherited?<milestone unit="section" n="55"/> Why should we
not try asking whether this means that he is to be
disinherited, whatever the character of the father
for whom he failed to appear? Such a course is
often adopted in those controversial themes in
which we demand that sons who fail to maintain
their parents should be cast into prison: take for
example the case of the mother who gave evidence
against her son when accused of being an alien, or
of the father who sold his son to a procurer. What,
then, is there in the present case that we lay hold of
as regards the character of the father?<milestone unit="section" n="56"/> He was
condemned. But does the law apply only to those
cases where the father is acquitted? At first sight
the question is difficult. But let us not despair. It
is probable that the intention of the legislator was
that innocent parents should secure the support of
their children. But the uneducated son will be
ashamed to produce this argument, since he acknowledges that his father was innocent.<milestone unit="section" n="57"/> There is, however, another line of argument which may be drawn
from the enactment that the person condemned for
treason should be banished together with his
advocate. It seems almost impossible that in one
and the same case a son should incur a penalty,

<pb id="p.41"/>

both if he appeared in his father's defence and if
he did not appear. Further, exiles are outlaws.
Therefore the letter of the law cannot conceivably apply to the advocate of the condemned
man.<milestone unit="section" n="58"/> For how can an exile hold any property?
The uneducated son raises a doubt as to the interpretation both of the letter and the spirit of the law.
Tile eloquent son will cling to the strict letter of
tile law, which makes no exception, and will argue
that the reason for enacting a penalty against those
who fail to appear for their fathers was to prevent
their being deterred from the defence of their
fathers by the risk of banishment, and he will assert
that his brother failed to appear in defence of
his innocent father. It may therefore be worth
while pointing out that two <hi rend="italics">general questions</hi> may
arise out of one <hi rend="italics">basis</hi>&mdash;<note>III. vi. 1 <hi rend="italics">sqq.</hi> The <hi rend="italics">basis</hi> or main point on which the case
turns is that of the intention of the law (<hi rend="italics">voluntas</hi>).</note> for we may ask, <quote>Is everyone who fails to appear liable to disinheritance?</quote>
or <quote>Is he bound to appear irrespective of the
character of his father?</quote></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="59"/>So far all our questions have been derived from
two of the persons involved.<note><hi rend="italics">i. e.</hi> the father and the uneducated son.</note> With regard to the
third, this can give rise to no question, as there is
no dispute about his portion of the inheritance.
Still the time is not yet come to relax our
efforts: for so far all the arguments might have
been used even if the father had not been recalled
from exile. But we must not betake ourselves
at once to the obvious point that he was recalled
by the agency of the uneducated son. A little
ingenuity will lead us to look further a field:
for as <hi rend="italics">species</hi> comes after <hi rend="italics">genus,</hi> so <hi rend="italics">genus</hi> precedes
<hi rend="italics"><milestone unit="section" n="60"/>species.</hi> Let us therefore assume that the father
was recalled by someone else. This will give rise

<pb id="p.43"/>

to a question of the ratiocinative or syllogistic type,<note><hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> III. vi. 15, 43, 46, 51; vii. viii. 1.</note>
namely whether recall from exile cancels the sentence of the court and is tantamount to the trial
never having taken place at all. The uneducated
son will therefore attempt to argue that, being
entitled to not more than one reward, there was no
means by which he could have secured the recall of
his kin save by the restoration of his father on the
same terms as if he had never been accused, and
that this fact carries with it the cancellation of the
penalty incurred by his advocate, as though he had
never defended his father at all.<note>The reward to be chosen, it is argued, covered the
recall of one person only. The only means by which <hi rend="italics">both</hi>
father and son could be recalled was by the restoration of
the father, whose amnesty would <hi rend="italics">ipso facto</hi> extend to the son
as well.</note><milestone unit="section" n="61"/> Our next point
will be that which first occurred to us, namely the
plea that he was recalled by the agency of the
uneducated son. At this point we are confronted
by the question whether the son who secured his
father's restoration is thereby to be regarded in the
light of an advocate, since he secured for him
precisely what his original advocate demanded for
him, and it is not an unreasonable claim to ask that
an action should be regarded as equivalent when it
is really more than equivalent.<milestone unit="section" n="62"/> The remaining
points turn on questions of equity, for we ask which
of the two sons makes the juster claim. This
question admits of still further division. The claim
of the uneducated son would have been the juster
even if both had claimed the whole property. How
much more so when one claims only a half and the
other the whole to the exclusion of his brother.
And then, even after we have dealt with all these
points, an appeal to the memory of his father will
carry great weight with the judges, more especially
as the dispute is about the father's estate. This
will give rise to conjecture as to what the intentions

<pb id="p.45"/>

of the father were at the time of his dying intestate.
This conjecture, however, involves a question of
<hi rend="italics">quality,</hi> and is employed in the service of a
different <hi rend="italics">basis.</hi><note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> qualitative, <hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> III. vi. 43.</note><milestone unit="section" n="63"/> As a rule questions of equity are
best introduced at the conclusion of a case, since
there is nothing to which the judges give more
ready hearing. Sometimes, however, the interests
of the case demand a change in this order; for
example if we regard our case as weak in point of
law, it will be well to secure the good-will of the
judge by dealing with the question of equity first.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="64"/>This concludes my general rules on this subject.
We will now proceed to consider the several parts
of forensic cases, and although I cannot follow them
to the <hi rend="italics">ultimate species,</hi><note><hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> VI. i. 23.</note> that is to say, I cannot deal
with individual suits and controversies, I shall be
able to discuss them on general lines in such a way
as to show what <hi rend="italics">bases</hi> most of them involve. And
since the first question naturally is whether an
alleged fact has taken place, I will begin with this.</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>All conjecture is concerned either with facts
or intention. Each of these may occur in one of
three times, past, present or future. Questions
concerning facts are either general or definite, that
is to say, those which involve consideration of
persons and those which do not.<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Concerning intentions there can be no questions which do not
involve some person and where the facts of the
case are not admitted. Therefore when the question
turns on some fact, the point on which doubt arises
is either what has been done, or what is being done,
or what is likely to be done. For example, in general
questions we discuss whether the universe <hi rend="italics">has been</hi>
formed of a concourse of atoms, or <hi rend="italics">is</hi> governed by

<pb id="p.47"/>

providence, or <hi rend="italics">is likely</hi> some day to come to an end.
In definite questions, on the other hand, we discuss whether Roscius <hi rend="italics">has</hi> murdered his father,
whether Manlius <hi rend="italics">is</hi> aiming at making himself king,
or Quintus Caecilius <hi rend="italics">will be</hi> justified in appearing
as the accuser of Verres.<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In the law courts past
time is of most importance, since all accusations
are concerned with what has actually been done,
while what is being done or is likely to be done is
inferred from the past. We also enquire into origins.
For instance, we enquire whether a pestilence be
due to the anger of heaven, the inclement weather,
the pollution of the water-supply, or the noxious
vapours emitted by the earth. Again, we seek for
the motives of an act. For example, we enquire
whether the fifty kings who sailed against Troy did
so because they were bound by their oath, or were
moved to do so by righteous indignation, or merely
desired to gratify the sons of Atreus. There is no
very great difference between these two classes of
question.<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> As regards facts falling within the present,
if they can be detected by the eye without any
reference to their logical antecedents being required,
there will be no need of conjecture: let us suppose,
for instance, that the Lacedaemonians are enquiring
whether the Athenians are erecting fortifications.
But although conjecture may seem entirely foreign
to this class of question, there are cases in which it
it necessary, as in questions of personal identity,
which may be illustrated by the action brought
against the heirs of Urbinia,<note><hi rend="italics">cv.</hi> IV. i. 11 and VII. ii. 26.</note> where the question
was whether the man who claimed the property as
being the son of the deceased, was Figulus or Sosipater.<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In this case the actual person was before the

<pb id="p.49"/>

eyes of the court, so that there could be no question
whether he existed (as there is, for instance, when
we ask whether there exists any land beyond the
Ocean)<note><hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> <milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>viii. 16.</note> nor what he was nor of what kind. The
question was simply, who he was. But this kind of
dispute also depends on past time. The problem is
whether this man Clusinius Figulus <hi rend="italics">was</hi> born of
Urbinia. Such disputes have arisen even in our
own day, indeed I myself have pleaded in such.
On the other hand,<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> conjecture as to intention is
obviously concerned with all three times. We ask
with what purpose Ligarius <hi rend="italics">went</hi> to Africa, with
what purpose Pyrrhus <hi rend="italics">is</hi> asking for a treaty, and
how Caesar <hi rend="italics">will</hi> take it if Ptolemy kills Pompey.<note><hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> III. viii. 56.</note></p>
<p>We may also employ conjecture to enquire into
quality in questions dealing with size, species and
number, such as whether the sun is greater than the
earth, whether the moon is spherical, flat or conical,
whether there is one universe or several, or,<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> to go
outside these physical speculations, whether the
Trojan or the Peloponnesian war was the greatest,
what was the nature of the shield of Achilles, or
whether there was more than one Hercules.</p>
<p>In forensic cases, however, which consist of
accusation and defence, there is one kind of conjecture by which we enquire both about an act
and about its author. This sometimes treats the two
questions together, as, for example, when both the
act and the identity of the author are denied, and
sometimes separately, as when the first enquiry,
whether the act was committed, is followed by a
second, where, the act being admitted, the question
is by whom it was committed.<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The act itself again
sometimes involves a single question, as, for example,

<pb id="p.51"/>

whether a man is dead, and sometimes two, as, for
instance, whether he died of poison or of some internal
disease. Another form of conjecture is concerned
with the act alone, it being admitted that if the
act was really committed, there can be no doubt as
to its author. A third form is concerned solely with
the author, the act being admitted and the dispute
turning on the question as to who committed it.
This third form is complex.<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> For the accused either
confines himself to denying that he did it or accuses
another of having done it. Further, there is more
than one way of transferring the charge to another.
At times this results in <hi rend="italics">mutual accusation,</hi> which the
Greeks call <foreign lang="greek">a)ntikathgori/a,</foreign> and some of our own authors
<hi rend="italics">concertative accusation.</hi><note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> mutual or reciprocal accusation, see VII. i. 3.</note> At times, on the other hand,
the charge is transferred to some person who
cannot be brought to trial, and may be either
known or unknown: again, if the person is known,
he may be someone outside the case or the victim
himself, who may be alleged to have committed
suicide.<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> In such cases we compare characters,
motives and other circumstances in the same way
as in eases of mutual accusation. Cicero, for instance,
in the <hi rend="italics">pro Vareno</hi> diverts the charge from the
accused to the slaves of Ancharius and in the <hi rend="italics">pro
Scauro</hi> throws the suspicion of Bostar's murder upon
his mother.<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> There is also a different form of comparison, which comes into play when both parties
claim the credit of some act, and yet another kind,
when the question is not as between two persons,
but as between two acts; that is to say, the
question is not which of the two committed an act,
but which of two acts was committed. Finally,
if the act and the identity of the author are both

<pb id="p.53"/>

admitted, we may still raise the question of his
intention.</p>
<p>I shall now proceed to detail. As an example of
joint denial covering both the act and the identity
of the author we may take the following statements,
<quote>I have not committed adultery,</quote> <quote>I have not
sought to establish myself as tyrant.</quote> In cases of
murder or poisoning the denial is often divided as
follows:<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <quote>The act was not committed, and, if it
was committed, it was not by me.</quote> But if the
defence say, <quote>Prove that the man was killed,</quote> the
burden falls solely on the accuser, for the accused can
say nothing more against the charge except perhaps
in the way of casting certain suspicions, which he
should throw out in the vaguest terms, since if you
make one definite assertion, you will have to prove it
or run the risk of losing your case. For when the
question lies between our statement and that of our
opponent, one or other will be regarded as true.
Thus when the point on which we relied for our
defence is overthrown, there is nothing left but the
points that tell against us.<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> For example, when the
question turns on symptoms, which may point either
to poisoning or internal disease, there is no third
course left open and consequently each party sticks
to his statement. At times the question turns on
the nature of the fact, whether, for instance, death
was due to poisoning or internal disease, and arguments are introduced which are drawn from the
circumstances alone without any reference to the
person concerned.<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> For example, it makes a difference whether the deceased was cheerful or depressed,
had been working or taking his ease, had been awake
or sleeping previous to the festive gathering that

<pb id="p.55"/>

was followed by his death. The age of the deceased
is also an important factor, and it is desirable to
know whether he died suddenly or after a long
period of ill health. If the question turns only on
his sudden death, both parties will have still freer
scope for discussion.<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> At times the character of the
accused may be adduced to prove the fact, and to
make it likely that it was or was not a case of
poisoning because the accused is or is not a likely
person to have committed such an act.</p>
<p>When, on the other hand, the enquiry concerns
both the accused and the act, the natural order for
the accuser to pursue is to commence by proving
that the act has been committed and then to go on
to show that it was committed by the accused. If,
however, proofs of the authorship of the crime are
more in number than the proofs of the commission,
this order may be reversed.<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> On the other hand, the
accused will always begin by denying the act, since
if this can be successfully proved, there is no need
to say anything more, while if it is not proved, there
remain other means of defence.</p>
<p>Similarly, when the dispute turns solely on the act
and, the act being proved, there can be no doubt as
to the author, arguments may be drawn in like
manner both from the person and the facts, although
with reference to the question of fact alone.<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Take the
following controversial theme as an example, for it
is best to employ scholastic themes as illustrations
since they are more familiar to the student. <quote>A
man who had been disinherited by his father took
to the study of medicine. His father fell sick and,
his life being despaired of by the other doctors, the
son was called in, and said he would cure him if

<pb id="p.57"/>

he would take a draught prescribed by himself.
The father after drinking part of the draught said
that he had been poisoned: the son drank the
remainder of the draught. The father died and
the son is accused of parricide.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="18"/> There is no doubt
who administered the draught, and, if it was poison,
there is no question as to the author: but the
problem as to whether the draught was poison can
only be decided by arguments drawn from the
character of the accused.</p>
<p>There remains a third type of conjectural case
where the fact is admitted, and the only question
is as to the author. It is unnecessary for me to
quote examples, since such cases are of frequent
occurrence. For example, it may be clear that a
man has been killed or that sacrilege has been committed, but the person accused of the crime may
deny his guilt. It is from such circumstances that
cases of mutual accusation arise, where it is admitted
that the crime has been committed, but each party
charges the other with being the author.<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> With regard to this class of case Celsus points out that they
cannot actually occur in the courts, a fact which I
imagine is familiar to all: for the jury is empanelled
to try one accused person only, and even though
the defence and the prosecution may accuse each
other of tile crime, the first case must be tried before
the second.<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> Apollodorus again stated that mutual
accusation involved two separate disputes, and this
is of course in conformity with the practice of the
courts, which insists on two separate trials. On the
other hand, mutual accusation is possible in cases
tried before the senate or the emperor, and even in
the courts the fact of mutual accusation will involve

<pb id="p.59"/>

no difference in the pleadings, since the same
methods will be required whether the verdict is
given on both charges simultaneously or only on
one.<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> In such cases the defence must always come
first for three reasons. In the first place, we naturally prefer to secure our own safety than to injure
our opponent, while secondly, our accusation will
carry greater weight if we have first proved our
own innocence, and thirdly, we shall thus secure
a double line of defence. For the man who says,
<quote>I did not kill him,</quote> is then free to go on to say,
<quote>You killed him,</quote> whereas it is superfluous for the
man who says, <quote>You killed him,</quote> to go on to say,
<quote>I did not kill him.</quote></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="22"/>Further, such cases consist of comparison, which
may be effected in different ways. For we may either
compare our case in its entirety with that of our
adversary, or we may compare individual arguments.
The choice between these two methods can only
be determined by the requirements of the case. For
example, in the <hi rend="italics">pro Vareno,</hi> Cicero, in dealing with
the first charge, compares the individual arguments:
for it would have been rash in connexion with the
second charge to compare the position of a stranger
with that of a mother.<note>The <hi rend="italics">pro Vareno</hi> being lost, it is impossible to say to
what this refers, and for the same reason Halm's conjecture must be regarded as quite uncertain.</note> It is therefore best, if
possible, to refute argument by individual argument:
if, however, our individual arguments are weak, we
shall try to secure success by comparison of case
with case as a whole.<milestone unit="section" n="23"/> But whether the case is
one of mutual accusation, or the accused throws
the guilt upon his opponent without making any
formal accusation (as Roscius<note>Roscius Amerinus, accused of parricide and defended by
Cicero.</note> did without indicting

<pb id="p.61"/>

his accusers), or the responsibility for the deed be
placed on the victims themselves, whom we allege
to have perished by their own hand, the arguments
for both sides of the case will be compared in
exactly the same way as in cases of mutual accusation.<milestone unit="section" n="24"/> The class of case last mentioned by me is,
however, not merely of frequent occurrence in
the schools, but sometimes actually occurs in the
courts. For example, the sole question in the
case of Naevius of Arpinum was whether he threw
his wife out of the window or she threw herself.
My speech in this case is the only one of all my
pleadings that I have so far published, and I admit
that I was led to do so merely by a youthful
desire for glory. For the other speeches which
circulate as mine have little in them that actually
fell from my lips, having been corrupted by the
carelessness of the shorthand-writers who took
them down with a view to making money out of
them.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="25"/>There is also another type of conjectural case
which, though it involves two questions, is different
from cases of mutual accusation; such cases are concerned with rewards and may be illustrated by the
following controversial theme. <quote>A tyrant, suspecting that his physician had given him poison, tortured
him and, since he persisted in denying that he had
done so, sent for a second physician. The latter
asserted that poison had been administered, but
that he would provide an antidote; he gave him a
draught: the tyrant drank it and died. Both
physicians claim a reward for slaying the tyrant.</quote>
Now just as in cases of mutual accusation where each
party shifts the guilt to his opponent, so in this

<pb id="p.63"/>

case we compare the characters, motives, means,
opportunities, instruments and evidence of the
persons who claim the reward.<milestone unit="section" n="26"/> There is yet another
type of case which, though not one of mutual
accusation, is treated in the same way: I mean a
case in which we enquire, without accusing anyone, which of two acts has taken place. For both
parties make and defend their own statement of
the case. Thus in the suit concerning the estate
of Urbinia<note><hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> <milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>i. 11. and VII. ii. 4.</note> the claimant says that Clusinius Figulus,
the son of Urbinia, on the defeat of the army
in which he was serving, fled and after various
misfortunes, being even even kept in captivity by
the king, at length returned to Italy and his own
home in the Marrucine district, where he was recognised. To this Pollio replies that he had been a
slave to two masters at Pisaurum, that he had
practised medicine, and finally, after receiving his
freedom, inserted himself into a gang of slaves who
were for sale<note>For another meaning of <hi rend="italics">venalis,</hi> newly-bought, see VIII.
ii. 8.</note> and was at his own request purchased by himself.<milestone unit="section" n="27"/> Does not the whole suit consist
of comparison between the two cases and of two
different and opposite sets of conjecture? But the
method to be followed is identical whether the case
be one of accusation and defence or of claim and
denial of the claim.</p>
<p>Conjecture is, in the first place, based on what is
past, under which I include persons, causes and
intent. For in dealing with a case we first ask
what the accused intended to do, next what he was
in a position to do, and lastly what he actually did.
Consequently the first point on which we must fix
our attention is the character of the accused.<milestone unit="section" n="28"/> It is
the business of the accuser to make any charge that

<pb id="p.65"/>

he may bring against the accused not merely discreditable, but as consistent as possible with the
crime for which he is arraigned. For example, if
he calls a man accused of murder a debauchee or
an adulterer, the discredit attaching to such charges
will no doubt tell against the accused, but will, on
the other hand, do less to prove the case than if
he shows him to be bold, insolent, cruel or reckless.<milestone unit="section" n="29"/>
On the other hand, counsel for the defence must,
as far as possible, aim at denying, excusing or
extenuating such charges, or, if that be impossible,
show that they are not relevant to the case. For
there are many charges which not only have no
mutual resemblance, but may even at times contradict each other, as for instance if a man accused
of theft is called prodigal or careless. For it is
not likely that one and the same man should at
once despise money and covet it.<milestone unit="section" n="30"/> If such means
of defence are not available, we must take refuge
with the plea that the charges made are not
relevant to the case, that because a man has committed certain sins, it does not follow that he has
committed all, and that the accusers ventured to
make such false charges merely because they hoped
by injuring and insulting the accused to be able
to overwhelm him with the unpopularity thus
created.<milestone unit="section" n="31"/> There are also other topics which arise
from and against the statement of the case by the
prosecution. The defence may begin by drawing
arguments from the person involved, and will at
times urge on general grounds that it is incredible
that a father has been killed by his son or that a
commander has betrayed his country to the enemy.
The answer to such arguments is easy, for we may

<pb id="p.67"/>

urge that bad men are capable of every crime, as
is shown by every-day occurrences, or that the
atrocious nature of a crime is but a poor argument
against its having been committed.<milestone unit="section" n="32"/> At times we
may base our arguments on the special circumstances
of the person involved. This may be done in various
ways: rank, for example, may be pleaded in defence
of the accused, or at times, on the other hand, may
be employed to prove his guilt on the ground that
he trusted to his rank to secure impunity. Similarly
poverty, humble rank, wealth may be used as arguments for or against the accused according to the
talent of the advocate.<milestone unit="section" n="33"/> Upright character, however,
and the blamelessness of his past life are always of
the utmost assistance to the accused. If no charge
is made against his character, counsel for the defence
will lay great stress on this fact, while the accuser
will attempt to restrict the judge to the sole consideration of the actual issue which the court has
to decide, and will say that there must always be
a first step in crime and that a first offence is not
to be regarded as the occasion for celebrating a
feast in honour of the defendant's character.<milestone unit="section" n="34"/> So
much for the methods of reply which will be employed by the prosecution. But he will also in his
opening speech endeavour to dispose the judges to
believe that it is not so much that he is unable,
as that he is unwilling to bring any charge against
the character of the accused. Consequently it is
better to abstain from casting any slur on the past
life of the accused than to attack him with slight
or frivolous charges which are manifestly false,
since such a proceeding discredits the rest of
our argument. Further, the advocate who brings

<pb id="p.69"/>

no charges against the accused may be believed to
have omitted all reference to past offences on the
ground that such reference was not necessary, while
the advocate who heaps up baseless charges thereby
admits that his only argument is to be found in the
past life of the accused, and that he has deliberately
preferred to risk defeat on this point rather than
say nothing at all about it.<milestone unit="section" n="35"/> As regards the other
arguments derived from character, I have already
discussed them in connexion with <quote>places</quote> of
argument.<note>v. x. 20, where <hi rend="italics">argumentorum loci</hi> are defined as "the
dwellings of arguments, where they hide and where we must
look for them.</note></p>
<p>The next type of proof is derived from causes or
motives, such as anger, hatred, fear, greed or hope,
since all motives can be classified as species of one
or other of these. If any of these motives can be
plausibly alleged against the accused, it is the duty
of the accuser to make it appear that such motives
may lead a man to commit any crime, and to exaggerate the particular motives which he selects for
the purpose of his argument.<milestone unit="section" n="36"/> If no such motive can
be alleged, he must take refuge in suggesting that
there must have been some hidden motive, or in
asserting that, if he committed the act, all enquiry
into motive is irrelevant or that a motiveless crime
is even more abominable than one which has a
motive. Counsel for the defence, on the other hand,
will, wherever it be possible, emphasise the point
that it is incredible that any act should be committed
without a motive. Cicero develops this point with
great energy in a number of his speeches, but more
especially in his defence of Varenus, who had everything else against him and was as a matter of fact
condemned.<milestone unit="section" n="37"/> But if the prosecution do allege some
motive, he will either say that the motive alleged is

<pb id="p.71"/>

false or inadequate or unknown to the accused. For
it is possible that a man may be quite ignorant of
motives imputed to him. He may not, for example,
have known whether the man whom he is accused
of having killed had appointed him his heir
or intended to prosecute him. All else failing,
we may urge that motives are not necessarily of
importance. For what man is there who is not
liable to the emotions of fear, hatred or hope, and
yet numbers of persons act on these motives without
committing crime?<milestone unit="section" n="38"/> Nor should we neglect the point
that all motives do not apply to all persons. For
example, although poverty may in certain cases be a
motive for theft, it will not have the same force with
men such as Curius or Fabricius.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="39"/>The question has been raised as to whether we
should deal first with persons or motives, and different
orators have given different answers: Cicero as a rule
prefers to treat motives first. For my own part, if
the circumstances of the case do not point strongly
in either direction, I consider that the most natural
course is to begin by dealing with persons. For the
enquiry whether any crime can credibly be imputed
to such a man as the accused is of a more general
character than the question whether some one
particular crime can be imputed, and in addition
involves a greater correctness in division.<milestone unit="section" n="40"/> Still, in
many cases expediency may make it desirable to
reverse the order. Further, we have to seek not
merely motives affecting the will, but also causes
leading to error, such as drunkenness or ignorance.
For just as such considerations lessen the guilt of a
crime when regarded from the point of view of its
quality, so they tell heavily against the criminal as

<pb id="p.73"/>

far as the question of fact is concerned.<milestone unit="section" n="41"/> I should
imagine that there could never be a case, or at any rate
an actual case in the courts, in which neither side said
anything about the character of the persons involved;
but this is not true of causes and motives, for it is
often wholly unnecessary to trouble ourselves about
them, as, for example, in cases of theft or adultery,
crimes which carry their motives on the face of them.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="42"/>Next we must consider the intention, a term which
involves a number of questions, such as whether it is
probable that the accused hoped that he would be
able to carry such a crime into effect, or that it
would escape detection when committed, or that,
even if detected, it would be pardoned or punished
but lightly or after considerable lapse of time, or
that the inconvenience involved by the penalty
would be outweighed by the pleasure resulting from
the crime: or again, whether it was worth while
incurring the penalty;<milestone unit="section" n="43"/> and further, whether he could
have done the deed at some other time and in some
other way, or with greater ease or security, as Cicero
says in the <hi rend="italics">pro Milone,</hi><note>c. xiv. <hi rend="italics">sqq.</hi></note> where he mentions the
numerous occasions when his client could have killed
Clodius with impunity. There is also the question
why the accused should have chosen that particular
place or time or means for the commission of the
crime, a topic to which Cicero gives a thorough
treatment in the same passage;<milestone unit="section" n="44"/> or whether, without
having the least reason for the deed, he was carried
away by the impulse of the moment and acted
without deliberate purpose (for it is a common
saying that crimes are irrational), or finally, whether
he was led astray by the fact that crime had become
a habit with him.</p>

<pb id="p.75"/>

<p>Having dealt with the question whether he
intended to commit the crime, we proceed to the
question whether he was in a position to commit it.
Under this head we discuss the place and occasion of
the offence. For instance, in a case of theft we ask
whether it was committed in a secluded or frequented
spot, in the daytime, when witnesses are more
numerous, or by night, when success is more difficult.
<milestone unit="section" n="45"/>Consequently we shall consider all the circumstances
rendering the act difficult or easy of accomplishment;
these require no illustration, being numerous and
familiar. This second topic is of such importance
that, if it is impossible to give it satisfactory treatment, the case falls to the ground; if, however, we
succeed in dealing with it adequately, we must
proceed to consider whether the accused actually
committed the act. But this topic involves conjecture as to intention, for it is from these facts that
we infer whether he hoped for success or not.
Therefore we must also consider the question of
the means at his disposal, such, for example, as the
retinues of Clodius and Milo.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="46"/>The question whether he actually did the deed
belongs, in the first place, to the second division of
time, namely the present, and secondly to time that
is almost, though not actually contemporary: under
this latter head come circumstances such as noise,
cries or groans,<note><hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> <milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>x. 45.</note> while concealment, fear and the
like belong to subsequent time. To these must be
added indications, which we have already discussed
elsewhere,<note>v. ch. ix.</note> and words and acts antecedent or subsequent to the crime.<milestone unit="section" n="47"/> These words and acts are either
our own or those of others. With regard to words,
our own do us greater harm and bring us less profit

<pb id="p.77"/>

than do those of others, while those of others bring
us greater profit and do us less harm than our own.
On the other hand, with regard to deeds, it is sometimes from our own and sometimes from those of
others that we derive the greatest advantage, as, for
example, when our opponent has done something
which tells in our favour: but our own acts are
always more injurious to our case than are those
of others.<milestone unit="section" n="48"/> Again, with regard to words, we must
distinguish between those whose meaning is clear
and those whose significance is doubtful. The latter
will necessarily give less assistance to either side, be
they our own words or another's. On the other hand,
any ambiguity in our own words will always tell
against us, as, for example, in the following controversial theme. <quote>A son, on being asked where his
father was, replied: 'Wherever he is, he is alive.'
But the father was found dead at the bottom of a
well.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="49"/> When the ambiguity lies in words used by
others, they can never do us any harm, unless he
who uttered them be unknown or dead; I will give
two illustrations of my meaning: <quote>A cry was heard
at night, 'Be on your guard against the establishment of a tyranny';</quote> and, <quote>on being asked who
had poisoned him, he replied: 'It is not fit that you
should know.'</quote> For if the speaker is available for
examination, he will clear up the ambiguity.<milestone unit="section" n="50"/> Finally,
whereas our own words and deeds can only be justified by their intention, the deeds and words of others
can be disposed of in a number of different ways.</p>
<p>My remarks on this subject have, I think, been
confined to one very important class of conjectural
cases, but something of what I have said will apply
to all cases. For example, in cases concerned with

<pb id="p.79"/>

theft, deposits and loans, arguments are derived both
from possibilities (as when we enquire whether there
was any money to deposit), and from persons, as when
we raise the question whether it is credible that anyone deposited money with this man or trusted him
with a loan, or that the claimant is bringing a false
accusation, or that the accused repudiates his debt or
is a thief.<milestone unit="section" n="51"/> But even in the case of an accusation of
theft, just as in an accusation of murder, we enquire
both into the act and the author, while in cases
concerned with loans and deposits there are also
two questions (though these are always distinct
from one another), namely, whether the money was
delivered and whether it has been repaid. Cases of
adultery are marked by the following peculiarity,
that, as a rule, the safety of two persons is involved,
and it is necessary to say something of the past life
of both, although some have raised the question
whether both parties should be defended together.
The line to be taken must depend on the circumstances of the individual case: if the defence of one
party lends support to the defence of the other, I
should defend them conjointly; if the reverse is the
case, I should treat the two cases separately.<milestone unit="section" n="52"/> However, that no one may think me somewhat hasty in
saying that two persons are as a rule involved in
charges of adultery, I would point out that I would
not assert that this is always the case. The
woman alone may be accused of adultery with a
person unknown: we may say, <quote>Gifts were found
in the house, and money from some unknown source,
and love-letters whose destination cannot be ascertained.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="53"/> The case is similar in accusations of
forgery: for either there are several accused or only

<pb id="p.81"/>

one. The writer of a document always regards it as
necessary to support the signatory, but the signatory
does not always support the writer of the document,
for it is always possible that he has been deceived
on the matter.<note>The writer will always support the signatory's statement that he signed the document. The signatory will not
always support the writer; <hi rend="italics">e.</hi> g. he may not know the nature
of the document which he signed.</note> On the other hand, the man who is
said to have called in their services, and for whom
the document is alleged to have been written, will
always defend both writer and signatories. The
arguments employed in cases of treason or attempted
tyranny will be drawn from the same sources.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="54"/>But the custom prevalent in the schools of regarding everything not definitely stated in the theme as
being in the speaker's favour,<note><hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> IV. ii. 28. As the examples which follow show, the
declaimer assumes that his imaginary opponent has no good
evidence to support his case: <hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> no witness, no informer,
no weapons, no bodyguard.</note> is likely to prove
harmful to students destined for practice in the
courts. You bring a charge of adultery. <quote>Who is
your witness? who is your informer?</quote> You charge
me with treason. <quote>What was my reward? who was
my accomplice?</quote> You charge me with poisoning.
<quote>Where did I buy the poison, and from whom?
When did I buy it, what was the price, and whom
did I employ to administer it?</quote> Or in defence of
one charged with attempting to establish himself as
tyrant, the declaimer will cry, <quote>Where are my
weapons, and what bodyguards have I ever
collected?</quote><milestone unit="section" n="55"/> I do not deny that these questions
should be asked, or that we should use them as
far as is permitted by the r&ocirc;le which we have
assumed; for even in the courts I feel that it will
be desirable to put such questions, if my opponent
is not in a position to reply effectively; but we have
often felt the lack of such freedom in the courts,
whereas in the schools there is scarcely a case where
one or more examples of this method are not to be
found.<milestone unit="section" n="56"/> Similar to this is the practice which some

<pb id="p.83"/>

declaimers allow themselves in their perorations
of assigning children, parents and nurses to their
characters at will, though it is more reasonable to
call for evidence which is not explicitly mentioned
in the statement of the theme than to introduce it
ourselves.<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> it is safer to ask the imaginary opponent <quote>where
is your evidence?</quote> than to produce imaginary evidence
ourselves.</note></p>
<p>With regard to the method to be followed when
we enquire into intention, I have said enough in
dividing the subject into three questions,<note>&sect; 27.</note> namely,
whether the accused intended to do the deed,
whether he was in a position to do it and whether
he actually did it. For the method of enquiring
into the purpose with which an act was committed
is identical with that employed in enquiring whether
the deed was intended, since it amounts to asking
whether a criminal act was intended.<milestone unit="section" n="57"/> Further, the
order in which the facts are stated may either contribute to or detract from the credibility of our case;
for consistency and the reverse depend to a very
great extent on the way the circumstances are
arranged. But we shall be unable to detect these
qualities unless we consider the circumstances in
connexion with the case as a whole. None the less,
it will always be necessary to consider what are best
suited to be placed together.</p>
<p>III. <hi rend="italics">Conjecture</hi> is followed by <hi rend="italics">definition.</hi> For the
man who cannot assert that he has done nothing,
must needs take refuge in the assertion that lie has
not committed the act which is alleged against him.
Consequently the laws which govern <hi rend="italics">definition</hi> are
for the most part the same as those which govern <hi rend="italics">conjecture,</hi> the only difference lying in the method to be
employed in defence in cases such as those concerned
with theft, deposits or adultery. For just as we say,

<pb id="p.85"/>

<quote>I have not committed theft, I never received a
deposit, I am not guilty of adultery,</quote> so we say,
<quote>This is not theft, this is not a deposit, this is not
adultery.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Sometimes we may pass from <hi rend="italics">quality</hi> to
<hi rend="italics">definition,</hi> as in actions concerned with lunacy, cruelty
and offences against the State. In such cases if it
is impossible to assert that the acts alleged were
right, we are left with such pleas as, <quote>To use bad
language to one's wife does not amount to cruelty.</quote>
Definition is the statement of the fact called in
question in appropriate, clear and concise language.<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>
As I have already said,<note>V. x. 55.</note> it consists mainly in the
statement of <hi rend="italics">genus, species, difference</hi> and <hi rend="italics">property.</hi>
For example, if you wish to define a horse (for I will
take a familiar example), the <hi rend="italics">genus</hi> is animal, the
<hi rend="italics">species</hi> mortal, the <hi rend="italics">diffrence</hi> irrational (since man also
is mortal) and the <hi rend="italics">properly</hi> neighing. Definition is
employed by the orator for a number of different
reasons.<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For sometimes, though there may be no
doubt as to a term, there is a question as to what it
includes, or, on the other hand, there may be no
doubt about the thing, but no agreement as to the
term to be applied to it. When the term is agreed,
but the thing doubtful, conjecture may sometimes
come into play, as, for instance, in the question,
<quote>What is god?</quote><milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For the man who denies that god
is a spirit permeating all things, assuredly asserts
that the epithet <quote>divine</quote> is falsely applied to his
nature, like Epicurus, who gives him a human form
and makes him reside in the intermundane space.
While both use the same term <hi rend="italics">god,</hi> both have to employ conjecture to decide which of the two meanings
is consistent with fact.<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Sometimes again we have
recourse to quality, as in the question, <quote>What is

<pb id="p.87"/>

rhetoric? Is it the power to persuade or the science
of speaking well?</quote> This form of question is of
frequent occurrence in the courts. For instance, the
question may arise whether a man caught in a
brothel with another man's wife is an adulterer.
Here there is no doubt about the name; it is the
significance of the act which is in doubt, since the
question is whether he has committed any sin at all.
For if he has sinned, his sin can only be adultery.<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>
There is a different type of question where the
dispute is concerned with the term to be applied,
which depends on the letter of the law: it is a form
of question which can only arise in the courts from
the actual words on which the dispute turns. Take
as examples the questions, whether suicide is a form
of homicide, or whether the man who forces a tyrant
to kill himself can be considered a tyrannicide, or
whether magical incantations are equivalent to the
crime of poisoning. In all these cases there is no
doubt about the facts, for it is well known that there
is a difference between killing oneself and killing
another, between slaying a tyrant and forcing him
to suicide, between employing incantations and
administering a deadly draught, but we enquire
whether we are justified in calling them by the
same name.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Though I hardly like to differ from Cicero,<note><hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> III. vi. 31.</note> who
follows many authorities in saying that definition is
concerned with identity and difference (since he
who denies the applicability of one term must always
produce another term which he regards as preferable), for my own part I consider that definition
falls into three types, which I may perhaps call
<hi rend="italics">species.</hi><milestone unit="section" n="9"/> For at times it is convenient merely to

<pb id="p.89"/>

enquire whether one particular term is applicable to
a given thing, as in the question whether an act
committed in a brothel is adultery. If we deny
that it is adultery, there is no need to state what it
should be called, since we have given a total denial
to the charge. Secondly, there are occasions when
the question is which of two terms is to be applied
to a thing, as in the question whether an act is
theft or sacrilege. It may be sufficient for the
defence that it is not sacrilege, but it is still necessary
to show what else it is, and therefore we must define
both.<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Thirdly, there are times when the question
concerns things which are different in species, and
we ask whether two different things are to be called
by the same name, in spite of the fact that each has
a special name of its own: for example, is tile same
name applicable both to a love-potion and a poison?<note><hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> VIII. V. 31.</note>
But in all disputes of this kind the question is
whether one thing is another thing as well, since
the name in doubt does without question apply to
something else. It is sacrilege to steal a sacred
object from a temple; is it also sacrilege to steal
private property from a temple? It is adultery to
lie with another man's wile in one's own house; is
it adultery to do so in a brothel? It is tyrannicide
to slay a tyrant; is it tyrannicide to force him to
slay himself?<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Consequently the syllogism, to which
I shall return later, is virtually a weaker form of
definition, since while definition seeks to determine
whether one thing has the same name as another,
syllogism seeks to determine whether one thing is
to be regarded as identical with another.<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> There is
moreover great variety in definitions. For instance,
persons will give different verbal expression to

<pb id="p.91"/>

things about which they are really in agreement:
thus rhetoric is defined as the science of <hi rend="italics">speaking
well,</hi> as the science of <hi rend="italics">correct conception</hi> or <hi rend="italics">correct
expression</hi> of what we have to say, as the science of
<hi rend="italics">speading in accordance with the excellence of an orator</hi>
and again of <hi rend="italics">speaking to the purpose.</hi> And we must
take care to discover how it is that definitions,
identical in meaning, differ in the form in which
they are expressed. However, this is a subject for
discussion and not for a quarrel.<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Definition is sometimes required to explain rare or obscure words such
as <hi rend="italics">clarigatio</hi><note>A formal demand for redress under threat of war.</note> or <hi rend="italics">erctum citum,</hi><note>An undivided inheritance.</note> or again to explain
familiar words such as <hi rend="italics">penus</hi><note>Store of provisions.</note> or <hi rend="italics">litus.</hi><note>Shore, see v. xiv. 34, where its derivation is explained
as qua fiuctus eludit.</note></p>
<p>This variety in definition has caused some writers
to include it under conjecture, others under quality
and others again under legal questions.<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Some, on
the other hand, entirely reject the elaborate and
formal methods of reasoning employed by dialectic,
regarding such ingenuity as suited rather to quibbles
over words in philosophical discussions than as likely
to carry much weight in the performance of the
duties of an orator. For though in dialogue definition may serve to fetter the person who has got
to reply in chains of his own making, or may force
him to silence, or even to reluctant confession of a
point which tells against himself, it is of less use in
forensic cases.<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> For there we have to persuade the
judge, who, even though he may be tied and bound
with our words, will still dissent in silence, unless he
is brought really into touch with the actual facts.
And what need has a pleader for such precision of
definition? Even if I do not say that man is an
animal, mortal and rational, surely I shall still be
able, by setting forth the numerous properties of his

<pb id="p.93"/>

body and mind in more general terms, to distinguish
him from gods or dumb beasts.<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Again, may not the
same thing be defined in more than one way, as
Cicero does when he says, <quote>What do we mean when
we say' commonly ': surely we mean 'by all men'?</quote><note><hi rend="italics">Pro Mur.</hi> xxxv. 73.</note>
May it not be given a wide and varied treatment
such as is frequently employed by all orators? For
it is rare to find orators falling victims to that form
of slavery introduced from the practice of the philosophers and tying themselves down to certain
definite words; indeed it is absolutely forbidden by
Marcus Antonius in the <hi rend="italics">de Oratore</hi><note>II xxv. 108 <hi rend="italics">sqq.</hi></note> of Cicero.
For it is a most dangerous practice, since,<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> if we make
a mistake in a single word, we are like to lose our
whole case, and consequently the compromise adopted
by Cicero in the <hi rend="italics">pro Caecina</hi><note>XV. 42.</note> is the safest course to
follow; this consists in setting forth the facts without
running any risks over the exactness of our terminology. These are his words: <quote>Judges, the violence
which threatens our lives and persons is not the
only kind of violence: there is a much more serious
form which by the threat of death fills our minds
with panic and often turns them from their natural
condition of stability.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="18"/> Or again, we may prove
before we define, as Cicero does in the <hi rend="italics">Philippics,</hi><note>IX. iii. 7.</note>
where he proves that Servius Sulpicius was killed by
Antony and introduces his definition at the conclusion in the following terms:&mdash;<quote>For assuredly the
murderer was he who was the cause of his death.</quote>
I would not, however, deny that such rules should be
employed, if it will help our case, and that, if we
can produce a definition which is at once strong and
concise, it will be not merely an ornament to our
speech, but will also produce the strongest

<pb id="p.95"/>

impression, provided always that it cannot be overthrown.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="19"/>The order to be followed in definition is invariable.
We first ask <hi rend="italics">what</hi> a thing is, and then, whether it is
<hi rend="italics">this.</hi><note><hi rend="italics">i. e.</hi> the thing under consideration.</note> And there is generally more difficulty in the
establishment than in the application of a definition.
In determining what a thing is, there are two things
which require to be done: we must establish our
own definition and destroy that of our opponent.
Consequently in the schools,<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> where we ourselves
imagine our opponent's reply, we have to introduce
two definitions, which should suit the respective
sides of the case as well as it is in our power to
make them. But in the courts we must give careful
consideration to the question whether our definition
may not be superfluous and irrelevant or ambiguous
or inconsistent or even of no less service to our
opponents than to ourselves, since it will be the
fault of the pleader if any of these errors occur. On
the other hand, we shall ensure the right definition,<milestone unit="section" n="21"/>
if we first make up our minds what it is precisely
that we desire to effect: for, this done, we shall be
able to suit our words to serve our purpose. To
make my meaning clearer, I will follow my usual
practice and quote a familiar example. <quote>A man
who has stolen private money from a temple is
accused of sacrilege.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="22"/> There is no doubt about his
guilt; the question is whether the name given by
the law applies to the charge. It is therefore
debated whether the act constitutes sacrilege. The
accuser employs this term on the ground that the
money was stolen from a temple: the accused denies
that the act is sacrilege, on the ground that the
money stolen was private property, but admits that

<pb id="p.97"/>

it is theft. The prosecutor will therefore give the
following definitions, <quote>It is sacrilege to steal anything from a sacred place.</quote> The accused will reply
with another definition, <quote>It is sacrilege to steal
something sacred.</quote> Each impugns the other's definition.<milestone unit="section" n="23"/> A definition may be overthrown on two
grounds: it may be false or it may be too narrow.
There is indeed a possible third ground, namely
irrelevance, but this is a fault which no one save a
fool will commit.<milestone unit="section" n="24"/> [It is a false definition if you say,
<quote>A horse is a rational animal,</quote> for though the horse
is an animal, it is irrational. Again, a thing which
is common to something else cannot be a property
of the thing defined.] In the case under discussion,
then, the accused alleges that the definition given
by the accuser is false, whereas the accuser cannot
do the same by his opponent's definition, since to
steal a sacred object is undoubtedly sacrilege. He
therefore alleges that the definition is too narrow
and requires the addition of the words <quote>or from a
sacred place.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="25"/> But the most effective method of
establishing and refuting definitions is derived from
the examination of properties and differences, and
sometimes even from considerations of etymology,
while all these considerations will, like others, find
further support in equity and occasionally in conjecture.<note>Conjecture is here used in the ordinary sense, not the
technical.</note> Etymology is rarely of assistance, but the
following will provide an example of its use. <quote>For
what else is a 'tumult' but a disturbance of such
violence as to give rise to abnormal alarm? And
the name itself is derived from this fact.</quote><note>Cic. <hi rend="italics">Phil.</hi> VIII. i. 3. <hi rend="italics">Tumultus</hi> is here used by Cicero in
its special sense, civil war or Gallic invasion. He derives it
from <hi rend="italics">timor multus.</hi></note><milestone unit="section" n="26"/> Great
ingenuity may be exercised with regard to properties
and differences, as for instance in the question
whether a person assigned to his creditor for debt,<note><hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> III. vi. 25.</note>

<pb id="p.99"/>

who is condemned by the law to remain in a state
of servitude until he has paid his debt, is actually a
slave. One party will advance the following definition, <quote>A slave is one who is legally in a state of
servitude.</quote> The other will produce the definition,
<quote>A slave is one who is in a state of servitude on
the same terms as a slave (or, to use the older
phrase, 'who serves as a slave').</quote> This definition,
though it differs considerably from the other, will be
quite useless unless it is supported by properties
and differences.<milestone unit="section" n="27"/> For the opponent will say that the
person in question is actually serving as a slave or is
legally in a state of servitude. We must therefore
look for properties and differences, to which in
passing I devoted a brief discussion in my fifth book.<note>V. x. 60.</note>
A slave when manumitted becomes a freedman: a
man who is assigned for debt becomes a free man on
the restoration of his liberty. A slave cannot acquire
his freedom without the consent of his master: a
man assigned for debt can acquire it by paying his
debt without the consent of his master being
necessary. A slave is outside the law; a man
assigned for debt is under the law. Turning to
properties, we may note the following which are
possessed by none save the free, the three names
(praenomen, nomen and cognomen) and membership
of a tribe, all of which are possessed by the man
assigned for debt.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="28"/>By settling what a thing is we have come near
to determining its identity, for our purpose is to
produce a definition that is applicable to our case.
Now the most important element in a definition is
provided by quality, as, for example, in the question
whether love be a form of madness. To this point

<pb id="p.101"/>

in our procedure belong those proofs which according
to Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">Top.</hi> xxiii. 88.</note> are peculiar to definition, that is, proofs
drawn from antecedents, consequents, adjuncts, contraries, causes, effects and similarities, with the
nature of which I have already dealt.<note>V. x. 73.</note><milestone unit="section" n="29"/> I will, however, quote a passage from the <hi rend="italics">pro Caecina</hi><note>XV. 44.</note> in which
Cicero includes brief proofs drawn from origins,
causes, effects, antecedents and consequents: <quote>Why
then did they fly? Because they were afraid. What
were they afraid of? Obviously of violence. Can you
then deny the beginning, when you have admitted
the end?</quote> But he also argued from similarity:<note>XV. 43.</note>
<quote>Shall not that which is called violence in war be
called violence in peace as well</quote> Arguments may
also be drawn from contraries, as for instance in the
question whether a love-potion can be a poison, in
view of the fact that a poison is not a love-potion.</p>
<p>In order that my young students (and I call them
mine, because the young student is always dear to
me) may form a clearer conception of this second
kind of definition, I will once more quote a fictitious
controversial theme.<milestone unit="section" n="31"/> <quote>Some young men who were
in the habit of making merry together decided to
dine on the sea-shore. One of their party failed
to put in an appearance, and they raised a tomb to
him and inscribed his name thereon. His father on
his return from overseas chanced to land at this
point of the shore, read the name and hung himself.
It is alleged that the youths were the cause of
his death.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="32"/> The definition produced by the accuser
will run as follows: <quote>The man whose act leads to
another's death is the cause of his death.</quote> The
definition given by the accused will be, <quote>He who
wittingly commits an act which must necessarily lead

<pb id="p.103"/>

to another's death, is the cause of his death.</quote> Without any formal definition it would be sufficient for
the accuser to argue as follows: <quote>You were the
cause of his death, for it was your act that led
to his death: but for your act he would still be
alive.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="33"/> To which the accused might answer, <quote>It
does not necessarily follow that the man whose act
leads to another's death should be condemned forthwith. Were this so, the accuser, witnesses and
judges in a capital case would all be liable to
condemnation. Nor is the cause of death always a
guilty cause. Take for instance the case of a man
who persuades another to go on a journey or
sends for his friend from overseas, with the result
that the latter perishes in a shipwreck, or again the
case of a man who invites another to dine, with
the result that the guest dies of indigestion.<milestone unit="section" n="34"/> Nor
is the act of the young men to be regarded as
the sole cause of death. The credulity of the old
man and his inability to bear the shock of grief
were contributory causes. Finally, had lie been wiser
or made of sterner stuff, he would still be alive.
Moreover the young men acted without the least
thought of doing harm, and the father might have
suspected from the position of the tomb and the
traces of haste in its construction that it was not
a genuine tomb. What ground then is there for
condemning them, for everything else that constitutes
homicide is lacking save only the contributory act?</quote></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="35"/>Sometimes we have a settled definition on which
both parties are agreed, as in the following example
from Cicero:<note><hi rend="italics">Part. Or.</hi> xxx. 105. <hi rend="italics">maiestatem iminuere</hi> = to commit
l&egrave;se-majest&eacute; or treason.</note> <quote>Majesty resides in the dignity of
the Roman power and the Roman people.</quote> The
question however, is, whether that majesty has been

<pb id="p.105"/>

impaired, as for example in the ease of Cornelius.<note>No fragments of the <hi rend="italics">pro Cornelio contain any trace of this.</hi></note>
But even although the case may seem to turn on
definition, the point for decision is one of quality,
since there is no doubt about the definition, and
must be assigned to the <hi rend="italics">qualitative basis.</hi><note>See III. vi. 31, <hi rend="italics">sqq.</hi></note> It is a
mere accident that I have come to mention quality
at this moment, but in point of fact quality is the
matter that comes next in order for discussion.</p>
<p>IV. In speaking of quality we sometimes use
the word in its most general sense, which covers
a number of different questions. For we enquire
sometimes into the nature and form of things: as
for instance whether the soul is immortal or whether
god is to be conceived of in human form. Sometimes, on the other hand, the question turns on size
and number, as, for instance, what is the size of
the sun or whether there are more worlds than
one. In all these cases we arrive at our conclusions
by conjecture, yet each involves a question of quality.
<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Such questions are sometimes treated in deliberative themes: for example, if Caesar is deliberating
whether to attack Britain, he must enquire into the
nature of the Ocean, consider whether Britain is an
island (a fact not then ascertained), and estimate its
size and the number of troops which lie will require
for the invasion. Under the same head of quality
fall questions whether certain things should be done
or not and certain objects sought or avoided: such
topics are specially adapted for deliberative themes,
but occur with some frequency in controversial
themes as well, the only difference being that in
the latter we deal with what is past and in the
former with the future.<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Similarly all the topics
of demonstrative<note>See III. iv. 12 <hi rend="italics">sqq.</hi></note> oratory involve a <hi rend="italics">qualitative basis.</hi>

<pb id="p.107"/>

The facts are admitted, and the question turns on
their quality, the dispute being entirely concerned
with rewards or penalties or their quantity. The
case is therefore of two kinds, simple or comparative, the former dealing with what is just, the latter
with what is juster, or most just. When the point
for decision is the penalty to be inflicted, the duty
of the pleader will be to defend, extenuate or excuse
the act on which the charge is based, or even,
according to some, to plead for mercy.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>By far the strongest line that can be taken in
defence is to assert that the act which forms the
subject of the charge is actually honourable. A
man is disinherited because he went on military
service, stood for office or married without his
father's consent. We defend this act. This form
of defence is called <foreign lang="greek">kat' a)nti/lhyin</foreign> by the followers of
Hermagoras, that is, defence by objection, the term
being used with reference to the purport of the
defendant's plea.<note><foreign lang="greek">a)nti/lhyis</foreign> is the technical term for this form of defence
which turns not on the facts, but on the justice of the case.
The meaning of <hi rend="italics">ad intellectum id nomen referentes</hi> is obscure.
If the words are correct (and no satisfactory correction seems
possible), their meaning must be that the defence turns not
on the act, but on its significance and equity. If any change
is made in the text, the simplest course is to delete the words
as a gloss which has crept into the text.</note> I can find no exact Latin translation of the term; we call it an absolute defence.
But in such cases the question is concerned with the
justice or injustice of the act alone.<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Justice is
either natural or conventional. Natural justice is
found in actions of inherent worth.<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Under this
head come the virtues of piety, loyalty, self-control
and the like. To these some add the rendering
of like for like. But this view must not be adopted
without consideration: for to retaliate, or meet
violence with violence on the one hand, does not
imply injustice on the part of the aggressor, while
on the other hand it does not follow that the first
act was just merely because the two acts were alike.
In cases where there is justice on both sides, the

<pb id="p.109"/>

two parties must both come under the same law
and the same conditions, and it would not perhaps
be untrue to say that things can never be spoken
of as like if there is any point in which they
are dissimilar. Convention, on the other hand, is
to be found in laws, customs, legal precedents and
agreements.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>There is another form of defence by which we
defend an act in itself indefensible by arguments
drawn from without.<note><hi rend="italics">i. e.</hi> from motives derived from facts lying outside the
actual case.</note> This the Greeks call <foreign lang="greek">kat'
a)nti/qesin</foreign> by opposition. Here again there is no
Latin equivalent, since we call it defence by assumption.<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The strongest line to take in this form
of defence is to defend the act forming the subject
of the charge by appealing to its motive. An
example of this is provided by the defence put
forward on behalf of Orestes, Horatius or Milo. The
term <foreign lang="greek">a)nte/gklhma,</foreign> or counter-accusation, is employed
when our defence consists entirely in accusing the
person whom our opponents are seeking to vindicate.
<quote>He was killed, but he was a robber; he was blinded,
but he was a ravisher.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="9"/> There is another form
of defence based on an appeal to the motives of
the act which is the opposite of that which I have
just described It consists not in defending the act
<hi rend="italics">per se,</hi> as we do when we employ the absolute
defence, nor in opposing another act to it, but
in appealing to the interests of the State, of a
number of persons, of our opponent himself or finally
at times of ourselves, provided always that the act
in question is such as we might lawfully do in our
own interests. If, however, the accuser is a stranger
and insists on the letter of the law, this form
of defence will invariably be useless, though it may

<pb id="p.111"/>

serve our turn if the dispute is of a domestic
character.<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> For example, in a suit concerned
with the question of disinheritance a father may,
without reflecting on himself, say to his sons that
his act was of importance to his own interests,
and the same plea may be urged by a husband
accused of cruelty by his wile or a son who
alleges that his father is insane. But in such cases
the position of the man who seeks to avoid
loss is stronger than that of him who aims at
positive advantage.<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Precisely similar methods are
also employed in questions that occur in real life.
For the scholastic themes concerned with the disowning of children are on exactly the same footing
as the cases of sons disinherited by their parents
which are tried in the public courts, or of those
claims for the recovery of property which are tried
in the centum viral court: themes dealing with cruelty
find an actual parallel in those cases in which the
wife claims the restoration of her dowry, and the
question is whose fault it was that led to the divorce:
and again the theme where the son accuses his father
of madness has its analogy in cases where a suit is
brought for the appointment of a guardian.<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Under
the same heading as the appeal to public or personal
interest comes the plea that the act in question
prevented the occurrence of something worse. For
in a comparison of evils the lesser evil must be
regarded as a positive good: for example, Mancinus
may defend the treaty made with the Numantines
on the ground that it saved the army from annihilation. This form of defence is called <foreign lang="greek">a)nti/stasis</foreign> by
the Greeks, while we style it defence by comparison.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="13"/>Such are the methods by which we may

<pb id="p.113"/>

defend an act. If it is impossible to defend an
act either on its merits or with the assistance of
arguments from without, the next best course will
be to shift the charge, if possible, to another.
It is for this reason that the <hi rend="italics">basis</hi> of <hi rend="italics">competence</hi> has
been held to apply even to those who cannot
plead the letter of the law in this connexion.<note><hi rend="italics">i e.</hi> there are no legal grounds for alleging that the court
is not competent to try the case, or the accuser to bring the
charge, etc. See III. vi. 53, 78.</note> In
some cases, then, the blame will be thrown on a
person: for example, Gracchus, when accused of
making the treaty with the Numantines (and it was
fear of this accusation that seems to have led him
to bring forward the democratic laws of his tribuneship) may plead that he made it as the representative of his commander-in-chief.<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> At times, on the
other hand, the blame may be shifted to some
thing: for instance, a person who has failed to
comply with some testamentary injunction may plead
that the laws forbade such compliance. The Greek
term for such shifting is <foreign lang="greek">meta/stasis.</foreign></p>
<p>If these methods of defence are out of the
question, we must take refuge in making excuses.
We may plead ignorance. For example, if a man
has branded a runaway slave and the latter is
subsequently adjudged to be a free man, he may
deny that he was cognisant of the truth. Or
we may plead necessity; for instance, if a soldier
overstays his leave, he may plead that his return
was delayed by floods or ill health.<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Again, the
blame is often cast upon fortune, while sometimes
we assert that, although we undoubtedly did wrong,
we did so with the best intentions. Instances
of these two latter forms of excuse are, however,
so numerous and obvious that there is no need for
me to cite them here.</p>

<pb id="p.115"/>

<p>If all the above-mentioned resources prove unavailable, we must see whether it may not be
possible to extenuate the offence. It is here that
what some call the <hi rend="italics">quantitative basis</hi><note><hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> III. vi. 23, 51, 53.</note> comes into
play.<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> But when quantity is considered in reference to punishment or reward, it is determined by
the quality of the act, and therefore in my opinion
comes under the <hi rend="italics">qualitative basis,</hi> as also does quantity
which is used with reference to number by the
Greeks, who distinguish between <foreign lang="greek">poso/ths</foreign> and
<foreign lang="greek">phliko/ths</foreign><note><foreign lang="greek">poso/ths</foreign> = quantity with reference to number; <foreign lang="greek">phliko/ths</foreign>
= quantity with reference to magnitude.</note>: we, however, have only one name for
the two.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="17"/>In the last resort we may plead for mercy, a though
most writers deny that this is ever admissible in the
courts.<note><hi rend="italics">Pro Lig.</hi> X. 30.</note> Indeed Cicero himself seems to support
this view in his defence of Quintus Ligarius where
he says, <quote>I have pleaded many causes, Caesar, some
of them even in association with yourself, so long as
your political ambitions prevented you from abandoning the bar, but never have I pleaded in words such
as these, ' Forgive him, gentlemen, he erred, he
made a slip, he did not think that it mattered, he
will never do it again,'</quote> and so on.<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> On the other
hand, in addressing the senate, the people, the emperor or any other authority who is in a position to
show clemency, such pleas for mercy have a legitimate
place. In such cases there are three points based
on the circumstances of the accused which are most
effective. The first is drawn from his previous life, if
he has been blameless in his conduct and deserved
well of the state, or if there is good hope that his
conduct will be blameless for the future and likely
to be of some use to his fellow men; the second is
operative if it appears that he has been sufficiently

<pb id="p.117"/>

punished already on the ground that he has suffered
other misfortunes, or that his present peril is extreme,
or that he has repented of his sin; while thirdly we
may base his appeal on his external circumstances,
his birth, his rank, his connexions, his friendships.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="19"/>It is, however, on the judge that we shall pin our
highest hopes, if the circumstances be such that
acquittal will result in giving him a reputation for
clemency rather than for regrettable weakness. But
even in the ordinary courts appeals for mercy are
frequently employed to a large extent, although they
will not colour the whole of our pleading. For the
following form of division is common:&mdash;<quote>Even if
he had committed the offence, he would have
deserved forgiveness,</quote> a plea which has often
turned the balance in doubtful cases, while practically
all perorations contain such appeals.<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> Sometimes
indeed the whole case may rest on such considerations. For example, if a father has made an express
declaration that he has disinherited his son because
lie was in love with a woman of the town, will not
the whole question turn on the point whether it was
the father's duty to pardon such an offence and
whether it is the duty of the centumviral court
to overlook it? Nay, even in penal prosecutions
governed by strict forms of law we raise two separate
questions: first whether the penalty has been incurred,
and secondly whether, if so, it ought to be inflicted.
Still the view of the authorities to whom I have
referred that an accused person cannot be saved
from the clutches of the law by this method of
defence is perfectly correct.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="21"/>With regard to rewards, there are two questions
which confront us: namely, whether the claimant is

<pb id="p.119"/>

deserving of any reward, and, if so, whether he deserves so great a reward. If there are two claimants,
we have to decide which is the more worthy of the
two; if there are a number, who is the most worthy.
The treatment of these questions turns on the kind
of merit possessed by the claimants. And we must
consider not merely the act (whether it has merely
to be stated or has to be compared with the acts of
others), but the person of the claimant as well. For
it makes a great difference whether a tyrannicide be
young or old, man or woman, a stranger or a connexion.<milestone unit="section" n="22"/> The place may also be discussed in a number
of ways: was the city in which the tyrant was killed
one inured to tyranny or one which had always been
free? was he killed in the citadel or in his own
house? The means, too, and the time call for consideration: was he killed by poison or the sword?
was he killed in time of peace or war, when he was
intending to lay aside his power or to venture on
some fresh crime?<milestone unit="section" n="23"/> Further, in considering the
question of merit, the danger and difficulty of the act
will carry great weight, while with regard to liberality
it will similarly be of importance to consider the
character of the person from whom it proceeds. For
liberality is more pleasing in a poor man than in a
rich, in one who confers than in one who returns a
benefit, in a father than in a childless man. Again,
we must consider the immediate object of the gift,
the occasion and the intention, that is to say, whether
it was given in the hope of subsequent profit; and
so on with a number of similar considerations. The
question of <hi rend="italics">quality</hi> therefore makes the highest
demands on the resources of oratory, since it affords
the utmost scope for a display of talent on either side,

<pb id="p.121"/>

while there is no topic in which the emotional appeal
is so <hi rend="italics">effective.</hi><milestone unit="section" n="24"/> For conjecture has often to introduce
proofs from without and uses arguments drawn from
the actual subject matter, whereas the real task of
eloquence is to demonstrate <hi rend="italics">quality:</hi> there lies its
kingdom, there its power, and there its unique
victory.</p>
<p>Verginius includes under <hi rend="italics">quality</hi> cases concerned
with disinheritance, lunacy, cruelty to a wife, and
claims of female orphans to marry relatives. The
questions thus involved are, it is true, frequently questions of <hi rend="italics">quality,</hi> while some writers style them questions of <hi rend="italics">moral obligation.</hi><milestone unit="section" n="25"/> But the laws governing
these cases sometimes admit of other <hi rend="italics">bases.</hi> For
example, <hi rend="italics">conjecture</hi> is involved in quite a number of
such cases, as when the accused urges either that he
did not commit the act or, if he did, acted with the
best intentions. I could quote many examples of
this kind. Again, it is definition which tells us what
precisely is meant by lunacy or cruelty to a wife.<note>The general sense of 25 and 26 is clear. These cases do
not always come under the <hi rend="italics">status qualitatis:</hi> they not infrequently come under the <hi rend="italics">status coniecturalis</hi> and <hi rend="italics">finitivus.</hi>
They cannot however, strictly be said to come under the <hi rend="italics">states
legalis,</hi> since although the <hi rend="italics">leges</hi> of such scholastic themes do
involve certain questions of law, these are not such as to constitute the <hi rend="italics">status legally.</hi> Still in the last resort such cases
may be argued on legal grounds. The text adopted for the
last sentence of 25 is that which involves the least change,
but it is highly obscure and the corruption may well lie
deeper still. For the whole question of <hi rend="italics">bases,</hi> which is
highly technical, see III, vi.</note>
For as a rule the laws cited in such themes involve
certain legal questions, though not to such an extent
as to determine the <hi rend="italics">basis</hi> of the case.<milestone unit="section" n="26"/> But this notwithstanding, if the actual fact cannot be defended,
we may in the last resort base our defence on legal
grounds, in which case we shall consider how many
and what cases there are in which a father may not
disinherit his son, what charges fail to justify an
action for cruelty, and under what circumstances a
son is not allowed to accuse his father of lunacy.</p>

<pb id="p.123"/>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="27"/>Disinheritance may be of two kinds. In the first
case it is for a completed crime: for example, the son
who is disinherited may be a ravisher or an adulterer:
in the second case it is for a crime which is still incomplete and terminable<note>Literally <hi rend="italics">conditional.</hi> The sense, however, is that the disinheritance is only conditional on the disobedience being
continued.</note>; an instance of this will
be the case where the son is disinherited because of
disobedience to his father. The first form of disinheritance always demands a certain harshness when
the father pleads his case, since the act is irrevocable,
whereas in the latter his pleading will be of a kindly
and almost persuasive nature, since he would prefer
not to disinherit him. On the other hand, the
pleading of the sons should in both cases be of a
subdued character and couched in a conciliatory
tone.<milestone unit="section" n="28"/> I know that those who delight in making
covert attacks upon the father under the disguise
of some figure of speech will disagree with me:
and I would not deny that their procedure may
sometimes be justifiable, since the theme may conceivably be such as to demand it; but it is certainly
to be avoided wherever possible. However, I shall
deal with the whole question of figures in a later
book.<note>Book IX. See especially IX. ii. 65 sqq.</note><milestone unit="section" n="29"/> The treatment of the theme of cruelty to a
wife is not unlike that of the theme of disinheritance; for both demand a certain moderation on the
part of the accuser. Cases concerned with lunacy
arise either out of what has been done or out of
something which may or may not be done in the
future.<milestone unit="section" n="30"/> In the former case the pleader is free to
attack as he will, but must none the less do so in
such a manner that, while denouncing the act, he
will yet express pity for the father on the ground
that he has erred by reason of his infirmity. On the
other hand, in the latter case, where the act has not

<pb id="p.125"/>

yet taken place and there is nothing to prevent the
father changing his purpose, he must begin by a
prolonged attempt to induce him to change his mind,
and then, and only then, complain that it is madness
and not depravity of character that prevents him
from listening to the voice of reason; and the more
he praises his past character, the easier will it be to
prove the change which it has undergone owing to
the inroads of the disease.<milestone unit="section" n="31"/> The accused, wherever
possible, must assume a temperate tone in his defence, for the reason that as a rule anger and excitement are near akin to madness. All these cases
have this much in common, that the accused does not
always defend his act, but often pleads excuse and
asks for pardon. For these are domestic quarrels, in
which the fact that the offence is an isolated case,
due to error and of a less serious character than
alleged, will sometimes suffice to secure an acquittal.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="32"/>There are, however, a number of other controversial themes involving <hi rend="italics">quality,</hi> as, for example,
cases of <hi rend="italics">assault.</hi> In these, although at times the
accused denies that he committed the assault, the
pleading as a rule is concerned with fact and intention.<milestone unit="section" n="33"/> Then there are cases concerned with the
<hi rend="italics">appointment of a prosecutor,</hi> which are known as
<hi rend="italics">divinations.</hi> In this connexion Cicero, who was indicting Verres on the instruction of our Sicilian allies,
adopts the following division-to the effect that the
main point for consideration is, by whom those the
redress of whose wrongs forms the subject of the
trial would prefer to be represented, and by whom
the accused would least desire them to be represented.<milestone unit="section" n="34"/> But in the great majority of cases the
questions raised are, which claimant has the strongest

<pb id="p.127"/>

motives for undertaking the role of accuser, which is
likely to bring the greatest energy or talent to the
task, and which is likely to press the charge with
the greatest sincerity.<milestone unit="section" n="35"/> Next we may take cases
concerned with <hi rend="italics">guardianship,</hi> in which it is usual
to enquire whether it is necessary to investigate
anything save the accounts, and whether anything
can be demanded of the guardian except the
honest execution of his trust; his sagacity and the
success of his administration being beside the mark.
Cases of <hi rend="italics">fraud on the part of an agent,</hi> which are
styled cases of <hi rend="italics">conduct of business</hi> when they occur in
the actual courts, are of a similar nature, since they
also are concerned with the administration of a
trust.<milestone unit="section" n="36"/> In addition to these we have the fictitious
cases of the schools which deal with <hi rend="italics">crimes not covered
by the law,</hi> where the question is as a rule either
whether the crime is really not covered by the law
or whether it is a crime, though on rare occasions
both questions are raised. Cases of <hi rend="italics">misconduct on
the part of an ambassador</hi> are of frequent occurrence
among the Greeks, even in actual life: in these the
legal question is raised whether it is lawful to deviate
at all from one's instructions and for how long the
accused was technically an ambassador, since in some
cases the ambassador's duty is to convey a communication to a foreign power and in others to bring one
back. Take for example the case of Heius, who gave
evidence against Verres after performing his duties
as ambassador. But in such cases the most important
question turns on the nature of the deed complained
<milestone unit="section" n="37"/>of Next come cases of <hi rend="italics">action contrary to the interests
of the state.</hi> In these we meet with legal quibbles
as to what is the meaning of <quote>action contrary to the

<pb id="p.129"/>

interests of the state,</quote> and whether the action of
the accused was injurious or profitable, or whether
the interests of the state suffered at his hands or
merely on his account: but the most important
question is that of fact. There are also cases of
<hi rend="italics">ingratitude;</hi> in these we raise the question whether
the accused has really received any kindness. It is
only rarely that the fact can be denied, as denial is
in itself a sign of ingratitude. But there are the
further questions as to the extent of the kindness
and whether it has been repaid.<milestone unit="section" n="38"/> If it has not been
repaid, does this necessarily involve ingratitude?
Was it in his power to repay? Did he really owe
the return which was demanded of him? What is
his intention? Somewhat simpler are cases of
<hi rend="italics">unjust divorce,</hi> a form of controversy which has this
peculiarity, that the accuser defends and the defendant accuses.<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> the divorced wife defends her character, while the
husband attacks her character.</note><milestone unit="section" n="39"/> Further there are cases where
a senator sets forth to the senate the <hi rend="italics">reasons which
determine him to commit suicide,</hi><note>Based on a law of Massilia, where the state provided
poison for the would-be suicide, provided he could justify
himself before the senate.</note> in which there is one
<hi rend="italics">legal</hi> question, namely, whether a man who desires to
kill himself in order to escape the clutches of the
law ought to be prevented from so doing, while the
remaining questions are all concerned with <hi rend="italics">quality.</hi>
There are also fictitious cases concerned with <hi rend="italics">wills,</hi>
in which the only question raised is one of <hi rend="italics">quality,</hi> as,
for instance, in the controversial theme quoted above,<note>VII. i. 38.</note>
where the philosopher, physician and orator all
claim the fourth share which their father had left
to the most worthy of his sons. The same is true
of cases where suitors of equal rank claim the
hand of an orphan and the question confronting her
relatives is which is the most suitable.<milestone unit="section" n="40"/> I do not,
however, intend to discuss every possible theme,

<pb id="p.131"/>

since fresh ones can always be invented, nor yet to
deal with all the questions to which they give rise,
since these vary with circumstances. But I cannot
help expressing my astonishment that Flavus,<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> Verginius mentioned in &sect; 24.</note> for
whose authority I have the highest respect, restricted
the range of <hi rend="italics">quality</hi> to such an extent in the text-book
which he composed for the special guidance of the
schools.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="41"/><hi rend="italics">Quantity</hi> also, as I have already stated,<note>&sect; 16.</note> falls as a
rule, though not always, under the head of <hi rend="italics">quality,</hi>
whether it is concerned with measure or number.
Measure, however, sometimes consists in the valuation
of a deed with a view to determining the amount
of guilt or the amount of benefit involved, while, on
the other hand, it sometimes turns on a point of
law, when the dispute is under what law a man
is to be punished or rewarded.<milestone unit="section" n="42"/> For example is a
ravisher to pay 10,000 sesterces<note><hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> IV. ii. 69.</note> because that is the
penalty appointed by law, or is he liable to capital
punishment as a murderer because his victim hanged
himself? In such cases those who plead as if there
were a question between two laws, are wrong: for
there is no dispute about the fine of 10,000,
since it is not claimed by the prosecution.<milestone unit="section" n="43"/> The
point on which judgment has to be delivered is
whether the accused is guilty of causing his victim's
death. The same type of case will also bring
<hi rend="italics">conjecture</hi> into play, when, for example, the question
in dispute is whether the accused shall be punished
with banishment for life or for five years. For the
question then is whether he caused his death
willingly or not.<milestone unit="section" n="44"/> Again, there are questions concerned with numerical quantity which turn on a
point of law, such as the questions whether thirty

<pb id="p.133"/>

rewards are due to Thrasybulus,<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> for his overthrow of the thirty tyrants; <hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> II. vi. 26.</note> or whether, when
two thieves have stolen a sum of money, they are
each to be required to refund fourfold or twofold.
But in these cases, too, valuation of the act is
necessary, and yet the point of law also turns on
<hi rend="italics">quality.</hi></p>
<p>V. He who neither denies nor defends his act nor
asserts that it was of a different nature from that
alleged, must take his stand on some point of law
that tells in his favour, a form of defence which
generally turns on the legality of the action brought
against him.<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> This question is not, however, as some
have held, always raised before the commencement
of the trial, like the elaborate deliberations of the
praetor when there is a doubt as to whether the
prosecutor has any legal standing, but frequently
comes up during the course of the actual trial. Such
discussions fall into two classes, according as the point
in dispute arises from an argument advanced by the
prosecution or from some <hi rend="italics">prescription</hi><note><hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> III. vi. 72.</note> (or demurrer)
put forward by the defence. There have indeed
been some writers who have held that there is a
special <hi rend="italics">prescriptive basis;</hi> but <hi rend="italics">prescription</hi> is covered
by precisely the same questions that cover all other
laws.<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When the dispute turns on <hi rend="italics">prescription,</hi> there
is no need to enquire into the facts of the case
itself. For example, a son puts forward a demurrer
against his father on the ground that his father has
forfeited his civil rights. The only point which has
to be decided is whether the demurrer can stand.
Still, wherever possible, we should attempt to create
a favourable impression in the judge as to the facts
of the case as well, since, if this be done, he will be
all the more disposed to give an indulgent hearing

<pb id="p.135"/>

to our point of law: for example, in actions taking
the form of a wager and arising out of interdicts,<note><hi rend="italics">sponsio</hi> (= wager) was a form of suit in which the litigant
promised to pay a sum of money if he lost his case. The
<hi rend="italics">interdict was</hi> an order issued by the praetor commanding or
prohibiting certain action. It occurred chiefly in disputes
about property.</note>
even though the question is concerned solely with
actual possession, the question as to tile right to
possession not being raised, it will be desirable to
prove not merely that the property was actually in
our possession, but that it was ours to possess.<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> On
tile other hand, the question more frequently turns
on intention. Take the law<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> an imaginary law of the schools of rhetoric.</note> <quote>Let a hero choose what
reward he will.</quote> I deny that he is entitled to receive
whatever he chooses. I cannot put forward any
formal demurrer, but none the less I use the intention as against the letter of the law just as I should
use a demurrer. In both cases the <hi rend="italics">basis</hi> is the same.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Moreover every law either gives or takes away
punishes or commands, forbids or permits, and
involves a dispute either on its own account or on
account of another law, while the question which it
involves will turn either on the letter or the intention.
The letter is either clear or obscure or ambiguous.<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>
And what I say with reference to laws will apply
equally to wills, agreements, contracts and every
form of document; nay, it will apply even to verbal
agreements. And since I have classified such cases
under four <hi rend="italics">questions</hi> or <hi rend="italics">bases,</hi> I will deal with each in
turn.</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Lawyers frequently raise the question of the
letter and the intention of the law, in fact a large
proportion of legal disputes turn on these points.
We need not therefore be surprised that such
questions occur in the schools as well, where they
are often invented with this special purpose. One
form of this kind of question is found in cases where
tile enquiry turns both on the letter and the spirit

<pb id="p.137"/>

of a law.<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Such questions arise when the law presents
some obscurity. Under these circumstances both
parties will seek to establish their own interpretation
of the passage and to overthrow that advanced by
their opponent. Take for example the following
case. <quote>A thief shall refund four times the amount
of his theft. Two thieves have jointly stolen 10,000
sesterces. 40,000 are claimed from each. They
claim that they are liable only to pay 20,000 each.</quote>
The accuser will urge that the sum which he claims
is fourfold the amount stolen; the accused will urge
that the sum which they offer to pay is fourfold.
The intention of the law will be pleaded by both
parties.<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> On the other hand, the dispute may turn
on a passage of the law which is clear in one sense
and doubtful in another. <quote>The son of a harlot shall
not address the people. A woman who had a son
became a prostitute. The youth is forbidden to
address the people.</quote> Here there is no doubt about
the son of one who was a prostitute before his birth,
but it is doubtful whether the law applies to the case
of one born before his mother became a prostitute.
<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Another question which is not infrequently raised is
as to the interpretation of the law forbidding an action
to be brought twice on the same dispute, the problem
being whether the word <hi rend="italics">twice</hi> refers to the prosecutor
or the prosecution. Such are the points arising out
of the obscurity of the law.</p>
<p>A second form of question turns on some passage
where the meaning is clear. Those who have given
exclusive attention to this class of question call it
the <hi rend="italics">basis concerned with the obvious expression of the
law and its intention.</hi> In such circumstances one
party will rest their case on the letter, the other

<pb id="p.139"/>

on the intention of the law.<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There are three
different methods in which we may combat the letter.
The first comes into play where it is clear that it is
impossible always to observe the letter of the law.
<quote>Children shall support their parents under penalty
of imprisonment.</quote> It is clear, in the first place, that
this cannot apply to an infant. At this point we
shall turn to other possible exceptions and distinguish
as follows. <quote>Does this apply to everyone who refuses
to support his parent? Has this particular individual
incurred the penalty by this particular act?</quote><milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The
second arises in scholastic themes where no argument can be drawn from the particular law, but the
question is concerned solely with the subject of the
dispute. <quote>A foreigner who goes up on to the wall
shall be liable to capital punishment. The enemy
had scaled the wall and were driven back by a
foreigner. His punishment is demanded.</quote><milestone unit="section" n=" 7"/> In this
case we shall not have two separate questions,
namely, whether every foreigner who goes up on
the wall is liable to the penalty, and whether this
particular foreigner is liable, since no more forcible
argument can be brought against the application of
the letter of the law than the fact in dispute, but the
only question to be raised will be whether a foreigner
may not go on to the wall even for the purpose of
saving the city. Therefore we shall rest our case on
equity and the intention of the law. It is, however,
sometimes possible to draw examples from other laws
to show that we cannot always stand by the letter,
as Cicero did in his defence of Caecina.<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The third
method becomes operative when we find something
in the actual words of the law which enables us to
prove that the intention of the legislator was different.

<pb id="p.141"/>

The following theme will provide an example. <quote>Anyone who is caught at night with steel in his hands
shall be thrown into prison. A man is found wearing a steel ring, and is imprisoned by the magistrate.</quote>
In this case the use of the word <hi rend="italics">caught</hi> is sufficient
proof that the word steel was only intended by the
law in the sense of a weapon of offence.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>But just as the advocate who rests his case on the
intention of the law must wherever possible impugn
the letter of the law, so he who defends the letter
of the law must also seek to gain support from the
intention. Again, in cases concerned with wills it
sometimes happens that the intention of the testator
is clear, though it has not been expressed in writing:
an example of this occurs in the trial of Curius, which
gave rise to the well-known argument between
Lucius Crassus and Scaevola.<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> A second heir had
been appointed in the event of a posthumous son
dying while a minor. No posthumous son was born.
The next of kin claimed the property. Who could
doubt that the intention of the testator was that
the same man should inherit in the event of the
son not being born who would have inherited in the
event of his death? But he had not written this in
his will.<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Again, the opposite case, that is to say,
when what is written is obviously contrary to tile
intention of the writer, occurred quite recently. A
man who had made a bequest of 5000 sesterces, on
altering his will erased the word <hi rend="italics">sesterces</hi> and inserted
<hi rend="italics">pounds of silver.</hi><note>About 384 sesterces go to the pound of silver.</note> But it was clear that he had meant
not 5000 but 5 pounds of silver, because the weight
of silver mentioned in the bequest was unparalleled
and incredible.<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The same <hi rend="italics">basis</hi> includes such general
questions as to whether we should stand by the

<pb id="p.143"/>

letter or the intention of the document, and what
was the purpose of the writer, while for the treatment of such questions we must have recourse to
<hi rend="italics">quality</hi> or <hi rend="italics">conjecture,</hi> with which I think I have dealt
in sufficient detail.</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The next subject which comes up for discussion is that of contrary laws.<note>See III. vi. 46.</note> For all writers
of text-books are agreed that in such cases there
are two <hi rend="italics">bases</hi> involving the letter and the intention
of the law respectively. This view is justified by
the fact that, when one law contradicts another, both
parties attack the letter and raise the question of
intention, while the point in dispute, as regards each
law, is whether we should be guided by it at all.<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But
it is clear to everybody that one law cannot contradict
another in principle (since if there were two different
principles, one law would cancel the other), and
that the laws in question are brought into collision
purely by the accidents of chance.</p>
<p>When two laws clash, they may be of a similar
nature, as for instance if we have to compare two
cases in which a tyrannicide and a brave man are
given the choice of their reward, both being granted
the privilege of choosing whatever they desire. In
such a case we compare the deserts of the claimants,
the occasions of the respective acts and the nature
of the rewards claimed.<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Or the same law may be
in conflict with itself, as in the case where we have
two brave men,<note>Both claiming the reward allotted by the law.</note> two tyrannicides<note>Both claiming the reward allotted by the law.</note> or two ravished
women,<note>Two women, both dishonoured by one man, put in
different claims, both of which are provided for as alternatives
in the same law. <hi rend="italics">A.</hi> demands the ravisher's death, <hi rend="italics">B.</hi>
demands his hand in marriage.</note> when the question must turn either on <hi rend="italics">time</hi>
(that is, whose claim has priority) or on <hi rend="italics">quality</hi> (that
is, whose claim is the more just). Again, we may
have a conflict between diverse, similar or dissimilar
laws.<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <hi rend="italics">Diverse</hi> laws are those against which arguments

<pb id="p.145"/>

may be brought without reference to any contradictory law. The following theme will provide an
example. <quote>A magistrate shall not quit the citadel.
One who has rendered heroic service to his country
may choose what reward he pleases. A magistrate
who left his post and saved his country, demands an
amnesty for his conduct.</quote> In this case, even though
there be no other law covering the case, we may
raise the question whether a hero ought to be
granted anything he chooses to claim. Again, many
conclusive arguments may be brought against the
letter of the law restricting the movements of the
magistrate: for example, a fire may have broken out
in the citadel, or a sally against the enemy may have
been necessary.<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Laws are styled <hi rend="italics">similar</hi> when nothing can be opposed to one except the other.
<quote>Tyrannicides shall have their statues set up in the
gymnasium. A statue of a woman shall not be set
up in the gymnasium. A woman killed a tyrant.</quote>
Here are two conflicting laws: for a woman's statue
cannot under any other circumstances be erected in
the gymnasium, while there is no other circumstance
which can bar the erection of the statue of a
tyrannicide in the gymnasium.<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Laws are styled
<hi rend="italics">dissimilar</hi> when many arguments can be urged against
one, while the only point which can be urged against
the other is the actual subject of dispute. An
example is provided by the case in which a brave
man demands the pardon of a deserter as his reward.
For there are many arguments, as I have shown
above, which can be urged against the law permitting
a hero to choose whatever reward he will, but
the letter of the law dealing with the crime of
desertion cannot be overthrown under any

<pb id="p.147"/>

circumstances save the choice of rewards to which I have
just referred.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Again, the point of law is either admitted by
both parties or disputed. If it be admitted, the
questions which are raised will as a rule be such
as the following. Which of the two laws is the
most stringent? Does it concern gods or men, the
state or private individuals, reward or punishment,
great things or small? Does it permit, forbid or
command?<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Another common question is which of
the two laws is the oldest; but the most important
question is which of the two laws will suffer less by
its contravention, as for example in the case of the
hero and the deserter just mentioned, in which case,
if the deserter is not put to death, the whole law is
ignored, whereas, if he be put to death, the hero
will still have another choice left open to him. It
is, however, of the utmost importance to consider
which course is best from the point of view of
morality and justice, a problem for the solution of
which no general rules can be laid down, as it will
depend on the special circumstances of the case.<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> If,
on the other hand, the point of law is disputed, either
one party or both in turn will argue the point. Take
the following case as an example. <quote>A father shall
be empowered to arrest his son, and a patron to
arrest his freedman. Freedmen shall be transferred
to their patron's heir. A certain man appointed the
son of a freedman as his heir. The son of the freedman and the freedman himself both claim the right
to arrest the other.</quote> Here the father claims his right
over the son, while the son, in virtue of his new position
as patron, denies that his father possessed the rights
of a father, because he was in the power of his patron.</p>

<pb id="p.149"/>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>Laws containing two provisions may conflict with
themselves in exactly the same way as two laws may
conflict. The following will serve as an illustration.
<quote>The bastard born before a legitimate son shall rank
as legitimate, the bastard born after the legitimate
son shall only rank as a citizen.</quote><note>See III. vi. 96.</note> All that I have
said about laws will also apply to decrees of the
senate. If decrees of the senate conflict with one
another or with the laws, the <hi rend="italics">basis</hi> will be the same
as if laws only were concerned.</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The <hi rend="italics">syllogistic basis</hi><note>See III. vi. 43 <hi rend="italics">sqq.</hi></note> has some resemblance
to the <hi rend="italics">basis</hi> concerned with the <hi rend="italics">letter and intention of
the law,</hi> since whenever it comes into play, one party
rests his case on the letter: there is, however, this
difference between the two <hi rend="italics">bases,</hi> that in the latter
we argue against the letter, in the present beyond
the letter, while in the latter the party defending
the letter aims at securing that in any case the letter
may be carried into effect, whereas in the present his
aim will be to prevent anything except the letter
being carried into effect. The <hi rend="italics">syllogism</hi> is sometimes
employed in conjunction with <hi rend="italics">definition:</hi> for often if
the definition be weak it takes refuge in the syllogism.
Assume a law to run as follows: <quote>A woman who is<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>
a poisoner shall be liable to capital punishment. A
wife gave her husband a love-potion to cure him of
his habit of beating her. She also divorced him.
On being asked by her relatives to return to him,
she refused. The husband hung himself. The
woman is accused of poisoning.</quote> The strongest
line for the accuser to take will be to assert that
the love-potion was a poison. This involves definition.
If it proves weak, we shall have recourse to the
syllogism, to which we shall proceed after virtually

<pb id="p.151"/>

dropping our previous argument, and which we shall
employ to decide the question whether she does not
deserve to be punished for administering the lovepotion no less than if she had caused her husband's
death by poison.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The <hi rend="italics">syllogistic basis,</hi> then, deduces from the letter
of the law that which is uncertain; and since this
conclusion is arrived at by reason, the <hi rend="italics">basis</hi> is called
<hi rend="italics">ratiocinative.</hi><note><hi rend="italics">See</hi> in. vi. 43, 61.</note> It may be subdivided into the following <hi rend="italics">species</hi> of question. If it is right to do a thing
once, is it right to do it often? Example: <quote>A
priestess found guilty of unchastity is thrown from
the Tarpeian rock and survives. It is demanded
that she shall be thrown down again.</quote> If the law
grants a privilege with reference to one thing, does
it grant it with reference to a number? Example:
<quote>A man kills two tyrants together and claims two
rewards.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="4"/> If a thing is legal before a certain
occurrence, is it legal after it? Example: <quote>The
ravisher took refuge in flight. His victim married.
The ravisher returned and the woman demands to
be allowed her choice.</quote><note><hi rend="italics">i. e.</hi> the death of the ravisher, see n. on VII. vii. 3.</note> Is that which is lawful
with regard to the whole, lawful with regard to a
part? Example: <quote>It is forbidden to accept a plough
as security. He accepted a ploughshare.</quote> Is that
which is lawful with regard to a part, lawful with
regard to the whole? Example: <quote>It is forbidden
to export wool from Tarentum: he exported sheep.</quote>
<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>In all these cases the syllogism rests on the letter of
the law as well: for the accuser urges that the
provisions of the law are precise. He will say,
<quote>I demand that the priestess who has broken
her vows be cast down: it is the law,</quote> or <quote>The
ravished woman demands the exercise of the

<pb id="p.153"/>

choice permitted her by law,</quote> or <quote>Wool grows on
sheep,</quote> and so on.<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But to this we may reply,
<quote>The law does not prescribe that the condemned
woman should be thrown down twice, that the
ravished woman should exercise her choice under
all circumstances, that the tyrannicide should receive
two rewards, while it makes no mention of ploughshares or of sheep.</quote> Thus we infer what is doubtful
from what is certain. It is a more difficult task to
deduce from the letter of the law that which is not
actually prescribed by the letter, and to argue because
that is the case, so also is this. Take the following
problems. <quote>The man who kills his father shall be
sewn up in a sack. He killed his mother,</quote> or <quote>It
is illegal to drag a man from his own house into the
court. He dragged him from his tent.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Under this
heading come questions such as the following: if
there is not a special law applicable to the case, ought
we to have recourse to an analogous law? is the
point in question similar to what is contained in the
letter of the law? Now it should be noted that what
is similar may be greater, equal or less. In the first
ease we enquire whether the provisions of the law
are sufficient, or, if they are insufficient, whether we
should have recourse to this other law. In both
cases it is a question of the intention of the legislator.
But the most effective form of treatment in such
cases will be to appeal to equity.</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>I turn to tile discussion of <hi rend="italics">ambiguity,</hi> which will
be found to have countless species: indeed, in the
opinion of certain philosophers, there is not a single
word which has not a diversity of meanings. There
are, however, very few <hi rend="italics">genera,</hi> since ambiguity must
occur either in a single word or in a group of words.</p>

<pb id="p.155"/>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Single words give rise to error, when the same
noun applies to a number of things or persons (the
Greeks call this <hi rend="italics">homonymy):</hi> for example, it is uncertain with regard to the word <hi rend="italics">gallus</hi> whether it
means a cock or a Gaul or a proper name or an
emasculated priest of tybele; while Ajax may refer
either to the son of Telamon or the son of Oileus.
Again, verbs likewise may have different meanings,
as, for example, cerno.<note>See <hi rend="italics">or</hi> decide <hi rend="italics">or</hi> separate.</note><milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This ambiguity crops up in
many ways, and gives rise to disputes, mole especially
in connexion with wills, when two men of the same
name claim their freedom or, it may be, an inheritance, or again, when the enquiry turns on the precise
nature of the bequest.<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> There is another form of
ambiguity where a word has one meaning when
entire and another when divided, as, for example,
<hi rend="italics">ingenua, armameniam</hi> or <hi rend="italics">Corvinum.</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Inyenua,</hi> a freeborn woman; <hi rend="italics">in genua,</hi> on to the knees.
<hi rend="italics">Armamentum,</hi> equipment; <hi rend="italics">arma mentum,</hi> arms, chin.
<hi rend="italics">Corvinum,</hi> ace. of name Corvinus; <hi rend="italics">cor vimium,</hi> heart, wine.</note> The disputes
arising from such ambiguities are no more than
childish quibbles, but nevertheless the Greeks are
in the habit of making them the subject for controversial themes, as, for example, in the notorious
case of the <foreign lang="greek">au)lhtri/s,</foreign> when the question is whether
it is a hall which has fallen down three times (<foreign lang="greek">au)/lh
tri/s</foreign>) or a flute-player who fell down that is to be sold.<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>
A third form of ambiguity is caused by the use of
compound words; for example, if a man orders his
body to be buried in a cultivated spot, and should
direct, as is often done, a considerable space of land
surrounding his tomb to be taken from the land left
to his heirs with a view to preserving his ashes from
outrage, an occasion for dispute may be afforded by
the question whether the words mean <quote>in a cultivated place</quote> (<hi rend="italics">in culto loco</hi>) or <quote>in an uncultivated
place</quote> (<hi rend="italics">inculto loco</hi>).<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Thus arises the Greek theme

<pb id="p.157"/>

about Leon and Pantaleon, who go to law because
the handwriting of a will makes it uncertain whether
the testator has left all his property to Leon or his
property to Pantaleon.<note><hi rend="italics">i. e.</hi> whether he wrote <foreign lang="greek">pa/nta *le/onti</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">*pantale/onti.</foreign></note></p>
<p>Groups of words give rise to more serious ambiguity. Such ambiguity may arise from doubt as
to a case, as in the following passage:<note>Enn. <hi rend="italics">Ann.</hi> 186. An ambiguous oracle quoted by Cicero
(<hi rend="italics">de Div.</hi> II. lvi.). It might equally mean that Rome or
Pyrrhus would conquer. Cp. the oracle given to Croesus:
<quote>If thou cross the Halys, thou shalt destroy a mighty
empire.</quote></note>&mdash;

<quote rend="blockquote">
<quote><l>I say that you, O prince of Aeacus' line,</l>
<l part="I">Rome can o'erthrow.</l></quote></quote>

Or it may arise from the arrangement of the words,<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>
which makes it doubtful what the exact reference of
some word or words may be, more especially when
there is a word in the middle of the sentence which
may be referred either to what precedes or what
follows, as in the line of Virgil<note><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> i. 477.</note> which describes
Troilus as

<quote rend="blockquote">
<l>lora tenens tamen,</l></quote>

where it may be disputed whether the poet means
that he is still holding the reins, or that, although
he holds the reins, he is still dragged along.<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The
controversial theme, <quote>A certain man in his will
ordered his heirs to erect <hi rend="italics">statuam auream hastam
tenentem,'</hi></quote> turns on a similar ambiguity; for it raises
the question whether it is the statue holding the
spear which is to be of gold, or whether the spear
should be of gold and the statue of some other
material. The same result is even more frequently
produced by a mistaken inflexion of the voice, as in
the line:

<quote rend="blockquote">
<l>quinquaginta uhi erant centum inde occidit Achilles.<note><quote>Achilles slew fifty out of a hundred,</quote> <hi rend="italics">or</hi> <quote>a hundred
out of fifty.</quote> Translated from a Greek line in Arist. <hi rend="italics">Soph.
El.</hi> i. 4. (<foreign lang="greek">penth/kont' a)ndrw=n e(kato\n li/pe di=os</foreign>). <hi rend="italics">Quinquaginta</hi> is the object of <hi rend="italics">occidit.</hi> Faulty reading might
make it go with <hi rend="italics">ubi erant,</hi> leaving <hi rend="italics">centum</hi> as the object of
<hi rend="italics">occidit,</hi> and making nonsense of the line.</note></l></quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>It is also often doubtful to which of two antecedents
a phrase is to be referred. Hence we get such

<pb id="p.159"/>

controversial themes as, <quote>My heir shall be bound to
give my wife a hundred pounds of silver according
to choice,</quote> where it is left uncertain which of the
two is to make the choice.</p>
<p>But in these examples of ambiguity, the first may
be remedied by a change of case, the second by
separating 1 the words or altering their position, the
third by some addition.<note>See &sect; 11.</note><milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Ambiguity resulting from
the use of two accusatives may be removed by the
substitution of the ablative: for example, <hi rend="italics">Lachetem
audivi percussisse Demeam</hi> (I heard that Demea struck
Laches, <hi rend="italics">or</hi> that L. struck D.) may be rendered clear
by writing <hi rend="italics">a Lachete percussum Demeam</hi> (that D. was
struck by L.). There is, however, a natural ambiguity in the ablative case itself, as I pointed out
in the first book.<note>I. vii. 3.</note> For example, <hi rend="italics">caelo decurrit aperto</hi><note>Apparently a misquotation of Virg. <hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> v. 212, <hi rend="italics">pelago
decurrit aperto.</hi></note>
leaves it doubtful whether the poet means he
hastened down <quote>through the open sky,</quote> or <quote>when
the sky was opened for him to pass.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Words may
be separated by a breathing space or pause. We
may, for instance, say <hi rend="italics">statuam,</hi> and then, after a
slight pause, add <hi rend="italics">auream hastam,</hi> or the pause may
come between <hi rend="italics">statuam auream</hi> and <hi rend="italics">haslam.</hi> The
addition referred to above would take the form <hi rend="italics">quod
elegerit ipse,</hi> where <hi rend="italics">ipse</hi> will show that the reference
to the heir, or <hi rend="italics">quod elegerit ipsa,</hi> making the reference
to the wife. In cases where ambiguity is caused
by the addition of a word, the difficulty may be
eliminated by the removal of a word, as in the
sentence <hi rend="italics">nos flentes illos deprehendimus.</hi><note>Does this mean <hi rend="italics">we found them weeping,</hi> or <hi rend="italics">we found them
weeping for us?</hi> The ambiguity is eliminated by the removal
of <hi rend="italics">nos.</hi></note><milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Where it
is doubtful to what a word or phrase refers, and the
word or phrase itself is ambiguous, we shall have to
alter several words, as, for example, in the sentence,
<quote>My heir shall be bound to give him all his own

<pb id="p.161"/>

property,</quote> where <quote>his own</quote> is ambiguous. Cicero
commits the same fault when he says of Gaius
Fannius,<note><hi rend="italics">Brut.</hi> xxvi. 101. The sentence continues, <quote>(an act of
which Laelius said by way of excuse that he had given the
augurship not to his younger son-in-law, but to his elder
daughter), Fannius, I say, despite his lack of affection for
Laelius, in obedience to his instructions attended the lectures
of Panaetius.</quote></note> <quote>He following the instructions of his
father-in-law, for whom, because he had not been
elected to the college of augurs, he had no great
affection, especially as he had given Quintus Scaevola,
the younger of his sons-in-law, the preference over
himself. .</quote> For <hi rend="italics">over himself</hi> may refer either to his
father-in-law or to Fannius.<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Again, another source
of ambiguity arises from leaving it doubtful in a
written document whether a syllable is long or short.
<hi rend="italics">Cato,</hi> for example, means one thing in the nominative when its second syllable is short, and another in
the dative or ablative when the same syllable is long.<note><hi rend="italics">sc.</hi> of the adjective catus, shrewd.</note>
There are also a number of other forms of ambiguity
which it is unnecessary for me to describe at length.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="14"/>Further, it is quite unimportant how ambiguity
arises or how it is remedied. For it is clear in all
cases that two interpretations are possible, and as
far as the written or spoken word is concerned,
it is equally important for both parties. It is
therefore a perfectly futile rule which directs us to
endeavour, in connexion with this <hi rend="italics">basis,</hi> to turn the
word in question to suit our own purpose, since, if
this is feasible, there is no ambiguity.<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> In cases of
ambiguity the only questions which confront us will
be, sometimes which of the two interpretations is
most natural, and always which interpretation is
most equitable, and what was the intention of the
person who wrote or uttered the words. I have,
however, given sufficient instructions in the course
of my remarks on <hi rend="italics">conjecture</hi> and <hi rend="italics">quality,</hi> as to the
method of treating such questions, whether by the
prosecution or the defence.</p>

<pb id="p.163"/>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>There is, however, a certain affinity between
all these <hi rend="italics">bases.</hi><note>III. vi. 54.</note> For in <hi rend="italics">definition</hi> we enquire into the
meaning of a term, and in the <hi rend="italics">syllogism,</hi> which is
closely connected with <hi rend="italics">definition,</hi><note>See ch. viii. 1.</note> we consider what
was the meaning of the writer, while it is obvious
that in the case of contrary laws there are two <hi rend="italics">bases,</hi>
one concerned with the <hi rend="italics">letter,</hi> and the other with
the <hi rend="italics">intention.</hi> Again, <hi rend="italics">definition</hi> is in itself a kind of
<hi rend="italics">ambiguity,</hi> since it brings out two meanings in the
same term.<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The <hi rend="italics">basis</hi> concerned with the <hi rend="italics">letter</hi> and
the <hi rend="italics">intention</hi> of the law involves a legal question as
regards the interpretation of the words, which is
identical with the question arising out of <hi rend="italics">contrary
laws.</hi> Consequently some writers have asserted that
all these <hi rend="italics">bases</hi> may be resolved into those concerned
with the <hi rend="italics">letter</hi> and <hi rend="italics">intention,</hi> while others hold that
in all cases where the <hi rend="italics">letter</hi> and the <hi rend="italics">intention</hi> of a
document have to be considered, it is <hi rend="italics">ambiguity</hi> that
gives rise to the question at issue. But all these
<hi rend="italics">bases</hi> are really distinct, for an obscure point of law
is not the same as an ambiguous point of law.
<hi rend="italics">Definition,</hi> then,<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> involves a general question as to
the actual nature of a term, a question which may
conceivably have no connexion whatsoever with the
content of the case in point. In investigations as
to the <hi rend="italics">letter</hi> and the <hi rend="italics">intention,</hi> the dispute turns on
the provisions contained in the law, whereas the
<hi rend="italics">syllogism</hi> deals with that which is not contained in
the law. In disputes arising out of <hi rend="italics">ambiguity</hi> we
are led from the ambiguous phrase to its conflicting
meanings, whereas in the case of <hi rend="italics">contrary laws</hi> the
fight starts from the conflict of their provisions.
<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The distinction between these <hi rend="italics">bases</hi> has therefore
been rightly accepted by the most learned of

<pb id="p.165"/>

rhetoricians, and is still adopted by the majority
and the wisest of the teachers of to-day.</p>
<p>It has not been possible in this connexion to give
instructions which will cover the arrangement to be
adopted in every case, though I have been able to
give some.<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There are other details concerning which
I can give no instructions without a statement of the
particular case on which the orator has to speak.
For not only must the whole case be analysed into
its component topics and questions, but these subdivisions themselves require to be arranged in the
order which is appropriate to them. For example,
in the <hi rend="italics">exordium</hi> each part has its own special place,
first, second and third, etc., while each question and
topic requires to be suitably arranged, and the same
is true even of isolated <hi rend="italics">general questions.</hi><note><hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> II. iv. 24; III. v. 8.</note><milestone unit="section" n="6"/> For it will
not, I imagine, be represented that sufficient skill
in division is possessed by the man who, after resolving a controversial theme into questions such as
the following, whether a hero is to be granted any
reward that he may claim, whether he is allowed to
claim private property, whether he may demand any
woman in marriage, whether he may claim to marry
a woman who already possesses a husband, or this
particular woman, <hi rend="italics">then,</hi> although it is his duty to
deal with the first question first, proceeds to deal
with them indiscriminately as each may happen to
occur to him, and ignores the fact that the first
point which should be discussed is whether we
should stand by the letter or the intention of the
law, and fails to follow the natural order,<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> which
demands that after beginning with this question he
should then proceed to introduce the subsidiary
questions, thereby making the structure of his speech

<pb id="p.167"/>

as regular as that of the human body, of which, for
example, the hand is a part, while the fingers are
parts of the hand, and the joints of the fingers.<note><hi rend="italics">fecerit</hi> and <hi rend="italics">struxerit</hi> are both negatived by the preceding
<hi rend="italics">non.</hi> It is impossible to reproduce the conciseness of the
original.</note> It
is precisely this method of arrangement which it is
impossible to demonstrate except with reference to
some definite and specific case.<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> But it is clearly
useless to take one or two cases, or even a hundred
or a thousand, since their number is infinite. It is
the duty of the teacher to demonstrate daily in one
kind of case after another what is the natural order
and connexion of the parts, so that little by little
his pupils may gain the experience which will enable
them to deal with other cases of the same character.
For it is quite impossible to teach everything that
can be accomplished by art.<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> For example, what
painter has ever been taught to reproduce everything
in nature? But once he has acquired the general
principles of imitation, he will be able to copy whatever is given him. What vase-maker is there who
has not succeeded in producing a vase of a type
which he had never previously seen?</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>There are, however, some things which depend
not on the teacher, but on the learner. For example,
a physician will teach what treatment should be
adopted for different diseases, what the dangers are
against which he must be on his guard, and what
the symptoms by which they may be recognised. But
he will not be able to communicate to his pupil the
gift of feeling the pulse, or appreciating the variations
of colour, breathing and temperature: this will
depend on the talent of the individual. Therefore,
in most instances, we must rely on ourselves,
and must study cases with the utmost care, never

<pb id="p.169"/>

forgetting that men discovered our art before ever
they proceeded to teach it.<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> For the most effective,
and what is justly styled most <hi rend="italics">economical</hi><note><hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> III. iii. 9.</note> arrangement of a case as a whole, is that which cannot be
determined except when we have the specific facts
before us. It consists in the power to determine
when the <hi rend="italics">exordium</hi> is necessary and when it should
be omitted; when we should make our statement of
facts continuous, and when we should subdivide it;
when we should begin at the very beginning, when,
like Homer, start at the middle or the end;<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> when
we should omit the statement of facts altogether;
when we should begin by dealing with the arguments
advanced by our opponents, and when with our own;
when we should place the strongest proofs first and
when the weakest; in what cases we should prefix
<hi rend="italics">questions</hi> to the <hi rend="italics">exordium,</hi> and what preparation is
necessary to pave the way for these questions; what
arguments the judge will accept at once, and to
what he requires to be led by degrees; whether we
should refute our opponent's arguments as a whole
or in detail; whether we should reserve emotional
appeals for the peroration or distribute them throughout the whole speech; whether we should speak first
of law or of equity; whether we should first advance
(or refute) charges as to past offences or the charges
connected with the actual trial;<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> or, again, if the
case is complicated, what order we should adopt,
what evidence or documents of any kind should
be read out in the course of our speech, and what
reserved for a later stage. This gift of arrangement
is to oratory what generalship is to war. The skilled
commander will know how to distribute his forces

<pb id="p.171"/>

for battle, what troops he should keep back to
garrison forts or guard cities, to secure supplies, or
guard communications, and what dispositions to make
by land and by sea.<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> But to possess this gift, our
orator will require all the resources of nature, learning
and industrious study. Therefore let no man hope
that he can acquire eloquence merely by the labour
of others. He must burn the midnight oil, persevere
to the end and grow pale with study: he must form
his own powers, his own experience, his own
methods: he must not require to hunt for his
weapons, but must have them ready for immediate
use, as though they were born with him and not
derived from the instruction of others.<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> The road
may be pointed out, but our speed must be our
own. Art has done enough in publishing the
resources of eloquence, it is for us to know how to
use them.<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> And it is not enough merely to arrange
the various parts: each several part has its own
internal economy, according to which one thought
will come first, another second, another third, while
we must struggle not merely to place these thoughts
in their proper order, but to link them together and
give them such cohesion that there will be no trace
of any suture: they must form a body, not a congeries
of limbs.<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> This end will be attained if we note what
best suits each position, and take care that the words
which we place together are such as will not clash,
but will mutually harmonise. Thus different facts
will not seem like perfect strangers thrust into
uncongenial company from distant places, but will
be united with what precedes and follows by an
intimate bond of union, with the result that our

<pb id="p.173"/>

speech will give the impression not merely of having
been put together, but of natural continuity. I fear,
however, that I have been lured on from one thing to
another and have advanced somewhat too far, since
I find myself gliding from the subject of arrangement to the discussion of the general rules of style,
which will form the opening theme of the next
book.</p></div1>



<pb id="p.177"/>

<div1 type="book" n="8"><head>Book VIII</head>


<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="pr"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/> THE observations contained in the preceding five
books approximately cover the method of invention
and the arrangement of the material thus provided.
It is absolutely necessary to acquire a thorough
knowledge of this method in all its details, if we
desire to become accomplished orators, but a simpler
and briefer course of instruction is more suitable for
beginners.<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For they tend either to be deterred from
study by the difficulties of so detailed and complicated
a course, or lose heart at having to attempt tasks of
such difficulty just at the very period when their
minds need special nourishment and a more attractive form of diet, or think that when they have
learned this much and no more, they are fully
equipped for the tasks of eloquence, or finally, regarding themselves as fettered by certain fixed laws
of oratory, shrink from making any effort on their
own initiative.<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Consequently, it has been held that
those who have exercised the greatest care in
writing text-books of rhetoric have been the furthest
removed from genuine eloquence. Still, it is absolutely necessary to point out to beginners the road
which they should follow, though this road must be
smooth and easy not merely to enter, but to indicate.
Consequently, our skilful instructor should select all

<pb id="p.179"/>

that is best in the various writers on the subject
and content himself for the moment with imparting
those precepts of which he approves, without wasting
time over the refutation of those which he does not
approve. For thus your pupils will follow where you
lead.<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Later, as they acquire strength in speaking,
their learning will grow in proportion. To begin
with, they may be allowed to think that there is no
other road than that on which we have set their
feet, and it may be left to time to teach them what
is actually the best. It is true that writers on
rhetoric have, by the pertinacity with which they
have defended their opinions, made the principles
of the science which they profess somewhat complicated; but these principles are in reality neither
obscure nor hard to understand.<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Consequently, if
we regard the treatment of the art as a whole, it is
harder to decide what we should teach than to teach
it, once the decision has been made. Above all, in
the two departments which I have mentioned, the
necessary rules are but few in number, and if the
pupil gives them ready acceptance, he will find that
the path to further accomplishment presents no
difficulty.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>I have, it is true, already expended much labour
on this portion of my task; for I desired to make
it clear that rhetoric is the science of speaking well,
that it is useful, and further, that it is an art and a
virtue. I wished also to show that its subject matter
consists of everything on which an orator may be
called to speak, and is, as a rule, to be found in three
classes of oratory, demonstrative, deliberative, and
forensic; that every speech is composed of matter
and words, and that as regards matter we must

<pb id="p.181"/>

study invention, as regards words, style, and as
regards both, arrangement, all of which it is the
task of memory to retain and delivery to render
attractive.<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> I attempted to show that the duty of
the orator is composed of instructing, moving and
delighting his hearers, statement of facts and argument falling under the head of instruction, while
emotional appeals are concerned with moving the
audience and, although they may be employed
throughout the case, are most effective at the beginning and end. As to the element of charm, I
pointed out that, though it may reside both in facts
and words, its special sphere is that of style.<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> I
observed that there are two kinds of questions, the
one indefinite, the other definite, and involving the
consideration of persons and circumstances of time
and place; further, that whatever our subject matter, there are three questions which we must ask, <hi rend="italics">is
it? what is it?</hi> and <hi rend="italics">of what kind is it?</hi> To this I
added that demonstrative oratory consists of praise
and denunciation, and that in this connexion we
must consider not merely the acts actually performed by the person of whom we were speaking,
but what happened after his death. This task I
showed to be concerned solely with what is honourable or expedient.<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> I remarked that in deliberative
oratory there is a third department as well which
depends on conjecture, for we have to consider
whether the subject of deliberation is possible or
likely to happen. At this point I emphasised the
importance of considering who it is that is speaking,
before whom he is speaking, and what he says. As
regards forensic cases, I demonstrated that some
turn on one point of dispute, others on several, and

<pb id="p.183"/>

that whereas in some cases it is the attack, in others
in is the defence that determines the <hi rend="italics">basis;</hi> that
every defence rests on denial, which is of two kinds,
since we may either deny that the act was committed or that its nature was that alleged, while it
further consists of justification and technical pleas
to show that the action cannot stand.<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> I proceeded
to show that questions must turn either on something written or something done: in the latter
case we have to consider the truth of the facts
together with their special character and quality;
in the former we consider the meaning or the
intention of the words, with reference to which we
usually examine the nature of all cases, criminal or
civil, which fall under the heads of the <hi rend="italics">letter</hi> and
<hi rend="italics">intention,</hi> the <hi rend="italics">syllogism, ambiguity</hi> or <hi rend="italics">contrary lairs.</hi><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>
I went on to point out that in all forensic cases the
speech consists of five parts, the <hi rend="italics">exordium</hi> designed
to conciliate the audience, the <hi rend="italics">statement of facts</hi>
designed to instruct him, the <hi rend="italics">proof</hi> which confirms
our own propositions, the <hi rend="italics">refutation</hi> which overthrows
the arguments of our opponents, and the <hi rend="italics">peroration</hi>
which either refreshes the memory of our hearers
or plays upon their emotions.<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> I then dealt with the
sources of arguments and emotion, and indicated
the means by which the judges should be excited,
placated, or amused. Finally I demonstrated the
method of division. But I would ask that the
student who is really desirous of learning should
believe that there are also a variety of subjects with
regard to which nature itself should provide much
of the requisite knowledge without any assistance
from formal teaching, so that the precepts of which
I have spoken may be regarded not so much as

<pb id="p.185"/>

having been discovered by the professors of rhetoric
as having been noted by them when they presented
themselves.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="13"/>The points which follow require greater care and
industry. For I have now to discuss the theory of
style, a subject which, as all orators agree, presents
the greatest difficulty. For Marcus Antonius, whom
I mentioned above, states that lie has seen many
good, but no really eloquent speakers, and holds
that, while to be a good speaker it is sufficient to
say what is necessary, only the really eloquent
speaker can do this in ornate and appropriate language.<note><hi rend="italics">de Or.</hi> <milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>xxi. 94.</note><milestone unit="section" n="14"/> And if this excellence was to be found in
no orator up to his own day, and not even in himself
or Lucius Crassus, we may regard it as certain that
the reason why they and their predecessors lacked
this gift was its extreme difficulty of acquisition.
Again, Cicero<note>Cic. <hi rend="italics">Or.</hi> xiv. 44;</note> holds that, while invention and
arrangement are within the reach of any man of
good sense, eloquence belongs to the orator alone,
and consequently it was on the rules for the cultivation of eloquence that he expended the greatest
care.<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> That he was justified in so doing is shown
clearly by the actual name of the art of which I am
speaking. For the verb <hi rend="italics">eloqui</hi> means the production
and communication to the audience of all that the
speaker has conceived in his mind, and without this
power all the preliminary accomplishments of oratory
are as useless as a sword that is kept permanently
concealed within its sheath.<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Therefore it is on this
that teachers of rhetoric concentrate their attention, since it cannot possibly be acquired without
the assistance of the rules of artit is this which
is the chief object of our study, the goal of all

<pb id="p.187"/>

our exercises and all our efforts at imitation, and it
is to this that we devote the energies of a lifetime;
it is this that makes one orator surpass his rivals,
this that makes one style of speaking preferable to
another.<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> The failure of the orators of the Asiatic
and other decadent schools did not lie in their
inability to grasp or arrange the facts on which
they had to speak, nor, on the other hand, were
those who professed what we call the dry style of
oratory either fools or incapable of understanding
the cases in which they were engaged. No, the
fault of the former was that they lacked taste and
restraint in speaking, while the latter lacked power,
whence it is clear that it is here that the real faults
and virtues of oratory are to be found.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="18"/>This does not, however, mean that we should
devote ourselves to the study of words alone. For
I am compelled to offer the most prompt and determined resistance to those who would at the very
portals of this enquiry lay hold of the admissions
I have just made and, disregarding the subject
matter which, after all, is the backbone of any
speech, devote themselves to the futile and crippling
study of words in a vain desire to acquire the gift of
elegance, a gift which I myself regard as the fairest
of all the glories of oratory, but only when it is
natural and unaffected.<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> Healthy bodies, enjoying
a good circulation and strengthened by exercise,
acquire grace from the same source that gives them
strength, for they have a healthy complexion, firm
flesh and shapely thews. But, on the other hand,
the man who attempts to enhance these physical
graces by the effeminate use of depilatories and cosmetics, succeeds merely in defacing them by the

<pb id="p.189"/>

very care which he bestows on them.<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> Again, a
tasteful and magnificent dress, as the Greek poet
tells us, lends added dignity to its wearer: but
effeminate and luxurious apparel fails to adorn the
body and merely reveals the foulness of the mind.
Similarly, a translucent and iridescent style merely
serves to emasculate the subject which it arrays with
such pomp of words. Therefore I would have the
orator, while careful in his choice of words, be even
more concerned about his subject matter.<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> For, as a
rule, the best words are essentially suggested by the
subject matter and are discovered by their own
intrinsic light. But to-day we hunt for these words
as though they were always hiding themselves and
striving to elude our grasp. And thus we fail to
realise that they are to be found in the subject of
our speech, and seek them elsewhere, and, when we
have found them, force them to suit their context.
<milestone unit="section" n="22"/>It is with a more virile spirit that we should pursue
eloquence, who, if only her whole body be sound,
will never think it her duty to polish her nails and
tire her hair.</p>
<p>The usual result of over-attention to the niceties
of style is the deterioration of our eloquence.<milestone unit="section" n="23"/> The
main reason for this is that those words are best
which are least far-fetched and give the impression
of simplicity and reality. For those words which are
obviously the result of careful search and even seem to
parade their self-conscious art, fail to attain the grace
at which they aim and lose all appearance of sincerity
because they darken the sense and choke the good
seed by their own luxuriant overgrowth.<milestone unit="section" n="24"/> For in
our passion for words we paraphrase what might be
said in plain language, repeat what we have already

<pb id="p.191"/>

said at sufficient length, pile up a number of words
where one would suffice, and regard allusion as
better than directness of speech. So, too, all
directness of speech is at a discount, and we think no
phrase eloquent that another could conceivably have
used.<milestone unit="section" n="25"/> We borrow figures and metaphors from the
most decadent poets, and regard it as a real sign
of genius that it should require a genius to understand our meaning. And yet Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">de Or.</hi> I. iii. 12.</note> long since
laid down this rule in the clearest of language, that
the worst fault in speaking is to adopt a style inconsistent with the idiom of ordinary speech and
contrary to the common feeling of mankind.<milestone unit="section" n="26"/> But
nowadays our rhetoricians regard Cicero as lacking
both polish and learning; we are far superior, for
we look upon everything that is dictated by nature
as beneath our notice, and seek not for the true
ornaments of speech, but for meretricious finery, as
though there were any real virtue in words save in
their power to represent facts. And if we have to
spend all our life in the laborious effort to discover
words which will at once be brilliant, appropriate
and lucid, and to arrange them with exact precision,
we lose all the fruit of our studies.<milestone unit="section" n="27"/> And yet we see
the majority of modern speakers wasting their time
over the discovery of single words and over the
elaborate weighing and measurement of such words
when once discovered. Even if the special aim of
such a practice were always to secure the best words,
such an ill-starred form of industry would be much
to be deprecated, since it checks tile natural current
of our speech and extinguishes the warmth of
imagination by the delay and loss of self-confidence
which it occasions.<milestone unit="section" n="28"/> For the orator who cannot

<pb id="p.193"/>

endure to lose a single word is like a man plunged
in griping poverty. On the other hand, if he will
only first form a true conception of the principles of
eloquence, accumulate a copious supply of words by
wide and suitable reading, apply the art of arrangement to the words thus acquired, and finally, by
continual exercise, develop strength to use his
acquisitions so that every word is ready at hand
and lies under his very eyes, he will never lose a
single word.<milestone unit="section" n="29"/> For the man who follows these instructions will find that facts and words appropriate
to their expression will present themselves spontaneously. But it must be remembered that a long
course of preliminary study is necessary and that
the requisite ability must not merely be acquired,
but carefully stored for use; for the anxiety devoted
to the search for words, to the exercise of the
critical faculty and the power of comparison is in its
place while we are learning, but not when we are
speaking. Otherwise, the orator who has not given
sufficient attention to preliminary study will be like
a man who, having no fortune, lives from hand to
mouth.<milestone unit="section" n="30"/> If, on the other hand, the powers of speech
have been carefully cultivated beforehand, words
will yield us ready service, not merely turning up
when we search for them, but dwelling in our
thoughts and following them as the shadow follows
the body.<milestone unit="section" n="31"/> There are, however, limits even to this
form of study; for when our words are good Latin,
full of meaning, elegant and aptly arranged, why
should we labour further? And yet there are some
who are never weary of morbid self-criticism, who
throw themselves into an agony of mind almost
over separate syllables, and even when they have

<pb id="p.195"/>

discovered the best words for their purpose look for
some word that is older, less familiar, and less
obvious, since they cannot bring themselves to
realise that when a speech is praised for its words,
it implies that its sense is inadequate.<milestone unit="section" n="32"/> While, then,
style calls for the utmost attention, we must always
bear in mind that nothing should be done for the
sake of words only, since words were invented
merely to give expression to things: and those
words are the most satisfactory which give the best
expression to the thoughts of our mind and produce
the effect which we desire upon the minds of the
judges.<milestone unit="section" n="33"/> Such words will assuredly be productive
of a style that will both give pleasure and awaken
admiration; and the admiration will be of a kind
far other than that which we bestow on portents,
while the pleasure evoked by the charm will have
nothing morbid about it, but will be praiseworthy
and dignified.</p>

<p>I. What the Greeks call <foreign lang="greek">fra/sin</foreign> we in Latin call
<hi rend="italics">elocuio</hi> or style. Style is revealed both in individual
words and in groups of words. As regards the
former, we must see that they are Latin, clear, elegant
and well-adapted to produce the desired effect. As
regards the latter, they must be correct, aptly placed
and adorned with suitable figures.<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> I have already,
in the portions of the first book dealing with the
subject of grammar, said all that is necessary on
the way to acquire idiomatic and correct speech.
But there my remarks were restricted to the prevention of positive faults, and it is well that I should
now point out that our words should have nothing
provincial or foreign about them. For you will find

<pb id="p.197"/>

that there are a number of writers by no means
deficient in style whose language is precious rather
than idiomatic. As an illustration of my meaning
I would remind you of the story of the old woman
at Athens, who, when Theophrastus, a man of no
mean eloquence, used one solitary word in an
affected way, immediately said that he was a
foreigner, and on being asked how she detected it,
replied that his language was too Attic for Athens.
Again Asinius Pollio held that Livy,<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> for all his
astounding eloquence, showed traces of the idiom
of Padua. Therefore, if possible, our voice and all
our words should be such as to reveal the native of
this city, so that our speech may seem to be of
genuine Roman origin, and not merely to have
been presented with Roman citizenship.</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Clearness results above all from <hi rend="italics">propriety</hi> in
the use of words. But <hi rend="italics">propriety</hi> is capable of more
than one interpretation. In its primary sense it
means calling things by their right names, and is
consequently sometimes to be avoided, for our
language must not be obscene, unseemly or mean.
<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Language may be described as mean when it is
beneath the dignity of the subject or the rank of
the speaker. Some orators fall into serious error
in their eagerness to avoid this fault, and are afraid
of all words that are in ordinary use, even although
they may be absolutely necessary for their purpose.
There was, for example, the man who in the course
of a speech spoke of <quote>Iberian grass,</quote> a meaningless
phrase intelligible only to himself. Cassius Severus,
however, by way of deriding his affectation, explained
that he meant Spanish broom.<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Nor do I see why
a certain distinguished orator thought <quote>fishes

<pb id="p.199"/>

conserved in brine</quote> a more elegant phrase than the
word which he avoided.<note>Probably salsamenta.</note> But while there is no
special merit in the form of <hi rend="italics">propriety</hi> which consists
in calling things by their real names, it is a fault
to fly to the opposite extreme. This fault we call
<hi rend="italics">impropriety,</hi><milestone unit="section" n="4"/> while the Greeks call it <foreign lang="greek">a)/kuron</foreign> As
examples I may cite the Virgilian,<note><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> IV. 419.</note> <quote>Never could
I have hoped for such great woe,</quote> or the phrase,
which I noted had been corrected by Cicero in a
speech of Dolabella's, <quote>To bring death,</quote> or again,
phrases of a kind that win praise from some of
our contemporaries, such as, <quote>His words fell from
the cross.</quote><note>Presumably in the sense, <quote>He spoke like one in bodily pain.</quote></note> On the other hand, everything that
lacks appropriateness will not necessarily suffer from
the fault of positive <hi rend="italics">impropriety,</hi> because there are, in
the first place, many things which have no proper
term either in Greek or Latin.<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For example, the
verb <hi rend="italics">iaculari</hi> is specially used in the sense of <quote>to
throw a javelin,</quote> whereas there is no special verb
appropriated to the throwing of a ball or a stake.
So, too, while <hi rend="italics">lapidare</hi> has the obvious meaning of
<quote>to stone,</quote> there is no special word to describe
the throwing of clods or potsherds.<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Hence abuse or
<hi rend="italics">catachresis</hi> of words becomes necessary, while metaphor, also, which is the supreme ornament of oratory,
applies words to things with which they have
strictly no connexion. Consequently <hi rend="italics">propriety</hi> turns
not on the actual term, but on the meaning of the
term, and must be tested by the touchstone of the
understanding, not of the ear.<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The second sense
in which the word <hi rend="italics">propriety</hi> is used occurs when
there are a number of things all called by the same
name: in this case the original term from which
the others are derived is styled the <hi rend="italics">proper</hi> term.

<pb id="p.201"/>

For example, the word <hi rend="italics">vertex</hi> means a whirl of
water, or of anything else that is whirled in a like
manner: then, owing to the fashion of coiling the
hair, it comes to mean the top of the head, while
finally, from this sense it derives the meaning of
the highest point of a mountain. All these things
may correctly be called <hi rend="italics">vertices,</hi> but the <hi rend="italics">proper</hi> use
of the term is the first. So, too, <hi rend="italics">solea</hi> and <hi rend="italics">tuidus</hi><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>
are employed as names of fish, to mention no other
cases.<note>Lit. i. e. in the <hi rend="italics">proper</hi> sense <hi rend="italics">the sole of the foot and
a thrush.</hi></note> The third kind of <hi rend="italics">propriety</hi> is found in
the case where a thing which serves a number
of purposes has a special name in some one particular context; for example, the proper term for
a funeral <hi rend="italics">song</hi> is <hi rend="italics">naenia,</hi> and for the general's <hi rend="italics">tent
augurale.</hi> Again, a term which is common to a
number of things may be applied in a <hi rend="italics">proper</hi> or
special sense to some one of them. Thus we use
<hi rend="italics">urbs</hi> in the special sense of Rome, <hi rend="italics">venales</hi> in the
special sense of newly-purchased slaves, and <hi rend="italics">Corinthia</hi> in the special sense of bronzes, although
there are other cities besides Rome, and many
other things which may be styled <hi rend="italics">venales</hi> besides
slaves, and gold and silver are found at Corinth
as well as bronze. But the use of such terms
implies no special excellence in an orator.<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> There
is, however, a form of <hi rend="italics">propriety</hi> of speech which
deserves the highest praise, that is to say, the
employment of words with the maximum of significance, as, for instance, when Cato<note><hi rend="italics">Suet. Caes.</hi> 53.</note> said that
<quote>Caesar was thoroughly sober when he undertook
the task of overthrowing the constitution,</quote> or as
Virgil<note><hi rend="italics">Ecl.</hi> vi. 5.</note> spoke of a <quote>thin-drawn strain,</quote> and Horace<note><hi rend="italics">Odes</hi> I. xii. 1, and III. vi. 36.</note>
of the <quote>shrill pipe,</quote> and <quote>dread Hannibal.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Some
also include under this head that form of <hi rend="italics">propriety</hi>

<pb id="p.203"/>

which is derived from characteristic epithets,
such as in the Virgilian<note><hi rend="italics">Georg.</hi> i. 295 and <hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> xi. 681.</note> phrases, <quote>sweet unfermented wine,</quote> or <quote>with white teeth.</quote> But of
this sort of propriety I shall have to speak elsewhere.<note><hi rend="italics">SC.</hi> ch. vi.</note><milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <hi rend="italics">Propriety is</hi> also made to include the appropriate use of words in metaphor, while at times the
salient characteristic of an individual comes to be
attached to him as a <hi rend="italics">proper</hi> name: thus Fabius was
called <quote>Cunctator,</quote> the Delayer, on account of the
most remarkable of his many military virtues. Some,
perhaps, may think that words which mean more
than they actually say deserve mention in connexion
with clearness, since they assist the understanding.
I, however, prefer to place <hi rend="italics">emphasis</hi><note>See IX. ii. 64.</note> among the
ornaments of oratory, since it does not make a thing
intelligible, but merely more intelligible.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>Obscurity, on the other hand, results from the
employment of obsolete words, as, for instance, if
an author should search the records of the priests,
the earliest treaties and the works of long-forgotten
writers with the deliberate design of collecting
words that no man living understands. For there
are persons who seek to gain a reputation for erudition by such means as this, in order that they
may be regarded as the sole depositories of certain
forms of knowledge.<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Obscurity may also be produced by the use of words which are more familiar
in certain districts than in others, or which are
of a technical character, such as the wind called
<quote>Atabalus,</quote><note>An Apulian term for the Scirocco. What is the peculiarity of a <hi rend="italics">sack-ship</hi> is unknown. It is possible that with
Haupt we should read <hi rend="italics">stlataria,</hi> "a broad-beamed merchant-vessel.</note> or a <quote>sack-ship,</quote> or <hi rend="italics">in malo cosanum.</hi>
Such expressions should be avoided if we are pleading before a judge who is ignorant of their meaning,
or, if used, should be explained, as may have to be
done in the case of what are called homonyms. For

<pb id="p.205"/>

example, the word <hi rend="italics">taurus</hi> may be unintelligible unless we make it clear whether we are speaking of
a bull, or a mountain, or a constellation, or the name
of a man, or the root of a tree.<note>Reference unknown.</note></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="14"/>A greater source of obscurity is, however, to be
found in the construction and combination of words,
and the ways in which this may occur are still more
numerous. Therefore, a sentence should never be
so long that it is impossible to follow its drift, nor
should its conclusion be unduly postponed by transposition or an excessive use of <hi rend="italics">hyperbaton.</hi><note>See viii. vi. 62.</note> Still
worse is the result when the order of the words is
confused as in the line<note><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> i. 109. The awkwardness of the order cannot be
brought out in English.</note>

<quote rend="blockquote">
<quote><l part="F">In the midmost sea</l>
<l>Rocks are there by Italians altars called.</l></quote></quote>

Again,<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> parenthesis, so often employed by orators
and historians, and consisting in the insertion of one
sentence in the midst of another, may seriously
hinder the understanding of a passage, unless the
insertion is short. For example, in the passage
where Vergil<note><hi rend="italics">Georg.</hi> iii. 79&ndash;83.</note> describes a colt, the words

<quote rend="blockquote">
<quote><l>Nor fears he empty noises,</l></quote></quote>

are followed by a number of remarks of a totally
different form, and it is only four lines later that
the poet returns to the point and says,

<quote rend="blockquote">
<quote><l>Then, if tile sound of arms be heard afar,</l>
<l>How to stand still he knows not.</l></quote></quote>

Above all, ambiguity must be avoided,<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> and by
ambiguity I mean not merely the kind of which
I have already spoken, where the sense is uncertain,
as in the clause <hi rend="italics">Chremetem audivi percussisse Demean,</hi><note>See VII. ix. 10.</note>

<pb id="p.207"/>

but also that form of ambiguity which, although
it does not actually result in obscuring the sense,
falls into the same verbal error as if a man should say
<hi rend="italics">visum a se hominem librum scribentem</hi> (that he had
seen a man writing a book). For although it is
clear that the book was being written by the man,<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> and not the man by the book!</note>
the sentence is badly put together, and its author
has made it as ambiguous as he could.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="17"/>Again, some writers introduce a whole host of
useless words; for, in their eagerness to avoid
ordinary methods of expression, and allured by
false ideals of beauty they wrap up everything in a
multitude of words simply and solely because they
are unwilling to make a direct and simple statement of the facts: and then they link up and
involve one of those long-winded clauses with others
like it, and extend their periods to a length beyond
the compass of mortal breath.<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> Some even expend
an infinity of toil to acquire this vice, which, by the
way, is nothing new: for I learn from the pages of
Livy<note>Perhaps in his letter to his son, for which see II. v. 20.</note> that there was one, a teacher, who instructed
his pupils to make all they said obscure, using the
Greek word <foreign lang="greek">sko/tison</foreign> (<quote>darken it.</quote>) It was this
same habit that gave rise to the famous words of
praise, <quote>So much the better: even I could not
understand you.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="19"/> Others are consumed with a
passion for brevity and omit words which are
actually necessary to the sense, regarding it as a
matter of complete indifference whether their meaning is intelligible to others, so long as they know
what they mean themselves. For my own part, I
regard as useless words which make such a demand
upon the ingenuity of the hearer. Others, again,
succeed in committing the same fault by a

<pb id="p.209"/>

perverse misuse of figures.<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> Worst of all are the
phrases which the Greeks call <foreign lang="greek">a)diano/hta,</foreign> that is to
say, expressions which, though their meaning is
obvious enough on the surface, have a secret meaning, as for example in the phrase <hi rend="italics">cum ductus est
caecus secundam viam stare,</hi> or where the man, who
is supposed in the scholastic theme to have torn his
own limbs with his teeth, is said to have <hi rend="italics">lain upon
himself</hi><note>Like a wild beast devouring his prey.</note><milestone unit="section" n="21"/> Such expressions are regarded as ingenious,
daring and eloquent, simply because of their ambiguity, and quite a number of persons have become
infected by the belief that a passage which requires
a commentator must for that very reason be a
masterpiece of elegance. Nay, there is even a class
of hearer who find a special pleasure in such passages; for the fact that they can provide an answer
to the riddle fills them with an ecstasy of self-congratulation, as if they had not merely heard the
phrase, but invented it.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="22"/>For my own part, I regard clearness as the first
essential of a good style: there must be propriety
in our words, their order must be straightforward,
the conclusion of the period must not be long postponed, there must be nothing lacking and nothing
superfluous. Thus our language will be approved
by the learned and clear to the uneducated. I am
speaking solely of clearness in style, as I have
already dealt with clearness in the presentation
of facts in the rules I laid down for the <hi rend="italics">statement
of the case.</hi><milestone unit="section" n="23"/> But the general method is the same
in both. For if what we say is not less nor more
than is required, and is clear and systematically
arranged, the whole matter will be plain and obvious
even to a not too attentive audience. For we must

<pb id="p.211"/>

never forget that the attention of the judge is not
always so keen that he will dispel obscurities without assistance, and bring the light of his intelligence
to bear on the dark places of our speech. On the
contrary, lie will have many other thoughts to distract him unless what we say is so clear that our
words will thrust themselves into his mind even
when he is not giving us his attention, just as the
sunlight forces itself upon the eyes.<milestone unit="section" n="24"/> Therefore
our aim must be not to put him in a position
to understand our argument, but to force him to
understand it. Consequently we shall frequently
repeat anything which we think the judge has
failed to take in as he should. We shall say, for
example, <quote>I fear that this portion of our case has
been somewhat obscurely stated: the fault is mine,
and I will therefore re-state it in plainer and simpler
language</quote>; for the pretended admission of a fault
on our part creates an excellent impression.</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>I now come to the subject of ornament, in
which, more than in any other department, the orator
undoubtedly allows himself the greatest indulgence.
For a speaker wins but trifling praise if he does no
more than speak with correctness and lucidity; in
fact his speech seems rather to be free from blemish
than to have any positive merit.<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Even the untrained often possess the gift of invention, and no
great learning need be assumed for the satisfactory
arrangement of our matter, while if any more
recondite art is required, it is generally concealed,
since unconcealed it would cease to be an art, while
all these qualities are employed solely to serve the
interests of the actual case. On the other hand, by
the employment of skilful ornament the orator

<pb id="p.213"/>

commends himself at the same time, and whereas his
other accomplishments appeal to the considered
judgment of the learned, this gift appeals to the
enthusiastic approval of the world at large, and the
speaker who possesses it fights not merely with
effective, but with flashing weapons.<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> If in his defence
of Cornelius Cicero had confined himself merely to
instructing the judge and speaking in clear and idiomatic Latin without a thought beyond the interests
of his case, would he ever have compelled the Roman
people to proclaim their admiration not merely by
acclamation, but by thunders of applause? No, it
was the sublimity and splendour, the brilliance and
the weight of his eloquence that evoked such clamorous enthusiasm.<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Nor, again, would his words have
been greeted with such extraordinary approbation if
his speech had been like the ordinary speeches of
every day. In my opinion the audience did not know
what they were doing, their applause sprang neither
from their judgment nor their will; they were seized
with a kind of frenzy and, unconscious of the place in
which they stood, burst forth spontaneously into a
perfect ecstasy of delight.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>But rhetorical ornament contributes not a little to
the furtherance of our case as well. For when our
audience find it a pleasure to listen, their attention
and their readiness to believe what they hear are
both alike increased, while they are generally filled
with delight, and sometimes even transported by
admiration. The flash of the sword in itself strikes
something of terror to the eye, and we should be
less alarmed by the thunderbolt if we feared its
violence alone, and not its flash as well.<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Cicero
was right when, in one of his letters to Brutus, he

<pb id="p.215"/>

wrote, <quote>Eloquence which evokes no admiration is,
in my opinion, unworthy of the name.</quote> Aristotle<note><hi rend="italics">Rhet.</hi> III. ii. 5.</note>
likewise thinks that the excitement of admiration
should be one of our first aims.</p>
<p>But such ornament must, as I have already said,<note>In the introduction to this book, 19.</note>
be bold, manly and chaste, free from all effeminate
smoothness and the false hues derived from artificial
dyes, and must glow with health and vigour.<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> So true
is this, that although, where ornament is concerned,
vice and virtue are never far apart, those who employ
a vicious style of embellishment disguise their vices
with the name of virtue. Therefore let none of our
decadents accuse me of being an enemy to those
who speak with grace and finish. I do not deny the
existence of such a virtue, I merely deny that they
possess it.<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Shall I regard a farm as a model of good
cultivation because its owner shows me lilies and
violets and anemones and fountains of living water
in place of rich crops and vines bowed beneath their
clusters? Shall I prefer the barren plane and myrtles
trimly clipped, to the fruitful olive and the elm that
weds the vine? No, let such luxuries delight the rich:
but where would their wealth be if they had nought
save these?<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Again, is beauty an object of no consideration in the planting of fruit trees? Certainly
not! For my trees must be planted in due order
and at fixed intervals. What fairer sight is there
than rows of trees planted in &eacute;chelon<note><hi rend="italics">Quincunx.</hi> The formation may be thus represented</note> which present
straight lines to the eye from whatever angle they be
viewed? But it has an additional advantage, since
this form of plantation enables every tree to derive
an equal share of moisture from the soil.<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> When the
tops of my olive trees rise too high, I lop them away,
with the result that their growth expands laterally

<pb id="p.217"/>

in a manner that is at once more pleasing to the eye
and enables them to bear more fruit owing to the
increase in the number of branches. A horse whose
flanks are compact is not only better to look upon,
but swifter in speed. The athlete whose muscles
have been formed by exercise is a joy to the eye, but
he is also better fitted for the contests in which he
must engage.<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> In fact true beauty and usefulness
always go hand in hand.</p>
<p>It does not, however, require any special ability to
discern the truth of this. It is more important to
note that such seemly ornament must be varied to
suit the nature of the material to which it is applied.
To begin with the primary classification of oratory,
the same form of ornament will not suit demonstrative, deliberative and forensic speeches. For the
oratory of display aims solely at delighting the
audience, and therefore develops all the resources of
eloquence and deploys all its ornament, since it seeks
not to steal its way into the mind nor to wrest the
victory from its opponent, but aims solely at honour
and glory.<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Consequently the orator, like the hawker
who displays his wares, will set forth before his
audience for their inspection, nay, almost for their
handling, all his most attractive reflexions, all the
brilliance that language and the charm that figures
can supply, together with all the magnificence of
metaphor and the elaborate art of composition that
is at his disposal. For his success concerns himself,
and not his cause.<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> But when it is a question of facts,
and he is confronted by the hard realities of battle,
his last thought will be for his personal glory. Nay,
it is even unseemly to trouble overmuch about words
when the greatest interests are at stake. I would

<pb id="p.219"/>

not assert that such themes afford no scope for
ornament, but such ornament as is employed must
be of a more severe, restrained and less obvious
character; above all, it must be adapted to the
matter in hand.<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> For whereas in deliberative oratory
the senate demand a certain loftiness and the people
a certain impetuosity of eloquence, the public cases
of the courts and those involving capital punishment
demand a more exact style. On the other hand, in
private deliberations and lawsuits about trifling sums
of money (and there are not a few of these) it is more
appropriate to employ simple and apparently unstudied language. For we should be ashamed to
demand the repayment of a loan in rolling periods, or
to display poignant emotion in a case concerned with
water-droppings, or to work ourselves into a perspiration over the return of a slave to the vendor.
But I am wandering from the point.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="15"/>Since rhetorical ornament, like clearness, may
reside either in individual words or groups of words,
we must consider the requirements of both cases.
For although tile canon, that clearness mainly
requires propriety of language and ornament the
skilful use of metaphor, is perfectly sound, it is
desirable that we should realise that without propriety ornament is impossible.<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> But as several words
may often have the same meaning (they are called
synonyms), some will be more distinguished, sublime, brilliant, attractive or euphonious than others.
For as those syllables are the most pleasing to the
ear which are composed of the more euphonious
letters, thus words composed of such syllables will
sound better than others, and the more vowel sounds
they contain the more attractive they will be to hear.

<pb id="p.221"/>

The same principle governs the linking of word with
word; some arrangements will sound better than
others.<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> But words require to be used in different
ways. For example, horrible things are best described by words that are actually harsh to the
ear. But as a general rule it may be laid down
that the best words, considered individually, are
those which are fullest or most agreeable in sound.
Again, elegant words are always to be preferred
to those which are coarse, and there is no room
for low words in the speech of a cultivated man.
<milestone unit="section" n="18"/>The choice of striking or sublime words will be
determined by the matter in hand; for a word that
in one context is magnificent may be turgid in
another, and words which are all too mean to
describe great things may be suitable enough when
applied to subjects of less importance. And just as
a mean word embedded in a brilliant passage
attracts special attention, like a spot on a bright
surface, so if our style be of a plain character,
sublime and brilliant words will seem incongruous
and tasteless excrescences on a flat surface.<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> In
some cases instinct, and not reason, must supply
the touchstone, as, for example, in the line:<note><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> viii. 641.</note>

<quote rend="blockquote">
<quote><l>A sow was slain to ratify their pacts.</l></quote></quote>

Here the poet, by inventing the word <hi rend="italics">porca,</hi> succeeded in producing an elegant impression, whereas
if lie had used the masculine <hi rend="italics">porcuis,</hi> the very reverse
would have been the case. In some cases, however,
the incongruity is obvious enough. It was only the
other day that we laughed with good reason at the
poet who wrote:

<quote rend="blockquote">
<quote><l>The youngling mice had gnawed</l>
<l>Within its chest the purple-bordered gown.</l><note>Camillus originally means a <quote>young boy.</quote></note></quote></quote></p>

<pb id="p.223"/>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="20"/>On the other hand, we admire Virgil<note><hi rend="italics">Georg. i.</hi> 181.</note> when he
says:

<quote rend="blockquote">
<l><quote>Oft hath the tiny mouse,</quote> etc.</l></quote></p>

<p>For here the epithet is appropriate and prevents
our expecting too much, while the use of the singular
instead of the plural, and the unusual monosyllabic
conclusion of the line, both add to the pleasing effect.
Horace<note><hi rend="italics">A. P.</hi> 139.</note> accordingly imitated Virgil in both these
points, when he wrote,

<quote rend="blockquote">
<quote><l>The fruit shall be a paltry mouse.</l></quote></quote></p>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="21"/>Again, our style need not always dwell on the
heights: at times it is desirable that it should sink.
For there are occasions when the very meanness of
the words employed adds force to what we say.
When Cicero, in his denunciation of Piso,<note><hi rend="italics">Fr.</hi> 100.</note> says,
<quote>When your whole family rolls up in a dray,</quote> do
you think that his use of the word <hi rend="italics">dray</hi> was accidental,
and was not designedly used to increase his audience's
contempt for the man he wished to bring to ruin?
The same is true when he says elsewhere, <quote>You put
down your head and butt him.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="22"/> This device may also
serve to carry off a jest, as in the passage of Cicero
where he talks of the <quote>little sprat of a boy who slept
with his elder sister,</quote><note><hi rend="italics">pro. Cael.</hi> xv. 36.</note> or where he speaks of <quote>Flavius,
who put out the eyes of crows,</quote><note><hi rend="italics">pro Mil.</hi> xi. 25. Our equivalent is <quote>catch a weasel
asleep.</quote></note> or, again, in the
<hi rend="italics">pro Milone,</hi><note><hi rend="italics">pro Mil.</hi> xxii. 60. <hi rend="italics">Rufio,</hi> a slave name = red head.</note> cries, <quote>Hi, there! Rufio!</quote> and talks of
<quote>Erucius Antoniaster.</quote><note>From the lost <hi rend="italics">pro Vareno.</hi> <quote>Erucius, Antonius' ape.</quote></note> On the other hand, this
practice becomes more obtrusive when employed in
the schools, like the phrase that was so much
praised in my boyhood, <quote>Give your father bread,</quote> or
in the same declamation, <quote>You feed even your dog.</quote><note>A declamation turning on the law that sons must support
their parents.</note>
But such tricks do not always come off,<milestone unit="section" n="23"/> especially in

<pb id="p.225"/>

the schools, and often turn the laugh against the
speaker, particularly in the present day, when declamation has become so far removed from reality
and labours under such an extravagant fastidiousness
in the choice of words that it has excluded a good
half of the language from its vocabulary.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="24"/>Words are <hi rend="italics">proper, newly-coined or metaphorical.</hi> In
the case of <hi rend="italics">proper</hi> words there is a special dignity
conferred by antiquity, since old words, which not
everyone would think of using, give our style a
venerable and majestic air: this is a form of ornament
of which Virgil, with his perfect taste, has made
unique use.<milestone unit="section" n="25"/> For his employment of words such as
<hi rend="italics">olli,</hi><note>Archaic for <hi rend="italics">illi.</hi></note> <hi rend="italics">quianam,</hi><note>Because.</note> <hi rend="italics">moerus,</hi><note>Archaic for <hi rend="italics">murus (Aen.</hi> x. 24.).</note> <hi rend="italics">pone</hi><note>Behind.</note> and <hi rend="italics">pellacia</hi><note>Deceitfulness (<hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> ii. 90).</note> gives his
work that impressive air of antiquity which is so
attractive in pictures, but which no art of man can
counterfeit. But we must not overdo it, and such
words must not be dragged out from the deepest
darkness of the past. <hi rend="italics">Quaeso</hi> is old enough: what
need for us to say <hi rend="italics">quaiso?</hi><note><hi rend="italics">quaeso</hi> = pray, <hi rend="italics">oppido</hi> quite, exactly.</note> <hi rend="italics">Oppido</hi> was still used by
my older contemporaries, but I fear that no one
would tolerate it now. At any rate, <hi rend="italics">antegerio,</hi><note>Quite, very.</note> which
means the same, would certainly never be used by
anyone who was not possessed with a passion for
notoriety.<milestone unit="section" n="26"/> What need have we of <hi rend="italics">acrumnosum?</hi><note>Wretched.</note> It
is surely enough to call a thing <hi rend="italics">horridum. Reor may</hi>
be tolerated, <hi rend="italics">autumo</hi><note>Assert.</note> smacks of tragedy, <hi rend="italics">proles</hi><note>Offspring.</note> has
become a rarity, while <hi rend="italics">prosapia</hi><note>Stock, family.</note> stamps the man
who uses it as lacking taste. Need I say more
Almost the whole language has changed.<milestone unit="section" n="27"/> But there
are still some old words that are endeared to us by

<pb id="p.227"/>

their antique sheen, while there are others that we
cannot avoid using occasionally, such, for example, as
<hi rend="italics">nuncupare</hi> and <hi rend="italics">fari:</hi><note>Name, speak.</note> there are yet others which it
requires some daring to use, but which may still be
employed so long as we avoid all appearance of that
affectation which Virgil<note><hi rend="italics">Catal.</hi> ii.</note> has derided so cleverly:

<quote rend="blockquote">
<quote><l>Britain's Thucydides, <milestone unit="section" n="28"/> whose mad Attic brain</l>
<l>Loved word-amalgams like Corinthian bronze,</l>
<l>First made a horrid blend of words from Gaul,</l>
<l>Tau, al, min, sil and God knows how much else,</l>
<l>Then mixed them in a potion for his brother!</l></quote></quote>

This was a certain Cimber who killed his brother,<milestone unit="section" n="29"/>
a fact which Cicero recorded in the words, <quote>Cimber
has killed his brother German.</quote><note><hi rend="italics">Phil.</hi> XI. vi. 14. A pun on the two meanings of <hi rend="italics">gemanus,</hi>
brother and German.</note></p>
<p>The epigram against Sallust is scarcely less well
known:

<quote rend="blockquote">
<quote><l>Crispus, you, too, Jugurtha's fall who told,</l>
<l>And filched such store of words from Cato old.</l></quote></quote></p>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="30"/>It is a tiresome kind of affectation; any one can
practise it, and it is made all the worse by the fact
that the man who catches the infection will not
choose his words to suit his facts, but will drag in
irrelevant facts to provide an opportunity for the use
of such words.</p>
<p>The coining of new words is, as I stated in the
first book,<note>I. v. 70</note> more permissible in Greek, for the
Greeks did not hesitate to coin nouns to represent
certain sounds and emotions, and in truth they were
taking no greater liberty than was taken by the
first men when they gave names to things.<milestone unit="section" n="31"/> Our
own writers have ventured on a few attempts at
composition and derivation, but have not met with

<pb id="p.229"/>

much success. I remember in my young days there
was a dispute between Pomponius and Seneca which
even found its way into the prefaces of their works,
as to whether <hi rend="italics">gradus eliminate</hi><note>Sc. <quote>moves his steps beyond the threshold.</quote></note> was a phrase which
ought to have been allowed in tragedy. But the
ancients had no hesitation about using even <hi rend="italics">expectorate</hi><note><quote>banishes from his heart.</quote></note>
and, after all, it presents exactly the same formation
as <hi rend="italics">exanimat.</hi><milestone unit="section" n="32"/> Of the coining of words by expansion
and inflexion we have examples, such as the Ciceronian<note><hi rend="italics">De Nat. D.</hi> I. xxxiv. 95.</note> <hi rend="italics">beatitas</hi> and <hi rend="italics">beatitudo,</hi> forms which he feels to
be somewhat harsh, though he thinks they may be
softened by use. Derivatives may even be fashioned
from proper names, quite apart from ordinary words,
witness <hi rend="italics">Sullaturit</hi><note><hi rend="italics">a Att.</hi> IX. x. 6. <quote>Desires to be a second Sulla.</quote></note> in Cicero and <hi rend="italics">Fimbriatus</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Figulatus</hi><note>Metamorphosed into Figulus. Presumably refers to
Clusinius Figulus, see VII. ii. 26.</note> in Asinius.<milestone unit="section" n="33"/> Many new words have been
coined in imitation of the Greeks,<note>See II. xiv. 2.</note> more especially
by Verginius Flavus, some of which, such as <hi rend="italics">queens</hi> and
<hi rend="italics">essentia,</hi> are regarded as unduly harsh. But I see no
reason why we should treat them with such contempt,
except, perhaps, that we are highly self-critical and
suffer in consequence from the poverty of our
language. Some new formations do, however, succeed
in establishing themselves.<milestone unit="section" n="34"/> For words which now
are old, once were new, and there are some words in
use which are of quite recent origin, such as <hi rend="italics">reatus,</hi><note>The condition of an accused person.</note>
invented by Messala, and <hi rend="italics">munerarius,</hi><note>The giver of a gladiatorial show.</note> invented by
Augustus. So, too, my own teachers still persisted
in banning the use of words, such as <hi rend="italics">piratica, musica</hi>
and <hi rend="italics">fabrica,</hi> while Cicero regards <hi rend="italics">favor</hi> and <hi rend="italics">urbanus</hi>
as but newly introduced into the language. For in
a letter to Brutus he says, <hi rend="italics">eum amorer et eum, ut hoc</hi>

<pb id="p.231"/>

<hi rend="italics">verbo utar, favored in consilium advocabo,</hi><note>This letter is lost: <quote>I will call that love and that favour,
if I may use the word, to be my counsellors.</quote></note><milestone unit="section" n="35"/> while to
Appius Pulcher he writes, <hi rend="italics">le hominem non solum sapientem, verum etiam, ut nunc loquimur, urbanum.</hi><note><hi rend="italics">ad Fam.</hi> III. viii. 3. <quote>You who are not merely wise,
but, as we say nowadays, urbane.</quote></note> He
also thinks that Terence was the first to use the
word <hi rend="italics">obsequium,</hi> while Caecilius asserts that Sisenna
was the first to use the phrase <hi rend="italics">albente caelo.</hi><note><quote>When the sky grew white (at dawn).</quote></note> Hortensius seems to have been the first to use <hi rend="italics">cervix</hi> in
the singular, since the ancients confined themselves
to the plural. We must not then be cowards, for I
cannot agree with Celsus when he forbids orators to
coin new words.<milestone unit="section" n="36"/> For some words, as Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">Part Or.</hi> v. 16.</note> says,
are native, that is to say, are used in their original
meaning, while others are derivative, that is to say,
formed from the native. Granted then that we
are not justified in coining entirely new words
having no resemblance to the words invented by
primitive man, I must still ask at what date we were
first forbidden to form derivatives and to modify
and compound words, processes which were undoubtedly permitted to later generations of mankind.
If, however,<milestone unit="section" n="37"/> one of our inventions seems a little
risky, we must take certain measures in advance to
save it from censure, prefacing it by phrases such as
<quote>so to speak,</quote> <quote>if I may say so,</quote> <quote>in a certain
sense,</quote> or <quote>if you will allow me to make use of such
a word.</quote> The same practice may be followed in the
case of bold metaphors, and it is not too much to
say that almost anything can be said with safety
provided we show by the very fact of our anxiety
that the word or phrase in question is not due to an
error of judgment. The Greeks have a neat saying
on this subject, advising us to be the first to blame
our own hyperbole.<note><hi rend="italics">Ar. Rhet.</hi> III. vii. 9.</note></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="38"/>The metaphorical use of words cannot be

<pb id="p.233"/>

recommended except in connected discourse. Enough has
now been said on the subject of single words, which,
as I have pointed out elsewhere,<note>I. v. 3.</note> have no intrinsic
value of their own. On the other hand, there is no
word which is intrinsically ugly unless it be beneath
the dignity of the subject on which we have to
speak, excepting always such words as are nakedly
obscene.<milestone unit="section" n="39"/> I would commend this remark to those
who do not think it necessary to avoid obscenity on
the ground that no word is indecent in itself and
that, if a thing <hi rend="italics">is</hi> revolting, its unpleasantness will
be realised clearly enough by whatever name it is
called. Accordingly, I shall content myself with
following the good old rules of Roman modesty and,
as I have already replied to such persons, shall
vindicate the cause of decency by saying no more on
this unpleasant subject.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="40"/>Let us now pass to consider connected discourse.
Its adornment may be effected, primarily, in two
ways; that is to say, we must consider first our ideal
of style, and secondly how we shall express this ideal
in actual words. The first essential is to realise
clearly what we wish to enhance or attenuate, to
express with vigour or calm, in luxuriant or austere
language, at length or with conciseness, with gentleness or asperity, magnificence or subtlety, gravity or
wit.<milestone unit="section" n="41"/> The next essential is to decide by what kind of
metaphor, figures, reflexions, methods and arrangement we may best produce the effect which we
desire.</p>
<p>But, before I discuss ornament, I must first touch
upon its opposite, since the first of all virtues is the
avoidance of faults.<milestone unit="section" n="42"/> Therefore we must not expect
any speech to be ornate that is not, in the first place,

<pb id="p.235"/>

acceptable. An acceptable style is defined by
Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">Part. Or.,</hi> vi. 19.</note> as one which is not over-elegant: not that
our style does not require elegance and polish,
which are essential parts of ornament, but that excess
is always a vice.<milestone unit="section" n="43"/> He desires, therefore, that our
words should have a certain weight about them, and
that our thoughts should be of a serious cast or, at
any rate, adapted to the opinions and character of
mankind. These points once secured, we may
proceed to employ those expressions which he
regards as conferring distinction on style, that is to
say, specially selected words and phrases, metaphor,
hyperbole, appropriate epithets, repetitions, synonyms and all such language as may suit our case and
provide an adequate representation of the facts.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="44"/>But since my first task is to point out the faults to
be avoided, I will begin by calling attention to the
fault known as <foreign lang="greek">kake/mfaton,</foreign> a term applied to the
employment of language to which perverted usage
has given an obscene meaning: take, for example,
phrases such as <hi rend="italics">ductare exercitus and patrare bellum,</hi><note><hi rend="italics">ductare</hi> might mean <hi rend="italics">ad libidinem abducere. patrare bellum</hi>
might mean <hi rend="italics">paedicare formosum.</hi></note>
which were employed by Sallust in their old and
irreproachable sense, but, I regret to say, cause
amusement in certain quarters to-day. This, however, is not, in my opinion, the fault of the writer, but
of his readers;<milestone unit="section" n="45"/> still it is one to be avoided, for we
have perverted the purity of language by our own
corruption, and there is no course left to us but to
give ground before the victorious advance of vice.
The same term is also applied in the cases where an
unfortunate collocation of words produces an obscene
suggestion. For example, in the phrase <hi rend="italics">cum hominibus notis loqui,</hi> unless <hi rend="italics">hominibus</hi> is placed between <hi rend="italics">cum</hi>
and <hi rend="italics">notis,</hi> we shall commit ourselves to a phrase

<pb id="p.237"/>

which will require some apology, since the final letter
of the first syllable, which cannot be pronounced
without closing the lips, will force us either to pause
in a most unbecoming manner, or by assimilation to
the <hi rend="italics">n</hi> which follows<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> pronouncing <hi rend="italics">cunnotis.</hi></note> will produce a most objectionable suggestion.<milestone unit="section" n="46"/> I might quote other collocations
of words which are liable to the same objection, but
to discuss them in detail would be to fall into that
very fault which I have just said should be avoided.
A similar offence against modesty may be caused by
the division of words, as, for example, by the use of
the nominative of <hi rend="italics">intercapedinis.</hi><note><hi rend="italics">interccapedo,</hi> of which the last two syllables might give
rise to unseemly laughter; <hi rend="italics">pedo =</hi> <quote>break wind.</quote></note><milestone unit="section" n="47"/> And it is not
merely in writing that this may occur, but you will
find, unless you exercise the greatest care, that there
are a number of persons who take pleasure in putting
an indecent interpretation on words, thinking, as
Ovid<note><hi rend="italics">Met.</hi> i. 502.</note> says:

<quote rend="blockquote">
<quote><l>that whatsoe'er is hid is best of all.</l></quote></quote>

Nay, an obscene meaning may be extracted even
from words which are as far removed from indecency
as possible. Celsus, for example, detects an instance
of <foreign lang="greek">kake/mfaton</foreign> in the Virgilian<note><hi rend="italics">Georg.</hi> i. 357.</note> phrase:

<quote rend="blockquote">
<l>incipiunt agitata tumescere;</l></quote>

but if this point of view be accepted, it will be risky
to say anything at all.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="48"/>Next to indecency of expression comes meanness,
styled <foreign lang="greek">tapei/nwsis,</foreign> when the grandeur or dignity of
anything is diminished by the words used, as in the
line:

<quote rend="blockquote">
<l><quote>There is a rocky wart upon the mountain's brow.</quote><note>From an unknown tragedian.</note></l></quote>

The opposite fault, which is no less serious, consists

<pb id="p.239"/>

in calling small things by extravagant names, though
such a practice is permissible when deliberately
designed to raise a laugh. Consequently we must
not call a parricide a scamp, nor a man who keeps a
harlot a villain, since the first epithet is too weak
and the second too strong.<milestone unit="section" n="49"/> This fault will result in
making our language dull, or coarse, jejune, heavy,
unpleasing or slovenly, all of which faults are best
realised by reference to the virtues which are their
opposites, that is, point, polish, richness, liveliness,
charm, and finish.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="50"/>We must also avoid <foreign lang="greek">mei/wsis</foreign> a term applied to
meagreness and inadequacy of expression, although
it is a fault which characterises an obscure style rather
than one which lacks ornament. But <hi rend="italics">meiosis</hi> may be
deliberately employed, and is then called a figure,
as also is <hi rend="italics">tautology,</hi> which means the repetition of a
word or phrase.<milestone unit="section" n="51"/> The latter, though not avoided
with special care even by the best authors, may
sometimes be regarded as a fault: it is, in fact, a
blemish into which Cicero not infrequently falls
through indifference to such minor details: take, for
example, the following passage,<note><hi rend="italics">Pro Cluent.</hi> xxxv. 96. To bring out the effect criticised
by Cicero, <hi rend="italics">iudicium</hi> must he translated <quote>judgment.</quote> But
<quote>trial</quote> is required to give the correct sense. <foreign lang="greek">e)pana/lhyis</foreign>
= repetition.</note> <quote>Judges, this
judgment was not merely unlike a judgment.</quote>
It is sometimes given another name, <foreign lang="greek">e)pana/lhyis,</foreign> under
which appellation it is ranked among figures, of
which I shall give examples when I come to the
discussion of stylistic virtues.<note>IX. ii.</note></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="52"/>A worse fault is <foreign lang="greek">o(moei/deia,</foreign> or sameness, a term
applied to a style which has no variety to relieve
its tedium, and which presents a uniform monotony
of hue. This is one of the surest signs of lack of art,
and produces a uniquely unpleasing effect, not merely
on the mind, but on the ear, on account of its

<pb id="p.241"/>

sameness of thought, the uniformity of its figures, and
the monotony of its structure.<milestone unit="section" n="53"/> We must also avoid
<hi rend="italics">macrology,</hi> that is, the employment of more words
than are necessary, as, for instance, in the sentence
of Livy, <quote>The ambassadors, having failed to obtain
peace, went back home, whence they had come.</quote><note><hi rend="italics">Fr.</hi> 62, <hi rend="italics">Hertz.</hi></note>
On the other hand, <hi rend="italics">periphrasis,</hi> which is akin to this
blemish, is regarded as a virtue. Another fault is
<hi rend="italics">pleonasm,</hi> when we overload our style with a superfluity of words, as in the phrase, <quote>I saw it with
my eyes,</quote> where <quote>I saw it</quote> would have been
sufficient.<milestone unit="section" n="54"/> Cicero passed a witty comment on a
fault of this kind in a declamation of Hirtius when
he said that a child had been carried for ten months
in his mother's womb. <quote>Oh,</quote> he said, <quote>I suppose
other women carry them in their bags.</quote><note><hi rend="italics">perulra</hi> means <quote>a small wallet.</quote> But it is noteworthy
that in Apul. <hi rend="italics">Met.</hi> V. xiv. it is used <hi rend="italics">= uterus,</hi> and the <hi rend="italics">doubleentendre</hi> was probably current in Cicero's time.</note> Sometimes, however, the form of pleonasm, of which I
have just given an example, may have a pleasing
effect when employed for the sake of emphasis, as
in the Virgilian phrase<note><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> iv- 359.</note>:

<quote rend="blockquote">
<quote><l>With mine own ears his voice I heard.</l></quote></quote>

But whenever the addition is not deliberate,<milestone unit="section" n="55"/> but
merely tame and redundant, it must be regarded as
a fault. There is also a fault entitled <foreign lang="greek">periergi/a,</foreign> which
I may perhaps translate by superfluous elaboration,
which differs from its corresponding virtue much as
fussiness differs from industry, and superstition from
religion. Finally, every word which neither helps
the sense nor the style may be regarded as faulty.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="56"/><hi rend="italics">Cacozelia,</hi> or perverse affectation, is a fault in every
kind of style: for it includes all that is turgid,
trivial, luscious, redundant, far-fetched or extravagant, while the same name is also applied to virtues

<pb id="p.243"/>

carried to excess, when the mind loses its critical
sense and is misled by the false appearance of
beauty, the worst of all offences against style, since
other faults are due to carelessness, but this is
deliberate.<milestone unit="section" n="57"/> This form of affectation, however, affects
style alone. For the employment of arguments which
might equally well be advanced by the other side,
or are foolish, inconsistent or superfluous, are all
faults of matter, whereas corruption of style is
revealed in the employment of improper or redundant
words, in obscurity of meaning, effeminacy of rhythm,
or in the childish search for similar or ambiguous
expressions.<milestone unit="section" n="58"/> Further, it always involves insincerity,
even though all insincerity does not imply affectation.
For it consists in saying something in an unnatural
or unbecoming or superfluous manner. Style may,
however, be corrupted in precisely the same number
of ways that it may be adorned. But I have discussed this subject at greater length in another
work,<note>The lost <hi rend="italics">De causis corruptae eloquentiae.</hi></note> and have frequently called attention to it in
this, while I shall have occasion to mention it continually in the remaining books. For in dealing with
ornament, I shall occasionally speak of faults which
have to be avoided, but which are hard to distinguish
from virtues.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="59"/>To these blemishes may be added faulty arrangement or <foreign lang="greek">a)noikono/mhton,</foreign> the faulty use of figures or
<foreign lang="greek">a)sxhma/tiston,</foreign> and the faulty collocation of words
or <foreign lang="greek">kakosu/nqeton.</foreign> But, as I have already discussed
arrangement, I will confine myself to the consideration of figures and structure. There is also a fault
known as <foreign lang="greek">*sardismo\s,</foreign> which consists in the indiscriminate use of several different dialects, as, for
instance, would result from mixing Doric, Ionic, and

<pb id="p.245"/>

even Aeolic words with Attic.<milestone unit="section" n="60"/> A similar fault is
found amongst ourselves, consisting in the indiscriminate mixture of grand words with mean, old
with new, and poetic with colloquial, the result
being a monstrous medley like that described by
Horace in the opening portion of his <hi rend="italics">Ars poetica,</hi><note><hi rend="italics">A. P. I.</hi></note>

<quote rend="blockquote">
<quote><l part="F">If a painter choose</l>
<l>To place a man's head on a horse's neck,</l></quote></quote>

and, be proceeds to say, should add other limbs from
different animals.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="61"/>The ornate is something that goes beyond what
is merely lucid and acceptable. It consists firstly
in forming a clear conception of what we wish to
say, secondly in giving this adequate expression,
and thirdly in lending it additional brilliance, a
process which may correctly be termed embellishment. Consequently we must place among ornaments
that <foreign lang="greek">e)na/rgeia</foreign> which I mentioned in the rules which
I laid down for the statement of facts,<note><milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>ii. 63.</note> because vivid
illustration, or, as some prefer to call it, representation, is something more than mere clearness, since
the latter merely lets itself be seen, whereas the
former thrusts itself upon our notice.<milestone unit="section" n="62"/> It is a great
gift to be able to set forth the facts on which
we are speaking clearly and vividly. For oratory
fails of its full effect, and does not assert itself
as it should, if its appeal is merely to the hearing,
and if the judge merely feels that the facts
on which he has to give his decision are being
narrated to him, and not displayed in their living
truth to the eyes of the mind.<milestone unit="section" n="63"/> But since different
views have been held with regard to this art of
representation, I shall not attempt to divide it into

<pb id="p.247"/>

all its different departments, whose number is
ostentatiously multiplied by certain writers, but
shall content myself with touching on those which
appear to me to be absolutely necessary. There is,
then, to begin with, one form of vividness which consists in giving an actual word-picture of a scene, as
in the passage beginning,

<quote rend="blockquote">
<quote><l>Forthwith each hero tiptoe stood erect.<note><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> v. 426.</note></l></quote></quote>

Other details follow which give us such a picture
of the two boxers confronting each other for the
fight, that it could not have been clearer had we
been actual spectators.<milestone unit="section" n="64"/> Cicero is supreme in this
department, as in others. Is there anybody so incapable of forming a mental picture of a scene that,
when he reads the following passage from the
Verrines,<note>v. xxxiii. 86.</note> he does not seem not merely to see the
actors in the scene, the place itself and their very
dress, but even to imagine to himself other details
that the orator does not describe? <quote>There on the
shore stood the praetor, the representative of the
Roman people, with slippered feet, robed in a purple
cloak, a tunic streaming to his heels, and leaning on
the arm of this worthless woman.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="65"/> For my own
part, I seem to see before my eyes his face, his eyes,
the unseemly blandishments of himself and his paramour, the silent loathing and frightened shame of
those who viewed the scene.<milestone unit="section" n="66"/> At times, again, the
picture which we endeavour to present is fuller in
detail, as, for example, in the following description
of a luxurious banquet, which is also from Cicero,<note>From the lost <hi rend="italics">pro Gallio.</hi></note>
since he by himself is capable of supplying admirable
examples of every kind of oratorical ornament: <quote>I
seemed to see some entering, some leaving the room,

<pb id="p.249"/>

some reeling under the influence of the wine, others
yawning with yesterday's potations. The floor was
foul with wine-smears, covered with wreaths half-withered and littered with fishbones.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="67"/> What more
would any man have seen who had actually entered
the room? So, too, we may move our hearers to
tears by the picture of a captured town. For the
mere statement that the town was stormed, while
no doubt it embraces all that such a calamity involves, has all the curtness of a dispatch, and fails
to penetrate to the emotions of the hearer.<milestone unit="section" n="68"/> But if
we expand all that the one word <quote>stormed</quote> includes,
we shall see the flames pouring from house and
temple, and hear the crash of falling roofs and one
confused clamour blent of many cries: we shall
behold some in doubt whither to fly, others clinging
to their nearest and dearest in one last embrace,
while the wailing of women and children and the
laments of old men that the cruelty of fate should
have spared them to see that day will strike upon
our ears.<milestone unit="section" n="69"/> Then will come the pillage of treasure
sacred and profane, the hurrying to and fro of the
plunderers as they carry off their booty or return to
seek for more, the prisoners driven each before his
own inhuman captor, the mother struggling to keep
her child, and the victors fighting over the richest
of the spoil. For though, as I have already said,
the sack of a city includes all these things, it is less
effective to tell the whole news at once than to
recount it detail by detail.<milestone unit="section" n="70"/> And we shall secure
the vividness we seek, if only our descriptions give
the impression of truth, nay, we may even add
fictitious incidents of the type which commonly
occur. The same vivid impression may be produced

<pb id="p.251"/>

also by the mention of the <hi rend="italics">accidents</hi> of each
situation:

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l part="F">Chill shudderings shake my limbs</l>
<l>And all my blood is curdled cold with fear;</l></quote><bibl><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> iii. 29</bibl></cit></quote>

or

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l part="F">And trembling mothers clasped</l>
<l>Their children to their breast.</l></quote><bibl><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> vii. 518.</bibl></cit></quote>

Though the attainment of such effects is,<milestone unit="section" n="71"/> in my
opinion, the highest of all oratorical gifts, it is far
from difficult of attainment. Fix your eyes on nature
and follow her. All eloquence is concerned with
the activities of life, while every man applies to
himself what he hears from others, and the mind
is always readiest to accept what it recognises to
be true to nature.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="72"/>The invention of <hi rend="italics">similes</hi> has also provided an
admirable means of illuminating our descriptions.
Some of these are designed for insertion among
our arguments to help our proof, while others are
devised to make our pictures yet more vivid; it is
with this latter class of simile that I am now specially
concerned. The following are good examples:&mdash;

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>Thence like fierce wolves beneath the cloud of
night,</l></quote> <bibl>Aen. ii. 355.</bibl></cit></quote>

or

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l part="M">Like the bird that flies</l>
<l>Around the shore and the fish-haunted reef,</l>
<l>Skimming the deep.</l></quote> <bibl>Aen. iv. 254.</bibl>
</cit></quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="73"/>In employing this form of ornament we must be
especially careful that the subject chosen for our
simile is neither obscure nor unfamiliar: for anything that is selected for the purpose of illuminating

<pb id="p.253"/>

something else must itself be clearer than that which
it is designed to illustrate. Therefore while we may
permit poets to employ such similes as:&mdash;

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>As when Apollo wintry Lycia leaves,</l>
<l>And Xanthus' streams, or visits Delos' isle,</l>
<l>His mother's home,</l></quote><bibl><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> iv. 143.</bibl></cit></quote>

it would be quite unsuitable for an orator to illustrate
something quite plain by such obscure allusions.
<milestone unit="section" n="74"/>But even the type of simile which I discussed in
connexion with arguments<note><milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>xi. 22.</note> is an ornament to oratory,
and serves to make it sublime, rich, attractive or
striking, as the case may be. For the more remote
the simile is from the subject to which it is applied,
the greater will be the impression of novelty and the
unexpected which it produces.<milestone unit="section" n="75"/> The following type
may be regarded as commonplace and useful only as
helping to create an impression of sincerity: <quote>As
the soil is improved and rendered more fertile by
culture, so is the mind by education,</quote> or <quote>As
physicians amputate mortified limbs, so must we
lop away foul and dangerous criminals, even though
they be bound to us by ties of blood.</quote> Far finer is
the following from Cicero's<note><hi rend="italics">Pro Arch.</hi> viii. 19.</note> defence of Archias:
<quote>Rock and deserts reply to the voice of man, savage
beasts are oft-times tamed by the power of music
and stay their onslaught,</quote> and the rest.<milestone unit="section" n="76"/> This type
of simile has, however, sadly degenerated in the
hands of some of our declaimers owing to the license
of the schools. For they adopt false comparisons,
and even then do not apply them as they should
to the subjects to which they wish them to provide
a parallel. Both these faults are exemplified in
two similes which were on the lips of everyone

<pb id="p.255"/>

when I was a young man, <quote>Even the sources of
mighty rivers are navigable,</quote> and <quote>The generous
tree bears fruit while it is yet a sapling.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="77"/> In every
comparison the simile either precedes or follows the
subject which it illustrates. But sometimes it is
free and detached, and sometimes, a far better
arrangement, is attached to the subject which it
illustrates, the correspondence between the resemblances being exact, an effect produced by <hi rend="italics">reciprocal
representation,</hi> which the Greeks style <foreign lang="greek">a)ntapo/dosis.</foreign>
For example, the simile already quoted,<milestone unit="section" n="78"/>

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>Thence like fierce wolves beneath the cloud of<lb/>
night,</l></quote><bibl><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> ii. 355.</bibl></cit></quote>

precedes its subject. On the other hand, an example
of the simile following its subject is to be found in
the first <hi rend="italics">Georgic,</hi> where, after the long lamentation
over the wars civil and foreign that have afflicted
Rome, there come the lines:

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>As when, their barriers down, the chariots speed</l>
<l>Lap after lap; in vain the charioteer</l>
<l>Tightens the curb: his steeds ungovernable</l>
<l>Sweep him away nor heeds the car the rein.</l></quote><bibl><hi rend="italics">Georg. i.</hi> 512.</bibl></cit></quote>

There is, however, no <hi rend="italics">antapodosis</hi> in these similes.<milestone unit="section" n="79"/>
Such <hi rend="italics">reciprocal representation</hi> places both subjects of
comparison before our very eyes, displaying them
side by side. Virgil provides many remarkable examples, but it will be better for me to quote from
oratory. In the <hi rend="italics">pro Murena</hi> Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">Pro Mur.</hi> xiii. 29.</note> says, <quote>As among
Greek musicians (for so they say), only those turn
flute-players that cannot play the lyre, so here at
Rome we see that those who cannot acquire the art
of oratory betake themselves to the study of the

<pb id="p.257"/>

law.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="80"/> There is also another simile in the same
speech,<note><hi rend="italics">Pro Mur.</hi> xvii. 36.</note> which is almost worthy of a poet, but in
virtue of its <hi rend="italics">reciprocal representation</hi> is better adapted
for ornament: <quote>For as tempests are generally preceded by some premonitory signs in the heaven, but
often, on the other hand, break forth for some obscure
reason without any warning whatsoever, so in the
tempests which sway the people at our Roman
elections we are not seldom in a position to discern
their origin, and yet, on the other hand, it is frequently so obscure that the storm seems to have
burst without any apparent cause.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="81"/> We find also
shorter similes, such as <quote>Wandering like wild beasts
through the woods,</quote> or the passage from Cicero's
speech against Clodius:<note>Now lost.</note> <quote>He fled from the court
like a man escaping naked from a fire.</quote> Similar
examples from everyday speech will occur to
everyone.</p>
<p>Such comparisons reveal the gift not merely of
placing a thing vividly before the eye, but of doing
so with rapidity and without waste of detail.<milestone unit="section" n="82"/> The
praise awarded to perfect brevity is well-deserved;
but, on the other hand, <hi rend="italics">brachylogy,</hi> which I shall
deal with when I come to speak of figures, that is
to say, the brevity that says nothing more than what
is absolutely necessary, is less effective, although it
may be employed with admirable results when it
expresses a great deal in a very few words, as in
Sallust's description of Mithridates as <quote>huge of
stature, and armed to match.</quote> But unsuccessful
attempts to imitate this form of terseness result
merely in obscurity.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="83"/>A virtue which closely resembles the last, but
is on a grander scale, is <hi rend="italics">emphasis,</hi> which succeeds

<pb id="p.259"/>

in revealing a deeper meaning than is actually
expressed by the words. There are two kinds of
<hi rend="italics">emphasis:</hi> the one means more than it says, the
other often means something which it does not
actually say.<milestone unit="section" n="84"/> An example of the former is found
in Homer,<note><hi rend="italics">Od.</hi> xi. 523.</note> where he makes Menelaus say that the
Greeks <hi rend="italics">descended</hi> into the Wooden Horse, indicating
its size by a single verb. Or again, there is the
following example by Virgil:<note><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> ii. 262.</note>

<quote rend="blockquote">
<quote><l>Descending by a rope let down,</l></quote></quote>

a phrase which in a similar manner indicates the
height of the horse. The same poet,<note><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> iii. 631.</note> when he says
that the Cyclops lay stretched <quote>throughout the
cave,</quote> by taking the room occupied as the standard
of measure, gives an impression of the giant's
immense bulk.<milestone unit="section" n="85"/> The second kind of <hi rend="italics">emphasis</hi> consists either in the complete suppression of a word
or in the deliberate omission to utter it. As an
example of complete suppression I may quote the
following passage from the <hi rend="italics">pro Ligario,</hi> 4 where
Cicero says: <quote>But if your exalted position were
not matched by your goodness of heart, a quality
which is all your own, your very own&mdash;I know
well enough what I am saying&mdash;&mdash;</quote> Here he suppresses the fact, which is none the less clear enough
to us, that he does not lack counsellors who would
incite him to cruelty. The omission of a word is produced by <hi rend="italics">aposiopesis,</hi> which, however, being a figure,
shall be dealt with in its proper place.<note>v. 15: The passage goes on, <quote>Then your victory
would have brought bitter grief in its train. For how many
of the victors would have wished you to be cruel!</quote> Where
then is the <hi rend="italics">suppression?</hi> Quintilian is probably quoting from
memory and has forgotten the context.
ix. ii. 54; iii. 60.</note><milestone unit="section" n="86"/> <hi rend="italics">Emphasis is</hi>
also found in the phrases of every day, such as <quote>Be a
man!</quote> or <quote>He is but mortal,</quote> or <quote>We must live!</quote>
So like, as a rule, is nature to art.</p>
<p>It is not, however, sufficient for eloquence to set

<pb id="p.261"/>

forth its theme in brilliant and vivid language:
there are many different ways of embellishing our
style.<milestone unit="section" n="87"/> For even that absolute and unaffected simplicity which the Greeks call <foreign lang="greek">a)fe/leia</foreign> has in it a
certain chaste ornateness such as we admire also in
women, while a minute accuracy in securing propriety and precision in our words likewise produces
an impression of neatness and delicacy. Again
copiousness may consist either in wealth of thought
or luxuriance of language.<milestone unit="section" n="88"/> Force, too, may be
shown in different ways; for there will always be
force in anything that is in its own way effective.
Its most important exhibitions are to be found in
the following: <foreign lang="greek">dei/nwsis</foreign> or a certain sublimity in the
exaggerated denunciation of unworthy conduct, to
mention no other topics; <foreign lang="greek">fantasi/a</foreign> or imagination,
which assists us to form mental pictures of things;
<foreign lang="greek">e)cergasi/a</foreign> or finish, which produces completeness of
effect; <foreign lang="greek">e)pecergasi/a</foreign> an intensified form of the preceding, which reasserts our proofs and clinches the
argument by repetition;<milestone unit="section" n="89"/> and <foreign lang="greek">e)ne/rgeia,</foreign> or vigour, a
near relative of all these qualities, which derives
its name from action and finds its peculiar function
in securing that nothing that we say is tame.
Bitterness, which is generally employed in abuse,
may be of service as in the following passage.
from Cassius: <quote>What will you do when I invade
your special province, that is, when I show that,
as far as abuse is concerned, you are a mere
ignoramus?</quote><note>Cassius Severus was famous for his powers of abuse.
His opponent was abusive. Cassius says that he will take a
leaf out of his book and show him what real abuse is.</note> Pungency also may be employed,
as in the following remark of Crassus: <quote>Shall
I regard you as a consul, when you refuse to
regard me as a senator?</quote> But the real power of
oratory lies in enhancing or attenuating the force

<pb id="p.263"/>

of words. Each of these departments has the same
number of methods; I shall touch on the more important; those omitted will be of a like character,
while all are concerned either with words or things.
I have, however,<milestone unit="section" n="90"/> already dealt with the methods of
invention and arrangement, and shall therefore now
concern myself with the way in which style may
elevate or depress the subject in hand.</p>
<p>IV. The first method of <hi rend="italics">amplification</hi> or <hi rend="italics">attenuation</hi>
is to be found in the actual word employed to
describe a thing. For example, we may say that
a man who was <hi rend="italics">beaten</hi> was <hi rend="italics">murdered,</hi> or that a <hi rend="italics">dishonest</hi> fellow is a <hi rend="italics">robber,</hi> or, on the other hand, we
may say that one who <hi rend="italics">struck</hi> another merely <hi rend="italics">touched</hi>
him, and that one who <hi rend="italics">wounded</hi> another merely <hi rend="italics">hurt</hi>
him. The following passage from the <hi rend="italics">pro Caelio,</hi><note>xvi. 38.</note>
provides examples of both: <quote>If a widow lives
<hi rend="italics">freely,</hi> if being by nature bold she throws restraint
to the winds, makes wealth an excuse for luxury,
and strong passions for playing the harlot, would
this be a reason for my regarding a man who was
somewhat free in his method of saluting her to be
an adulterer?</quote><milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For here he calls an immodest
woman a harlot, and says that one who had long
been her lover saluted her with a certain freedom.
This sort of <hi rend="italics">amplification</hi> may be strengthened
and made more striking by pointing the comparison between words of stronger meaning and
those for which we propose to substitute them, as
Cicero does in denouncing Verres<note><hi rend="italics">Verr. I.</hi> iii. 9.</note>: <quote>I have brought
before you, judges, not a thief, but a plunderer;
not an adulterer, but a ravisher; not a mere committer of sacrilege, but the enemy of all religious
observance and all holy things; not an assassin,

<pb id="p.265"/>

but a bloodthirsty butcher who has slain our fellowcitizens and our allies.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In this passage the
first epithets are bad enough, but are rendered
still worse by those which follow. I consider,
However, that there are four principal methods of
<hi rend="italics">implication: augmentation, comparison, reasoning</hi> and
accumulation.</p>
<p>Of these, <hi rend="italics">augmentation</hi> is most impressive when it
ends grandeur even to comparative insignificance.
This may be effected either by one step or by
everal, and may be carried not merely to the
highest degree, but sometimes even beyond it.
<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>A single example from Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">Verr.</hi> v. lxvi. 170.</note> will suffice to
llustrate all these points. <quote>It is a sin to bind a
Roman citizen, a crime to scourge him, little short
if the most unnatural murder to put him to death;
chat then shall I call his crucifixion?</quote> If he had
merely been scourged, we should have had but one
tep, indicated by the description even of the lesser
offence as a <hi rend="italics">sin,</hi> while if he had merely been killed,<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>
we should have had several more steps; but after
saying that it was <quote>little short of the most unatural murder to put him to death,</quote> and mentioning the worst of crimes, he adds, <quote>What then shall
call his crucifixion?</quote> Consequently, since he had
ready exhausted his vocabulary of crime, words
must necessarily fail him to describe something still
orse.<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> There is a second method of passing beond the highest degree, exemplified in Virgil's
description of Lausus:<note><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> vii. 649.</note>

<quote rend="blockquote">
<quote><l>Than whom there was not one more fair</l>
<l part="I">Saving Laurentian Turnus.</l></quote></quote>

or here the words <quote>than whom there was not

<pb id="p.267"/>

one more fair</quote> give us the superlative, on which
the poet proceeds to superimpose a still higher
degree.<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> There is also a third sort, which is not
attained by gradation, a height which is not a
degree beyond the superlative, but such that
nothing greater can be conceived. <quote>You beat
your mother. What more need I say? You beat
your mother.</quote> For to make a thing so great as
to be incapable of augmentation is in itself a kind
of augmentation.<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> It is also possible to heighten
our style less obviously, but perhaps yet more effectively, by introducing a continuous and unbroken
series in which each word is stronger than the last,
as Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">Phil.</hi> I. xxv. 63.</note> does when he describes how Antony
vomited <quote>before an assembly of the Roman people,
while performing a public duty, while Master of the
Horse.</quote> Each phrase is more forcible than that
which went before. Vomiting is an ugly thing in
itself, even when there is no assembly to witness
it; it is ugly when there is such an assembly, even
though it be not an assembly of the people; ugly
even though it be an assembly of the people and
not the Roman people; ugly even though he were
engaged on no business at the time, even if his
business were not public business, even if lie were
not Master of the Horse.<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Another might have
broken up the series and lingered over each step
in the ascending scale, but Cicero hastens to his
climax and reaches the height not by laborious
effort, but by the impetus of his speed.</p>
<p>Just as this form of <hi rend="italics">amplification</hi> rises to a climax,
so, too, the form which depends on <hi rend="italics">comparison</hi> seeks
to rise from the less to the greater, since by raising
what is below it must necessarily exalt that which

<pb id="p.269"/>

is above, as, for example: in the following passage:<note><hi rend="italics">Phil. II.</hi> xxv. 63.</note>
<milestone unit="section" n="10"/><quote>If this had befallen you at the dinner-table in
the midst of your amazing potations, who would
not have thought it unseemly? But it occurred at
an assembly of the Roman people.</quote> Or take this
passage from the speech against Catiline:<note><hi rend="italics">Phil.</hi> I. vii. 17.
xi 32.</note> <quote>In
truth, if my slaves feared me as all your fellowcitizens fear you, I should think it wise to leave my
house.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="11"/> At times, again, we may advance a parallel
to make something which we desire to exaggerate
seem greater than ever, as Cicero does in the <hi rend="italics">pro
Cluentio,</hi><note><hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> v. xiii. 24.</note> where, after telling a story of a woman
of Miletus who took a bribe from the reversionary
heirs to prevent the birth of her expected child,
lie cries, <quote>How much greater is the punishment
deserved by Oppianicus for the same offence! For
that woman, by doing violence to her own body
did but torture herself, whereas he procured
the same result by applying violence and torture
to the body of another.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="12"/> I would not, however,
have anyone think that this method is identical
with that used in argument, where the greater is
inferred from the less, although there is a certain
resemblance between the two. For in the latter
case we are aiming at proof, in the former at
<hi rend="italics">amplification;</hi> for example, in the passage just cited
about Oppianicus, the object of the comparison is
not to show that his action was a crime, but that
it was even worse than another crime. There is,
however, a certain affinity between the two methods,
and I will therefore repeata passage which I
quoted there, although my present purpose is
different.<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> For what I have now to demonstrate is
that when amplification is our purpose we

<pb id="p.271"/>

compare not merely whole with whole, but part with
part, as in the following passage:<note><hi rend="italics">Cat.</hi> i. i. 3.
<hi rend="italics">Phil.</hi> ii. xxv. 63.</note> <quote>Did that illustrious citizen, the pontifex maximus, Publius Scipio,
acting merely in his private capacity, kill Tiberius
Gracchus when he introduced but slight changes
for the worse that did not seriously impair the
constitution of the state, and shall we as consuls
suffer Catiline to live, whose aim was to lay waste
the whole world with fire and sword?</quote><milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Here
Catiline is compared to Gracchus, the constitution
of the state to the whole world, a slight change for
the worse to fire and sword and desolation, and a
private citizen to the consuls, all comparisons
affording ample opportunity for further individual
expansion, if anyone should desire so to do.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="15"/>With regard to the <hi rend="italics">amplificalion</hi> produced by
<hi rend="italics">reasoning,</hi> we must consider whether <hi rend="italics">reasoning</hi> quite
expresses my meaning. I am not a stickler for
exact terminology, provided the sense is clear to
any serious student. My motive in using this term
was, however, this, that this form of amplification
produces its effect at a point other than that where
it is actually introduced. One thing is magnified
in order to effect a corresponding augmentation elsewhere, and it is by reasoning that our hearers are
then led on from the first point to the second which
we desire to emplasise.<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Cicero, when he is about
to reproach Antony with his drunkenness and
vomiting, says,<note><hi rend="italics">Cat.</hi> i. i. 3.
<hi rend="italics">Phil.</hi> ii. xxv. 63.</note> <quote>You with such a throat, such
flanks, such burly strength in every limb of your
prize-fighter's body,</quote> etc. What have his throat
and flanks to do with his drunkenness? The
reference is far from pointless: for by looking at
them we are enabled to estimate the quantity of

<pb id="p.273"/>

the wine which he drank at Hippias' wedding, and
was unable to carry or digest in spite of the fact
that his bodily strength was worthy of a prizefighter. Accordingly if, in such a case, one thing is
inferred from another, the term <hi rend="italics">reasoning</hi> is neither
improper nor extraordinary, since it has been
applied on similar grounds to one of the <hi rend="italics">bases.</hi><note>See III. vi. 43 sqq. VII. v. 2.</note>
So, again,<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> amplification results from subsequent
events, since the violence with which the wine
burst from him was such that the vomiting was
not accidental nor voluntary, but a matter of
necessity, at a moment when it was specially unseemly, while the food was not recently swallowed,
as is sometimes the case, but the residue of the revel
of the preceding day.<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> On the other hand, <hi rend="italics">amplification</hi> may equally result from antecedent circumstances; for example, when Juno made her request
to Aeolus, the latter<note><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> i. 81.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote">
<l part="M">"Turned his spear and smote</l>
<l>The mountain's caverned side, and forth the winds</l>
<l part="I">Rushed in a throng,"</l></quote>
whereby the poet shows what a mighty tempest will
ensue.<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> Again, when we have depicted some horrible
circumstance in such colours as to raise the detestation of our audience to its height, we then proceed
to make light of them in order that what is to follow
may seem still more horrible: consider the following
passage from Cicero:<note><hi rend="italics">Verr.</hi> 5, 44, 177.</note> <quote>These are but trivial offences
for so great a criminal. The captain of a warship
from a famous city bought off' his threatened scourging for a price: a humane concession! Another
paid down a sum of money to save his head from
the axe:<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> a perfectly ordinary circumstance!</quote> Does

<pb id="p.275"/>

not the orator employ a process of reasoning to
enable the audience to infer how great the implied
crime must be when such actions were but humane
and ordinary in comparison? So, again, one thing
may be magnified by allusion to another: the valour
of Scipio is magnified by extolling the fame of
Hannibal as a general, and we are asked to marvel
at the courage of the Germans and the Gauls in
order to enhance the glory of Gaius Caesar. <milestone unit="section" n="21"/>There
is a similar form of <hi rend="italics">amplification</hi> which is effected by
reference to something which appears to have been
said with quite another purpose in view. The chiefs
of Troy<note><hi rend="italics">Il.</hi> iii. 156.</note> think it no discredit that Trojan and Greek
should endure so many woes for so many years all
for the sake of Helen's beauty. How wondrous,
then, must her beauty have been! For it is not
Paris, her ravisher, that says this; it is not some
youth or one of the common herd; no, it is the
elders, the wisest of their folk, the counsellors of
Priam.<milestone unit="section" n="22"/> Nay, even the king himself, worn out by a
ten years' war, which had cost him the loss of so many
of his sons, and threatened to lay his kingdom in the
dust, the man who, above all, should have loathed
and detested her beauty, the source of all those
tears, hears these words, calls her his daughter, and
places her by his side, excuses her guilt, and denies
that she is the cause of his sorrows.<milestone unit="section" n="23"/> Again, when
Plato in the Symposium<note>218B&ndash;219D.</note> makes Alcibiades confess
how he had wished Socrates to treat him, he does
not, I think, record these facts with a view to
blaming Aleibiades, but rather to show the unconquerable self-control of Socrates, which would
not yield even to the charms which the greatest
beauty of his day so frankly placed at his disposal.

<pb id="p.277"/>

<milestone unit="section" n="24"/>We are even given the means of realising the
extraordinary stature of the heroes of old by the
description of their weapons, such as the shield of
Ajax<note><hi rend="italics">Il.</hi> vii. 219.</note> and the spear-shaft of Achilles<note><hi rend="italics">Il.</hi> xvi. 140.</note> hewn in the
forests of Pelion. Virgil<note><hi rend="italics"> Aen.</hi> iii. 659.</note> also has made admirable
use of this device in his description of the Cyclops.
For what an image it gives us of the bulk of that
body

<quote rend="blockquote">
<quote><l>Whose hand was propped by a branchless trunk of<lb/>
pine.</l></quote></quote>

So, too, what a giant must Demoleos<note><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> v. 264.</note> have been,<milestone unit="section" n="25"/>
Whose

<quote rend="blockquote">
<quote><l part="M">corselet manifold</l>
<l>Scarce two men on their shoulders could uphold</l></quote></quote>

And yet the hero buckled it upon him and

<quote rend="blockquote">
<quote><l>Drave the scattering Trojans at full speed.</l></quote></quote>

And again, Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">Phil.</hi> ii. 27.</note> could hardly even have conceived of such luxury in Antony himself as he
describes when he says, <quote>You might see beds in
the chambers of his slaves strewn with the purple
coverlets that had once been Pompey's own.</quote> Slaves
are using purple coverlets in their chambers, aye,
and coverlets that had once been Pompey's! No
more, surely, can be said than this, and yet it leaves
us to infer how infinitely greater was the luxury of
their master.<milestone unit="section" n="26"/> This form of <hi rend="italics">amplification</hi> is near akin
to <hi rend="italics">emphasis:</hi> but emphasis derives its effect from
the actual words, while in this case the effect is
produced by inference from the facts, and is consequently far more impressive, inasmuch as facts are
more impressive than words.</p>

<pb id="p.279"/>

<p><hi rend="italics">Accumulation</hi> of words and sentences identical in
meaning may also be regarded under the head of
<hi rend="italics">amplification.</hi> For although the climax is not in
this case reached by a series of steps, it is none the
less attained by the piling up of words. Take the
following example:<note><hi rend="italics">Pro Lig.</hi> iii. 9.</note><milestone unit="section" n="27"/> <quote>What was that sword of yours
doing, Tubero, the sword you drew on the field of
Pharsalus? Against whose body did you aim its
point? What meant those arms you bore? Whither
were your thoughts, your eyes, your hand, your fiery
courage directed on that day? What passion, what
desires were yours?</quote> This passage recalls the figure
styled <foreign lang="greek">sunaqroismo/s</foreign><note><quote>accumulation.</quote></note> by the Greeks, but in that
figure it is a number of different things that are
accumulated, whereas in this passage all the accumulated details have but one reference. The
heightening of effect may also be produced by
making the words rise to a climax.<note><hi rend="italics">Verr.</hi> xv. xlv. 118.</note> <quote>There stood
the porter of the prison, the praetor's executioner,
the death and terror of the citizens and allies of
Rome, the lictor Sextius.</quote></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="28"/><hi rend="italics">Attenuation</hi> is effected by the same method, since
there are as many degrees of descent as ascent.
I shall therefore content myself with quoting but
one example, namely, the words used by Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">Leg. Agr.</hi> II. V. 13.</note> to
describe the speech of Rullus: <quote>A few, however, who
stood nearest to him suspected that he had intended
to say something about the agrarian law.</quote> This passage may be regarded as providing an example of
<hi rend="italics">attenuation</hi> or of <hi rend="italics">augmentation,</hi> according as we consider its literal meaning or fix our attention on the
obscurity attributed to Rullus.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="29"/>I know that some may perhaps regard <hi rend="italics">hyperbole</hi>
as a species of <hi rend="italics">amplification,</hi> since <hi rend="italics">hyperbole</hi> can be

<pb id="p.281"/>

employed to create an effect in either direction.
But as the name is also applied to one of the <hi rend="italics">tropes,</hi>
I must postpone its consideration for the present.
I would proceed to the immediate discussion of this
subject but for the fact that others have given
separate treatment to this form of artifice, [which
employs words not in their literal, but in a metaphorical sense<note>See ch. vi.</note>]. I shall therefore at this point
indulge a desire now almost universal, and discuss
a form of ornament which many regard as the chief,
nay, almost the sole adornment of oratory.</p>
<p>V. When the ancients used the word <hi rend="italics">sententia,</hi>
they meant a feeling, or opinion. The word is
frequently used in this sense by orators, and traces
of this meaning are still found even in the speech
of every day. For when we are going to take an
oath we use the phrase <hi rend="italics">ex animi nostri sententia (in</hi>
accordance with what we hold is the solemn truth),
and when we offer congratulations, we say that we do
so <hi rend="italics">ex sententia</hi> (with all our heart). The ancients, indeed, often expressed the same meaning by saying
that they uttered their <hi rend="italics">sensa;</hi> for they regarded
<hi rend="italics">senses</hi> as referring merely to the senses of the body.
<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>But modern usage applies <hi rend="italics">sensus</hi> to concepts of the
mind, while <hi rend="italics">sentcntia</hi> is applied to striking reflexions
such as are more especially introduced at the close
of our periods, a practice rare in earlier days, but
carried even to excess in our own. Accordingly, I
think that I ought to say something of the various
forms which such reflexions may tale and the manner
in which they should be used.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Although all the different forms are included
under the same name, the oldest type of <hi rend="italics">sententia,</hi>
and that in which the term is most correctly applied,

<pb id="p.283"/>

is the aphorism, called <foreign lang="greek">gnw/mh</foreign> by the Greeks. Both
the Greek and the Latin names are derived from
the fact that such utterances resemble the decrees
or resolutions of public bodies. The term, however,
is of wide application (indeed, such reflexions may
be deserving of praise even when they have no
reference to any special context), and is used in
various ways. Sometimes it refers merely to things,
as in the sentence: <quote>There is nothing that wins
the affections of the people more than goodness of
heart.<note>Cic. <hi rend="italics">pro Lig.</hi> xii. 37.</note></quote> Occasionally, again, they may have a
personal reference, as in the following utterance
of Domitius Afer: <quote>The prince who would know
all, must needs ignore much.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Some have called
this form of <hi rend="italics">reflexion</hi> a part of the <hi rend="italics">enthymeme,</hi> others
the major premise or conclusion of the <hi rend="italics">epichireme,</hi> as
it sometimes, though not invariably, is. More correct
is the statement that at times it is simple, as in the
example just quoted, while at other times a reason
for the statement may be added,<note>The premises of the enthymeme are simple, while those
of the epichireme are supported by a <hi rend="italics">reason.</hi> See v. xiv.</note> such as the following:<note><hi rend="italics">Sall. Jug.</hi> 10.</note> <quote>For in every struggle, the stronger seems not
to suffer wrong, even when this is actually the case,
but to inflict it, simply in virtue of his superior
power.</quote> Sometimes, again, it may be double, as in
the statement that

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>Complaisance wins us friends, truth enmity.</l></quote><bibl><hi rend="italics">Ter. Andr.</hi> I. i. 41.</bibl></cit></quote>

There are some even who classify them under ten<note>##</note>
heads, though the principle on which they make
this division is such that it would justify a still
larger number: they class them as based on interrogation, comparison, denial, similarity, admiration,
and the like, for they can be treated under every

<pb id="p.285"/>

kind of figure. A striking type is that which is
produced by opposition:

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>Death is not bitter, but the approach to death.</l></quote><bibl>Author unknown.</bibl></cit></quote>

Others are cast in a form of a direct statement,<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>
such as

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l part="F">The miser lacks</l>
<l>That which he has no less than what he has<lb/>
not.</l></quote><bibl>Publil. <hi rend="italics">Syr. Sent.</hi> 486.</bibl></cit></quote>

But they acquire greater force by a change in the
<hi rend="italics">figure</hi> employed, as in the following:

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>Is it so bitter, then, to die?</l></quote><bibl><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> xii. 646.</bibl></cit></quote>

For this is more vigorous than the simple statement,
<quote>Death is not bitter.</quote> A similar effect may be produced by transference of' the statement from the
general to the particular. For example, although
the direct statement would be, <quote>To hurt is easy,
but to do good is hard.</quote> Ovid<note>In his lost tragedy, the Medea.</note> gives this reflexion
increased force when lie makes Medea say,

<quote rend="blockquote">
<quote><l>I had the power to save, and ask you then</l>
<l part="I">If I have power to ruin?</l></quote></quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">' Pro Lig.</hi> xii. 38.</note> again gives the general statement a personal
turn when he says: <quote>Caesar, the splendour of your
present fortune confers on you nothing greater than
the power and nothing better than the will to save
as many of your fellow-citizens as possible.</quote> For
here he attributes to Caesar what was really attributable to the circumstances of his power. In
this class of <hi rend="italics">reflexion</hi> we must be careful, as always,
not to employ them too frequently, nor at random,
nor place them in the mouth of every kind of person,

<pb id="p.287"/>

while we must make certain that they are not
untrue, as is so often the case with those speakers
who style them <hi rend="italics">reflexions of universal application and</hi>
recklessly employ whatever seems to support their
case as though its truth were beyond question.
<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Such reflexions are best suited to those speakers
whose authority is such that their character itself
will lend weight to their words. For who would
tolerate a boy, or a youth, or even a man of low
birth who presumed to speak with all the authority
of a judge and to thrust his precepts down our throats?</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>The term <hi rend="italics">enthymeme</hi> may be applied to any concept
of the mind, but in its strict sense means a <hi rend="italics">reflexion</hi>
drawn from contraries. Consequently, it has a
supremacy among <hi rend="italics">reflexions</hi> which we may compare to that of Homer among poets and Rome
among cities.<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> I have already said enough on this
topic in dealing with arguments.<note>See v. x. 2, and again, for greater detail, v. xiv. 1 (note
at end), where an example of this type of <hi rend="italics">sententia</hi> is given
from the <hi rend="italics">pro Milone</hi> (ch. 29) <quote>You are sitting to avenge the
death of one whom you would be unwilling to restore to life
even if you thought it was in your power to restore it!</quote></note> But the use of
the enthymeme is not confined to proof, it may sometimes be employed for the purpose of ornament, as
in the following instance:<note><hi rend="italics">Pro Lig.</hi> iv. 10.</note> <quote>Caesar, shall the language of those whom it is your glory to have spared
goad you to imitate their own cruelty?</quote> Cicero's
motive in saying this is not that it introduces any
fresh reason for clemency, but because he has already
demonstrated by other arguments how unjust such
conduct would be,<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> while he adds it at the period's
close as an <hi rend="italics">epiphonema,</hi> not by way of proof, but as
a crowning insult to his opponents. For an <hi rend="italics">epiphonema</hi>
is an exclamation attached to the close of a statement
or a proof by way of climax. Here are two examples:

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>Such toil it was to found the Roman race!</l></quote><bibl><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> i. 33.</bibl></cit></quote>

and <quote>The virtuous youth preferred to risk his life

<pb id="p.289"/>

by slaying him to suffering such dishonour.</quote><note>Cic. <hi rend="italics">pro Mil.</hi> iv. 9, <hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> V. xi. 13.</note><milestone unit="section" n="12"/> There
is also what our modern rhetoricians call the <hi rend="italics">noema,</hi>
a term which may be taken to mean every kind of
<hi rend="italics">conception,</hi> but is employed by them in the special
sense of things which they wish to be understood,
though they are not actually said, as in the declamation where the sister defends herself against the
brother whom she had often bought out from the
gladiatorial school, when he brought an action
against her demanding the infliction of a similar
mutilation because she had cut off his thumb while
he slept: <quote>You deserved,</quote> she cries, <quote>to have all
your fingers,</quote> meaning thereby, <quote>You deserved to
be a gladiator all your days.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="13"/> There is also what
is called a <hi rend="italics">clausula.</hi> If this merely means a <hi rend="italics">conclusion,</hi> it is a perfectly correct and sometimes a
necessary device, as in the following case: <quote>You
must, therefore, first confess your own offence before
you accuse Ligarius of anything.</quote><note><hi rend="italics">Pro Lig. i. 2.</hi> It is a conclusion in the logical sense.
But <hi rend="italics">clausula</hi> more commonly means <quote>close, conclusion,
cadence</quote> of a period. <hi rend="italics">Cp.</hi> what follows.</note> But to-day
something more is meant, for our rhetoricians want
every passage, every sentence to strike the ear by
an impressive close.<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> In fact, they think it a disgrace, nay, almost a crime, to pause to breathe
except at the end of a passage that is designed to
call forth applause. The result is a number of tiny
epigrams, affected, irrelevant and disjointed. For
there are not enough striking reflexions in the world
to provide a close to every period.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="15"/>The following forms of reflexion are even more
modern. There is the type which depends on surprise for its effect, as, for example, when Vibius
Crispus, in denouncing the man who wore a breastplate when strolling in the forum and alleged that
he did so because he feared for his life, cried, <quote>Who

<pb id="p.291"/>

gave you leave to be such a coward?</quote> Another
instance is the striking remark made by Africanus
to Nero with reference to the death of Agrippina:
<quote>Caesar, your provinces of Gaul entreat you to bear
your good fortune with courage.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Others are of
an allusive type: for example, Domitius Afer, in his
defence of Cloatilla, whom Claudius had pardoned
when she was accused of having buried her husband,
who had been one of the rebels, addressed her sons
in his peroration with the words: <quote>Nonetheless, it
is your duty, boys, to give your mother burial.</quote><note>The point is uncertain. Possibly, as Gesner suggests,
the sons were accusing their mother.</note>
Some, again,<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> depend on the fact that they are
transferred from one context to another Crispus,
in his defence of Spatale, whose lover had made her
his heir and then proceeded to die at the age
of eighteen, remarked: <quote>What a marvellous fellow
to gratify his passion thus!</quote><note><hi rend="italics">sibi indulsit</hi> would seen to mean his appointing S. his
heir and then being kind enough to die so soon! But the
point is uncertain.</note><milestone unit="section" n="18"/> Another type of reflexion may be produced by the doubling of a phrase,
as in the letter written by Seneca for Nero to be sent
to the senate on the occasion of his mother's death,
with a view to creating the impression that he had
been in serious danger:&mdash;<quote>As yet I cannot believe
or rejoice that I am safe.</quote> Better, however, is the
type which relies for its effect on contrast of opposites,
as <quote>I know from whom to fly, but whom to follow
I know not;</quote><note>Cic. <hi rend="italics">ad Att.</hi> VIII. vii. 2.</note> or, <quote>What of the fact that the poor
wretch, though he could not speak,<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> could not keep
silence?</quote><note>Probably from the lost <hi rend="italics">in Pisonem,</hi> since St. Jerome in a
letter to Oceanus says <hi rend="italics">postea vero Pisoniano vitio, cum loqui
non post, tacere non poterat.</hi> But here again the point is
obscure.</note> But to produce the most striking effect
this type should be given point by the introduction
of a comparison, such as is made by Trachalus in his
speech against Spatale, where he says: <quote>Is it your
pleasure, then, ye laws, the faithful guardians of
chastity, that wives should receive a title<note>
By the <hi rend="italics">lex Julia et Papia Poppaea</hi> childless wives were
only entitled to a tenth of their husband's estate.</note> and
harlots a quarter?</quote></p>

<pb id="p.293"/>

<p>In these instances, however, the reflexion may
equally well be good or bad.<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> On the other hand,
there are some which will always be bad, such as
those which turn on play upon words, as in the
following case: <quote>Conscript fathers, for I must
address you thus that you may remember the duty
owed to fathers.</quote> Worse still, as being more unreal
and far-fetched, is the remark made by the gladiator
mentioned above in his prosecution of his sister:
<quote>I have fought to the last finger.</quote><note>The exact meaning is uncertain. The allusion may be to
the turning up of the thumb as a sign of defeat. See sect. 12.</note><milestone unit="section" n="21"/> There is
another similar type, which is perhaps the worst of
all, where the play upon words is combined with a
false comparison. When I was a young man I heard
a distinguished pleader, after handing a mother some
splinters of bone taken from the head of her son
(which he did merely to provide an occasion for his
epigram), cry: <quote>Unhappiest of women, your son is
not yet dead and yet you have gathered up his
bones!</quote><milestone unit="section" n="22"/> Moreover, most of our orators delight in
devices of the pettiest kind, which seriously considered are merely ludicrous, but at the moment of
their production flatter their authors by a superficial
semblance of wit. Take, for instance, the exclamation
from the scholastic theme, where a man, after being
ruined by the barrenness of his land, is shipwrecked and hangs himself: <quote>Let him whom
neither earth nor sea receives, hang in mid air.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="23"/> A
similar absurdity is to be found in the declamation,
to which I have already referred, in which a father
poisons his son who insists on tearing his flesh with
his teeth: <quote>The man who eats such flesh, deserves
such drink.</quote> Or again, take this passage from the
theme of the luxurious man who is alleged to have
pretended to starve himself to death: <quote>Tie a noose

<pb id="p.295"/>

for yourself: you have good reason to be angry with
your throat. 'rake poison: it is fit that a luxurious
man should die of drink!</quote><milestone unit="section" n="24"/> Others are merely
fatuous, such as the remark of the declaimer who
urges the courtiers of Alexander to provide him with
a tomb by burning down Babylon. <quote>I am burying
Alexander. Shall any man watch such a burial from
his housetop?</quote> As if this were the climax of
indignities! Others fail from sheer extravagance.
For example, I once heard a rhetorician who was
declaiming about the Germans, say: <quote>I know not
where they carry their heads,</quote><note>Is this a suggestion that the Germans are monsters
<quote>whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders</quote> or that
they are so tall that their heads are lost in the clouds?</note> and again when
belauding a hero, <quote>He beats back whole wars with
the boss of his shield.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="25"/> However, I shall never
come to an end if I try to describe every possible
form of this kind of absurdity. I will therefore turn
to discuss a point of more importance.</p>
<p>Rhetoricians are divided in opinion on this subject:
some devote practically all their efforts to the
elaboration of <hi rend="italics">reflexions,</hi> while others condemn their
employment altogether. I cannot agree entirely
with either view.<milestone unit="section" n="26"/> If they are crowded too thick
together, such <hi rend="italics">reflexions</hi> merely stand in each other's
way, just as in the case of crops and the fruits of
trees lack of room to grow results in a stunted
development. Again in pictures a definite outline
is required to throw objects into relief, and consequently artists who include a number of objects in
the same design separate them by intervals sufficient
to prevent one casting a shadow on the other.
Further,<milestone unit="section" n="27"/> this form of display breaks up our speeches
into a number of detached sentences; every <hi rend="italics">reflexion</hi>
is isolated, and consequently a fresh start is necessary
after each. This produces a discontinuous style, since

<pb id="p.297"/>

our language is composed not of a system of limbs,
but of a series of fragments: for your nicely rounded
and polished phrases are incapable of cohesion.
Further, the colour,<milestone unit="section" n="28"/> though bright enough, has no
unity, but consists of a number of variegated splashes.
A purple stripe appropriately applied lends brilliance
to a dress, but a dress decorated with a quantity of
patches can never be becoming to anybody.<milestone unit="section" n="29"/> Wherefore, although these ornaments may seem to stand
out with a certain glitter of their own, they are
rather to be compared to sparks flashing through
the smoke than to the actual brilliance of flame:
they are, in fact, invisible when the language is of
uniform splendour, just as the stars are invisible in
the light of day. And where eloquence seeks to
secure elevation by frequent small efforts, it merely
produces an uneven and broken surface which fails
to win the admiration due to outstanding objects
and lacks the charm that may be found in a smooth
surface.<milestone unit="section" n="30"/> To this must be added the fact that those
who devote themselves solely to the production of
<hi rend="italics">reflexions</hi> cannot avoid giving utterance to many that
are trivial, flat or foolish. For their mere number
will so embarrass their author that selection will be
impossible. Consequently you will often find that
such persons will produce a <hi rend="italics">division</hi> or an <hi rend="italics">argument</hi> as
if it were an epigram, the only qualification necessary
being that it should come toward the close of the
period and be impressively delivered.<milestone unit="section" n="31"/> <quote>You killed
your wife, though you were an adulterer yourself. I
should loathe you even if you had only divorced her.</quote>
Here we have a division. <quote>Do you wish me to prove
that a love-philtre is a poison? The man would still
be living, if he had not drunk it.</quote> This is an

<pb id="p.299"/>

argument. There are, moreover, a number of speakers
who not merely deliver many such epigrams, but
utter everything as if it were an epigram.<milestone unit="section" n="32"/> Against
these persons, on the other hand, must be set those
who shun and dread all ornament of this kind, approving nothing that is not plain, humble and effortless,
with the result that by their reluctance to climb for
fear of falling they succeed merely in maintaining a
perpetual flatness. What sin is there in a good
epigram? Does it not help our case, or move the
judge, or commend the speaker to his audience?
It may be urged, perhaps,<milestone unit="section" n="33"/> that it is a form of
ornament eschewed by the ancients. What do you
mean by antiquity? If you go back to the earliest
periods you will find that Demosthenes frequently
employed methods that were known to none before
him. How can we give our approval to Cicero, if we
think that no change should be made from the
methods of Cato and the Gracchi? And yet before
the Gracchi and Cato the style of oratory was simpler
still.<milestone unit="section" n="34"/> For my own part I regard these particular
ornaments of oratory to be, as it were, the eyes of
eloquence. On the other hand, I should not like to
see the whole body full of eyes, for fear that it might
cripple the functions of the other members, and, if I
had no alternative, I should prefer the rudeness of
ancient eloquence to the license of the moderns.
But a middle course is open to us here no less than
in the refinements of dress and mode of life, where
there is a certain tasteful elegance that offends no
one. Therefore let us as far as possible seek to increase the number of our virtues, although our first
care must always be to keep ourselves free from
vices, lest in seeking to make ourselves better than

<pb id="p.301"/>

the ancients we succeed merely in making ourselves
unlike them.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="35"/>I will now proceed to the next subject for discussion, which is, as I have said, that of <hi rend="italics">tropes,</hi> or <hi rend="italics">modes,</hi>
as the most distinguished Roman rhetoricians call
them. Rules for their use are given by the teachers
of literature as well. But I postponed the discussion
of the subject when I was dealing with literary
education, because it seemed to me that the theme
would have greater importance if handled in connexion with the ornaments of oratory, and that it
ought to be reserved for treatment on a larger scale.</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>By a <hi rend="italics">trope</hi> is meant the artistic alteration of
a word or phrase from its proper meaning to another.
This is a subject which has given rise to interminable disputes among the teachers of literature, who
have quarrelled no less violently with the philosophers than among themselves over the problem of
the <hi rend="italics">genera</hi> and <hi rend="italics">species</hi> into which <hi rend="italics">tropes</hi> may be
divided, their number and their correct classification.
<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>I propose to disregard such quibbles as in no wise
concern the training of an orator, and to proceed
to discuss those <hi rend="italics">tropes</hi> which are most necessary and
meet with most general acceptance, contenting
myself merely with noting the fact that some <hi rend="italics">tropes</hi>
are employed to help out our meaning and others to
adorn our style, that some arise from words used
<hi rend="italics">properly</hi> and others from words used <hi rend="italics">metaphorically,</hi>
and that the changes involved concern not merely
individual words, but also our thoughts and the
structure of our sentences.<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In view of these facts
I regard those writers as mistaken who have held
that <hi rend="italics">tropes</hi> necessarily involved the substitution of
word for word. And I do not ignore the fact that

<pb id="p.303"/>

as a rule the <hi rend="italics">tropes</hi> employed to express our meaning
involve ornament as well, though the converse is not
the case, since there are some which are intended
solely for the purpose of embellishment.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Let us begin, then, with the commonest and by far
the most beautiful of <hi rend="italics">tropes,</hi> namely, <hi rend="italics">metaphor,</hi> the
Greek term for our <hi rend="italics">translatio.</hi> It is not merely so
natural a turn of speech that it is often employed unconsciously or by uneducated persons, but it is in itself
so attractive and elegant that however distinguished
the language in which it is embedded it shines forth
with a light that is all its own.<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For if it be correctly
and appropriately applied, it is quite impossible
for its effect to be commonplace, mean or unpleasing. It adds to the copiousness of language by the
interchange of words and by borrowing, and finally
succeeds in accomplishing the supremely difficult
task of providing a name for everything. A noun
or a verb is transferred from the place to which it
properly belongs to another where there is either no
<hi rend="italics">literal</hi> term or the <hi rend="italics">transferred</hi> is better than the <hi rend="italics">literal.</hi>
<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>We do this either because it is necessary or to make
our meaning clearer or, as I have already said, to produce a decorative effect. When it secures none of
these results, our metaphor will be out of place. As
an example of a necessary metaphor I may quote the
following usages in vogue with peasants when they
call a vinebud <hi rend="italics">gemma,</hi> a gem (what other term is
there which they could use?), or speak of the <hi rend="italics">crops
being thirsty</hi> or the <hi rend="italics">fruit suffering.</hi> For the same
reason we speak of a <hi rend="italics">hard</hi> or <hi rend="italics">rough</hi> man, there being
no <hi rend="italics">literal</hi> term for these temperaments.<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> On the
other hand, when we say that a man is <hi rend="italics">kindled to
anger</hi> or <hi rend="italics">on fire with greed</hi> or that he has <hi rend="italics">fallen into</hi>

<pb id="p.305"/>

<hi rend="italics">error,</hi> we do so to enhance our meaning. For none
of these things can be more literally described in its
own words than in those which we import from
elsewhere. But it is a purely ornamental metaphor
when we speak of <hi rend="italics">brilliance of style, splendour of
birth, tempestuous public assemblies, thunderbolts of
eloquence,</hi> to which I may add the phrase employed
by Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">Pro Mil.</hi> xiii. 34, 35.</note> in his defence of Milo where he speaks
of Clodius as the <hi rend="italics">fountain,</hi> and in another place as
<hi rend="italics">the fertile field and material</hi> of his client's <hi rend="italics">glory.</hi><milestone unit="section" n="8"/> It
is even possible to express facts of a somewhat
unseemly character by a judicious use of metaphor,
as in the following passage:<note>Virg. <hi rend="italics">Georg.</hi> iii. 1</note></p>

<quote rend="blockquote">
<quote><l>This do they lest too much indulgence make</l>
<l>The field of generation slothful grow</l>
<l part="F">And choke its idle furrows.</l></quote></quote>

<p>On the whole <hi rend="italics">metaphor</hi> is a shorter form of <hi rend="italics">simile,</hi>
while there is this further difference, that in the
latter we compare some object to the thing which we
wish to describe, whereas in the former this object is
actually substituted for the thing.<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> It is a comparison when I say that a man did something <hi rend="italics">like a
lion,</hi> it is a metaphor when I say of him, <hi rend="italics">He is a lion.</hi>
Metaphors fall into four classes. In the first we
substitute one living thing for another, as in the
passage where the poet, speaking of a charioteer,<note>Probably from Ennius.</note>
says,

<quote rend="blockquote">
<quote><l part="I">The steersman then</l>
<l>With mighty effort wrenched his charger round.</l></quote></quote>

or when Livy<note>Liv. XXXVIII. liv.</note> says that Scipio was continually
<hi rend="italics">barked at</hi> by Cato.<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Secondly, inanimate things may
be substituted for inanimate, as in the Virgilian.

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>And gave his fleet the rein,</l></quote><bibl><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> vi. 1.</bibl></cit></quote>

<pb id="p.307"/>

or inanimate may be substituted for animate, as in

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>Did the Argive bulwark fall by sword or fate?</l></quote><bibl>From an unknown tragedian.</bibl></cit></quote>

or animate for inanimate, as in the following lines:</p>

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>The shepherd sits unknowing on the height</l>
<l>Listening the roar from some far mountain<lb/>
brow.</l></quote><bibl><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> ii. 307.</bibl></cit></quote>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>But, above all, effects of extraordinary sublimity are
produced when the theme is exalted by a bold and
almost hazardous metaphor and inanimate objects
are given life and action, as in the phrase

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>Araxes' flood that scorns a bridge,</l></quote><bibl><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> viii. 728.</bibl></cit></quote>

or in the passage of Cicero,<note><hi rend="italics">Pro Lit.</hi> iii. 9. See VIII. iv. 27.</note> already quoted,<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> where
he cries, <quote>What was that sword of yours doing,
Tubero, the sword you drew on the field of
Pharsalus? Against whose body did you aim its
point? What meant those arms you bore?</quote> Sometimes the effect is doubled, as in Virgil's.

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>And with venom arm the steel.</l></quote><bibl><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> ix. 773.</bibl></cit></quote>

For both <quote>to arm the steel</quote> and <quote>to arm with
venom</quote> are metaphors.<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> These four kinds of
metaphor are further subdivided into a number of
<hi rend="italics">species,</hi> such as transference from rational beings
to rational and from irrational to irrational and the
reverse, in which the method is the same, and
finally from the whole to its parts and from the
parts to the whole. But I am not now teaching
boys: my readers are old enough to discover the
<hi rend="italics">species</hi> for themselves when once they have been
given the <hi rend="italics">genus.</hi></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="14"/>While a temperate and timely use of metaphor is

<pb id="p.309"/>

a real adornment to style, on the other hand, its
frequent use serves merely to obscure our language
and weary our audience, while if we introduce them
in one continuous series, our language will become
allegorical and enigmatic. There are also certain
metaphors which fail from meanness, such as that
of which I spoke above<note>See VIII. iii. 48.</note>:

<quote rend="blockquote">
<quote><l>There is a rocky wart upon the mountain's</l>
<l>brow.</l></quote></quote>

or they may even be coarse. For it does not
follow that because Cicero was perfectly justified
in talking of <quote>the sink of the state,</quote><note>In <hi rend="italics">Cat.</hi> I. v. 12.</note> when
he desired to indicate the foulness of certain
men, we can approve the following passage from
an ancient orator: <quote>You have lanced the boils
of the state.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Indeed Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">De Or.</hi> iii. xli. 164.</note> himself has demonstrated in the most admirable manner how important it is to avoid grossness in metaphor, such
as is revealed by the following examples, which he
quotes:&mdash;<quote>The state was gelded by the death of
Africanus,</quote> or <quote>Glaucia, the excrement of the
senate-house.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="16"/> He also points out that a metaphor
must not be too great for its subject or, as is more
frequently the case, too little, and that it must not
be inappropriate. Anyone who realises that these
are faults, will be able to detect instances of them
only too frequently. But excess in the use of metaphor is also a fault, more especially if they are of the
same species.<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Metaphors may also be harsh, that is,
far-fetched, as in phrases like <quote>the snows of the
head</quote> or
<quote rend="blockquote">
<cit><quote><l>Jove with white snow the wintry Alps bespewed.</l></quote><bibl>From Furius, an old epic poet of the second century
(not Furius Bibaculus), <hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> Hor. S. ii. v. 11.</bibl></cit></quote>

<pb id="p.311"/>

The worst errors of all, however, originate in the
fact that some authors regard it as permissible to
use even in prose any metaphors that are allowed to
poets, in spite of the fact that tile latter aim solely
at pleasing their readers and are compelled in many
cases to employ metaphor by sheer metrical necessity.<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> For my own part I should not regard a phrase
like <quote>the shepherd of the people</quote> as admissible in
pleading, although it has the authority of Homer,
nor would I venture to say that winged creatures
<quote>swim through the air,</quote> despite the fact that this
metaphor has been most effectively employed by
Virgil to describe the flight of bees and of Daedalus.1 For metaphor should always either occupy
a place already vacant, or if it fills the room of something else, should be more impressive than that
which it displaces.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="19"/>What I have said above applies perhaps with even
greater force to <hi rend="italics">synecdoche&egrave;.</hi> For while <hi rend="italics">metaphor</hi> is
designed to move the feelings, give special distinction to things and place them vividly before
the eye, <hi rend="italics">synecdoche&egrave;</hi> has the power to give variety to
our language by making us realise many things
from one, the whole from a part, the <hi rend="italics">genus</hi> from a
<hi rend="italics">species,</hi> things which follow from things which have
preceded; or, on the other hand, the whole procedure may be reversed. It may, however, be more
freely employed by poets than by orators.<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> For
while in prose it is perfectly correct to use <hi rend="italics">macro,</hi>
the point, for the whole sword, and <hi rend="italics">tectum,</hi> roof, for a
whole house, we may not employ <hi rend="italics">puppis,</hi> stern, to
describe a ship, nor <hi rend="italics">abies,</hi> fir, to describe planks;
and again, though <hi rend="italics">ferrunm,</hi> the steel, may be used to
indicate a sword, <hi rend="italics">quadrupes</hi> cannot be used in the

<pb id="p.313"/>

sense of horse. It is where numbers are concerned
that <hi rend="italics">synecdoche&egrave;</hi> can be most freely employed in
prose. For example, Livy frequently says, <quote>The
Roman won the day,</quote> when he means that the
<hi rend="italics">Romans</hi> were victorious; on the other hand, Cicero
in a letter to Brutus<note>This letter is lost.</note> says, <quote>We have imposed on
the people and are regarded as orators,</quote> when he is
speaking of himself alone.<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> This form of <hi rend="italics">trope</hi> is
not only a rhetorical ornament, but is frequently
employed in everyday speech. Some also apply the
term <hi rend="italics">synecdoche</hi> when something is assumed which
has not actually been expressed, since one word is
then discovered from other words, as in the sentence,

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>The Arcadians to the gates began to rush;</l></quote><bibl><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> xi. 142. A false explanation of the historic infinitive as involving the omission of some such word as
<hi rend="italics">coeperunt.</hi></bibl></cit></quote>

when such omission creates a blemish, it is called an
<hi rend="italics">ellipse.</hi><milestone unit="section" n="22"/> For my own part, I prefer to regard this as
a figure, and shall therefore discuss it under that
head. Again, one thing may be suggested by
another, as in the line,

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>Behold, the steers</l>
<l>Bring back the plough suspended from the<lb/>
yoke,</l></quote><bibl><hi rend="italics">Ed.</hi> ii. 61</bibl></cit></quote>

from which we infer the approach of night. I am
not sure whether this is permissible to an orator
except in arguments, when it serves as an indication
of some fact. However, this has nothing to do with
the question of style.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="23"/>It is but a short step from <hi rend="italics">synecdoche&egrave;</hi> to <hi rend="italics">metonymy,</hi>
which consists in the substitution of one name for
another, and, as Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">Orat.</hi> xxvii. 93.</note> tells us, is called <hi rend="italics">hypallage</hi>
by the rhetoricians. These devices are employed to
indicate an invention by substituting the name of

<pb id="p.315"/>

the inventor, or a possession by substituting the
name of the possessor. Virgil, for example, writes:<note><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> i. 177.</note>

<quote rend="blockquote">
<quote><l>Ceres by water spoiled,</l></quote></quote>

and Horace:

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>Neptune admitted to the land</l>
<l>Protects the fleets from blasts of Aquilo.</l></quote><bibl><hi rend="italics">A. P.</hi> 63.</bibl></cit></quote>

If, however, the process is reversed, the effect is
harsh.<milestone unit="section" n="24"/> But it is important to enquire to what
extent <hi rend="italics">tropes</hi> of this kind should be employed by
the orator. For though we often hear <quote>Vulcan</quote>
used for fire and to say <hi rend="italics">vario Marte pugnatum est</hi> for
<quote>they fought with varying success</quote> is elegant and
idiomatic, while <hi rend="italics">Venus</hi> is a more decent expression
than <hi rend="italics">coitus,</hi> it would be too bold for the severe style
demanded in the courts to speak of <hi rend="italics">Liber</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Ceres</hi>
when we mean bread and wine. Again, while usage
permits us to substitute that which contains for that
which is contained, as in phrases such as <quote>civilised
cities,</quote> or <quote>a cup was drunk to the lees,</quote> or <quote>a
happy age,</quote><milestone unit="section" n="25"/> the converse procedure would rarely be
ventured on by any save a poet: take, for example,
the phrase:

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>Ucalegon burns next.</l></quote><bibl><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> ii. 311.</bibl></cit></quote>

It is, however, perhaps more permissible to describe
what is possessed by reference to its possessor, as,
for example, to say of a man whose estate is being
squandered, <quote>the man is being eaten up.</quote> Of this
form there are innumerable species.<milestone unit="section" n="26"/> For example,
we say <quote>sixty thousand men were slain by Hannibal
at Cannae,</quote> and speak of <quote>Virgil</quote> when we mean
<quote>Virgil's poems</quote>; again, we say that supplies have

<pb id="p.317"/>

<quote>come,</quote> when they have been <quote>brought,</quote> that a
<quote>sacrilege,</quote> and not a <quote>sacrilegious man</quote> has been
detected, and that a man possesses a knowledge of
<quote>arms,</quote> not of <quote>the art of arms.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="27"/> The type which
indicates cause by effect is common both in poets
and orators. As examples from poetry I may quote:

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>Pale death with equal foot knocks at the poor
man's door</l></quote><bibl>Hor. <hi rend="italics">Od.</hi> I. iv. 13.</bibl></cit></quote>

and

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>There pale diseases dwell and sad old age;</l></quote><bibl><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> vi. 275</bibl></cit></quote>

<quote rend="blockquote">
<l>while the orator will speak of <quote>headlong anger</quote>,</l>
<l><quote>cheerful youth</quote> or <quote>slothful ease</quote>.</l></quote></p>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="28"/>The following type of <hi rend="italics">trope</hi> has also some kinship
with <hi rend="italics">synecdoch&egrave;.</hi> For when I speak of a man's
<quote>looks</quote> instead of his <quote>look,</quote> I use the plural for
the singular, but my aim is not to enable one thing
to be inferred from many (for the sense is clear
enough), but I merely vary the form of the word.
Again, when I call a <quote>gilded roof</quote> a <quote>golden roof,</quote>
I diverge a little from the truth, because gilding
forms only a part of the roof. But to follow out
these points is a task involving too much minute
detail even for a work whose aim is not the
training of an orator.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="20"/><hi rend="italics">Antonomasia,</hi> which substitutes something else for
a proper name, is very common in poets: it may be
done in two ways: by the substitution of an epithet
as equivalent to the name which it replaces, such as
<quote>Tydides,</quote> <quote>Pelides,</quote><note>The son of Tydeus=Diomede, the son of Peleus =
Achilles.</note> or by indicating the most
striking characteristics of an individual, as in the
phrase

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>Father of gods and king of men,</l></quote><bibl><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> i. 65.</bibl></cit></quote>

<pb id="p.319"/>

or from acts clearly indicating the individual, as in
the phrase,

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>The arms which he, the traitor, left</l>
<l>Fixed on the chamber wall.</l></quote><bibl><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> iv. 495. This third example does not correspond
with the twofold division given by <hi rend="italics">utroque</hi> and may be
spurious.</bibl></cit></quote>

This form of <hi rend="italics">trope</hi> is rare in oratory,<milestone unit="section" n="30"/> but is occasionally employed, For although an orator would
not say <quote>Tydides</quote> or <quote>Pelides,</quote> he will speak of
certain definite persons as <quote>the impious parricides,</quote>
while I should have no hesitation in speaking of
Scipio as <quote>the destroyer of Carthage and Numantia,</quote>
or of Cicero as <quote>the prince of Roman orators.</quote>
Cicero himself, at any rate, availed himself of this
licence, as, for example, in the following case: <quote>Your
faults are not many, said the old praeceptor to the
hero,</quote><note><hi rend="italics">Pro Muren.</hi> xxix. 60. The passage continues (a quotation
from some old play) <quote>But you have faults and I can correct
them.</quote> Phoenix is addressing his pupil Achilles.</note> where neither name is given, though both
are clearly understood.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="31"/>On the other hand, <hi rend="italics">onomatopoea,</hi> that is to say, the
creation of a word, although regarded with the
highest approbation by the Greeks, is scarcely permissible to a Roman. It is true that many words
were created in this way by the original founders of
the language, who adapted them to suit the sensation
which they expressed. For instance, <hi rend="italics">mugitus,</hi> lowing,
<hi rend="italics">sibilus,</hi> a hiss, and <hi rend="italics">murmur</hi> owe their origin to this
practice.<milestone unit="section" n="32"/> But to-day we consider that all has been
done that can be done in this line, and do not venture
on fresh creations, in spite of the fact that many
of the words thus formed in antiquity are daily
becoming obsolete. Indeed, we scarcely permit ourselves to use new derivatives, so they are called,
which are formed in various ways from words in
common use, such as <hi rend="italics">Sullaturit,</hi><note>Cic. <hi rend="italics">ad Att.</hi> IX. x. 6.</note> <quote>he wishes to be
a second Sulla,</quote> or <hi rend="italics">proscripturit,</hi> <quote>he wishes to have

<pb id="p.321"/>

a proscription,</quote> while <hi rend="italics">laureati posies,</hi> <quote>laurelled
door-posts,</quote> for <hi rend="italics">lauru coronati,</hi> <quote>crowned with
laurel,</quote> are similar formations.<milestone unit="section" n="33"/> * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * *<note>This passage is too corrupt to admit of emendation or
translation. There seem to be references to <hi rend="italics">vio</hi> for <hi rend="italics">eo</hi> and to
<hi rend="italics">arqtitollens.</hi> for which cp. <hi rend="italics">arquitenens.</hi> Septemntriones can
hardly be selected for censure, as it is not uncommon.</note></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="34"/>These facts make <hi rend="italics">catachresis</hi> (of which <hi rend="italics">abuse</hi> is a
correct translation) all the more necessary. By this
term is meant the practice of adapting the nearest
available term to describe something for which no
actual term exists, as in the line

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>A horse they build by Pallas' art divine,</l></quote><bibl> <hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> II. xv. It is an abuse to say <hi rend="italics">aedficant,</hi> which means
literally "they make a house.</bibl></cit></quote>

or as in the expression found in tragedy,

<quote rend="blockquote">
<quote><l>To Aigialeus</l>
<l>His sire bears funeral offerings,</l></quote><note>Perhaps from the Medus of Pacuvius It is an abuse to
use<hi rend="italics">parental</hi> of funeral offerings made by father to son.</note></quote>

The following examples are of a similar character.<milestone unit="section" n="35"/>
Flasks are called <hi rend="italics">acetabula,</hi><note>Lit. vinegar flasks.</note> whatever they contain,
and caskets <hi rend="italics">pyxides,</hi><note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> made of boxwood.</note> of whatever material they are
made, while <hi rend="italics">parricide</hi> includes the murder of a
mother or a brother. We must be careful to
distinguish between <hi rend="italics">abuse</hi> and <hi rend="italics">metaphor,</hi> since the
former is employed where there is no proper term
available, and the latter when there is another term
available. As for poets, they indulge in the abuse
of words even in cases where proper terms do exist,
and substitute words of somewhat similar meaning.
But this is rare in prose.<milestone unit="section" n="36"/> Some, indeed, would give
the name of <hi rend="italics">catachresis</hi> even to cases such as where
we call temerity valour or prodigality liberality.
I, however, cannot agree with them; for in these

<pb id="p.323"/>

instances word is not substituted for word, but thing
for thing, since no one regards prodigality and liberality as meaning the same, but one man calls certain
actions liberal and another prodigal, although neither
for a moment doubts the difference between the two
qualities.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="37"/>There is but one of the <hi rend="italics">tropes</hi> involving change of
meaning which remains to be discussed, namely,
<hi rend="italics">metalepsis</hi> or <hi rend="italics">transumption,</hi> which provides a transition
from one <hi rend="italics">trope</hi> to another. It is (if we except
comedy) but rarely used in Latin, and is by no means
to be commended, though it is not infrequently
employed by the Greeks, who, for example, call <foreign lang="greek">*xei/rwn</foreign>
the centaur <foreign lang="greek">*(/hsswn</foreign><note><foreign lang="greek">*xei/rwn</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">h(/sswn</foreign> both mean inferior.</note> and substitute the epithet <foreign lang="greek">qoai/</foreign>
(swift) for <foreign lang="greek">o)/ceiai</foreign><note><hi rend="italics">cp. Od.</hi> xv. 298. <foreign lang="greek">*qoo/s</foreign> is used elsewhere to express
sharpness.</note> in referring to sharp-pointed
islands. But who would endure a Roman if he
called Verres <hi rend="italics">sus</hi><note>Verres =boar; Catus=wise.</note> or changed the name of Aelius
Catus to Aelius <hi rend="italics">doctus?</hi><milestone unit="section" n="38"/> It is the nature of <hi rend="italics">metalepsis</hi>
to form a kind of intermediate step between the
term transferred and the thing to which it is transferred, having no meaning in itself, but merely
providing a transition. It is a <hi rend="italics">trope</hi> with which to
claim acquaintance, rather than one which we are
ever likely to require to use. The commonest
example is the following: <hi rend="italics">cano</hi> is a synonym
for <hi rend="italics">canto</hi> and <hi rend="italics">canto</hi><note>In the sense of to repeat.</note> for <hi rend="italics">dico,</hi> therefore <hi rend="italics">cano</hi> is a
synonym for <hi rend="italics">dico,</hi> the intermediate step being provided by <hi rend="italics">canto.</hi><milestone unit="section" n="39"/> We need not waste any more time
over it. I can see no use in it except, as I have
already said, in comedy.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="40"/>The remaining <hi rend="italics">tropes</hi> are employed solely to
adorn and enhance our style without any reference
to the meaning. For the <hi rend="italics">epithet,</hi> of which the correct
translation is <hi rend="italics">appositum,</hi> though some call it <hi rend="italics">sequens,</hi>

<pb id="p.325"/>

is clearly an ornament. Poets employ it with special
frequency and freedom, since for them it is sufficient
that the epithet should suit the word to which it is
applied: consequently we shall not blame them
when they speak of <quote>white teeth</quote> or <quote>liquid
wine.</quote><note><hi rend="italics">Georg.</hi> III. 364.</note> But in oratory an epithet is redundant
unless it has some point. Now it will only have
point when it adds something to the meaning, as for
instance in the following: <quote>O abominable crime, O
hideous lust!</quote><milestone unit="section" n="41"/> But its decorative effect is greatest
when it is metaphorical, as in the phrases <quote>unbridled
greed</quote><note>Cic. in <hi rend="italics">Cat.</hi> I. x. 25.</note> or <quote>those mad piles of masonry.</quote><note><hi rend="italics"> Pro Mil.</hi> xx. 53.</note> The
epithet is generally made into a <hi rend="italics">trope</hi> by the addition
of something to it, as when Virgil speaks of <quote>disgraceful poverty</quote> or <quote>sad old age.</quote><note><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> vi. 276 and 275. Here the addition is <hi rend="italics">metonymy,
turpis</hi> and <hi rend="italics">tristis</hi> both substituting <hi rend="italics">effect</hi> in place of <hi rend="italics">cause:
cp.</hi> &sect; 27.</note> But the nature
of this form of embellishment is such that, while
style is bare and inelegant without any epithets
at all, it is overloaded when a large number are
employed.<milestone unit="section" n="42"/> For then it becomes long-winded and
cumbrous, in fact you might compare it to an army
with as many camp-followers as soldiers, an army, that
is to say, which has doubled its numbers without
doubling its strength. None the less, not merely
single epithets are employed, but we may find a
number of them together, as in the following passage
from Virgil:<note><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> iii. 475. I have translated 476 (<hi rend="italics">cura deum, bis
Pergameis erepte ruinis</hi>) as well to bring out Quintilian's meaning. Quintilian assumes the rest of quotation to be known.</note></p>

<quote rend="blockquote">
<quote><l part="F">Anchises, worthy deigned</l>
<l>Of Venus' glorious bed, [beloved of heaven,</l>
<l>Twice rescued from the wreck of Pergamum.]</l></quote></quote>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="43"/>Be this as it may, two epithets directly attached
to one noun are unbecoming even in verse. There
are some writers who refuse to regard an <hi rend="italics">epithet</hi> as a
<hi rend="italics">trope,</hi> on the ground that it involves no change. It

<pb id="p.327"/>

is not always a <hi rend="italics">trope,</hi> but if separated from the word to
which it belongs, it has a significance of its own and
forms an <hi rend="italics">antonomasia.</hi> For if you say, <quote>The man
who destroyed Numantia and Carthage,</quote> it will
be an <hi rend="italics">antonomasia,</hi> whereas, if you add the word
<quote>Scipio,</quote> the phrase will be an <hi rend="italics">epithet.</hi> An epithet
therefore cannot stand by itself.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="44	"/><hi rend="italics">Allegory,</hi> which is translated in Latin by <hi rend="italics">inversio,</hi>
either presents one thing in words and another in
meaning, or else something absolutely opposed to the
meaning of the words. The first type is generally produced by a series of metaphors. Take as an example:

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>O ship, new waves will bear thee back to sea.</l>
<l>What dost thou? Make the haven, come what may,</l></quote> <bibl>Hor. Od. i. xiv. 1.</bibl></cit></quote>

and the rest of the ode, in which Horace represents
the state under the semblance of a ship, the civil
wars as tempests, and peace and good-will as the
haven.<milestone unit="section" n="45"/> Such, again, is the claim of Lucretius:<note><hi rend="italics">Lucr.</hi> IV. 1.</note>

<quote rend="blockquote">
<quote><l>Pierian fields I range untrod by man,</l></quote></quote>

and such again the passage where Virgil says,

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>But now</l>
<l>A mighty length of plain we have travelled o'er;</l>
<l>'Tis time to loose our horses' steaming necks.</l></quote><bibl>Georg. II. 541.</bibl></cit></quote></p>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="46"/>On the other hand, in the Bucolics<note><hi rend="italics">Buc.</hi> IX. 7.</note> he introduces
an allegory without any metaphor:

<quote rend="blockquote">
<quote><l>Truth, I had heard</l>
<l>Your loved Menalcas by his songs had saved</l>
<l>All those fair acres, where the hills begin</l>
<l>To sink and droop their ridge with easy slope</l>
<l>Down to the waterside and that old beech</l>
<l>With splintered crest.</l></quote></quote></p>

<pb id="p.329"/>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="47"/>For in this passage, with the exception of the
proper name, the words bear no more than their
literal meaning. But the name does not simply denote the shepherd Menalcas, but is a pseudonym for
Virgil himself. Oratory makes frequent use of such
allegory, but generally with this modification, that
there is an admixture of plain speaking. We get
allegory pure and unadulterated in the following
passage of Cicero:<note>From an unknown speech.</note> <quote>What I marvel at and complain
of is this, that there should exist any man so set on
destroying his enemy as to scuttle the ship on which
he himself is sailing.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="48"/> The following is an example
of the commonest type, namely, the mixed allegory:<note><hi rend="italics">Pro Mil.</hi> ii, 5.</note>
<quote>I always thought that Milo would have other storms
and tempests to weather, at least in the troubled
waters of political meetings.</quote> Had he not added
the words <quote>at least in the troubled waters of political meetings,</quote> we should have had pure allegory:
their addition, however, converted it into a mixed
allegory. In this type of allegory the ornamental
element is provided by the metaphorical words and
the meaning is indicated by those which are used
literally.<milestone unit="section" n="49"/> But far the most ornamental effect is produced by the artistic admixture of simile, metaphor
and allegory, as in the following example:<note><hi rend="italics">Pro Mur.</hi> xvii. 35.</note> <quote>What
strait, what tide-race, think you, is full of so many
conflicting motions or vexed by such a variety of
eddies, waves and fluctuations, as confuse our popular
elections with their wild ebb and flow? The passing
of one day, or the interval of a single night, will
often throw everything into confusion, and one little
breath of rumour will sometimes turn the whole
trend of opinion.<milestone unit="section" n="50"/></quote> For it is all-important to follow
the principle illustrated by this passage and never to

<pb id="p.331"/>

mix your metaphors. But there are many who, after
beginning with a tempest, will end with a fire or a
falling house, with the result that they produce a
hideously incongruous effect.<milestone unit="section" n="51"/> For the rest, allegory
is often used by men of little ability and in the
conversation of everyday life. For those hackneyed
phrases of forensic pleading, <quote>to fight hand to hand,</quote>
<quote>to attack the throat,</quote> or <quote>to let blood</quote> are all of
them allegorical, although they do not strike the
attention: for it is novelty and change that please
in oratory, and what is unexpected always gives special
delight. Consequently we have thrown all restraint
to the wind in such matters, and have destroyed the
charm of language by the extravagant efforts which
we have made to attain it.<milestone unit="section" n="52"/> Illustrative examples also
involve allegory if not preceded by an explanation;
for there are numbers of sayings available for use like
the <quote>Dionysius is at Corinth,</quote><note>The allusion must be to the fact that Dionysius II,
tyrant of Syracuse, on his expulsion from the throne,
migrated to Corinth and set up as a schoolmaster. Its
application is uncertain, but it would obviously be a way of
saying <quote>How are the mighty fallen I</quote></note> which is such a
favourite with the Greeks. When, however, an allegory
is too obscure, we call it a riddle: such riddles are,
in my opinion, to be regarded as blemishes, in view of
the fact that lucidity is a virtue; nevertheless they
are used by poets, as, for example, by Virgil<note><hi rend="italics">Ecl.</hi> iii. 104; the solution is lost.</note> in the
following lines:

<quote rend="blockquote">
<quote><l>Say in what land, and if thou tell me true,</l>
<l>I'll hold thee as Apollo's oracle,</l>
<l>Three ells will measure all the arch of heaven.</l></quote></quote>

Even orators sometimes use them,<milestone unit="section" n="53"/> as when Caelius<note>The references are to the licentious character of Clodia.
<hi rend="italics">Coa</hi> was probably intended to suggest <hi rend="italics">coitus,</hi> while <hi rend="italics">nola</hi> is best
derived from <hi rend="italics">nolle,</hi> and is to be regarded as the opposite of
<hi rend="italics">coa.</hi></note>
speaks of the <quote>Clytemnestra who sold her favours
for a farthing, who was a Coan in the dining-room
and a Nolan in her bedroom.</quote> For although we
know the answers, and although they were better
known at the time when the words were uttered,

<pb id="p.333"/>

they are riddles for all that; and other riddles are,
after all, intelligible if you can get someone to explain
them.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="54"/>On the other hand, that class of allegory in which
the meaning is contrary to that suggested by the
words, involve an element of irony, or, as our
rhetoricians call it, <hi rend="italics">illusio.</hi> This is made evident to
the understanding either by the delivery, the character of the speaker or the nature of the subject.
For if any one of these three is out of keeping with
the words, it at once becomes clear that the intention of the speaker is other than what he actually
says In the majority of <hi rend="italics">tropes</hi> it is, however,<milestone unit="section" n="55"/>
important to bear in mind not merely what is said,
but about whom it is said, since what is said may
in another context be literally true. It is permissible to censure with counterfeited praise and
praise under a pretence of blame. The following will
serve as an example of the first.<note>Cic. <hi rend="italics">Pro Cluent.</hi> xxxiii. 91.</note> <quote>Since Gaius
Verres, the urban praetor, being a man of energy and
blameless character, had no record in his register of
this substitution of this man for another on the panel.</quote>
As an example of the reverse process we may take
the following:<note><hi rend="italics">cp. &sect;</hi> 20.</note> <quote>We are regarded as orators and
have imposed on the people.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="56"/> Sometimes, again,
we may speak in mockery when we say the opposite
of what we desire to be understood, as in Cicero's
denunciation of Clodius<note>From the lost speech <hi rend="italics">in Clodium et Curionem.</hi></note>: <quote>Believe me, your well known integrity has cleared you of all blame, your
modesty has saved you, your past life has been your
salvation.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="57"/> Further, we may employ <hi rend="italics">allegory,</hi> and
disguise bitter taunts in gentle words I y way of wit,
or we may indicate our meaning by saying exactly
the contrary or. . .<note>The passage is hopelessly corrupt. The concluding
portion of the sentence must have referred to the use of
proverbs, of which it may have contained an example. This
is clear from the next sentence. Sarcasm, urbane wit and
contradiction are covered by the first three clauses, but there
has been no allusion to proverbs such as <foreign lang="greek">paroimi/a</foreign> demands.</note> If the Greek names for these

<pb id="p.335"/>

methods are unfamiliar to any of my readers, I would
remind him that they are <foreign lang="greek">sarkasmo/s, a)stei+smo/s, a)nti/frasis</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">paroimi/a</foreign> (sarcasm, urbane wit, contradiction and proverbs).<milestone unit="section" n="58"/> There are, however, some
writers who deny that these are species of <hi rend="italics">allegory,</hi>
and assert that they are actually <hi rend="italics">tropes</hi> in themselves:
for they argue shrewdly that allegory involves an
element of obscurity, whereas in all these cases our
meaning is perfectly obvious. To this may be added
the fact that when a <hi rend="italics">genus</hi> is divided into <hi rend="italics">species,</hi> it
ceases to have any peculiar properties of its own: for
example, we may divide tree into its species, pine,
olive, cypress, etc., leaving it no properties of its own,
whereas allegory always has some property peculiar
to itself. The only explanation of this fact is that
it is itself a species. But this, of course, is a matter
of indifference to those that use it.<milestone unit="section" n="59"/> To these the
Greeks add <foreign lang="greek">mukthrismo/s</foreign> or mockery under the
thinnest of disguises.</p>
<p>When we use a number of words to describe something for which one, or at any rate only a few words
of description would suffice, it is called <hi rend="italics">periphrasis,</hi>
that is, a circuitous mode of speech. It is sometimes
necessary, being of special service when it conceals
something which would be indecent, if expressed in
so many words: compare the phrase <quote>To meet the
demands of nature</quote> from Sallust.<note>Presumably from the Histories.</note><milestone unit="section" n="60"/> But at times it
is employed solely for decorative effect, a practice
most frequent among the poets:

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l part="F">Now was the time</l>
<l>When the first sleep to weary mortals comes</l>
<l>Stealing its way, the sweetest boon of heaven.</l></quote><bibl><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> ii. 268.</bibl></cit></quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="61"/>Still it is far from uncommon even in oratory, though

<pb id="p.337"/>

in such cases it is always used with greater restraint.
For whatever might have been expressed with greater
brevity, but is expanded for purposes of ornament, is
<hi rend="italics">a periphrasis,</hi> to which we give the name <hi rend="italics">circumlocution,</hi>
though it is a term scarcely suitable to describe one
of the virtues of oratory. But it is only called <hi rend="italics">periphrasis</hi> so long as it produces a decorative effect:
when it passes into excess, it is known as <hi rend="italics">perissology:</hi>
for whatever is not a help, is a positive hindrance.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="62"/>Again, <hi rend="italics">hyperbaton,</hi> that is, the transposition of a
word, is often demanded by the structure of the
sentence and the claims of elegance, and is consequently counted among the ornaments of style.
For our language would often be harsh, rough, limp
or disjointed, if the words were always arranged in
their natural order and attached each to each just
as they occur, despite the fact that there is no real
bond of union. Consequently some words require
to be postponed, others to be anticipated, each
being set in its appropriate place.<milestone unit="section" n="63"/> For we are like
those who build a wall of unhewn stone: we cannot
hew or polish our words in order to make them fit
more compactly, and so we must take them as they
are and choose suitable positions for them.<milestone unit="section" n="64"/> Further,
it is impossible to make our prose rhythmical except
by artistic alterations in the order of words, and
the reason why those four words in which Plato<note>At the beginning of the <hi rend="italics">Repiblic.</hi> <foreign lang="greek">kate/bhn xfe\s ei)s
*peiraia=.</foreign></note>
in the noblest of his works states that he had gone
down to the Piraeus were found written in a number
of different orders upon his wax tablets, was simply
that he desired to make the rhythm as perfect as
possible.<milestone unit="section" n="65"/> When, however, the transposition is confined to two words only, it is called <hi rend="italics">anastrophe,</hi> that
is, a reversal of order. This occurs in everyday

<pb id="p.339"/>

speech in <hi rend="italics">mecum</hi> and <hi rend="italics">secure,</hi> while in orators and
historians we meet with it in the phrase <hi rend="italics">quibus de
rebus.</hi> It is the transposition of a word to some
distance from its original place, in order to secure
an ornamental effect, that is strictly called <hi rend="italics">hyperbaton:</hi> the following passage will provide an example:
animadverti, indices, omnem accusatoris orationenm in duas
<hi rend="italics">divisam esse partes.</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Cic. pro Cluent.</hi> i. 1.</note> (<quote>I noted, gentlemen, that the
speech of the accuser was divided into two parts.</quote>)
In this case the strictly correct order would be <hi rend="italics">in duas
partes divisam esse,</hi> but this would have been harsh
and ugly.<milestone unit="section" n="66"/> The poets even go so far as to secure
this effect by the division of words, as in the line:

<quote rend="blockquote">
<l>Hyperboreo septem subiecta trioni<note><hi rend="italics">Georg.</hi> iii. 381.</note></l>
<l>(<quote>Under the Hyperborean Wain</quote>),</l></quote>

a licence wholly inadmissible in oratory. Still there
is good reason for calling such a transposition a <hi rend="italics">trope,</hi>
since the meaning is not complete until the two words
have been put together.<milestone unit="section" n="67"/> On the other hand, when
the transposition makes no alteration in the sense, and
merely produces a variation in the structure, it is rather
to be called a <hi rend="italics">verbal figure,</hi> as indeed many authorities
have held. Of the faults resulting from long or confused <hi rend="italics">hyperbata</hi> have spoken in the appropriate place.<note>VIII. ii. 14.</note></p>
<p>I have kept <hi rend="italics">hyperbole</hi> to the last, on the ground of
its boldness. It means an elegant straining of the
truth, and may be employed indifferently for exaggeration or attenuation. It can be used in various
ways.<milestone unit="section" n="68"/> We may say more than the actual facts, as
when Cicero says,<note><hi rend="italics">Phil.</hi> II. xxv. 63.</note> "He vomited and filled his lap
and the whole tribunal with fragments of food, or
when Virgil speaks of

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>win rocks that threaten heaven.</l></quote><bibl><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> i. 162.</bibl></cit></quote>

<pb id="p.341"/>

Again, we may exalt our theme by the use of simile,
as in the phrase:

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>Thou wouldst have deemed</l>
<l>That Cyclad isles uprooted swam the deep.</l></quote><bibl><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> viii. 691.</bibl></cit></quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="69"/>Or we may produce the same result by introducing
a comparison, as in the phrase:

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>Swifter than the levin's wings;</l></quote><bibl><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> v. 319.</bibl></cit></quote>

or by the use of indications, as in the lines:

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>She would fly</l>
<l>Even o'er the tops of the unsickled corn,</l>
<l>Nor as she ran would bruise the tender ears.</l></quote><bibl><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> vii. 808.</bibl></cit></quote>

Or we may employ a metaphor, as the verb to <hi rend="italics">fly</hi> is
employed in the passage just quoted.<milestone unit="section" n="70"/> Sometimes,
again, one <hi rend="italics">hyperbole</hi> may be heightened by the
addition of another, as when Cicero in denouncing
Antony says:<note><hi rend="italics"> Phil.</hi> II. xxvii. 67.</note> <quote>What Charybdis was ever so
voracious? Charybdis, do I say? Nay, if Charybdis
ever existed, she was but a single monster. By
heaven, even Ocean's self, methinks, could scarce
have engulfed so many things, so widely scattered
in such distant places, in such a twinkling of the
eye.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="71"/> I think, too, that I am right in saying that
I noted a brilliant example of the same kind in the
Hymns<note>A lost work.</note> of Pindar, the prince of lyric poets. For
when he describes the onslaught made by Hercules
upon the Meropes, the legendary inhabitants of the
island of Cos, he speaks of the hero as like not to
fire, winds or sea, but to the thunderbolt, making
the latter the only true equivalent of his speed and
power, the former being treated as quite inadequate.
<milestone unit="section" n="72"/>Cicero has imitated his method in the following

<pb id="p.343"/>

passage from the Verrines:<note>v. vi. 145.</note> <quote>After long lapse of
years the Sicilians saw dwelling in their midst, not
a second Dionysius or Phalaris (for that island has
produced many a cruel tyrant in years gone by), but
a new monster with all the old ferocity once familiar
to those regions. For, to my thinking, neither Scylla
nor Charybdis were ever such foes as he to the ships
that sailed those same narrow seas.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="73"/> The methods
of hyperbole by attenuation are the same in number.
Compare the Virgilian<note><hi rend="italics">Ecl.</hi> iii. 103. Describing a flock of starved sheep.</note>

<quote rend="blockquote"><l>Scarce cling they to their bones,</l></quote>

or the lines from a humorous work<note>Unknown.</note> of Cicero's,

<quote rend="blockquote">
<quote><l>Fundum Vetto vocat quem possit mittere funda;</l>
<l part="M">Ni tamen exciderit, qua cava funda patet.</l></quote></quote>

<quote rend="blockquote"><quote>Vetto gives the name of farm to an estate which
might easily be hurled from a sling, though it
might well fall through the hole in the hollow
sling, so small is it.</quote></quote>

But even here a certain proportion must be observed.
For although every <hi rend="italics">hyperbole</hi> involves the incredible,
it must not go too far in this direction, which
provides the easiest road to extravagant affectation.
<milestone unit="section" n="74"/>I shrink from recording the faults to which the lack
of this sense of proportion has given rise, more
especially as they are so well known and obvious.
It is enough to say that <hi rend="italics">hyperbole</hi> lies, though
without any intention to deceive. We must therefore be all the more careful to consider how far we
may go in exaggerating facts which our audience
may refuse to believe. Again, <hi rend="italics">hyperbole</hi> will often
cause a laugh. If that was what the orator desired,

<pb id="p.345"/>

we may give him credit for wit; otherwise we can
only call him a fool.<milestone unit="section" n="75"/> <hi rend="italics">Hyperbole</hi> is employed even
by peasants and uneducated persons, for the good
reason that everybody has an innate passion for
exaggeration or attenuation of actual facts, and no
one is ever contented with the simple truth. But
such disregard of truth is pardonable, for it does not
involve the definite assertion of the thing that is not.
<hi rend="italics">Hyperbole</hi> is, moreover, a virtue,<milestone unit="section" n="76"/> when the subject
on which we have to speak is abnormal. For we are
allowed to amplify, when the magnitude of the facts
passes all words, and in such circumstances our
language will be more effective if it goes beyond
the truth than if it falls short of it. However, I
have said enough on this topic, since I have already
dealt with it in my work on the causes of the decline
of oratory.</p></div1>

<pb id="p.349"/>

<div1 type="book" n="9"><head>Book IX</head>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In my last book I spoke of <hi rend="italics">tropes.</hi> I now come
to<hi rend="italics">figures,</hi> called <foreign lang="greek">sxh/mata</foreign> in Greek, a topic which is
naturally and closely connected with the preceding.
<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>For many authors have considered <hi rend="italics">figures</hi> identical
with <hi rend="italics">tropes,</hi> because whether it be that the latter
derive their name from having a certain form or from
the fact that they effect alterations in language (a
view which has also led to their being styled <hi rend="italics">motions</hi>),
it must be admitted that both these features are
found in <hi rend="italics">figures</hi> as well. Their employment is also
the same. For they add force and charm to our
matter. There are some again who call <hi rend="italics">tropes figures,</hi>
Artorius Proculus among them.<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Further the resemblance between the two is so close that it is not easy
to distinguish between them. For although certain
kinds differ, while retaining a general resemblance
(since both involve a departure from the simple and
straightforward method of expression coupled with
a certain rhetorical excellence), on the other hand
some are distinguished by the narrowest possible
dividing line: for example, while <hi rend="italics">irony</hi> belongs to
<hi rend="italics">figures of thought</hi> just as much as to <hi rend="italics">tropes,</hi><note>See IX. ii. 44.</note> <hi rend="italics"> periphrasis,
hyperbaton</hi> and <hi rend="italics">onomatopoea</hi><note>VIII. vi. 59 <hi rend="italics">sqq.,</hi> 62, 31 respectively.</note> have been ranked by
distinguished authors as <hi rend="italics">figures of speech</hi> rather than
<hi rend="italics">tropes.</hi></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>It is therefore all the more necessary to point out
the distinction between the two. The name of <hi rend="italics">trope</hi>

<pb id="p.351"/>

is applied to the transference of expressions from
their natural and principal signification to another,
with a view to the embellishment of style or, as the
majority of grammarians define it, the transference
of words and phrases from the place which is strictly
theirs to another to which they do not properly
belong. A <hi rend="italics">figure,</hi> on the other hand, as is clear from
the name itself, is the term employed when we give
our language a conformation other than the obvious
and ordinary.<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Therefore the substitution of one
word for another is placed among <hi rend="italics">tropes,</hi> as for
example in the case of <hi rend="italics">metaphor, metonymy, antonomasia, metalepsis, synecdoch&egrave;, catachresis, allegory</hi><note>See VIII. vi.</note> and,
as a rule, <hi rend="italics">hyperbole,</hi> which may, of course, be concerned either with words or things. <hi rend="italics">Onomatopoea</hi> is
the creation of a word and therefore involves substitution for the words which we should use but
for such creation.<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Again although <hi rend="italics">periphrasis</hi> often
includes the actual word whose place it supplies, it
still uses a number of words in place of one. The
<hi rend="italics">epithet</hi> as a rule involves an element of <hi rend="italics">antonomasia</hi><note>VIII. vi. 29 and 46.</note>
and consequently becomes a <hi rend="italics">trope</hi> on account of this
affinity. <hi rend="italics">Hyperbaton</hi> is a change of order and for
this reason many exclude it from <hi rend="italics">tropes.</hi> None the
less it transfers a word or part of a word from its
own place to another.<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> None of these can be called
<hi rend="italics">figures.</hi> For a <hi rend="italics">figure</hi> does not necessarily involve
any alteration either of the order or the strict sense
of words. As regards <hi rend="italics">irony,</hi> I shall show elsewhere<note>IX. ii. 44.</note>
how in some of its forms it is a <hi rend="italics">trope,</hi> in others a
<hi rend="italics">figure.</hi> For I admit that the name is common to
both and am aware of the complicated and minute
discussions to which it has given rise. They, however, have no bearing on my present task. For it

<pb id="p.353"/>

makes no difference by which name either is called, so
long as its stylistic value is apparent, since the meaning of things is not altered by a change of name.
For just as men remain the same,<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> even though they
adopt a new name, so these artifices will produce
exactly the same effect, whether they are styled
<hi rend="italics">tropes</hi> or <hi rend="italics">figures,</hi> since their values lie not in their
names, but in their effect. Similarly it makes no
difference whether we call a <hi rend="italics">basis</hi> conjectural or
negative, or concerned with fact or substance,<note>See III. vi. 15, 39.</note> provided always that we know that the subject of
enquiry is the same.<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> It is best therefore in dealing
with these topics to adopt the generally accepted
terms and to understand the actual thing, by whatever name it is called. But we must note the fact
that <hi rend="italics">trope</hi> and <hi rend="italics">figure</hi> are often combined in the
expression of the same thought, since figures are
introduced just as much by the metaphorical as by
the literal use of words.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>There is, however, a considerable difference of
opinion among authors as to the meaning of the
name,<note>i.e. figure.</note> the number of <hi rend="italics">genera</hi> and the nature and
number of the <hi rend="italics">species</hi> into which figures may be
divided. The first point for consideration is, therefore, what is meant by a <hi rend="italics">figure.</hi> For the term is
used in two senses. In the first it is applied to any
form in which thought is expressed, just as it is to
bodies which, whatever their composition, must have
some shape.<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> In the second and special sense, in
which it is called a <hi rend="italics">schema,</hi> it means a rational change
in meaning or language from the ordinary and simple
form, that is to say, a change analogous to that
involved by sitting, lying down on something or
looking back. Consequently when a student tends

<pb id="p.355"/>

to continuous or at any rate excessive use of the
same cases, tenses, rhythms or even feet, we are in
the habit of instructing him to vary his <hi rend="italics">figures</hi> with
a view to the avoidance of monotony.<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> In so doing
we speak as if every kind of language possessed a
<hi rend="italics">figure:</hi> for example <hi rend="italics">cursitare</hi> and <hi rend="italics">lectitare</hi><note>Frequentative forms of <hi rend="italics">curro</hi> (run) and <hi rend="italics">lego</hi> (read).</note> are said
to have the same figure, that is to say, they are
identical in formation. Therefore in the first and
common sense of the word everything is expressed
by <hi rend="italics">figures.</hi> If we are content with this view, there
is good reason for the opinion expressed by Apollodorus (if we may trust the statement of Caecilius on
this point) to the effect that he found the rules laid
down in this connexion quite incomprehensible.<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> If,
on the other hand, the name is to be applied to
certain attitudes, or I might say gestures of language,
we must interpret <hi rend="italics">schema</hi> in the sense of that which
is poetically or rhetorically altered from the simple
and obvious method of expression. It will then be
true to distinguish between the style which is devoid
of figures (or <foreign lang="greek">a)sxhma/tistos</foreign>) and that which is adorned
with figures (or <foreign lang="greek">e)sxhmatisme/nh,</foreign>).<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> But Zoilus narrowed
down the definition, since he restricted the term
<hi rend="italics">schema</hi> to cases when the speaker pretends to say
something other than that which he actually does
say. 1 know that this view meets with common
acceptance: it is, in fact, for this reason that we speak
<hi rend="italics">of figured</hi> controversial themes, of which I shall
shortly speak.<note>ix. ii. 65.</note> We shall then take a <hi rend="italics">figure</hi> to mean
a form of expression to which a new aspect is given
by art.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="15"/>Some writers have held that there is only one
kind of <hi rend="italics">figure,</hi> although they differ as regards the
reasons which lead them to adopt this view. For

<pb id="p.357"/>

some of them, on the ground that a change of words
causes a corresponding change in the sense, assert
that all <hi rend="italics">figures</hi> are concerned with words, while others
hold that <hi rend="italics">figures</hi> are concerned solely with the sense,
on the ground that words are adapted to things.
Both these views are obviously quibbling.<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> For the
same things are often put in different ways and
the sense remains unaltered though the words are
changed, while a <hi rend="italics">figure of thought</hi> may include several
<hi rend="italics">figures of speech.</hi> For the former lies in the conception, the latter in the expression of our thought.
The two are frequently combined, however, as in
the following passage: <quote>Now, Dolabella, [I have
no pity] either for you or for your children</quote>:<note>Cic. <hi rend="italics">Verr.</hi> I. xxx. 77. <hi rend="italics">iam iam</hi> is a figure, as being a
reduplication, and <hi rend="italics">liberum</hi> as being a contraction.</note> for
the device by which he turns from the judges to
Dolabella is a <hi rend="italics">figure of thought,</hi> while <hi rend="italics">iam iam (</hi> <quote>now</quote>)
and <hi rend="italics">liberum</hi> (<quote>your children</quote>) are <hi rend="italics">figures of speech.</hi></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="17"/>It is, however, to the best of my knowledge,
generally agreed by the majority of authors that
there are two classes of <hi rend="italics">figure,</hi> namely <hi rend="italics">figures of
thought,</hi> that is of the mind, feeling or conceptions,
since all these terms are used, and <hi rend="italics">figures of speech,</hi>
that is of words, diction, expression, language or
style: the name by which they are known varies,
but mere terminology is a matter of indifference.
Cornelius Celsus,<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> however, to <hi rend="italics">figures of thought</hi> and
<hi rend="italics">speech</hi> would add those produced by <quote>glosses</quote>;<note>See IV. ii. 88. <hi rend="italics">color</hi> = <quote>the particular aspect given to a
case by a skilful <hi rend="italics">representation of the facts</hi>&mdash;the 'gloss' or
varnish put on them by either the accused or the accuser.</quote></note> but
he has merely been led astray by an excessive passion
for novelty. For who can suppose that so learned
a man was ignorant of the fact that <quote>glosses</quote>
and <quote>reflexions</quote> both come under the heading of
thought? We may therefore conclude that, like
language itself, figures are necessarily concerned with
thought and with words.</p>

<pb id="p.359"/>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="19"/>As, however, in the natural course of things we
conceive ideas before we express them, I must take
<hi rend="italics">figures of thought</hi> first. Their utility is at once great
and manifold, and is revealed with the utmost clearness in every product of oratory. For although it
may seem that proof is infinitesimally affected by
<hi rend="italics">the figures</hi> employed, none the less those same <hi rend="italics">figures</hi>
lend credibility to our arguments and steal their
way secretly into the minds of the judges.<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> For just
as in sword-play it is easy to see, parry, and ward off'
direct blows and simple and straightforward thrusts,
while side-strokes and feints are less easy to observe
and the task of the skilful swordsman is to give the
impression that his design is quite other than it
actually is, even so the oratory in which there is
no guile fights by sheer weight and impetus alone;
on the other hand, the fighter who feints and varies
his assault is able to attack flank or back as he will,
to lure his opponent's weapons from their guard and
to outwit him by a slight inclination of the body.
Further,<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> there is no more effective method of exciting
the emotions than an apt use of figures. For if the
expression of brow, eyes and hands has a powerful
effect in stirring the passions, how much more
effective must be the aspect of our style itself when
composed to produce the result at which we aim?
But, above all, <hi rend="italics">figures</hi> serve to commend what we
say to those that hear us, whether we seek to win
approval for our character as pleaders, or to win
favour for the cause which we plead, to relieve
monotony by variation of our language, or to indicate
our meaning in the safest or most seemly way.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="22"/>But before I proceed to demonstrate what <hi rend="italics">figures</hi>
best suit the different circumstances, I must

<pb id="p.361"/>

point out that their number is far from being as
great as some authorities make out. For I am not
in the least disturbed by the various names which
the Greeks more especially are so fond of inventing.
First of all, then,<milestone unit="section" n="23"/> I must repudiate the views of those
who hold that there are as many types of <hi rend="italics">figure</hi>
as there are kinds of emotion, on the ground, not
that emotions are not qualities of the mind, but that
a figure, in its strict, not its general sense, is not
simply the expression of anything you choose to
select. Consequently the expression in words of
anger, grief, pity, fear, confidence or contempt is
not a <hi rend="italics">figure,</hi> any more than persuasion, threats,
entreaty or excuse.<milestone unit="section" n="24"/> But superficial observers are
deceived by the fact that they find <hi rend="italics">figures</hi> in all
passages dealing with such themes, and select
examples of them from speeches; whereas in reality
there is no department of oratory which does not
admit such <hi rend="italics">figures.</hi> But it is one thing to admit
<hi rend="italics">i>figure</hi> and another to be a <hi rend="italics">figure;</hi> I am not going
to be frightened out of repeating the term with some
frequency in my attempt to make the facts clear.
My opponents will, I know,<milestone unit="section" n="25"/> direct my attention to
special figures employed in expressing anger, in
entreating for mercy, or appealing to pity, but it
does not follow that expressions of anger, appeals
to pity or entreaties for mercy are in themselves
<hi rend="italics">figures.</hi> Cicero, it is true, includes all ornaments of
oratory under this head, and in so doing adopts, as
it seems to me, a middle course. For he does not
hold that all forms of expression are to be regarded
as <hi rend="italics">figures,</hi> nor, on the other hand, would he restrict
the term merely to those expressions whose form
varies from ordinary use. But he regards as

<pb id="p.363"/>

figurative all those expressions which are especially
striking and most effective in stirring the emotions
of the audience. He sets forth this view in two of
his works, and that my readers may have the
opportunity of realising the judgment of so high
an authority, I subjoin what he says <hi rend="italics">verbatim.</hi><note>The two works are the <hi rend="italics">Orator</hi> (xxxix. 134 <hi rend="italics">sqq.</hi>)&mdash;<hi rend="italics">see</hi> sect.
and the <hi rend="italics">de</hi> (<hi rend="italics">Oratore</hi> III. lii. 201, which is here quoted.</note><milestone unit="section" n="36"/></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="26"/>In the third book of the <hi rend="italics">de Oratore</hi> we find the
following words: <quote>As regards the composition of
continuous speech, as soon as we have acquired
the smoothness of structure and rhythm of which
I have spoken, we must proceed to lend brilliance to our style by frequent embellishments
both of thought and words.<milestone unit="section" n="27"/> For great effect may
be produced by dwelling on a single point, and by
setting forth our facts in such a striking manner
that they seem to be placed before the eyes as
vividly as if they were taking place in our actual
presence. This is especially effective in stating a
case or for the purpose of illuminating and amplifying the facts in course of statement, with a view to
making our audience regard the point which we
amplify as being as important as speech can make
it.<milestone unit="section" n="28"/> On the other hand, as opposed to this procedure
we may often give a rapid summary, suggest more
than is actually said, may express ourselves tersely
in short, clean-cut sentences and disparage, or, what
is much the same, mock our opponent in a manner
not inconsistent with the precepts given us by Caesar.<note><hi rend="italics"> de Or.</hi> ii. 261 <hi rend="italics">sqq.,</hi> 269 <hi rend="italics">sqq.</hi> Iulius Caesar <hi rend="italics">Strabo loq.</hi></note>
Or we may employ digressions and then, after thus
delighting our audience, make a neat and elegant
return to our main theme. We may set forth in
advance what we propose to say, mark off the topics
already treated from those which are to follow,
return to our point, repeat it and draw our formal

<pb id="p.365"/>

conclusions.<milestone unit="section" n="29"/> Again, with a view to augmenting
or attenuating the force of some point, we may
exaggerate and overstate the truth: we may ask
questions, or, what is much the same, enquire of
others and set forth our own opinion. There is also
available the device of dissimulation, when we say
one thing and mean another, the most effective of
all means of stealing into the minds of men and a
most attractive device, so long as we adopt a conversational rather than a controversial tone.<milestone unit="section" n="30"/> Hesitation may be expressed between two alternatives,
our statement may be distributed in groups or we
may correct ourselves, either before or after we have
said something or when we repel some allegation
against ourselves. We may defend ourselves by
anticipation to secure the success of some point
which we propose to make or may transfer the blame
for some action to another. We may confer with
our audience, admitting them as it were into our
deliberations, may describe the life and character
of persons either with or without mention of their
names, a device which is one of the greatest embellishments of oratory and specially adapted to
conciliate the feelings, as also frequently to excite
them.<milestone unit="section" n="31"/> Again by the introduction of fictitious
personages we may bring into play the most forcible
form of exaggeration. We may describe the results
likely to follow some action, introduce topics to lead
our hearers astray, move them to mirth or anticipate
the arguments of our opponent. Comparisons and
examples may be introduced, both of them most
effective methods; we may divide, interrupt, contrast,
suppress, commend.<milestone unit="section" n="32"/> Our language may be free or
even unbridled with a view to heighten our effects,

<pb id="p.367"/>

while anger, reproach, promises that we shall prove
our case, entreaty, supplication, slight deviations
from our proposed course (which must be distinguished from the longer digressions mentioned
above), exculpation, conciliation, personal attacks,
wishes and execrations are all of value.<milestone unit="section" n="33"/> The above
include practically all the devices of thought which
may be employed for the adornment of our speech.
As regards diction, this may either be employed like
weapons for menace and attack, or handled merely
for the purpose of display. For example, sometimes
the repetition of words will produce an impression
of force, at other times of grace. Again, slight
changes and alterations may be made in words,
the same word may be repeated sometimes at the
beginning of a sentence and sometimes at the end,
or the sentence may be made to open and close with
the same phrase.<note>This appears to be the meaning of <hi rend="italics">impetus</hi> and <hi rend="italics">concursio,</hi>
but there can be no certainty. The long list of technical
terms which follows provides almost insuperable difficulty
to the translator, since many can neither be translated nor
even paraphrased with certainty. Quintilian himself is not
always certain as to their meaning: see ix. iii. 90. For
<hi rend="italics">adiunctio,</hi> see Q's remarks on <foreign lang="greek">e)pezeugme/non</foreign> Ix. iii. 62. <hi rend="italics">conversio</hi>
(&sect; 33) is illustrated by <hi rend="italics">Auct. ad Herenn.</hi> iv. 19. by <hi rend="italics">Poenaspopulus
Romanus iustitia vicit, armis vicit, liberalitate vicit,</hi> while in
&sect; 34 it is a form of antithesis (<hi rend="italics">e. g.</hi> <quote>eat to live, not live to
eat</quote>). For <hi rend="italics">revocatio verbi,</hi> see ix. iii. 44; for <hi rend="italics">transgressio</hi> VII.
vi. 62, for <hi rend="italics">contrarium</hi> and <hi rend="italics">immutatio</hi> see ix. iii. 90. <hi rend="italics">declinatio</hi>
is explained by Cicero in <hi rend="italics">Orator</hi> 135 as occurring when we
pass something by and show why we do so. <hi rend="italics">reprehensio</hi>
means correction of the expression as opposed to the correction of thought referred to above. For the obscure and
perhaps corrupt clause <hi rend="italics">quod de singulis rebus propositis
duetum refertur ad singula</hi> see on IX. iii. 83. <hi rend="italics">dubitatio</hi> is
the hesitation between two expressions in contrast to the
hesitation between two alternative conceptions. <hi rend="italics">alia crrectio</hi> cannot be clearly distinguished from <hi rend="italics">reprehensio;</hi> but
cp. IX. ii. 60, <hi rend="italics">paenitentia dicti. dissipatio</hi> is illustrated in
IX. iii. 39. <hi rend="italics">diiunctio is</hi> not to be confused with the <hi rend="italics">disiunctio</hi>
of IX. iii. 45. Here it refers to the conclusion of each separate
proposition with its appropriate verb, and is the opposite of
<hi rend="italics">adiunctio</hi> (above). The meaning of <hi rend="italics">relatio</hi> is unknown even
to Quintilian (see ix. iii. 97), while he is doubtful as to the
meaning of <hi rend="italics">circumscriptio</hi>(see x. iii. 90);perhaps=periphrasis.</note> One verb may be made to serve
the purpose of a number of clauses, our words may
be worked up to a climax, the same word may be
repeated with a different meaning or reiterated at
the opening of one sentence from the close of the
preceding, while we may introduce words with
similar terminations or in the same cases or
balancing or resembling each other.<milestone unit="section" n="34"/> Other effects
may be obtained by the graduation or contrast of
clauses, by the elegant inversion of words, by

<pb id="p.369"/>

arguments drawn from opposites, asyndeton, paraleipsis,
correction, exclamation, meiosis, the employment of
a word in different cases, moods and tenses, the
correspondence of subsequent particulars with others
previously mentioned, the addition of a reason for
what is advanced, the assignment of a reason for each
distinct statement;<milestone unit="section" n="35"/> again we may employ concession
and another form of hesitation, introduction of the
unexpected, distinction by heads, another form of correction, local distribution, rapid succession of clauses,
interruption of clauses, imagery, answering our own
questions, immutation,<note>Perhaps=nmetonymy.</note> the appropriate distinction of
one proposition from another, effective arrangement,
reference, digression and circumscription.<milestone unit="section" n="36"/> These
(and there may be yet more like them) are the various
devices for the embellishment of our style, either
by the cast of our thought or the conformation of
our language.</quote></p>
<p>Most of these statements are repeated by Cicero
in the <hi rend="italics">Orator,</hi><note>xxxix. 134 <hi rend="italics">sqq.</hi></note> but not all, while his language is
somewhat more precise, since after dealing with
figures of speech and of thought he adds a third
section, concerned, as he himself says, with the other
excellences of style.<milestone unit="section" n="37"/> <quote>And those other embellishments which are derived from the arrangement of
words contribute greatly to the adornment of our style.
They may be compared to what we term the decorations of the forum or a richly-ornamented stage, since
they not only adorn, but stand out conspicuously in
the midst of other ornaments.<milestone unit="section" n="38"/> The principle governing the use of embellishments and decorations of
style is the same: words may be repeated and
reiterated or reproduced with some slight change.
Sentences may repeatedly commence or end with

<pb id="p.371"/>

the same word or may begin and end with the same
phrase. The same word may be reiterated<note><hi rend="italics">adiungitur</hi> apparently refers to the same figure described
in Herodian (<hi rend="italics">Rh. Gr.</hi> iii. 99) as <foreign lang="greek">e)pi/zeucis</foreign> for which he gives
as an example <foreign lang="greek">*qh=bai de\ *qh=bai, po/lis k. t. l.,</foreign> from Aeschin.
<hi rend="italics">Ctes.</hi> 133.</note> either at
the beginning or at the conclusion, or may be repeated,
but in a different sense.<milestone unit="section" n="39"/> Words may have the same
inflexion or termination or be placed in various
antitheses, our language may rise by gradations to a
climax, or a number of words may be placed together
in asyndeton without connecting particles. Or we
may omit something, while making clear the reason
for such omission, or correct ourselves with apparent
censure of our carelessness, may utter exclamations of
admiration or grief, or introduce the same word
repeatedly in different cases.<milestone unit="section" n="40"/> The ornaments of
thought are, however, more important. They are so
frequently employed by Demosthenes that some
critics have held that it is in them that the chief
beauty of his style resides. And in truth there is
hardly a topic in his speeches which is not distinguished by some artificial treatment of the thought,
and it must be admitted that speaking involves the
embellishment of all, or at any rate most of our
thoughts with some form of ornament.<milestone unit="section" n="41"/> As you,
Brutus, have such an admirable knowledge of all
these methods, it would be waste of time for me to
cite all their names or to give illustrations. I shall
therefore content myself merely with indicating this
topic. Our ideal orator then will speak in such a
manner that he will cast the same thought into a
number of different forms, will dwell on one point
and linger over the same idea.<milestone unit="section" n="42"/> he will often attenuate some one point or deride his opponent, will
diverge from his theme and give a bias to his thought,
will set forth what he intends to say, after completing his argument will give a brief summary, will

<pb id="p.373"/>

recall himself to the point which he has left, repeat
what he has said, complete his proof by a formal
conclusion, embarrass his opponent by asking questions or answer himself in reply to imaginary
questions;<milestone unit="section" n="43"/> will desire his words to be taken in a
different sense from their literal meaning, will
hesitate what argument or form of statement to
prefer, will classify and divide, will deliberately
omit and ignore some point, and defend himself
by anticipation; will transfer the blame of some
charge brought against him to his opponent, will
often take his audience, and sometimes even his
opponent into consultation,<milestone unit="section" n="44"/> will describe the character
and talk of particular persons, will put words into
the mouths of inanimate objects, divert the minds of
the audience from the point at issue, often move
them to merriment or laughter, anticipate objections,
introduce comparisons, cite precedents, assign and
distribute different sentiments to different persons,
silence interrupters, assert that there are certain
things of which he prefers not to speak, warn his
audience to be on their guard against certain things,
or venture on a certain licence of speech. Again, he
will wax angry, sometimes indulge in rebuke, entreaty or supplication, will clear away unfavourable
impressions, swerve a little from his point, utter
wishes or execrations, or address his audience in
terms of familiar intimacy.<milestone unit="section" n="45"/> There are also other
virtues at which he should aim, such as brevity, if his
theme demands it, while he will often set forth topics
in such vivid language as almost to present them to
the very eyes of his audience, or will exaggerate his
subject beyond the bounds of possibility. His meaning will frequently be deeper than his words seem to

<pb id="p.375"/>

indicate, his tone will often be cheerful, and he will
often mimic life and character. In fact, as regards
this department of oratory, of which I have given
you the substance, lie must display eloquence in all
its grandest forms.</quote></p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The student who desires to give a wider consideration to figures of thought and speech will,
therefore, have a guide to follow, and 1 would not
venture to assert that he could have a better. But
I would ask him to read these passages of Cicero with
reference to my own views on this subject. For I
intend to speak only of those figures of thought
which depart from the direct method of statement,
and I note that a similar procedure has been adopted
by a number of learned scholars.<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> On the other hand,
all those embellishments which differ in character
from these are none the less virtues whose importance is such that without them all oratory will be
little less than unintelligible. For how can the judge
be adequately instructed unless lucidity characterise
our performance of the following tasks: explanation,
proposition, promise of proofs, definition, distinction,
exposition of our own opinion, logical conclusion, defence by anticipation, introduction of comparisons or
precedents, disposition and distribution, interruption,
repression of those who interrupt us, antithesis, exculpation and personal attack?<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Again, what would
eloquence do if deprived of the artifices of amplification and its opposite? of which the first requires the
gift of signifying more than we say, that is <hi rend="italics">emphasis,</hi>
together with exaggeration and overstatement of the
truth, while the latter requires the power to diminish
and palliate. What scope is there for the stronger
emotions if the orator is not allowed to give free rein

<pb id="p.377"/>

to his speech, to flame out in anger, to reproach, to
wish or execrate? Or for the milder emotions without the assistance of commendation, conciliation and
humour?<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> What pleasure can an orator hope to produce, or what impression even of the most moderate
learning, unless he knows how to fix one point in the
minds of the audience by repetition, and another by
dwelling on it, how to digress from and return to his
theme, to divert the blame from himself and transfer
it to another, or to decide what points to omit and
what to ignore as negligible? It is qualities such as
these that give life and vigour to oratory; without
them it lies torpid like a body lacking the breath to
stir its limbs.<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But more than the mere possession of
these qualities is required; they must be deployed,
each in their proper place and with such variety that
every sound may bewitch the hearer with all the
charm of music. But these qualities are as a rule
open and direct, manifesting themselves without
disguise. They do, however, as I have said, admit
of <hi rend="italics">figures,</hi> as the instances to which I shall proceed
will show.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>What is more common than to <hi rend="italics">ask</hi> or <hi rend="italics">enquire?</hi>
For both terms are used indifferently, although the
one seems to imply a desire for knowledge, and the
other a desire to prove something. But whichever
term we use, the thing which they represent admits
a variety of figures. We will begin with those which
serve to increase the force and cogency of proof to
which I assign the first place.<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> A simple question
may be illustrated by the line:<note>quanquam, <hi rend="italics">Spalding:</hi> quam cum, <hi rend="italics">A:</hi> cum, <hi rend="italics">B.</hi></note>

<quote rend="blockquote">
<quote><l>But who are ye and from what shores are come?</l></quote></quote></p>

<p>On the other hand, a question involves a figure,

<pb id="p.379"/>

whenever it is employed not to get information, but
to emphasise our point, as in the following examples:<note><hi rend="italics">pro. Lig. iii.</hi> 9 and <hi rend="italics">in Cat. i. 1.</hi></note>
<quote>What was that sword of yours doing, Tubero, that
was drawn on the field of Pharsalus?</quote> and <quote>How long,
Catiline, will you abuse our patience?</quote> and <quote>Do you
not see that your plots are all laid bare?</quote> with the
whole passage that follows.<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> How much greater is
the fire of his words as they stand than if he had
said, <quote>You have abused our patience a long time,</quote>
and <quote>Your plots are all laid bare.</quote> We may also
ask what cannot be denied, as <quote>Was Gaius Fidiculanius Falcula, I ask you, brought to justice?</quote><note><hi rend="italics">pro Cluent.</hi> xxxvii. 103.</note>
Or we may put a question to which it is difficult to
reply, as in the common forms, <quote>How is it possible?</quote>
<quote><hi rend="italics">How</hi> can that be?</quote><milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Or we may ask a question
with a view to throw odium on the person to whom
it is addressed, as in the words placed by Seneca in
the mouth of Medea:<note><hi rend="italics">Med.</hi> 451.</note>

<quote rend="blockquote">
<quote><l>What lands dost bid me seek?</l></quote></quote>

Or our aim may be to excite pity, as is the case with
the question asked by Sinon in Virgil:<note><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> ii. 69.</note>

<quote rend="blockquote">
<quote><l part="I">Alas, what lands, lie cried,</l>
<l>What seas can now receive me?</l></quote></quote>

Or to embarrass our opponent and to deprive him of
the power to feign ignorance of our meaning, as
Asinius does in the following sentence: <quote>Do you
hear? The will which we impugn is the work of a
madman, not of one who lacked natural affection.</quote>
In fact questions admit of infinite variety.<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> They
may serve our indignation, as in the line:

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>Are any left</l>
<l>That still adore Juno's divinity?</l></quote><bibl><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> i. 48.</bibl></cit></quote>

<pb id="p.381"/>

Or they may still express wonder, as in:

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>To what dost thou not drive the hearts of men,</l>
<l>Accursed greed of gold?</l></quote><bibl><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> iii. 56.</bibl></cit></quote>

Again, at times they may express a sharp command,<milestone unit="section" n="11"/>
as in:

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>Will they not rush to arms and follow forth</l>
<l>From all the city?</l></quote><bibl><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> iv. 592.</bibl></cit></quote>

Or we may ask ourselves, as in the phrase of Terence,
<quote>What, then, shall I do?</quote><note><hi rend="italics">Eun.</hi> I. i. 1.</note><milestone unit="section" n="12"/> A figure is also involved
in a reply, when one question is asked and another
is answered, because it suits the respondent's purpose
better to do so, or because it aggravates the charge
brought against the accused. For example, a witness
for the prosecution was asked whether he had been
cudgelled by the plaintiff, and replied, <quote>And what
is more, I had done him no harm.</quote> Or the purpose
may be to elude a charge, a very common form of
reply. The advocate says, <quote>I ask if you killed the
man?</quote> The accused replies, <quote>He was a robber.</quote>
The advocate asks, <quote>Have you occupied the farm?</quote>
The accused replies, <quote>It was my own.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Again, the
answer may be of such a kind as to make defence
precede confession. For example, in the <hi rend="italics">Eclogues</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Ecl.</hi> iii. 17 and 21.</note>
of Virgil, when one shepherd asks:

<quote rend="blockquote">
<quote><l>Did I not see you, villain, snare a goat</l>
<l>Of Damon's?</l></quote></quote>

the other replies:

<quote rend="blockquote">
<quote><l>I vanquished him in song, and should he not</l>
<l>Pay me the prize, my due?</l></quote></quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/>Akin to this kind of answer is the dissimulatory

<pb id="p.383"/>

reply, which is employed solely with the purpose
of raising a laugh, and has therefore been treated
in its appropriate place.<note>VI. iii. 68.</note> If it were meant seriously,
it would be tantamount to a confession. Further,
there is the practice of putting the question and
answering it oneself, which may have quite a pleasing
effect. Take as an example the following passage
from the <hi rend="italics">pro Ligario,</hi><note>iii. 7.</note> where Cicero says, <quote>Before
whom do I say this? Before one who, although he
was aware of these facts, yet restored me to my
country even before he had seen me.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="15"/> A different
form of fictitious question is to be found in the <hi rend="italics">pro
Caelio.</hi> <quote>Some one will say, 'Is this your moral
discipline? Is this the training you would give
young men?'</quote> with the whole passage that follows.
Then comes his reply, <quote>Gentlemen, if there were
any man with such vigour of mind, with such
innate virtue and self-control, etc.</quote><note>xvii. 39 <hi rend="italics">sqq.</hi> The passage concludes, <quote>I should consider
such an one the possessor of qualities which I can only call
worthy of a god.</quote></note> A different
method is to ask a question and not to wait for a
reply, but to subjoin the reply at once yourself.
For example, <quote>Had you no house? Yes, you had
one. Had you money and to spare? No, you were
in actual want.</quote><note><hi rend="italics">Orat.</hi> lxvii. 223.</note> This is a figure which some call
<hi rend="italics">suggestion.</hi><milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Again, a question may involve <hi rend="italics">comparison,</hi>
as, for instance, <quote>Which of the two then could more
easily assign a reason for his opinion?</quote><note><hi rend="italics">pro Cluent.</hi> xxxviii. 106.</note> There are
other forms of question as well, some concise, some
developed at greater length, some dealing with one
thing only, others with several.
<hi rend="italics">Anticipation,</hi> or, as the Greeks call it, <foreign lang="greek">pro/lhyis,</foreign>
whereby we forestall objections, is of extraordinary
value in pleading; it is frequently employed in all
parts of a speech, but is especially useful in the
<hi rend="italics">exordium.</hi><milestone unit="section" n="17"/> However, it forms a genus in itself, and

<pb id="p.385"/>

has several different species. One of these is the
defence by anticipation, such as Cicero employs
against Quintus Caecilius,<note><hi rend="italics">Div. in Caec.</hi> i. 1.</note> where he points out that
though previously he himself has always appeared
for the defence, he is now undertaking a prosecution.
Another is a form of <hi rend="italics">confession,</hi> such as he introduces
in his defence of Rabirius Postumus,<note>Chs. i. and ix.</note> where he
admits that he himself regards his client as worthy
of censure for lending money to the king. Another
takes the form of <hi rend="italics">prediction,</hi> as in the phrase, <quote>For
I will say without any intention of aggravating the
charge.</quote> Again, there is a form of <hi rend="italics">self-correction,</hi>
such as, <quote>I beg you to pardon me, if I have been
carried too far.</quote> And, most frequent of all, there
is <hi rend="italics">preparation,</hi> whereby we state fully why we are
going to do something or have done it.<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> <hi rend="italics">Anticipation</hi>
may also be employed to establish the meaning or
<hi rend="italics">propriety</hi> of words, as in the following case, <quote>Although
that was not a punishment, but merely a prevention
of crime,</quote><note>From a lost work of Cicero.</note> while the same effect may be produced
by <hi rend="italics">qualification,</hi> as in the following sentence,
<quote>Citizens, I say, if I may call them by that name.</quote><note><hi rend="italics">pro Mur.</hi> xxxvii. 80.</note></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="19"/>Again, hesitation may lend an impression of truth
to our statements, when, for example, we pretend
to be at a loss, where to begin or end, or to decide
what especially requires to be said or not to be said
at all. All speeches are full of such instances, but
for the present one will be enough. <quote>As for myself,
I know not where to turn. Shall I deny that there
was a scandalous rumour that the jury had been
bribed, etc.?</quote><note><hi rend="italics">pro Cluent.</hi> i. 4.</note><milestone unit="section" n="20"/> This device may also be employed
to cover the past; for we may equally pretend that
we <hi rend="italics">had</hi> felt hesitation on the subject.
This figure is akin to that known as <hi rend="italics">communication,</hi>

<pb id="p.387"/>

when we actually take our opponents into consultation, as Domitius Afer does in his defence of Cloatilla.
<quote>She is so agitated that she does not know what is
permitted to a woman or what becomes a wife. It
may be that chance has brought you into contact
with the unhappy woman in her helpless plight.
What counsel do you give her, you her brother, and
you, her father's friends?</quote><milestone unit="section" n="21"/> Or we may admit the
judges to our deliberations, a device which is frequently called into play. We may say, <quote>What do
you advise?</quote> or, <quote>I ask you,</quote> or, <quote>What, then,
should have been done?</quote> Cato, for example, says,
<quote>Come now, if you had been in his place, what else
would you have done?</quote> And in another passage,
<quote>Imagine this to be a matter which concerns us all,
and assume you have been placed in charge of the
whole affair.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="22"/> Sometimes, however, in such forms
of communication we may add something unexpected,
a device which is in itself a <hi rend="italics">figure,</hi> as Cicero does in
the <hi rend="italics">Verrines:</hi> <quote>What then? What think you?
Perhaps you expect to hear of some theft or plunder.</quote><note>v. 5. 10.</note>
Then, after keeping the minds of the judges in
suspense for a considerable time, he adds something
much worse. This figure is termed <hi rend="italics">suspension</hi> by
Celsus. It has two forms.<milestone unit="section" n="23"/> For we may adopt
exactly the opposite procedure to that just mentioned,
and after raising expectation of a sequel of the most
serious nature, we may drop to something which is
of a trivial character, and may even imply no offence
at all. But since this does not necessarily involve
any form of <hi rend="italics">communication,</hi> some have given it the
name of <hi rend="italics">paradox</hi> or <hi rend="italics">surprise.</hi><milestone unit="section" n="24"/> I do not agree with
those who extend the name <hi rend="italics">of figure</hi> to a statement
that something has happened unexpectedly to the

<pb id="p.389"/>

speaker himself, like the following passage from
Pollio: <quote>Gentlemen, I never thought it would
come to pass that, when Scaurus was the accused,
I should have to entreat you not to allow influence
to carry any weight on his behalf.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="25"/> The figure
known as <hi rend="italics">concession</hi> springs from practically the same
source as <hi rend="italics">communication;</hi> it occurs when we leave
some things to the judgment of the jury, or even
in some cases of our opponents, as when Calvus
says to Vatinius, <quote>Summon all your assurance and
assert that you have a better claim than Cato to be
elected praetor.</quote></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="26"/>The <hi rend="italics">figures</hi> best adapted for intensifying emotion
consist chiefly in simulation. For we may feign
that we are angry, glad, afraid, filled with wonder,
grief or indignation, or that we wish something, and
so on. Hence we get passages like the following:
<quote>I am free, I breathe again,</quote><note><hi rend="italics">pro Mil.</hi> xviii. 47.</note> or, <quote>It is well,</quote> or,
<quote>What madness is this?</quote><note><hi rend="italics">pro Muren.</hi> vi. 14.</note> or, <quote>Alas! for these
degenerate days!</quote><note><hi rend="italics">in Cat. i.</hi> 2.</note> or, <quote>Woe is me; for though all
my tears are shed my grief still clings to me deep-rooted in my heart,</quote><note><hi rend="italics">Phil..</hi> xxvi. 64.</note> or,

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>Gape now, wide earth.</l></quote><bibl>Unknown.</bibl></cit></quote>

To this some give the name of <hi rend="italics">exclamation,</hi><milestone unit="section" n="27"/> and
include it among <hi rend="italics">figures of speech.</hi> When, however,
such exclamations are genuine, they do not come
under the head of our present topic: it is only those
which are simulated and artfully designed which can
with any certainty be regarded as <hi rend="italics">figures.</hi> The same
is true of free speech, which Corificius<note>The author of <hi rend="italics">Auct. ad Herennium,</hi> iv. 36.</note> calls <hi rend="italics">licence,</hi>
and the Greeks <foreign lang="greek">par)r(hsi/a.</foreign> For what has less of the
<hi rend="italics">figure</hi> about it than true freedom? On the other
hand, freedom of speech may frequently be made a

<pb id="p.391"/>

cloak for flattery.<milestone unit="section" n="28"/> For when Cicero in his defence
for Ligarius says, <quote>After war had begun, Caesar,
and was well on its way to a conclusion, I deliberately,
of my own free will and under no compulsion, joined
the forces of your opponents,</quote><note>iii. 7.</note> he has in his mind
something more than a desire to serve the interests
of Ligarius, for there is no better way of praising
the clemency of the victor.<milestone unit="section" n="29"/> On the other hand, in
the sentence, <quote>What else was our aim, Tubero, than
that we might secure the power which he now
holds?</quote><note>iv. 10. We = the Pompeian party. He = Caesar.</note> he succeeds with admirable art in representing the cause of both parties as being good, and
in so doing mollifies him whose cause was really
bad.
A bolder form of <hi rend="italics">figure,</hi> which in Cicero's opinion<note><hi rend="italics">Orat.</hi> xxv. 85.</note> demands greater effort, is <hi rend="italics">impersonation,</hi> or <foreign lang="greek">proswpopoii+/a</foreign>
This is a device which lends wonderful variety and
animation to oratory.<milestone unit="section" n="30"/> By this means we display the
inner thoughts of our adversaries as though they were
talking with themselves (but we shall only carry conviction if we represent them as uttering what they
may reasonably be supposed to have had in their
minds); or without sacrifice of credibility we may
introduce conversations between ourselves and others,
or of others among themselves, and put words of
advice, reproach, complaint, praise or pity into the
mouths of appropriate persons.<milestone unit="section" n="31"/> Nay, we are even
allowed in this form of speech to bring down the
gods from heaven and raise the dead, while cities
also and peoples may find a voice. There are some
authorities who restrict the term <hi rend="italics">imepersonation</hi> to
cases where both persons and words are fictitious, and
prefer to call imaginary conversations between men
by the Greek name of <hi rend="italics">dialogue,</hi> which some<note>Cornific. <hi rend="italics">op. cit.</hi> iv. 43 and 52.</note> translate

<pb id="p.393"/>

by the Latin <hi rend="italics">semnocinatio.</hi><milestone unit="section" n="32"/> For my own part, I have
included both under the same generally accepted
term, since we cannot imagine a speech without we
also imagine a person to utter it. But when we lend
a voice to things to which nature has denied it, we
may soften down the <hi rend="italics">figure</hi> in the way illustrated
by the following passage: <quote>For if my country, which
is far dearer to me than life itself, if all Italy, if the
whole commonwealth were to address me thus,
'Marcus Tullius, what dost thou?</quote><note><hi rend="italics">in Cat.</hi> T. xi. 27.</note> A bolder
figure of the same kind may be illustrated by the
following: <quote>Your country, Catiline, pleads with you
thus, and though she utters never a word, cries to
you, 'For not a few years past no crime has come
to pass save through your doing!'</quote><note><hi rend="italics">in Cat.</hi> I. vii. 18.</note><milestone unit="section" n="33"/> It is also convenient at times to pretend that we have before our
eyes the images of things, persons or utterances, or
to marvel that the same is not the case with our
adversaries or the judges; it is with this design that
we use phrases such as <quote>It seems to me,</quote> or <quote>Does
it not seem to you?</quote> But such devices make a great
demand on our powers of eloquence. For with things
which are false and incredible by nature there are but
two alternatives: either they will move our hearers
with exceptional force because they are beyond the
truth, or they will be regarded as empty nothings
because they are not the truth.<milestone unit="section" n="34"/> But we may introduce not only imaginary sayings, but imaginary
writings as well, as is done by Asinius in his defence
of Liburnia: <quote>Let my mother, who was the object
of my love and my delight, who lived for me and
gave me life twice in one day<note>The speech being lost, the allusion in <hi rend="italics">bis</hi>&mdash;<hi rend="italics">dedit is</hi>
unintelligible.</note> (and so on) inherit
nought of my property.</quote> This is in itself a figure,
and is doubly so whenever, as in the present case,

<pb id="p.395"/>

it imitates a document produced by the opposing
party.<milestone unit="section" n="35"/> For a will had been read out by the prosecution, in the following form: <quote>Let Publius Novanius
Gallio, to whom as my benefactor I will and owe all
that is good, as a testimony to the great affection
which he has borne me (then follow other details)
be my heir.</quote> In this case the <hi rend="italics">figure</hi> borders on
<hi rend="italics">parody,</hi> a name drawn from songs sung in imitation
of others, but employed by an abuse of language to
designate imitation in verse or prose.<milestone unit="section" n="36"/> Again, we
often personify the abstract, as Virgil<note><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> iv. 174.</note> does with
Fame, or as Xenophon<note><hi rend="italics">Mem.</hi> ii. 1.</note> records that Prodicus did
with Virtue and Pleasure, or as Ennius does when,
in one of his satires, he represents Life and Death
contending with one another. We may also introduce some imaginary person without identifying
him, as we do in the phrases, <quote>At this point some
one will interpose,</quote> or, <quote>Some one will say.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="37"/> Or
speech may be inserted without any mention of the
speaker, as in the line:<note><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> ii. 29. The words represent what some Trojan said
after the departure of the Greeks.</note>

<quote rend="blockquote">
<quote><l part="I">Here the Dolopian host</l>
<l>Camped, here the fierce Achilles pitched his tent.</l></quote></quote>

This involves a mixture of <hi rend="italics">figures,</hi> since to <hi rend="italics">impersonalion</hi> we add the <hi rend="italics">figure</hi> known as <hi rend="italics">ellipse,</hi> which
in this case consists in the omission of any indication
as to who is speaking. At times <hi rend="italics">impersonation</hi> takes
the form of narrative. Thus we find indirect
speeches in the historians, as at the opening of
Livy's first book<note>i. 9. These words represent the argument of envoys
sent out by Romulus to neighbouring cities.</note>: <quote>That cities, like other things,
spring from the humblest origins, and that those
who are helped by their own valour and the favour
of heaven subsequently win great power and a great
name for themselves.</quote>

<pb id="p.397"/>

<hi rend="italics">Apostrophe</hi> also,<milestone unit="section" n="38"/> which consists in the diversion of
our address from the judge, is wonderfully stirring,
whether we attack our adversary as in the passage,
<quote>What was that sword of yours doing, Tubero, in
the field of Pharsalus?</quote><note><hi rend="italics">pro Lig.</hi> iii. 9.</note> or turn to make some invocation such as, <quote>For I appeal to you, hills and groves
of Alba,</quote><note><hi rend="italics">pro Mil.</hi> xxxi. 85.</note> or to entreaty that will bring odium on
our opponents, as in the cry, <quote>O Porcian and Sempronian laws.</quote><note><hi rend="italics">Verr.</hi> V. lxiii. 163. Laws protecting the person of a
Roman citizen, and disregarded by Verres.</note><milestone unit="section" n="39"/> But the term <hi rend="italics">apostrophe</hi> is also
applied to utterances that divert the attention of
the hearer from the question before them, as in the
following passage:

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>I swore not with the Greeks</l>
<l>At Aulis to uproot the race of Troy.</l></quote><bibl><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> iv. 425. Dido is urging Anna to approach Aeneas
and induce Aeneas to postpone his departure. Dido is no
enemy from whom he need fly.</bibl></cit></quote>

There are a number of different figures by which
this effect may be produced. We may, for instance,
pretend that we expected something different or
feared some greater disaster, or that the judges in
their ignorance of the facts may regard some point
as of more importance than it really is: an example
of this latter device is to be found in the exordium
to Cicero's defence of Caelius.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="40"/>With regard to the figure which Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">de Or.</hi> <milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>liii. 202.</note> calls <hi rend="italics">ocular
denonstration,</hi> this comes into play when we do not
restrict ourselves to mentioning that something was
done, but proceed to show how it was done, and do
so not merely on broad general lines, but in full
detail. In the last book<note>VIII. Iii. 61 <hi rend="italics">sqq.</hi></note> I classified this figure
under the head of <hi rend="italics">vivid illustration,</hi> while Celsus
actually terms it by this name. Others give the
name of <foreign lang="greek">u(potu/pwsis</foreign> to any representation of facts
which is made in such vivid language that they
appeal to the eye rather than the ear. The

<pb id="p.399"/>

following will show what I mean: <quote>He came into the
forum on fire with criminal madness: his eyes blazed
and cruelty was written in every feature of his
countenance.</quote><note><hi rend="italics">Verr.</hi> v. lxii. 161.</note><milestone unit="section" n="41"/> Nor is it only past or present actions
which we may imagine: we may equally well present
a picture of what is likely to happen or might have
happened. This is done with extraordinary skill by
Cicero in his defence of Milo,<note>Ch. 32.</note> where he shows
what Clodius would have done, had he succeeded
in securing the praetorship. But this <hi rend="italics">transference
of time,</hi> which is technically called <foreign lang="greek">meta/stasis</foreign> was
more modestly used in <hi rend="italics">vivid description</hi> by the old
orators. For they would preface it by words such
as <quote>Imagine that you see</quote>: take, for example,
the words of Cicero<note>Not found in extant works of Cicero.</note>: <quote>Though you cannot see this
with your bodily eyes, you can see it with the mind's
eye.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="42"/> Modern authors, however, more especially
the declaimers, are bolder, indeed they show the
utmost animation in giving rein to their imagination;
witness the following passages from Seneca's treatment of the controversial theme in which a father,
guided by one of his sons, finds another son in the
act of adultery with his stepmother and kills both
culprits. <quote>Lead me, I follow, take this old hand of
mine and direct it where you will.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="43"/> And a little
later, <quote>See, he says, what for so long you refused to
believe. As for myself, I cannot see, night and thick
darkness veil my eyes.</quote> This figure is too dramatic:
for the story seems to be acted, not narrated.<milestone unit="section" n="44"/> Some
include the clear and vivid description of places
under the same heading, while others call it
<hi rend="italics">topography.</hi></p>
<p>I have found some who speak of <hi rend="italics">irony</hi> as <hi rend="italics">dissimulation,</hi> but, in view of the fact that this latter name

<pb id="p.401"/>

does not cover the whole range of this figure, I shall
follow my general rule and rest content with the
Greek term. <hi rend="italics">Irony</hi> involving a <hi rend="italics">figure</hi> does not differ
from the <hi rend="italics">irony</hi> which is a <hi rend="italics">trope,</hi> as far as its <hi rend="italics">genus</hi> is
concerned, since in both cases we understand something which is the opposite of what is actually said;
on the other hand, a careful consideration of the
<hi rend="italics">species</hi> of <hi rend="italics">irony</hi> will soon reveal the fact that they
differ.<milestone unit="section" n="45"/> In the first place, the <hi rend="italics">trope</hi> is franker in its
meaning, and, despite the fact that it implies something other than it says, makes no pretence about it.
For the context as a rule is perfectly clear, as, for
example, in the following passage from the Catilinarian orations.<note>I. viii. 19.</note> <quote>Rejected by him, you migrated
to your boon-companion, that excellent gentleman
Metellus.</quote> In this case the irony lies in two words,
and is therefore a specially concise form of <hi rend="italics">trope.</hi>
<milestone unit="section" n="46"/>But in the <hi rend="italics">figurative</hi> form of irony the speaker disguises his entire meaning, the disguise being apparent
rather than confessed. For in the <hi rend="italics">trope</hi> the conflict
is purely verbal, while in the <hi rend="italics">figure</hi> the meaning, and
sometimes the whole aspect of our case, conflicts with
the language and the tone of voice adopted; nay, a
man's whole life may be coloured with <hi rend="italics">irony,</hi> as was
the case with Socrates, who was called an <hi rend="italics">ironist</hi>
because he assumed the role of an ignorant man lost
in wonder at the wisdom of others. Thus, as continued <hi rend="italics">metaphor</hi> develops into <hi rend="italics">allegory,</hi> so a sustained
series of <hi rend="italics">tropes</hi> develops into this <hi rend="italics">figure.</hi><milestone unit="section" n="47"/> There are,
however, certain kinds of <hi rend="italics">this figure</hi> which have no
connexion with <hi rend="italics">tropes.</hi> In the first place, there is the
<hi rend="italics">figure</hi> which derives its name from negation and is
called by some <foreign lang="greek">a)nti/frasis.</foreign> Here is an example:
<quote>I will not plead against you according to the rigour

<pb id="p.403"/>

of the law, I will not press the point which I should

should I mention his decrees, his acts of plunder, his

inheritances?</quote><note><hi rend="italics">Phil.</hi> II. xxv. 62.</note> or <quote>I say nothing of the first wrong

sesterces</quote>;<milestone unit="section" n="48"/> or <quote>I might say, etc.</quote><note><hi rend="italics">pro Cael.</hi> xxii. 53.</note> Such kinds of
irony may even be sustained at times through whole
sections of our argument, as, for instance, where
Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">pro Cluent.</hi> lx. 166.</note> says, <quote>If I were to plead on this point as
though there were some real charge to refute, I
should speak at greater length.</quote> It is also <hi rend="italics">irony</hi>
when we assume the tone of command or concession,
as in Virgil's<note><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> iv. 381. Dido to Aeneas. She continues by praying
for his destruution.</note>

<quote rend="blockquote">
<quote><l part="F">Go!</l>
<l>Follow the winds to Italy;</l></quote></quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="49"/>or when we concede to our opponents qualities which
we are unwilling that they should seem to possess.
This is specially effective when we possess these
qualities and they do not, as in the following
passage,<note><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> xi. 383. Turnus addresses Drances, who has been
attacking him as the cause of the war and bidding him fight
himself, if he would win Lavinia for his bride.</note>

<quote rend="blockquote">
<quote><l>Brand <hi rend="italics">me</hi> as coward, Drances, since thy sword</l>
<l>Has slain such hosts of Trojans.</l></quote></quote>

A like result is produced by reversing this method
when we pretend to own to faults which are not ours
or which even recoil upon the heads of our opponents, as for example,

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>'Twas I that led the Dardan gallant on</l>
<l>To storm the bridal bed of Sparta's queen!</l></quote><bibl><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> x. 92. Juno ironically pretends to have brought
about the rape of Helen, which was in reality the work of
Venus.</bibl></cit></quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="50"/>Further, this device of saying the opposite of what

<pb id="p.405"/>

we desire to imply is not merely restricted to persons, but may be extended to things, witness the
whole of the <hi rend="italics">exordium</hi> of the <hi rend="italics">pro Ligario</hi> and disparaging phrases such as <quote>Forsooth,</quote> <quote>ye great
gods!</quote> or

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>Fit task, I ween, for gods!</l></quote><bibl><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> iv,. 379. Dido mocks the excuse of Aeneas that he had received the direct command of heaven to leave Carthage.</bibl></cit></quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="51"/>Another example is provided by the following passage from the <hi rend="italics">pro Oppio,</hi> <quote>What wondrous love!
what extraordinary benevolence!</quote> Akin to <hi rend="italics">irony</hi>
also are the following <hi rend="italics">figures,</hi> which have a strong
family resemblance: <hi rend="italics">confession</hi> of a kind that can do
our case no harm, such as the following<note><hi rend="italics">pro Lig.</hi> i. 2.</note>: <quote>You have
now, Tubero, the advantage most desired by an accuser: the accused confesses his guilt</quote>; secondly, <hi rend="italics">concession,</hi> when we pretend to admit something actually
unfavourable to ourselves by way of showing our
confidence in our cause, as in the following passage<note><hi rend="italics">Verr.</hi> v. xliv. 117</note>:
<quote>The commander of a ship from a distinguished
city paid down a sum of money to rid himself of
the fear of a scourging which hung over his head;
it shows Verres' humanity</quote>; or again, in the <hi rend="italics">pro
Cluentio,</hi><note><hi rend="italics">pro Cluet.</hi> ii. 5.</note> where Cicero is speaking of the prejudice
aroused against his client, <quote>Let it prevail in the
public assembly, but be silent in the courts of law</quote>;
thirdly, <hi rend="italics">agreement,</hi> as when Cicero,<note><hi rend="italics"> pro Cluent.</hi> xxiii. 63.</note> in the same
speech, agrees that the jury was bribed.<milestone unit="section" n="52"/> This last
form of<hi rend="italics">figure</hi> becomes more striking when we agree
to something which is really likely to tell in our
favour; but such an opportunity can only occur
through weakness on the part of our opponent
Sometimes we may even praise some action of our
opponent, as Cicero does in his prosecution of Verres<note><hi rend="italics">Verr.</hi> <milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>xvii. 37. <hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> Apollonius deserved it.</note>
when dealing with the charge in connexion with

<pb id="p.407"/>

Apollonius of Drepanum: <quote>Nay, it is a real pleasure
to me to think that you took something from him,
and I say that you never did a juster action in your
life.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="53"/> At times we may exaggerate charges against
ourselves which we can easily refute or deny; this
device is too common to require any illustration. At
other times we may by this same method make the
charges brought against us seem incredible just
because of their gravity: thus Cicero in his defence
of Roscius,<note>Roscius of Ameria was accused of parricide.</note> by the sheer force of his eloquence,
exaggerates the horror of parricide, despite the fact
that it requires no demonstration.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="54"/><hi rend="italics">Aposiopesis,</hi> which Cicero<note>See quotation in IX. i. 31.</note> calls <hi rend="italics">reticentia,</hi> Celsus
<hi rend="italics">obticentia,</hi> and some <hi rend="italics">interruptio,</hi> is used to indicate
passion or anger, as in the line:<note><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> i. 135. Neptune rebukes the winds for raising a
storm, but breaks off without actually saying what he would
do to them.</note>

<quote rend="blockquote">
<quote><l part="F">Whom I&mdash;</l>
<l>But better first these billows to assuage.</l></quote></quote>

Or it may serve to give an impression of anxiety or
scruple, as in the following:<note>Now frequently inserted in <hi rend="italics">pro Mil.</hi> xii. 33. But it is
quite possible that the words formed part of the speech
actually delivered, and do not belong to the existing speech,
from the MSS. from which they are absent. The law
proposed to give freedmen the right to vote in all thirty-five tribes and not as before in the four city-tribes only.</note> <quote>Would he have dared
to mention this law of which Clodius boasts he was
the author, while Milo was alive, I will not say was

complete the sentence.</quote> There is a similar instance
in the exordium of Demosthenes' speech in defence
of Ctesiphon.<note>&sect; 3. <foreign lang="greek">a)ll' e)moi\&mdash;ou) bou/lomai de\ dusxere\s ei)pei=n ou)de/n.</foreign></note><milestone unit="section" n="55"/> Again it may be employed as a means
of transition, as, for example,<note>From <hi rend="italics">thepro Cornelio.</hi></note> <quote>Cominius, however&mdash;
nay, pardon me, gentlemen.</quote> This last instance also
involves <hi rend="italics">digression,</hi> if indeed digression is to be
counted among <hi rend="italics">figures,</hi> since some authorities regard
it as forming one of the parts of a speech.<note><hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> xv. iii. 12.</note> For at

<pb id="p.409"/>

this point the orator diverges to sing the praises of
Gnaeus Pompeius, which he might have done without any recourse to <hi rend="italics">aposiopesis.</hi><milestone unit="section" n="56"/> For as Cicero<note>From the passage quoted IX. i. 28.</note> says,
the shorter form of <hi rend="italics">digression</hi> may be effected in a
number of different ways. The following passages
will, however, suffice as examples: <quote>Then Gaius
Varenus, that is, the Varenus who was killed by the
slaves of Ancharius:&mdash;I beg you, gentlemen, to give
careful attention to what I am about to say<note>From the lost <hi rend="italics">pro Varcno.</hi></note>;</quote> the
second is from the pro Milone<note>xii. 33.</note>: <quote>Then he turned
on me that glance, which it was his wont to assume,
when he threatened all the world with every kind
of violence.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="57"/> There is also another kind of figure,
which is not aposiopesis, since that involves leaving
a sentence unfinished, but consists in bringing our
words to a close before the natural point for their
conclusion. The following is an example<note><hi rend="italics">pro Lig.</hi> iii. 9.</note>: <quote>I am
pressing my point too far; the young man appears
to be moved</quote>; or<note>A free quotation from <hi rend="italics">Verr.</hi> v. xliv. 116</note> <quote>Why should I say more? you
heard the young man tell the story himself.</quote>
The imitation of other persons' characteristics,<milestone unit="section" n="58"/>
which is styled <foreign lang="greek">h)qopoii=/a</foreign> or, as some prefer <foreign lang="greek">mi/mhsis</foreign>
may be counted among the devices which serve to
excite the gentler emotions. For it consists mainly
in banter, though it may be concerned either with
words or deeds. If concerned with the latter, it
closely resembles <foreign lang="greek">u(potu/pwsis</foreign> while the following
passage from Terence<note><hi rend="italics">Eun.</hi> I. ii. 75.</note> will illustrate it as applied
to words: <quote>I didn't see your drift. 'A little girl
was stolen from this place; my mother brought her
up as her own daughter. She was known as my
sister. I want to get her away to restore her to her
relations.'</quote><milestone unit="section" n="59"/> We may, however, imitate our own
words and deeds in a similar fashion by relating some

<pb id="p.411"/>

act or statement, though in such cases the speaker
more frequently does so to assert his point than for
the sake of banter, as, for example, in the following,<note><hi rend="italics">Div. in Caec.</hi> ii. 4. Cicero ironically suggested to the
Sicilians that Caecilius should undertake their case. He was
a bogus accuser put forward by Verres himself, whose quaest or
he had been in Sicily.</note>
<quote>I said that they had Quintus Caecilius to conduct
the prosecution.</quote> There are other devices also which
are agreeable in themselves and serve not a little
to commend our case both by the introduction of
variety and by their intrinsic naturalness, since by
giving our speech an appearance of simplicity and
spontaneity they make the judges more ready to
accept our statements without suspicion.<milestone unit="section" n="60"/> Thus we
may feign repentance for what we have said, as in
the <hi rend="italics">pro Caelio,</hi><note>xv. 35.</note> where Cicero says, <quote>But why did I
introduce so respectable a character?</quote> Or we may
use some common phrase, such as, <quote>I didn't mean
to say that.</quote><note><hi rend="italics">Verr.</hi> IV. xx. 43.</note> Or we may pretend that we are
searching for what we should say, as in the phrases,
<quote>What else is there?</quote> or <quote>Have I left anything
out?</quote> Or we may pretend to discover something
suggested by the context, as when Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">pro Cluent.</hi> lxi. 169.</note> says, <quote>One
more charge, too, of this sort still remains for me to
deal with,</quote> or <quote>One thing suggests another.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="61"/> Such
methods will also provide us with elegant transitions,
although transition is not itself to be ranked among
figures: for example, Cicero,<note><hi rend="italics">Ve err.</hi> IV. xxvi. 57.</note> after telling the story
of Piso, who ordered a goldsmith to make a ring
before him in court, adds, as though this story had
suggested it to him, <quote>This ring of Piso's reminds
me of something which had entirely slipped my
memory. How many gold rings do you think
Verres has stripped from the fingers of honourable
men?</quote> Or we may affect ignorance on certain
points, as in the following passage<note><hi rend="italics">Verr.</hi> IV. iii. 5.</note>: <quote>But who
was the sculptor who made those statues? Who

<pb id="p.413"/>

was he? Thank you for prompting me, you are
right; they said it was Polyclitus.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="62"/> This device
may serve for other purposes as well. For there
are means of this kind whereby we may achieve
an end quite other than that at which we appear
to be aiming, as, for example, Cicero does in the
passage just quoted. For while he taunts Verres
with a morbid passion for acquiring statues and
pictures, he succeeds in creating the impression
that he personally has no interest in such subjects.
So, too, when Demosthenes<note><hi rend="italics">De Coron.</hi> 263. He argued that defeat in such a cause
could bring no shame. Athens would have been unworthy
of the heroes of old had she not fought for freedom.</note> swears by those who
fell at Marathon and Salamis, his object is to lessen
the odium in which he was involved by the disaster
at Chaeronea.<milestone unit="section" n="63"/> We may further lend charm to our
speech by deferring the discussion of some points
after just mentioning them, thus depositing them
in the safe keeping of the judge's memory and afterwards reclaiming our deposit; or we may employ
some figure to enable us to repeat certain points
(for repetition is not in itself a figure) or may make
especial mention of certain things and vary the
aspect of our pleading. For eloquence delights
in variety, and just as the eye is more strongly
attracted by the sight of a number of different
things, so oratory supplies a continuous series of
novelties to rivet the attention of the mind.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="64"/><hi rend="italics">Emphasis</hi> may be numbered among figures also,
when some hidden meaning is extracted from some
phrase, as in the following passage from Virgil:

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l part="F">Might I not have lived,</l>
<l>From wedlock free, a life without a stain,</l>
<l>Happy as beasts are happy?</l></quote><bibl><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> iv. 550.</bibl></cit></quote>

For although Dido complains of marriage, yet her

<pb id="p.415"/>

passionate outburst shows that she regards life without wedlock as no life for man, but for the beasts
of the field. A different kind of emphasis is found
in Ovid, where Zmyrna confesses to her nurse her
passion for her father in the following words:</p>

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>O mother, happy in thy spouse!</l></quote><bibl><hi rend="italics">Met.</hi> x. 422.</bibl></cit></quote>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="65"/>Similar, if not identical with this figure is another,
which is much in vogue at the present time. For
I must now proceed to the discussion of a class of
figure which is of the commonest occurrence and
on which I think I shall be expected to make
some comment. It is one whereby we excite some
suspicion to indicate that our meaning is other than
our words would seem to imply; but our meaning
is not in this case contrary to that which we express,
as is the case in <hi rend="italics">ironq,</hi> but rather a hidden meaning
which is left to the hearer to discover. As I have
already pointed out,<note>IX. i. 14.</note> modern rhetoricians practically
restrict the name of <hi rend="italics">figure</hi> to this device, from the
use of which <hi rend="italics">figured</hi> controversial themes derive
their name.<milestone unit="section" n="66"/> This class of figure may be employed under three conditions: first, if it is unsafe
to speak openly; secondly, if it is unseemly to speak
openly; and thirdly, when it is employed solely
with a view to the elegance of what we say, and
gives greater pleasure by reason of the novelty and
variety thus introduced than if our meaning had
been expressed in straightforward language.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="67"/>The first of the three is of common occurrence in
the schools, where we imagine conditions laid down
by tyrants on abdication and decrees passed by the
senate after a civil war, and it is a capital offence
to accuse a person with what is past, what is not

<pb id="p.417"/>

expedient in the courts being actually prohibited
in the schools. But the conditions governing the
employment of figures differ in the two cases. For
we may speak against the tyrants in question as
openly as we please without loss of effect, provided always that what we say is susceptible of a
different interpretation, since it is only danger to
ourselves, and not offence to them, that we have to
avoid.<milestone unit="section" n="68"/> And if the danger can be avoided by any
ambiguity of expression, tile speaker's cunning will
meet with universal approbation. On the other
hand, the actual business of the courts has never
yet involved such necessity for silence, though at
times they require something not unlike it, which
is much more embarrassing for the speaker, as, for
example, when he is hampered by the existence of
powerful personages, whom he must censure if
he is to prove his case.<milestone unit="section" n="69"/> Consequently he must
proceed with greater wariness and circumspection;
since the actual manner in which offence is given
is a matter of indifference, and if a figure is perfectly
obvious, it ceases to be a figure. Therefore such
devices are absolutely repudiated by some authorities, whether the meaning of the figure be intelligible or not. But it is possible to employ such
<hi rend="italics">figuress</hi> in moderation, the primary consideration
being that they should not be too obvious. And
this fault can be avoided, if the <hi rend="italics">figre</hi> does not
depend on the employment of words of doubtful
or double meaning, such, for instance, as the words
which occur in the theme of the suspected daughter-in-law:<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> suspected of an intrigue with her father-in-law.</note> <quote>I married the wife who pleased my
father.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="70"/> It is important, too, that the <hi rend="italics">figure</hi> should

<pb id="p.419"/>

not depend on ambiguous collocations of words (a
trick which is far more foolish than the last); an
example of this is to be found in the controversial
theme, where a father, accused of a criminal passion
for his unmarried daughter, asks her for the name
of her ravisher. <quote>Who dishonoured you?</quote> he says.
She replies: <quote>My father, do you not know?</quote><note>The sense of the words depends on the punctuation,
according as we place a full-stop or a comma after <hi rend="italics">My father.</hi></note><milestone unit="section" n="71"/>
The facts themselves must be allowed to excite the
suspicions of the judge, and we must clear away all
other points, leaving nothing save what will suggest
the truth. In doing this we shall find emotional
appeals, hesitation and words broken by silences
most effective. For thus the judge will be led to
seek out the secret which he would not perhaps
believe if he heard it openly stated, and to believe
in that which he thinks he has found out for himself.
But however excellent our <hi rend="italics">figures,</hi><milestone unit="section" n="72"/> they must not be
too numerous. For overcrowding will make them
obvious, and they will become ineffective without
becoming inoffensive, while the fact that we make
no open accusation will seem to be due not to
modesty, but to lack of confidence in our own cause.
In fact, we may sum up the position thus: our
figures will have most effect upon the judge when
he thinks that we use them with reluctance.<milestone unit="section" n="73"/> I
myself have come across persons whom it was impossible to convince by other means: I have even
come across a much rarer thing, namely, a case
which could only be proved by recourse to such
devices. I was defending a woman who was alleged
to have forged her husband's will, and the heirs
were stated to have given a bond<note>The bond was to the effect that they would make over
the property to the wife; the existence of such a bond
proved the wife innocent, since it was a virtual confirmation
of the will, of which it showed the husband to have cognisance. But the bond was not valid in the eye of the law
and such <hi rend="italics">tacita fideicommissa</hi> were illegal, since the wife
could not inherit; consequently the admission of the existence of the bond would have involved the loss of the inheritance, which on information being laid (cp. <hi rend="italics">delatores</hi>) would
have lapsed to the state. <hi rend="italics">Caput</hi> is the civil status of the
wife. With regard to <hi rend="italics">dicebantur,</hi> the writing is careless, as
it suggests that the statement was made by the prosecution,
which was, of course, not the case.</note> to the husband
on his deathbed, which latter assertion was true.
<milestone unit="section" n="74"/>For since the wife could not legally be appointed

<pb id="p.421"/>

his heir, this procedure was adopted to enable the
property to be transferred to her by a secret conveyance in trust. Now it was easy for me to secure
the woman's acquittal, by openly mentioning the
existence of the bond; but this would have involved
her loss of the inheritance. I had, therefore, to plead
in such a way that the judges should understand that
the bond had actually been given, but that informers
might be unable to avail themselves of any statement of mine to that effect. And I was successful
in both my aims. The fear of seeming to boast my
own skill would have deterred me from mentioning
this case, but for the fact that I wished to demonstrate that there was room for the employment of
these <hi rend="italics">figures</hi> even in the courts.<milestone unit="section" n="75"/> Some things,
again, which cannot be proved, may, on the other
hand, be suggested by the employment of some
<hi rend="italics">figure.</hi> For at times such hidden shafts will stick,
and the fact that they are not noticed will prevent
their being drawn out, whereas if the same point
were stated openly, it would be denied by our
opponents and would have to be proved.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="76"/>When, however, it is respect for some person that
hampers us (which I mentioned as the second condition<note>See &sect; 66.</note> under which such <hi rend="italics">figures</hi> may be used), all
the greater caution is required because the sense of
shame is a stronger deterrent to all good men than
fear. In such cases the judge must be impressed
with the fact that we are hiding what we know and
keeping back the words which our natural impulse
to speak out the truth would cause to burst from
our lips. For those against whom we are speaking,
together with the judges and our audience, would

<pb id="p.423"/>

assuredly be all the more incensed by such toying
with detraction, if they thought that we were
inspired by deliberate malice.<milestone unit="section" n="77"/> And what difference
does it make how we express ourselves, when both
the facts and our feelings are clearly understood?
And what good shall we do by expressing ourselves thus except to make it clear that we are
doing what we ourselves know ought not to be done?
And yet in the days when I first began to teach
rhetoric, this failing was only too common. For
declaimers selected by preference those themes
which attracted them by their apparent difficulty,
although as a matter of fact they were much easier
than many others.<milestone unit="section" n="78"/> For straightforward eloquence
requires the highest gifts to commend itself to
the audience, while these circuitous and indirect
methods are merely the refuge of weakness, for those
who use them are like men who, being unable to
escape from their pursuers by speed, do so by
doubling, since this method of expression, which
is so much affected, is really not far removed from
jesting. Indeed it is positively assisted by the
tact that the hearer takes pleasure in detecting
the speaker's concealed meaning, applauds his own
penetration and regards another man's eloquence as
a compliment to himself.<milestone unit="section" n="79"/> Consequently it was not
merely in cases where respect for persons prevented
direct speaking (a circumstance which as a rule calls
for caution rather than <hi rend="italics">figures</hi>) that they would
have recourse to <hi rend="italics">figurative</hi> methods, but they made
room for them even under circumstances where they
were useless or morally inadmissible, as for example
in a case where a father, who had secretly slain his
son whom he suspected of incest with his mother,

<pb id="p.425"/>

and was accused of ill-treating his wife, was made to
bring indirect insinuations against his wife.<milestone unit="section" n="80"/> But
what could be more discreditable to the accused than
that he should have kept such a wife? What could
be more damaging than that he who is accused
because he appears to have harboured the darkest
suspicions against his wife, should by his defence
confirm the charge which he is required to refute?
If such speakers had only placed themselves in the
position of the judges, they would have realised how
little disposed they would have been to put up with
pleading on such lines, more especially in cases
where the most abominable crimes were insinuated
against parents.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="81"/>However, since we have lighted on this topic, let
us devote a little more time to considering the
practice of the schools. For it is in the schools that
the orator is trained, and the methods adopted in
pleading ultimately depend on the methods employed
in declamation. I must therefore say something
of those numerous cases in which <hi rend="italics">figures</hi> have been
employed which were not merely harsh, but actually
contrary to the interests of the case. <quote>A man condemned for attempting to establish himself as tyrant
shall be tortured to make him reveal the names of
his accomplices. The accuser shall choose what
reward he pleases. A certain man has secured the
condemnation of his father and demands as his
reward that he should not be tortured. The father
opposes his choice.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="82"/> Everyone who pleaded for the
father indulged in <hi rend="italics">figurative</hi> insinuations against the
son, on the assumption that the father would, when
tortured, be likely to name him as one of his accomplices. But what could be more foolish? For as

<pb id="p.427"/>

soon as the judges grasp their point, they will either
refuse to put him to the torture in view of his
motive for desiring to be tortured, or will refuse to
believe any confession he may make under torture.
But, it will be urged,<milestone unit="section" n="83"/> it is possible that this was his
motive. May be. But he should then disguise his
motive, in order that he may effect his purpose.
But what will it profit us (and by <hi rend="italics">us</hi> I mean
the declaimers) to have realised this motive, unless
we declare it as well? Well, then, if the case
were being actually pleaded in the courts, should we
have disclosed this secret motive in such a way?
Again, if this is not the real motive, the condemned
man may have other reasons for opposing his son;
he may think that the law should be carried out
or be unwilling to accept such a kindness from the
hands of his accuser, or (and this is the line on which
I personally should insist) he may intend to persist
in declaring his innocence even under torture.
<milestone unit="section" n="84"/>Consequently the usual excuse advanced by such
declaimers to the effect that the inventor of the
theme meant the defence to proceed on these lines,
will not always serve their purpose. It is possible
that this was not the inventor's wish. However, let
us assume that it was. Are we then to speak like
fools merely because he thought like a fool? Personally I hold that, even in actual cases, we should
often disregard the wishes of the litigant.<milestone unit="section" n="85"/> Further,
in such cases speakers fall into the frequent error of
assuming that certain persons say one thing and
mean another: this is more especially the case where
it is assumed that a man asks permission to die.
Take, for example, the following controversial theme.
<quote>A man who had shown himself a heroic soldier in

<pb id="p.429"/>

the past, on the occasion of a subsequent war
demanded exemption from service in accordance
with the law, on the ground that he was fifty years
of age, but exemption being refused owing to the
opposition of his son, he deserted on being compelled to go into the fight. The son, who had borne
himself like a hero in the same battle, asks for his
father's pardon as a reward. The father opposes
his choice.</quote> <quote>Yes,</quote> they say, <quote>that is due not to
his desire to die, but to bring odium on his son.</quote>
For my part,<milestone unit="section" n="86"/> I laugh at the fears which they manifest
on his behalf, as though they were in peril of death
themselves, and at the way in which they allow their
terror to influence their line of pleading; for they
forget how many precedents there are for suicide
and how many reasons there may be why a hero
turned deserter should wish for death.<milestone unit="section" n="87"/> But it would
be waste of time to expatiate on one controversial
theme. I would lay it down as a general rule that an
orator should never put forward a plea that is tantamount to collusion, and I cannot imagine a lawsuit
arising in which both parties have the same design,
nor conceive that any man who wishes to live could
be such a fool as to put forward an absurd plea for
death, when he might refrain from pleading for it at
all.<note>The father does not wish to die, but merely to bring
odium on his son, <hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> he is saying one thing and meaning
another, for his real desire is to save his life. Consequently,
despite their quarrel, both parties are aiming at the same
thing, the saving of the father, while the father's plea is
practically tantamount to collusion (<hi rend="italics">praevaricatio</hi>) with his
opponent.</note> I do not, however,<milestone unit="section" n="88"/> deny that there are controversial themes of this kind where <hi rend="italics">figures</hi> may
legitimately be employed, as, for example, the
following: <quote>A man was accused of unnatural
murder on the ground that he had killed his brother,
and it seemed probable that he would be condemned.
His father gave evidence in his defence, stating
that the murder had been committed on his orders.
The son was acquitted, but disinherited by the

<pb id="p.431"/>

father.</quote> For in this case he does not pardon his son
entirely, but cannot openly withdraw the evidence
that he gave in the first trial, and while he does not
inflict any worse penalty than disinheritance, he does
not shrink from that. Further, the employment of
the <hi rend="italics">figure</hi> tells more heavily against the father than
is fair and less against the son.<note>The sense is quite uncertain. The simplest interpretation is perhaps that the father's action and the <hi rend="italics">figura</hi> by
which he defends himself show that his evidence in the
previous trial was false. The son has been acquitted on the
father's evidence, and the father by punishing him has put
himself in a hopelessly false position.</note><milestone unit="section" n="89"/> But, while no one
ever speaks against the view which he wishes to
prevail, he may wish something of greater importance than what he actually says. Thus the
disinherited son who asks his father to take back
another son whom he had exposed, and who had
been brought up by himself, on payment for his
maintenance, while he may prefer that he himself
should be reinstated, may all the same be perfectly
sincere in his demand on behalf of his brother.
Again, a kind of tacit hint may be employed, which,<milestone unit="section" n="90"/>
while demanding the utmost rigour of the law from
the judges, suggests a loophole for clemency, not
openly, for that would imply a pledge on our part,
but by giving a plausible suspicion of our meaning.
This device is employed in a number of controversial
themes, among them the following. <quote>A ravisher,
unless within thirty days he secure pardon both
from his own father and the father of the ravished
girl, shall be put to death. A man who has
succeeded in securing pardon from the father of the
girl, but not from his own, accuses the latter of
madness.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="91"/> Here if the father pledges himself to
pardon him, the dispute falls to the ground. If, on
the other hand, he holds out no hope of pardon,
though he will not necessarily be regarded as mad,
he will certainly give the impression of cruelty and
will prejudice the judge against him. Latro

<pb id="p.433"/>

therefore showed admirable skill when he made the son
say, <quote>You will kill me then?</quote> and the father reply,
<quote>Yes, if I can.</quote><note><hi rend="italics">Si potero</hi> is ambiguous. It might mean <quote>If I have the
heart to do so.</quote> Here lies the loophole for clemency to
which Quintilian has referred.</note> The elder Gallio treats the theme
with greater tenderness, as was natural to a man of
his disposition. He makes the father say, <quote>Be firm,
my heart, be firm. Yesterday you were made of
sterner stuff.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="92"/> Akin to this are those <hi rend="italics">figures</hi> of
which the Greeks are so fond, by means of which
they give gentle expression to unpleasing facts.
Themistocles, for example, is believed to have urged
the Athenians to commit their city to the protection
of heaven, because to urge them to abandon it would
have been too brutal an expression. Again the
statesman<note>Unknown.</note> who advised that certain golden images
of Victory should be melted down as a contribution
to the war funds, modified his words by saying that
they should make a proper use of their victories.
But all such devices which consist in saying one
thing, while intending something else to be understood, have a strong resemblance to <hi rend="italics">allegory.</hi></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="93"/>It has also been asked how <hi rend="italics">figures</hi> may best be
met. Some hold that they should always be
exposed by the antagonist, just as hidden ulcers
are laid open by the surgeon. It is true that
this is often the right course, being the only means
of refuting the charges which have been brought
against us, and this is more especially the case
when the question turns on the very point at which
the <hi rend="italics">figures</hi> are directed. But when the <hi rend="italics">figures</hi> are
merely employed as vehicles of abuse, it will sometimes even be wisest to show that we have a clear
conscience by ignoring them.<milestone unit="section" n="94"/> Nay, even if too
many figures have been used to permit us to take
such a course, we may ask our opponents, if they

<pb id="p.435"/>

have any confidence in the righteousness of their
cause, to give frank and open expression to the
charges which they have attempted to suggest by
indirect hints, or at any rate to refrain from asking
the judges not merely to understand, but even to
believe things which they themselves are afraid to
state in so many words.<milestone unit="section" n="95"/> It may even at times be
found useful to pretend to misunderstand them; for
which we may compare the well known story of the
man who, when his opponent cried, <quote>Swear by
the ashes of your father,</quote><note>See v. vi. 1. An oath might be taken by one of the
parties as an alternative to evidence. In court such an
oath might be taken only on the proposal of the defendant.
The taking of such a proffered oath meant victory for the
swearer.</note> replied that he was
ready to do so, whereupon the judge accepted the
proposal, much to the indignation of the advocate,
who protested that this would make the use of
<hi rend="italics">figures</hi> absolutely impossible; we may therefore lay
it down as a general rule that such <hi rend="italics">figures</hi> should
only be used with the utmost caution.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="96"/>There remains the third class of figure designed
merely to enhance the elegance of our style, for
which reason Cicero expresses the opinion that such
<hi rend="italics">figures</hi> are independent of the subject in dispute.
As an illustration I may quote the <hi rend="italics">figure</hi> which he
uses in his speech<note>Lost. An allusion presumably to the occasion when
Clodius was found disguised as a woman at the mysteries
of the Bona Dea.</note> against Clodius: <quote>By these
means he, being familiar with all our holy rites,
thought that he might easily succeed in appeasing
the gods.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="97"/> <hi rend="italics">Irony</hi> also is frequently employed in
this connexion. But by far the most artistic device

<pb id="p.437"/>

is to indicate one thing by allusion to another; take
the case where a rival candidate speaks against an
ex-tyrant who had abdicated on condition of his
receiving an amnesty<note>An example of this theme is preserved in the elder
Seneca, Excerpt. controv. 5, 8. One candidate is permitted
to speak against another. A tyrant has abdicated on
condition of an amnesty and that any one who charged him
with having been a tyrant should be liable to capital punishment. The ex-tyrant stands for a magistracy. The rival
candidate speaks against him. The irony is in the last
sentence.</note>: <quote>I am not permitted to
speak against you. Do you speak against me, as
you may. But a little while ago I wished to kill
you.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="98"/> Another common device is to introduce an
oath, like the speaker who, in defending a disinherited man, cried, <quote>So may I die leaving a son
to be my heir.</quote><note>By this wish he expresses his disapproval of such acts as
the disinheritance of a son.</note> But this is not a <hi rend="italics">figure</hi> which
is much to be recommended, for as a rule the
introduction of an oath, unless it is absolutely
necessary, is scarcely becoming to a self-respecting
man. Seneca made a neat comment to this
effect when he said that oaths were for the
witness and not for the advocate. Again, the
advocate who drags in an oath merely for the sake
of some trivial rhetorical effect, does not deserve
much credit, unless he can do this with the
masterly effect achieved by Demosthenes, which I
mentioned above.<note>&sect;62.</note><milestone unit="section" n="99"/> But by far the most trivial form
of <hi rend="italics">figure</hi> is that which turns on a single word,
although we find such a figure directed against
Clodia by Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">pro Cael.</hi> xiii. 32. The <quote>word</quote> is <hi rend="italics">amica,</hi> which means
either <quote>mistress</quote> or <quote>friend.</quote></note>: <quote>Especially when everybody
thought her the friend of all men rather than the
enemy of any.</quote></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="100"/>I note that <hi rend="italics">comparison</hi> is also regarded as a <hi rend="italics">figure,</hi>
although at times it is a form of proof,<note>See v. xi. 32 (where for <hi rend="italics">hredem</hi> read <hi rend="italics">heredi</hi> with MSS.)
<quote>The man to whom the usufruct of a house has been left
will not restore it in the interests of the heir if it collapses:
just as he would not replace a slave if he should die.</quote></note> and at others
the whole case may turn upon it,<note><hi rend="italics">E.g.</hi> when the accused admits that he is guilty of a
crime, but seeks to show that his wrongdoing was the cause
of greater good.</note> while its form
may be illustrated by the following passage from

<pb id="p.439"/>

the <hi rend="italics">pro Murena:</hi><note><hi rend="italics">pro Muren.</hi> ix. 22.</note> <quote>You pass wakeful nights that
you may be able to reply to your clients; he that he
and his army may arrive betimes at their destination. You are roused by cockcrow, he by the
bugle's reveille,</quote> and so on.<milestone unit="section" n="101"/> I am not sure, however, whether it is so much a <hi rend="italics">figure of thought</hi> as of
<hi rend="italics">speech.</hi> For the only difference lies in the fact that
universals are not contrasted with universals, but
particulars with particulars. Celsus, however, and
that careful writer Visellius regard it as a <hi rend="italics">figure of
thought,</hi> while Rutilius Lupus regards it as belonging
to both, and calls it <hi rend="italics">antithesis.</hi></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="102"/>To the <hi rend="italics">figures</hi> placed by Cicero among the ornaments of thought Rutilius (following the views of
Gorgias, a contemporary, whose four books he
transferred to his own work, and who is not to be
confused with Georgias of Leontini) and Celsus
(who follows Rutilius) would add a number of
others, such as:<milestone unit="section" n="103"/> <hi rend="italics">concentration,</hi> which the Greek calls
<foreign lang="greek">diallagh/</foreign><note><foreign lang="greek">diallagh/</foreign> is corrupt, but the correct term has not yet
been discovered. <hi rend="italics">MSS.</hi> <foreign lang="greek">*d*i*a*m*a*t*h*n, *d*i*a*m*a*p*h*n,</foreign> etc.</note> a term employed when a number of
different arguments are used to establish one point:
<hi rend="italics">consequence,</hi> which Gorgias calls <foreign lang="greek">e)pakolou/qhsis</foreign> and
which I have already discussed under the head
of argument<note>See v. xiv. 1.</note>: <hi rend="italics">inference,</hi> which Gorgias terms
<foreign lang="greek">sullogismo/s</foreign> <hi rend="italics">threats,</hi> that is, <foreign lang="greek">kata/plhcis</foreign> <hi rend="italics">exhortation,</hi>
or <foreign lang="greek">parainetiko/n</foreign> But all of these are perfectly
straightforward methods of speaking, unless combined with some one of the <hi rend="italics">figures</hi> which I have
discussed above.<milestone unit="section" n="104"/> Besides these, Celsus considers
the following to be <hi rend="italics">figures:</hi> exclusion, asseveration,
refusal,<note>The meaning of detrectare is uncertain It may mean <quote>refuse to deal with some topic,</quote> or simply <quote>detract.</quote></note> excitement of the judge, the use of
proverbs, the employment of quotations from poetry,
jests, invidious remarks or invocation to intensify a
charge (which is identical with <foreign lang="greek">dei/nwsis</foreign>) flattery,

<pb id="p.441"/>

pardon, disdain, admonition, apology, entreaty and
rebuke.<milestone unit="section" n="105"/> He even includes partition, proposition,
division and affinity between two separate things,
by which latter he means that two things
apparently different signify the same: for example,
not only the man who murders another by administering a deadly draught is to be regarded as
a poisoner, but also the man who deprives another
of his wits by giving him some drug, a point which
depends on <hi rend="italics">definition.</hi><milestone unit="section" n="106"/> To these Rutilius or
Gorgias add <foreign lang="greek">a)nagkai=on</foreign> that is, the representation
of the necessity of a thing, <foreign lang="greek">a)na/mnhsis</foreign> or reminding,
<foreign lang="greek">a)nqupofora/</foreign> that is, replying to anticipated objections, <foreign lang="greek">a)nti/r)r(hsis</foreign> or refutation, <foreign lang="greek">parau/chsis</foreign> or
amplification, <foreign lang="greek">proe/kqesis</foreign> which means pointing out
what ought to have been done, and then what
actually has been done, <foreign lang="greek">e)nantio/ths,</foreign> or arguments
from opposites<note>See IX. iii. 90. For enthymemes <foreign lang="greek">kat' e)nati/wsin,</foreign> see v.
xiv. 2. and note on <hi rend="italics">ex pugnantibus,</hi> Vol. II. p. 524.</note> (whence we get <hi rend="italics">enthymemes</hi> styled
<foreign lang="greek">kat' e)nanti/wsin</foreign>), and even <foreign lang="greek">meta/lhyis,</foreign> which Hermagoras considers a <hi rend="italics">basis.</hi><note>See III. vi. 46. The term is not used here in the same
sense as in VIII. vi. 37, but rather = <hi rend="italics">translatio,</hi> see III. vi. 23.
Lit. <hi rend="italics">translatio</hi> means <quote>transference of the charge</quote>: the
sense is virtually the same as that of <hi rend="italics">exceptio</hi> (a plea made
by defendant in bar of plaintiffs action). <quote>Competence</quote> is
perhaps the least unsatisfactory rendering.</note> Visellius, although he
makes the number of <hi rend="italics">figures</hi> but small, includes
among them the <hi rend="italics">enthymeme,</hi> which he calls
<hi rend="italics">commentum,</hi> and the <hi rend="italics">epicheireme,</hi> which he calls <hi rend="italics">ratio.</hi><note>See note on v. xiv. 5, Vol. II. p. 524.</note>
This view is also partially accepted by Celsus, who
is in doubt whether <hi rend="italics">consequence</hi> is not to be identified with the <hi rend="italics">epicheireme.</hi><milestone unit="section" n="107"/> Visellius also adds
<hi rend="italics">general reflexions</hi> to the list. I find others who
would add to these <foreign lang="greek">diaskeuh/</foreign><note>Apparently some form of exaggeration.</note> or enhancement,
<foreign lang="greek">a)pago/reusis</foreign> or prohibition, and <foreign lang="greek">paradih/ghsis</foreign> or
incidental narrative. But though these are not
figures, there may be others which have slipped
my notice, or are yet to be invented: still, they
will be of the same nature as those of which I have
spoken above.</p>

<pb id="p.443"/>

<p>III. <hi rend="italics">Figures of speech</hi> have always been liable to
change and are continually in process of change in
accordance with the variations of usage. Consequently when we compare the language of our
ancestors with our own, we find that practically everything we say nowadays is <hi rend="italics">figurative.</hi> For example,
we say <hi rend="italics">invidere hac re</hi> for to <quote>grudge a thing,</quote>
instead of <hi rend="italics">hanc rem,</hi> which was the idiom of all the
ancients, more especially Cicero, and <hi rend="italics">incumbere illi</hi>
(to lean upon him) for <hi rend="italics">incumbere in ilium, plenum vino</hi>
(full of wine) for <hi rend="italics">plenum vini,</hi> and <hi rend="italics">huic adulari</hi> (to flatter
him) for <hi rend="italics">hunc adulari.</hi> I might quote a thousand
other examples, and only wish I could say that the
changes were not often changes for the worse.<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But
to proceed, <hi rend="italics">figures of speech</hi> fall into two main
classes. One is defined as the form of language,
while the other is mainly to be sought in the
arrangement of words. Both are equally applicable
in oratory, but we may style the former rather more
grammatical and the latter more rhetorical.<note>These grammatical figures would not be styled <quote>figures
of speech</quote> in English. <quote>Figures of language</quote> would
perhaps be more comprehensive, but <quote>figures of speech</quote> is
the translation and direct descendant of the original Greek
<foreign lang="greek">sxh/mata le/cews</foreign> and has therefore been used throughout.</note>
The former originates from the same sources as
errors of language. For every <hi rend="italics">figure</hi> of this kind
would be an error, if it were accidental and not
deliberate.<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But as a rule such <hi rend="italics">figures</hi> are defended by
authority, age and usage, and not infrequently by some
reason as well. Consequently, although they involve
a divergence from direct and simple language, they
are to be regarded as excellences, provided always
that they have some praiseworthy precedent to
follow. They have one special merit, that they relieve the tedium of everyday stereotyped speech and
save us from commonplace language.<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> If a speaker
use them sparingly and only as occasion demands,
they will serve as a seasoning to his style and

<pb id="p.445"/>

increase its attractions. If, on the other hand, he
strains after them overmuch, he will lose that very
charm of variety which they confer. Some figures,
however, are so generally accepted that they have
almost ceased to be regarded as figures: consequently
however frequently they may be used, they will
make less impression on the ear, just because it has
become habituated to them.<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For abnormal <hi rend="italics">figures</hi>
lying outside the range of common speech, while
they are for that very reason more striking, and
stimulate the ear by their novelty, prove cloying if
used too lavishly, and make it quite clear that they
did not present themselves naturally to the speaker,
but were hunted out by him, dragged from obscure
corners and artificially piled together.
<hi rend="italics">Figures,</hi> then,<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> may be found in connexion with the
gender of nouns; for we find <hi rend="italics">oculis capti talpale</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Georg.</hi> i. 183.</note>
(blind moles) and <hi rend="italics">timidi damae</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Ecl.</hi> viii. 28.</note> (timid deer) in Virgil;
but there is good reason for this, since in these
cases both sexes are covered by a word of one gender,
and there is no doubt that there are male moles
and deer as well as female. <hi rend="italics">Figures</hi> may also affect
verbs: for example, we find such phrases <hi rend="italics">as fabricatus
est glatdium</hi><note>Cic. <hi rend="italics">pro Rab Post.</hi> iii. 7. <quote>He made a sword.</quote></note> or <hi rend="italics">inimicum poenitus es.</hi><note><hi rend="italics">pro Mil.</hi> xiii. 33. <quote>You punished an enemy.</quote></note><milestone unit="section" n="7"/> This is the less
surprising, since the nature of verbs is such that we
often express the active by the passive form, as in the
case of <hi rend="italics">arbitror</hi> (think) and <hi rend="italics">suspicor</hi> (suspect), and
the passive by the active, as in the case of <hi rend="italics">vapulo</hi>
(am beaten). Consequently the interchange of the
two forms is of common occurrence, and in many
cases either form can be used: for example, we may
say <hi rend="italics">luxuriatur</hi> or <hi rend="italics">luxuriat</hi> (luxuriate), <hi rend="italics">fluctuatur</hi> or
<hi rend="italics">fluctuat</hi> (fluctuate), <hi rend="italics">adsentior</hi> or <hi rend="italics">adsentio</hi> (agree).
<hi rend="italics">Figures</hi> also occur in connexion with number,<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> as

<pb id="p.447"/>

when the plural follows the singular, as in the
phrase <hi rend="italics">gladio pugnacissima gens Romani</hi> (the Romans
are a nation that fight fiercely with the sword); for
<hi rend="italics">gens</hi> is a singular noun indicating multitude. Or the
singular may follow the plural, as in the following
instance,

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>qui non risere parentes</l>
<l>nec deus hunc mensa dea nec dignata cubili est,</l></quote> <bibl><hi rend="italics">Ecl.</hi> iv. 62.<note>Those that have never smiled on their
parents, neither does any god honour him by admitting him
to his feats nor goddess deem him worthy of her bed."
Although there can be no doubt as to the correctness of
Politian's emendation in the passage as quoted here, it is
against all MSS. authority, both of Virgil and Quintilian,
and it is still frequently held that Virgil wrote <hi rend="italics">cui.</hi></note></bibl></cit></quote>

where  <quote>he whom no goddess deems,</quote> etc., is included
among <quote>those who have never smiled,</quote> etc.<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> In a
satire again we read,

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>nostrum istud vivere triste aspxei,</l></quote> <bibl><hi rend="italics">Pers.</hi> i. 9.<note><quote>I look at our dreary way of living.</quote></note></bibl></cit></quote>

where the infinitive is used as a noun: for the poet
by <hi rend="italics">nostrum vivere</hi> means <hi rend="italics">nostram vitam.</hi> We also at
times use the verb for the participle, as in the phrase,

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>magnum dat ferre talentum,</l></quote> <bibl><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> v. 248.<note><quote>He gives him a great talent-weight to
carry.</quote></note></bibl></cit></quote>

where <hi rend="italics">ferre</hi> is used for <hi rend="italics">ferendum,</hi> or the participle
may be used for the verb, as in the phrase <hi rend="italics">volo datum</hi>
(I wish to give).</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>At times, again, there may be some doubt as
to the precise error which a figure resembles. Take,
for example, the phrase

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>virtus est vitium fugere,</l></quote> <bibl> Hor. <hi rend="italics">Ep.</hi> I. i. 41. <note><quote>'Tis a virtue to shun vice.</quote></note></bibl></cit></quote>

where the writer has either changed the parts of
speech (making his phrase a variant for <hi rend="italics">virtus est</hi>

<pb id="p.449"/>

<hi rend="italics">fuga vitiorum</hi>), or the cases (in which case it will be
a variant for <hi rend="italics">virtutis est vitium fugere);</hi> but whichever
be the case, the <hi rend="italics">figure</hi> is far more vigorous than
either. At times <hi rend="italics">figures</hi> are joined, as in <hi rend="italics">Sthenelus
sciens pugnae,</hi><note>Hor. <hi rend="italics">Od.</hi> I. xv. 24. <quote>Sthenelus skilled in fight.</quote></note> which is substituted for <hi rend="italics">Sthenelus scilus
pugnandi.</hi> Tenses too are interchangeable.<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> For
example, <hi rend="italics">Timarchides negat esse ei periculum a seuri</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Verr.</hi> v. xliv. 116. <quote>Timarchides denies that he is in any
danger from the axe of the executioner.</quote></note>
the present <hi rend="italics">negat</hi> is substituted for the past. Or
one mood may be used for another, as in the phrase,
<hi rend="italics">hoc Ithacus velit.</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> ii. 104. <quote>So wills the Ithacan.</quote> On Quintilian's
view <hi rend="italics">velit</hi> here = <hi rend="italics">vult.</hi> But in point of fact this is untrue,
since in the context it clearly means <quote>would wish.</quote></note> In fact, to cut a long matter short,
there is a <hi rend="italics">figure</hi> corresponding to every form of
solecism.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>There is also a <hi rend="italics">figure</hi> styled <foreign lang="greek">e(teroi/wsis</foreign> (i.e. alteration of the normal idiom), which bears a strong
resemblance to <foreign lang="greek">e)callagh/.</foreign> For example, we find in
Sallust phrases such as <hi rend="italics">neque ea res failsum me habuit</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Jug.</hi> x. 1. <quote>Nor did this deceive me.</quote></note>
and <hi rend="italics">duci probare.</hi><note>From a lost work. Without the context the meaning is
uncertain.</note> Such <hi rend="italics">figures</hi> as a rule aim not
merely at novelty, but at conciseness as well.
Hence we get further developments, such as <hi rend="italics">non
paeniturum</hi> for <quote>not intending to repent,</quote> and <hi rend="italics">visuros</hi>
for <quote>sent to see,</quote> both found in the same author.
<milestone unit="section" n="13"/>These may have been figures when Sallust made
them; but it is a question whether they can now be
so considered, since they have met with such general
acceptance. For we are in the habit of accepting
common parlance as sufficient authority where current
phrases are concerned: for example, <hi rend="italics">rebus agentibus</hi>
in the sense of <hi rend="italics">while this was going on,</hi> which
Pollio rebukes Labienus<note>See IV. i. 11; I. V. 8.</note> for using, has become an
accredited idiom, as has <hi rend="italics">contumeliam fecit,</hi> which, as is

<pb id="p.451"/>

well known, is stigmatised by Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">Phil.</hi> III. ix. 22. Quintilian appears <hi rend="italics">primafacie</hi> to regard
the phrase as meaning <quote>to suffer insult.</quote> But in Plautus
and Terence it means to <quote>inflict an insult,</quote> and Quintilian
probably quotes the phrase in this sense. He should, however, have said <hi rend="italics">adficere,</hi> not <hi rend="italics">adfici,</hi> to make his meaning clear.</note>: for in his day
they said <hi rend="italics">ad fici contumelia.</hi><milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Figures may also be
commended by their antiquity, for which Virgil had
such a special passion. Compare his

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>vel cum se pavidum contra mea iurgia iactat</l></quote> <bibl><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> xi. 400.<note>The figure consists in the use of <hi rend="italics">vel cum</hi>
to introduce an independent sentence. <quote>Even when he
claims, to tremble at my taunts.</quote></note></bibl></cit></quote>

or

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>progeniem sed enim Troiano a sanguine duci</l>
<l>audierat.</l></quote> <bibl><hi rend="italics">An.</hi> i. 19.

<note><quote rend="blockquote"><l>But she had heard that even now a race</l>
<l>Was springing from the blood of fallen Troy.</l></quote>

Quintilian refers to the archaic <hi rend="italics">sed enim.</hi></note></bibl></cit></quote>

Numerous instances of the same kind might be cited
from the old tragic and comic poets.<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> One word of
this type has remained in common use, namely
<hi rend="italics">enimvero.</hi> I might further quote from the same
author

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>nam quis te iuvenum confidentissime,</l></quote> <bibl><hi rend="italics">Georg.</hi> iv. 445. <note><quote>For who bade thee, of youths most
bold.</quote></note> The figure consists in the opening of a speech with
<hi rend="italics">nam,</hi> or perhaps rather in saying <hi rend="italics">nam quis</hi> for <hi rend="italics">quisnam.</hi></bibl></cit></quote>

words which form the beginning of a speech: or

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>tam magis illa tremens et tristibus etffra flammis,</l>
<l>quam magis effuso crudescunt sanguine pugnae.</l></quote> <bibl><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> vii. 787.</bibl></cit></quote>

<quote rend="blockquote">
<quote><l>The more the strife with bloodshed rages wild,</l>
<l>The more it quivers and with baleful fire</l>
<l>Glows fiercer.</l></quote></quote>

There the sentence inverts the natural order which
may be illustrated by <hi rend="italics">quam magis aerumna urgent, tam
magis ad malefaciendumn viget.</hi><note>The source of the quotation is unknown. <quote>The more
calamity oppresses him, the greater his vigour for evil

<p><milestone unit="section" n="16"/>Old writers are full of such usages. At the

beginning of the <hi rend="italics">Eunuchus</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Eun.</hi> I. i. 1. <quote>What shall I do then?</quote></note> of Terence we have <hi rend="italics">quid
igitur faciam,</hi> while another comic poet says <hi rend="italics">ain
tandem leno?</hi><note>The poet is unknown. <quote>Do you agree then, you
pimp?</quote> The figure in this and the preceding instance lies
in the idiomatic use of <hi rend="italics">igitur</hi> and <hi rend="italics">tandem.</hi></note> Catullus in his <hi rend="italics">Epithalamium</hi> writes:

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>dum innupta manet, dum cara suis est,</l></quote> <bibl>Cat. lxii. 45. <note><quote>While she remains unwed, so long is
she dear to her own.</quote> Such is Quintilian's interpretation.
The line, however, runs <hi rend="italics">sic virgo, dum intacta</hi> (MSS. of
Catullus), <hi rend="italics">etc.,</hi> and is most naturally interpreted: <quote>Even so
(<hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> like to a perfect blossom) is the maiden, while she remains
unblemished and dear to her own.</quote></note></bibl></cit></quote>

where the first <hi rend="italics">dum</hi> means <hi rend="italics">while,</hi> and the second
means <hi rend="italics">so long.</hi><milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Sallust, on the other hand, borrows
a number of idioms from the Greek, such as
<hi rend="italics">vulgus amat fieri:</hi><note><quote>Such things as the people love to see done.</quote> Not
found in Sallust's extant works. But cp. <hi rend="italics">Jug. 34: ira amat
fieri.</hi></note> the same is true of Horace, who
strongly approves of the practice. Compare his

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>nec ciceris net longae invidit avenae.</l></quote> <bibl><hi rend="italics">Sat.</hi> II. vi. 83. <note><quote>Nor grudged him vetches nor the

Virgil<note><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> i. 67. <quote>He sails the Tyrrhene deep.</quote> The
internal ace. after the intrans. <hi rend="italics">navigat</hi> is treated as a
Graecism, as is ace. of part concerned after <hi rend="italics">saucius.</hi></note> does the same in phrases such as

<quote rend="blockquote">
<l>Tyrrhenum navigat aequor</l></quote>

or <hi rend="italics">saucius pectus</hi> (<quote>wounded at heart</quote>), an idiom
which has now become familiar in the public gazette.
<milestone unit="section" n="18"/>Under the same class of figure falls that of
addition, which, although the words added may be
strictly superfluous, may still be far from inelegant.
Take, for example,

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>nam neque Parnasi vobis iuga, nam neque Pindi,</l></quote> <bibl><hi rend="italics">Ecl.</hi> x. 11: <note><quote>For neither did Parnassus slope, nor yet/
The slopes of Pindus make delay for you.</quote></note></bibl></cit></quote>

<pb id="p.455"/>

where the second <hi rend="italics">nam</hi> might be omitted. And we
find in Horace,<note>Hor. <hi rend="italics">Od.</hi> I. xii. 40. <quote>And Fabricius, him and Cato
with locks unshorn.</quote></note>

<quote rend="blockquote">
<l>Fabriciumcque,</l>
<l>hunc et intonsis Curium capillis.</l></quote>

Similarly, words are omitted, a device which may be
either a blemish or a <hi rend="italics">figure,</hi> according to the context.
The following is an example:

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>accede ad ignen, iam calesces plus satis;</l></quote> <bibl> Ter. <hi rend="italics">Eun.</hi> I. ii. 5. <note><quote>Draw near the fire and you shall
be more than warm enough.</quote></note></bibl></cit></quote>

for the full phrase would be <hi rend="italics">plus quam satis.</hi> There
is, however, another form of omission which requires
treatment at greater length.<note>The sense is obscure. The words are either an interpolation or illustrative matter has been lost.</note></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="19"/>We frequently use the comparative for the
positive, as, for example, when a man speaks of
himself as being <hi rend="italics">infirmior</hi> (rather indisposed).
Sometimes we join two comparatives, as in the
following passage<note><hi rend="italics">Cat.</hi> I. ii. 5. <quote>If I were to give orders that you should
he apprehended and put to death, I think I should have
reason to fear that all good citizens would regard my action
as too tardy rather than that anyone would assert that it
was too cruel.</quote></note>: <hi rend="italics">si te, Catilina, comprehend, si
interfici iussero, credo erit verendum mihi, ne non potius
hoc ones boni serius a me qam quisquam crudelius
factum esse dicat.</hi><milestone unit="section" n="20"/> There are also <hi rend="italics">figures</hi> like the
following, which, though far from being solecisms,
alter the number and are also usually included
among <hi rend="italics">tropes.</hi> We may speak of a single thing in
the plural, as in the following instance<note><hi rend="italics">Georg.</hi> ii. 541.</note>:

<quote rend="blockquote">
<quote><l>But we have travelled o'er a boundless space;</l></quote></quote>

<pb id="p.457"/>

Or we may speak of the plural in the singular, as in
the following case<note><hi rend="italics">Georg.</hi> iii. 346.</note>:</p>

<quote rend="blockquote">
<quote><l>Like the fierce Roman in his country's arms.</l></quote></quote>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="21"/>There are others which belong to a diflfrent
species, but the same genus, such as

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>Nor let thy vineyards slope toward the west,</l></quote><bibl><hi rend="italics">Georg.</hi> ii. 298.</bibl></cit></quote>

or

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l part="F">In that hour</l>
<l>Be it not mine beneath the open sky</l>
<l>To court soft sleep nor on the forest ridge</l>
<l>Amid the grass to lie.</l></quote><bibl><hi rend="italics">Georg.</hi> iii. 435.</bibl></cit></quote>

For in the first of these passages he is not advising
some other person, nor exhorting himself in the
second, his advice in both passages being meant for
all. Sometimes, again, we speak of ourselves as
though we were referring to others, as in phrases
like, <quote>Servius asserts, Tullius denies it.</quote><note><hi rend="italics">i. e. I, Cicero, deny it.</hi> Halm suggests that the passage
comes from an unpublished portion of his speech in defence
of Murena. <hi rend="italics">cp. Pro Mur.</hi> xxvii. 57.</note><milestone unit="section" n="22"/> At
other times we speak in the first person instead of
in another, or substitute one person for another.
Both devices are employed together in the <hi rend="italics">pro
Caecina,</hi> where Cicero, addressing Piso, the counsel
for the prosecution, says, <quote>You asserted that you
reinstated me: I deny that you did so in accordance
with the praetor's edict.</quote><note><hi rend="italics">pro Caec.</hi> xxix. 82.</note> The actual truth is that
it was Aebutius who asserted that he had reinstated the defendant, and Caecina who denied that
he had been restored in accordance with the
praetor's edict. We may note also a further <hi rend="italics">figure
of speech</hi> in the contracted <hi rend="italics">dixti,</hi> which has dropped
one of its syllables.<milestone unit="section" n="23"/> The following also may be

<pb id="p.459"/>

regarded as belonging to the same <hi rend="italics">genus.</hi> The first
is called <hi rend="italics">interpositio</hi> or <hi rend="italics">interclusio</hi> by us, and <hi rend="italics">parenthesis</hi>
or <hi rend="italics">paremptosis</hi> by the Greeks, and consists in the
interruption of the continuous flow of our language
by the insertion of some remark. The following
is an example: <hi rend="italics">ego cum te (mecum enim saepissime
loquilur</hi>) <hi rend="italics">patriae reddidissem.</hi><note><hi rend="italics">pro Mil.</hi> xxxiv. 94. <quote>When I had restored you&mdash;for he
often enters into conversation with me&mdash;to your country.</quote></note><milestone unit="section" n="24"/> To this they add
<hi rend="italics">hyperbaton,</hi><note>See VIII. vi. 67.</note> which they refuse to include among
<hi rend="italics">tropes.</hi> A second <hi rend="italics">figure</hi> of this kind is one closely
resembling the <hi rend="italics">figure of thought</hi> known as <hi rend="italics">apostrophe,</hi><note>See IX. ii. 38.</note>
but differing in this respect, that it changes the
form of the language and not the sense. The
following will illustrate my meaning:

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l part="F">The Decii too,</l>
<l>The Marii and Camilli, names of might,</l>
<l>The Scipios, stubborn warriors, aye, and thee,</l>
<l>Great Caesar.</l></quote><bibl><hi rend="italics">Georg.</hi> ii. 169. (Rhoades' translation).</bibl></cit></quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="25"/>There is a still more striking example in the passage
describing the death of Polydorus<note><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> iii. 55.</note>:

<quote rend="blockquote">
<quote><l>All faith he brake and Polydorus slew</l>
<l>Seizing his gold by force. Curst greed of gold,</l>
<l>To what wilt thou not drive the hearts of men?</l></quote></quote>

'Those terminologists who delight in subtle distinctions call the last figure <foreign lang="greek">meta/basis</foreign> (transition), and
hold that it may be employed in yet another way,
as in Dido's</p>

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>What do I say? Where am I?</l></quote><bibl><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> iv. 595.</bibl></cit></quote>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="26"/>Virgil has combined <hi rend="italics">apostrollphe</hi> and <hi rend="italics">parenthesis in</hi>
the well-known passage:<note><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> viii. 642.</note>

<pb id="p.461"/>

<quote rend="blockquote">
<quote><l>Next Mettus the swift cars asunder tore,</l>
<l>(Better, false Alban, hadst thou kept thy troth!)</l>
<l>And Tullus dragged the traitors' mangled limbs. . .</l></quote></quote>

These figures and the like, which consist in change,<milestone unit="section" n="27"/>
addition, omission, and the order of words, serve to
attract the attention of the audience and do not
allow it to flag, rousing it from time to time by some
specially striking figure, while they derive something
of their charm from their very resemblance to
blemishes, just as a trace of bitterness in food will
sometimes tickle the palate. But this result will
only be obtained if figures are not excessive in
number nor all of the same type or combined or
closely packed, since economy in their use, no less
than variety, will prevent the hearer being surfeited.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="28"/>There is a more striking class of figure, which does
not merely depend on the form of the language for
its effect, but lends both charm and force to the
thought as well. The first figure of this class which
calls for notice is that which is produced by <hi rend="italics">addition.</hi>
Of this there are various kinds. Words, for instance,
may be doubled with a view to amplification, as in
<quote>I have slain, I have slain, not Spurius Maelius</quote><note><hi rend="italics">Cic. pro Mil.</hi> xxvii. 72.</note>
(where the first <hi rend="italics">I have slain</hi> states what has been
done, while the second emphasises it), or to excite
pity, as in

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>Ah! Corydon, Corydon.</l></quote><bibl><hi rend="italics">Ecl.</hi> ii. 69.</bibl></cit></quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="29"/>The same figure may also sometimes be employed
ironically, with a view to disparagement. Similar to
such doubling of words is repetition following a
<hi rend="italics">parenthesis,</hi> but the effect is stronger. <quote>I have seen
the property alas! (for though all my tears are shed,

<pb id="p.463"/>

my grief still clings to me deep-rooted in my heart),
the property, I say, of Gnaeus Pompeius put up for
sale by the cruel voice of the public crier.</quote><note><hi rend="italics">Phil.</hi> II. xxvi. 64.</note> <quote>You
still live, and live not to abate your audacity, but to
increase it.</quote><note><hi rend="italics"> Cat.</hi> I. ii. 4.</note><milestone unit="section" n="30"/> Again, a number of clauses may begin
with the same word for the sake of force and emphasis. <quote>Were you unmoved by the guard set each
night upon the Palatine, unmoved by the patrolling
of the city, unmoved by the terror of the people,
unmoved by the unanimity of all good citizens, unmoved by the choice of so strongly fortified a spot
for the assembly of the senate, unmoved by the looks
and faces of those here present to-day?</quote><note>Cic. <hi rend="italics">Cat.</hi> I. i. 1.</note> Or
they may end with the same words. <quote>Who demanded them? Appius. Who produced them?
Appius.</quote><note><hi rend="italics">pro. Mil.</hi> xxii. 59.</note><milestone unit="section" n="31"/> This last instance, however, comes under
the head of another figure as well, where both
opening and concluding words are identical, since
the sentences open with <quote>who</quote> and end with
<quote>Appius.</quote> Here is another example. <quote>Who are
they who have so often broken treaties? The
Carthaginians. Who are they who have waged war
with such atrocious cruelty? The Carthaginians.
Who are they who have laid Italy waste? The
Carthaginians. Who are they who pray for pardon?
The Carthaginians.</quote><note>Auct. <hi rend="italics">ad Herenn.,</hi> iv. 14.</note><milestone unit="section" n="32"/> Again, in antitheses and comparisons the first words of alternate phrases are
frequently repeated to produce correspondence,
which was my reason for saying a little while back<note>IX. ii. 100. The passage is from <hi rend="italics">pro Murena,</hi> ix. 22.</note>
that this device came under the present topic rather
than that which I was then discussing. <quote>You pass
wakeful nights that you may be able to reply to
your clients; he that he and his army may arrive
betimes at their destination. You are roused by

<pb id="p.465"/>

cockcrow, he by the bugle's reveill&eacute;. You draw up
your legal pleas, he sets the battle in array. You
are on the watch that your clients be not taken at a
disadvantage, he that cities or camps be not so
taken.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="33"/> But the orator is not content with producing this effect, but proceeds to reverse the figure.
<quote>He knows and understands how to keep off the
forces of the enemy, you how to keep off the rainwater; he is skilled to extend boundaries, you to
delimit them.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="34"/> A similar correspondence may be
produced between the middle and the opening of a
sentence, as in the line:

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>te nemus Angitiae, vitrea te Fucinus unda.</l></quote> <bibl><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> vii. 759

<note><quote rend="blockquote">
<l>Thee did Angitia's grove bewail,</l>
<l>Thee too the glassy waves o' the Fucine lake.</l></quote>

<p>The correspondence is to be found in <hi rend="italics">te</hi> (coming first in
one and second in the other clause).</p></note></bibl></cit></quote>

Or the middle may correspond to the end, as in the
following sentence: <quote>This ship, laden with the spoil
of Sicily, while it was itself a portion of the spoil.</quote><note><hi rend="italics">Verr.</hi> v. xvii. 44.</note>
Nor will it be questioned that a like effect may be
produced by the repetition of the middle of both
clauses. Again, the end may correspond with the
beginning. <quote>Many grievous afflictions were devised
for parents and for kinsfolk many.</quote><note><hi rend="italics">Verr. v.</hi> xlv. 119.</note><milestone unit="section" n="35"/> There is also
another form of repetition which simultaneously
reiterates things that have already been said, and
draws distinctions between them.

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>Iphitus too with me and Pelias came,</l>
<l>Iphitus bowed with age and Pelias</l>
<l>Slow-limping with the wound Ulysses gave.</l></quote><bibl><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> ii. 435.</bibl></cit></quote>

This is styled <foreign lang="greek">e)pa/nodos</foreign> by the Greeks and <hi rend="italics">regression</hi>
by Roman writers.<milestone unit="section" n="38"/> Nor are words only repeated to
reaffirm the same meaning, but the repetition may
serve to mark a contrast, as in the following sentence.

<pb id="p.467"/>

<quote>The reputation of the leaders was approximately
equal, but that of their followers perhaps not so
equal.</quote><note><hi rend="italics">pro Lig.</hi> vi. 19.</note> At times the cases and genders of the
words repeated may be varied, as in <quote>Great is the
toil of speaking, and great the task, etc.</quote>;<note><hi rend="italics">pro Muren.</hi> xiii. 29.</note> a similar
instance is found in Rutilius, but in a long period.
I therefore merely cite the beginnings of the clauses.
<hi rend="italics">Pater hic tuus? patrem nunc appellas? patris tui filius
es?</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Rutil.</hi> i. x. <quote>Is this your father? Do you still call
him father? Are you your father's son?</quote></note><milestone unit="section" n="37"/> This figure may also be effected solely by
change of cases, a proceeding which the Greeks call
<foreign lang="greek">polu/ptwton</foreign> It may also be produced in other ways,
as in the <hi rend="italics">pro Cluentio:</hi><note>lx. 167. <quote>But what was the time chosen for giving the
poison? Was it on that day? Amid such a crowd? And
who was selected to administer it? Where was it got? <hi rend="italics">How</hi>
was the cup intercepted? Why was it not given a second
time?</quote></note> <hi rend="italics">Quod autem tempus veneni dandi?
illo die? illa frequentia? per quem porro datum? unde
sumptum? quae porro interceptio poculi? cur non de
integro autem datum?</hi><milestone unit="section" n="38"/> The combination of different
details is called <foreign lang="greek">metabolh\n</foreign> by Caecilius, and may be
exemplified by the following passage directed against
Oppianicus in the <hi rend="italics">pro Cluentio:</hi><note>xiv. 41.</note> <quote>The local senate
were unanimously of opinion that he had falsified the
public registers at Larinum; no one would have any
business dealings or make any contract with him,
no one out of all his numerous relations and kinsfolk
ever appointed him as guardian to his children,</quote>
with much more to the same effect.<milestone unit="section" n="39"/> In this case the
details are massed together, but they may equally be
distributed or <hi rend="italics">dissipated,</hi> as I think Cicero says. For
example:

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>Here corn, there grapes, elsewhere the growth<lb/>
of trees</l>
<l>More freely rises,</l></quote><bibl><hi rend="italics">Georg.</hi> i. 54.</bibl></cit></quote>

with the remainder of the passage.<milestone unit="section" n="40"/> A wonderful

<pb id="p.469"/>

mixture of figures may be found in Cicero<note>From the lost speech against Q. Metellus.</note> in the
following passage, where the first word is repeated
last after a long interval, while the middle corresponds with the beginning, and the concluding words
with the middle. <quote>Yours is the work which we
find here, conscript fathers, not mine, a fine piece of
work too, but, as I have said, not mine, but yours.</quote>
This frequent repetition, which,<milestone unit="section" n="41"/> as I have said, is
produced by a mixture of figures, is called <foreign lang="greek">plokh\</foreign> by
the Greeks: a letter of Cicero<note>Now lost.</note> to Brutus will provide a further example. <quote>When I had made my
peace with Appius Claudius and made it through the
agency of Gnaeus Pompeius, when then I had made
my peace,</quote> etc.<milestone unit="section" n="42"/> The like effect may be produced
in the same sentence by repeating the same words
in different forms, as in Persius:

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l part="F">Is then to know in thee</l>
<l>Nothing unless another know thou knowest?</l></quote><bibl> i. 26. The translation is Watson's.</bibl></cit></quote>

and in Cicero,<note>Origin unknown.</note> where he says, <quote>For it was impossible for the judges as well to be condemned by
their own judgement.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="43"/> Whole sentences again end
with the phrase with which they began. Take an
example. <quote>He came from Asia. What a strange
thing. A tribune of the people came from Asia.</quote><note>From the lost <hi rend="italics">in Q. Metellum.</hi></note>
Nay, the first word of this same period is actually repeated at its close, thus making its third appearance:
for to the words just quoted the orator adds, <quote>Still
for all that he came.</quote> Sometimes a whole clause is
repeated, although the order of the words is altered,
as, for example, <hi rend="italics">Quid Cleomenes facere potuit non
enin possum quemquam insimulare falso, quid, inquam,</hi>

<pb id="p.471"/>

<hi rend="italics">magno opere potuit Cleomenes facere?</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Ecl.</hi> x. 72.</note><milestone unit="section" n="44"/> The first word
of one clause is also frequently the same as the last
of the preceding, a figure common in poetry.

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>And ye,</l>
<l>Pierian Muses, shall enhance their worth</l>
<l>For Gallus; Gallus, he for whom each hour</l>
<l>My love burns stronger.</l></quote><bibl><hi rend="italics">Cat.</hi> I. i. 2.</bibl></cit></quote>

But it is not uncommon even in the orators. For
example: <quote>Yet this man lives. Lives? Why he
even came into the senate house.</quote><note>&sect;30.</note><milestone unit="section" n="45"/> Sometimes, as I
remarked in connexion with the doubling of words,<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>
the beginnings and the conclusions of sentences are
made to correspond by the use of other words with
the same meaning. Here is an example of correspondence between the beginnings: <quote>I would have
faced every kind of danger; I would have exposed
myself to treacherous attacks; I would have delivered
myself over to public hatred.</quote><note>From the lost <hi rend="italics">in Q. Metellaim.</hi></note> An example of the
correspondence of conclusions is provided by another
passage in the same speech which follows close on
that just cited: <quote>For you have decided; you have
passed sentence; you have given judgment.</quote> Some
call this <hi rend="italics">synonzmy,</hi> others <hi rend="italics">disjunction:</hi> both terms,
despite their difference, are correct. For the words
are differentiated, but their meaning is identical.
Sometimes, again, words of the same meaning are
grouped together. For instance, <quote>Since this is so,
Catiline, proceed on the path which you have entered;
depart from the city, it is high time. The gates are
open, get you forth.</quote><note>L. v. 10.</note></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="46"/>Or take this example from another book of the
orations against Catiline, <quote>He departed, he went

<pb id="p.473"/>

hence; he burst forth, he was gone.</quote><note>II. i. l.</note> This is regarded as a case of <hi rend="italics">pleonasm</hi> by Caecilius, that is to
say, as language fuller than is absolutely required,
like the phrase:

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>Myself before my very eyes I saw:</l></quote><bibl><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> xii. 638.</bibl></cit></quote>

for <quote>myself</quote> is already implied by <quote>I saw.</quote> But
when such language is over weighted by some purely
superfluous addition, it is, as I have also pointed out
elsewhere,<note>VIII. iii. 53.</note> a fault; whereas when, as in this case, it
serves to make the sense stronger and more obvious,
it is a merit. <quote>I saw,</quote> <quote>myself,</quote> <quote>before my very
eyes,</quote> are so many appeals to the emotion.<milestone unit="section" n="47"/> I cannot
therefore see why Caecilius should have stigmatised
these words by such a name, since the doubling and
repetition of words and all forms of addition may likewise be regarded as<hi rend="italics">pleonasms.</hi> And it is not merely
words that are thus grouped together. The same
device may be applied to thoughts of similar content.
<quote>The wild confusion of his thoughts, the thick
darkness shed upon his soul by his crimes and the
burning torches of the furies all drove him on.</quote><note>From the lost <hi rend="italics">in Pisonem.</hi></note></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="48"/>Words of different meaning may likewise be
grouped together, as for instance, <quote>The woman, the
savage cruelty of the tyrant, love for his father,
anger beyond control, the madness of blind daring</quote>;<note>Probably from a declamation.</note>
or again, as in the following passage from Ovid,<note><hi rend="italics">Met.</hi> v. 17.</note></p>

<quote rend="blockquote">
<quote><l part="F">But the dread Nereids' power,</l>
<l>But horned Ammon, but that wild sea-beast</l>
<l>To feed upon my vitals that must come.</l></quote></quote>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="49"/>I have found some who call this also by the name
of <foreign lang="greek">plokh/:</foreign> but I do not agree, as only one figure is

<pb id="p.475"/>

involved. We may also find a mixture of words,
some identical and others different in meaning; of
this figure, which the Greeks style <foreign lang="greek">diallagh/,</foreign> the
following will provide an example: <quote>I ask my
enemies whether these plots were investigated,
discovered and laid bare, overthrown, crushed and
destroyed by me.</quote><note>From the lost speech <hi rend="italics">in Q. Metullum.</hi></note> In this sentence <quote>investigated,</quote> <quote>discovered</quote> and <quote>laid bare</quote> are different
in meaning, while <quote>overthrown,</quote> <quote>crushed</quote> and
<quote>destroyed</quote> are similar in meaning to each other,
but different from the three previous.<milestone unit="section" n="50"/> But both the
last example and the last but one involve a different
<hi rend="italics">figure</hi> as well, which, owing to the absence of
connecting particles, is called <hi rend="italics">dissolution</hi> (<hi rend="italics">asyndeton</hi>),
and is useful when we are speaking with special
vigour: for it at once impresses the details on the
mind and makes them seem more numerous than
they really are. Consequently, we apply this
<hi rend="italics">figure</hi> not merely to single words, but to whole
sentences, as, for instance, is done by Cicero in his
reply<note>Only a few fragments remain.</note> to the speech which Metellus made to
the public assembly: <quote>I ordered those against
whom information was laid, to be summoned, guarded,
brought before the senate: they were led into the
senate,</quote> while the rest of the passage is constructed
on similar lines. This kind of <hi rend="italics">figure</hi> is also called
<hi rend="italics">brachylogy,</hi> which may be regarded as detachment
without loss of connexion. The opposite of this
figure of <hi rend="italics">asyndeton</hi> is <hi rend="italics">polyxyndeton,</hi> which is characterised by the number of connecting particles employed.
<milestone unit="section" n="51"/>In this figure we may repeat the same connecting
particle a number of times, as in the following instance:

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>His house and home and arms</l>
<l>And Amyclean hound and Cretan quiver;</l></quote><bibl><hi rend="italics">Georg.</hi> iii. 344.</bibl></cit></quote>

or they may be different,<milestone unit="section" n="52"/> as in the case of <hi rend="italics">arma
virumque</hi> followed by <hi rend="italics">multum ille et terris</hi> and <hi rend="italics">multa
quoque.</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Aen. i. sqq.</hi></note><milestone unit="section" n="53"/> Adverbs and pronouns also may be varied,
as in the following instance:<note><hi rend="italics">Ecl.</hi> i. 43. <quote>Here I beheld that youth
For whom each year twelve days my altars smoke,
He first gave answer to my aupplication.</quote></note> <hi rend="italics">lic ilium vidi iunvenem</hi>
followed by <hi rend="italics">bis senos cui nostra dies</hi> and <hi rend="italics"> hic mihi
responsum primus dedit ille petenti.</hi> But both these
cases involve the massing together of words and
phrases either in <hi rend="italics">asyndeton</hi> or <hi rend="italics">polysyndeton.</hi><milestone unit="section" n="54"/> Writers
have given special names to all the different forms,
but the names vary with the caprice of the inventor.
The origin of these <hi rend="italics">figures</hi> is one and the same,
namely that they make our utterances more vigorous
and emphatic and produce animpression of vehemence
such as might spring from repeated outbursts of
emotion.</p>
<p><hi rend="italics">Gradation,</hi> which the Greeks call <hi rend="italics">climax,</hi> necessitates a more obvious and less natural application of
art and should therefore be more sparingly employed.
Moreover, it involves <hi rend="italics">addition,</hi><milestone unit="section" n="55"/> since it repeats what
has already been said and, before passing to a new
point, dwells on those which precede. I will translate a very famous instance from the Greek.<note>Demosth. <hi rend="italics">de Cor.</hi> 179.</note> <quote>I
did not say this, without making a formal proposal
to that effect, I did not make that proposal without
undertaking the embassy, nor undertake the embassy
without persuading the Thebans.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="56"/> There are, however, examples of the same thing in Latin authors.
<quote>It was the energy of Africanus that gave him his
peculiar excellence, his excellence that gave him
glory, his glory that gave him rivals.</quote><note>Auct. <hi rend="italics">ad Herenn.</hi> iv. 25.</note> Calvus
again writes, <quote>Consequently this means the abolition

<pb id="p.479"/>

of trials for treason no less than for extortion, for
offences covered by the Plautian law no less than for
treason, for bribery no less than for those offences,
and for all breaches of every law no less than
for bribery,</quote> etc.<milestone unit="section" n="57"/> It is also to be found in poets,
as in the passage in Homer<note><hi rend="italics">Il.</hi> ii. 101.</note> describing the sceptre
which he traces from the hands of Jupiter down to
those of Agamemnon, and in the following from one
of our own tragedians:<note>Unknown.</note></p>

<quote rend="blockquote">
<quote><l>From Jove, so runs the tale, was Tantalus sprung,</l>
<l>From Tantalus Pelops, and of Pelops' seed</l>
<l>Sprang Atreus, who is sire of all our line.</l></quote></quote>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="58"/>As regards the figures produced by omission, they
rely for their charm in the main on conciseness and
novelty. There is one of these which I mentioned
in the last book<note>VII. vi. 21.</note> with reference to <hi rend="italics">synecdoche,</hi> and
postponed discussing until such time as I came to
deal with <hi rend="italics">figures:</hi> it occurs when the word omitted
may be clearly gathered from the context: an
example may be found in Caelius' denunciation of
Antony: <hi rend="italics">stupere gaudio Graecus:</hi><note><quote>The Greek was struck dumb with joy.</quote></note> for we must clearly
supply <hi rend="italics">coepit.</hi> Or take the following passage from a
letter of Cicero<note>Lost. <quote>No talk except of you. What better? Then
Fla virus says, 'Couriers to-morrow,' and I scribbled these lines
at his house during dinner.</quote></note> to Brutus: <hi rend="italics">Serno nullus scilicet nisi
de te: quid enim potius? turn Flavius, cras, inquit,
tabellarii, et ego ibidem has inter cenum exaravi.</hi><milestone unit="section" n="59"/> Of a
similar kind, at any rate in my opinion, are those
passages in which words are decently omitted to
spare our modesty.

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>You&mdash;while the goats looked goatish-we know<lb/>
who,</l>
<l>And in what chapel&mdash;(but the kind Nymphs<lb/>
laughed).</l></quote><bibl><hi rend="italics">Ecl.</hi> iii. 8.</bibl></cit></quote>

<pb id="p.481"/>

Some regard this as an <hi rend="italics">aposiopesis,</hi> but wrongly.<milestone unit="section" n="60"/>
For in <hi rend="italics">aposiopesis</hi> it is either uncertain or at least
requires an explanation of some length to show what
is suppressed, whereas in the present case only one
word, and that of an obvious character, is missing.
If this, then, is an <hi rend="italics">aposiopesis,</hi> all omissions will have
a claim to the title.<milestone unit="section" n="61"/> I would not even allow the
name of <hi rend="italics">aposiopesis</hi> to all cases where what is omitted
is left to be understood, as for example the following phrase from Cicero's letters,<note>Lost. The sense is, <quote>Despatched on the day on which
Antony offered Caesar the crown.</quote></note> <hi rend="italics">Data Lupercalibus
quo die Antonius Caesari:</hi> for there, there is no real
suppression: the omission is merely playful, for there
is but one way of completing the sentence, namely
with the words <hi rend="italics">diadema imposuit.</hi><milestone unit="section" n="62"/> Another figure
produced by omission is that of which I have just
spoken,<note>&sect; 50.</note> when the connecting particles are omitted.
A third is the figure known as <foreign lang="greek">e)pezeugme/non</foreign> in which
a number of clauses are all completed by the same
verb, which would be required by each singly if they
stood alone. In such cases the verb to which the
rest of the sentence refers may come first, as in the
following instance: <hi rend="italics">Vicit pudorem lilido, timiorem
audacia, rationem amentia.</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Pro Cluent.</hi> vi. 15. <quote>Lust conquered shame, boldness
fear, madness reason.</quote></note> Or it may come last,
closing a number of clauses, as in the following:<note><hi rend="italics">Cat.</hi> i. ix. 22. <quote>For you are not the man, Catiline, to
be deterred from vile acts by shame, from peril by fear, or
from madness by reason.</quote></note>
<hi rend="italics">Neque enim is es, Catilina, ut te aut pudor unquam a
turpitudine ant meites a periculo aut ratio a furore revocaverit.</hi><milestone unit="section" n="63"/> The verb may even be placed in the middle
so as to serve both what precedes and what follows.
The same figure may join different sexes, as for
example when we speak of a male and female child
under the comprehensive term of <quote>sons</quote>; or it may

<pb id="p.483"/>

interchange singular and plural.<milestone unit="section" n="64"/> But these devices
are so common that they can scarcely lay claim to
involve the art essential to <hi rend="italics">figures.</hi> On the other
hand it is quite obviously <hi rend="italics">figure,</hi> when two different
constructions are combined as in the following case:</p>

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>Sociis tunc arma capessant</l>
<l>Edico et dira bellum cum gene gerendumn.</l></quote> <bibl><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> iii. 234; <hi rend="italics">participio</hi> = gerundive (<hi rend="italics">gerendum</hi>).</bibl></cit></quote>

<p>(I bid my comrades straight to seize their arms
And war be waged against a savage race.)</p>

<p>For although the portion of the sentence following
<hi rend="italics">bellum</hi> ends with a participle, both clauses of the
sentence are correctly governed by <hi rend="italics">edico.</hi> Another
form of connexion, which does not necessarily involve
omission, is called <foreign lang="greek">sunoikei/wsis,</foreign> because it connects
two different things, for example:</p>

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>The miser lacks</l>
<l>That which he has no less than what he has not.</l></quote><bibl><hi rend="italics">Syrus</hi> 486 (Ribbeck).</bibl></cit></quote>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="65"/>To this figure is opposed <hi rend="italics">distinction,</hi> which they call
<foreign lang="greek">paradiastolh/,</foreign> by which we distinguish between
similar things, as in this sentence:<note><hi rend="italics">Rutil.</hi> i. 4.</note> <quote>When you call
yourself wise instead of astute, brave instead of rash,
economical instead of mean.</quote> But this is entirely
dependent on definition, and therefore I have my
doubts whether it can be called a figure. Its opposite
occurs when we pass at a bound from one thing to
something different, as though from like to like; for
example:

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>I labour to be brief, I turn obscure,</l></quote><bibl> Hor <hi rend="italics">A.P.</hi> 25.</bibl></cit></quote>

with what follows.</p>

<pb id="p.485"/>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="66"/>There is a third class of <hi rend="italics">figures</hi> which attracts the
ear of the audience and excites their attention by
some resemblance, equality or contrast of words.
To this class belongs <hi rend="italics">paronomasia,</hi> which we call
<hi rend="italics">adnominatio.</hi> This may be effected in different ways.
It may depend on the resemblance of one word to
another which has preceded, although the words are
in different cases. Take the following passage from
Domitius Afer's defence of Cloatilla: <hi rend="italics">Mulier omnium
rerum imiperita, in omnnibus rebus infelix.</hi><note><quote>A woman unskilled in everything and in everything
unhappy.</quote></note><milestone unit="section" n="67"/> Or the same
word may be repeated with greater meaning, as
<hi rend="italics">quando homo, hostis homno.</hi><note>The meaning is obscure. As punctuated, the sense is
<quote>since he is a man, the man is an enemy,</quote> <hi rend="italics">i. e.</hi> the utterance
of some misanthrope. Or a question-mark may be placed
after <hi rend="italics">homo</hi> and the meaning will be <quote>since he is a man, can
he be an enemy?</quote></note> But although I have used
these examples to illustrate something quite different,
one of them involves both <hi rend="italics">emphasis</hi> and <hi rend="italics">reiteration.</hi>
The opposite of <hi rend="italics">parononasia</hi> occurs when one word is
proved to be false by repetition; for instance, <quote>This
law did not seem to be a law to private individuals.</quote><note><hi rend="italics">In Pis.</hi> xiii. 20.</note>
Akin to this is that syled <foreign lang="greek">a)ntana/klasis,</foreign><milestone unit="section" n="68"/> where the
same word is used in two different meanings. When
Proculeius reproached his son with waiting for his
death, and the son replied that he was not waiting
for it, the former retorted, <hi rend="italics">Well then, I ask you to
wait for it.</hi> Sometimes such difference in meaning
is obtained not by using the same word, but one like
it, as for example by saying that a man whom you
think <hi rend="italics">dignus supplicatione</hi> (worthy of supplication) is
<hi rend="italics">supplicio adficiendus.</hi><note>In old Latin <hi rend="italics">supplicium</hi> was used as equivalent to <hi rend="italics">suppliratio,</hi> and this use survives in Livy and Sallust. But in
Augustan and post-Augustan language the normal meaning
of <hi rend="italics">supplicium</hi> was <quote>punishment,</quote> and the natural translation
would be <quote>worthy of punishment.</quote></note><milestone unit="section" n="69"/> There are also other ways in
which the same words may be used in different
senses or altered by the lengthening or shortening of

<pb id="p.487"/>

a syllable: this is a poor trick even when employed
in jest, and I am surprised that it should be included
in the text-books: the instances which I quote are
therefore given as examples for avoidance, not for
imitation. Here they are:<milestone unit="section" n="70"/> <hi rend="italics">Amari iucundum est, si
curetur ne quid insit amari,</hi><note>Auct. <hi rend="italics">ad Herenn. iv.</hi> 14: <quote>It is pleasant to be loved,
but we must take care that there is no bitterness in that
love.</quote></note> and <hi rend="italics">Avium dulcedo ad avium
ducit;</hi><note><quote>Birds' sweet song leads us into pathless places.</quote></note> and again this jest from Ovid,<note>Probably from a collection of epigrams: <quote>Furia, why
should I not call you a fury?</quote></note>

<quote rend="blockquote">
<l>Cur ego non dicam, Furia, te furiam?</l></quote>

Cornificius calls this <hi rend="italics">traductio,</hi><milestone unit="section" n="71"/> that is the transference of the meaning of one word to another. It
has, however, greater elegance when it is employed
to distinguish the exact meanings of things, as in the
following example: <quote>This curse to the state could
be repressed for a time, but not suppressed for ever;</quote><note><hi rend="italics">Cat.</hi> L xii. 30.</note>
the same is true when the meaning of verbs is reversed
by a change in the preposition with which they are
compounded: for example, <hi rend="italics">Non emissus ex urbe, sed
immissus in urbem esse videatur.</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Cat.</hi> I. 11. 27: <quote>He would seem not so much to have
been sent out from, but to have been launched against the
city.</quote></note> The effect is better
still and more emphatic when our pleasure is derived
both from the figurative form and the excellence of
the sense, as in the following instance: <hi rend="italics">emit morte
immortalitatem.</hi><note><quote>By his death he purchased undying fame.</quote></note><milestone unit="section" n="72"/> A more trivial effect is produced by
the following: <hi rend="italics">Non Pisonum, sed pistorum,</hi><note><quote>Not of the Pisos, but of the bakers.</quote></note> and <hi rend="italics">Ex
oratore arator,</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Phil</hi> III. ix. 22: <quote>Orator turned ploughman.</quote></note> while phrases such as <hi rend="italics">Ne patres conscripti videantur circumscripti,</hi><note>Auct. <hi rend="italics">ad Herenn,</hi> iv. 22. <quote>That the conscript fathers
be not cheated.</quote></note> or <hi rend="italics">raro evenit, sed vehenenter venit,</hi><note>Meaning uncertain.</note> are the worst of all. It does, however,
sometimes happen that a bold and vigorous conception may derive a certain charm from the contrast
between two words not dissimilar in sound.<milestone unit="section" n="73"/> I do

<pb id="p.489"/>

not know that there is any reason why modesty
should prevent me from illustrating this point from
my own family. My father, in the course of a declamation against a man who had said he would die
on his embassy and then returned after a few days'
absence without accomplishing anything, said, <hi rend="italics">non
exigo ut immoriaris legationi: immorare.</hi><note><quote>I (do not demand that you should die on your embassy;
only stay there!</quote></note> For the
sense is forcible and the sound of the two words,
which are so very different in meaning, is pleasant,
more especially since the assonance is not far fetched,
but presents itself quite naturally, one word being of
the speaker's own selection, while the other is supplied by his opponent.<milestone unit="section" n="74"/> The old orators were at
great pains to achieve elegance in the use of words
similar or opposite in sound. Gorgias carried the
practice to an extravagant pitch, while Isocrates, at
any rate in his early days, was much addicted to it.
Even Cicero delighted in it, but showed some restraint in the employment of a device which is not
unattractive save when carried to excess, and, further,
by the weight of his thought lent dignity to what
would otherwise have been mere trivialities. For
in itself this artifice is a flat and foolish affectation,
but when it goes hand in hand with vigour of
thought, it gives the impression of natural charm,
which the speaker has not had to go far to find.
<milestone unit="section" n="75"/>There are some four different forms of play upon
verbal resemblances. The first occurs when we
select some word which is not very unlike another,
as in the line of Virgil

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>vuppesque tuae pubesque tuorum,</l></quote><bibl><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> i. 399. <note><quote>Your ships and the flower of your young
warriors.</quote></note></bibl></cit></quote>

or, <hi rend="italics">sic in hac calamitosa fama quasi in aliqua perniciosissim flamma,</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Pro Cluent.</hi> i. 4. <quote>In the midst of this disastrous
defamation, which may be compared to a disastrous
conflagration.</quote></note> and <hi rend="italics">non enim tarn spes laudanda quam</hi>

<pb id="p.491"/>

<hi rend="italics">res est.</hi><note>From Cic. <hi rend="italics">de Republica.</hi> <quote>For it is performance rather
that promise that claims our praise.</quote></note> Or at any rate the words selected will be
of equal length and will have similar terminations,
as in <hi rend="italics">non verbis, sed armis.</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Rutil.</hi> ii. xii. <quote>Not with words, but with arms.</quote></note><milestone unit="section" n="76"/> A good effect may also
be produced by an artifice such as the following, so
long as the thought which it expresses be vigorous: <hi rend="italics">quantum possis, in eo semper experire ut prosis.</hi><note><quote>Always try in such cases to make your efforts as useful
as possible.</quote></note>
The name commonly applied to this is <foreign lang="greek">pa/roson</foreign>
though the Stoic Theon thinks that in cases of
<foreign lang="greek">pa/rison</foreign> the correspondence between the clauses must
be exact.<milestone unit="section" n="77"/> The second form occurs when clauses
conclude alike, the same syllables being placed at
the end of each; this correspondence in the ending
of two or more sentences is called <hi rend="italics">homoeoteleuton.</hi>
Here is an example: <hi rend="italics">Non modo ad salutem eius exstinguendam sed etiam gloriam per tales viros infringendam.</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Pro Mil.</hi> ii. 5. <quote>Not merely to destroy his personal
security, but even to blacken his name by means of such
ruffians.</quote></note>
This figure is usually, though not invariably, found in
the groups of three clauses, styled <foreign lang="greek">tri/kwla,</foreign> of which
the following may be cited as an illustration: <hi rend="italics">vicit
pudorem libido, timorem audacia, rationed amentia.</hi><note>See &sect; 62.</note>
But the device may be applied to four clauses or
more. The effect may even be produced by single
words; for example, <hi rend="italics">Hecuba hoc dolet, pudet, piget,</hi><note>From an unknown tragedian. <quote>This fills Hecuba with
grief, shame and loathing.</quote></note>
or <hi rend="italics">abiit, excessit, erupit, evasit.</hi><note>See &sect; 46.</note><milestone unit="section" n="78"/> In the third form the
correspondence is produced by the use of similar
cases; it is known as <foreign lang="greek">o(moio/ptwton</foreign> But this name,
though it implies a certain similarity, does not necessarily involve identity in termination, since it means
no more than similarity of case, irrespective of the
fact that words may be differently declined, and does
not always occur at the end of a sentence; the correspondence may occur at the beginning, middle or

<pb id="p.493"/>

end of clauses, or may be varied so that the middle
of one clause corresponds with the beginning of
another and the end with the middle: in fact, any
arrangement of correspondences is permissible.<milestone unit="section" n="79"/> Nor
need the words which correspond consist of the
same number of syllables. For example, we find
the following sentence in Domitius Afer: <hi rend="italics">Amisso
nuper infelicis aulae,</hi><note>The sense of <hi rend="italics">infelicis aulae</hi> is uncertain. See Crit. note.
<quote>This unhappy court having lost, if not all that might protect it in the hour of peril, at any rate all that might console
it in moments of adversity.</quote></note> <hi rend="italics">si non praesidio inter pericula,
tamen solacio inter adversa.</hi> The best form of this
figure is that in which the beginnings and ends of
the clauses correspond (as in this case <hi rend="italics">praesidio</hi> corresponds with <hi rend="italics">solacio</hi> and <hi rend="italics">pericula</hi> with <hi rend="italics">adversa</hi>), in such
a way that there is a close resemblance between the
words, while cadence and termination are virtually
identical.<milestone unit="section" n="80"/> It is also desirable that the clauses should
be of equal length, although as a matter of fact this
forms the fourth <hi rend="italics">figure</hi> of this class, and is known as
<foreign lang="greek">i)so/kwlon</foreign> The following will serve as an example,
being both <foreign lang="greek"> i)so/kwlon</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">o(moio/ptwton:</foreign> <hi rend="italics">Si, quantum in
agro locisque desertis audacia potest, tantum in foro atque
iudiciis impudentia valeret;</hi> continuing, it combines
<foreign lang="greek">i)so/kwlon, o(moio/ptwton,</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">o(moiote/leuton.</foreign>:&mdash;non minus
<hi rend="italics">nunc in causa cederet Aulus Caecina Sexti Aebutii imnpudentiae, quam turn in vi facienda cessit audaciae.</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Cic. pro Caec.</hi> i. 1. <quote>If shamelessness carried as much
weight in the forum and the law courts as daring carries in
the country and in lonely places, Aulus Caecina would now
yield no less to the shamelessness of Sextus Aebutius in the
present case than he yielded to his audacity in the use of
violence.</quote></note> This
passage derives an additional elegance from the figure
which I mentioned above<note>&sect;&sect; 36, 66. It must be remembered that <hi rend="italics">casus</hi> can be
applied to verbs as well as nouns.</note> as consisting in the repetition of words with an alteration of case, tense, mood,
etc., to be found in this instance in the words <hi rend="italics">non
minus cederet quam cessit.</hi> The following, on the other

<pb id="p.495"/>

hand, combines <hi rend="italics">homoeoteleuton</hi> and <hi rend="italics">paronomasia:
Neminem alteri posse dare in matrinonium, nisi penes
quem sit patrimonium.</hi><note><quote>That no one may bestow the hand of a woman on
another in matrimony unless he be the possessor of a
patrimony.</quote></note></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="81"/><hi rend="italics">Antithesis,</hi> which Roman writers call either <hi rend="italics">contrapositum</hi> or <hi rend="italics">contentio,</hi> may be effected in more than one
way. Single words may be contrasted with single, as
in the passage recently quoted, <hi rend="italics">Vicit pudorem libido,
timorem audacia,</hi><note>See &sect; 62.</note> or the contrast may be between
pairs of words, as in <hi rend="italics">non nostri ingenii, vestri auxilii est,</hi><note><hi rend="italics">pro Cluent.</hi> i. 4. <quote>This is beyond my power; it is your
support that is required.</quote></note>
or sentence may be contrasted with sentence, as in
<hi rend="italics">dominetur in contionibus, iaceat in iudiciis.</hi><note><hi rend="italics">pro Cluent. ii. 5.</hi> See IX. ii. 51.</note><milestone unit="section" n="82"/> Next to
this another form may appropriately be placed,
namely that which we have styled <hi rend="italics">distinction</hi> and of
which the following is an example: <hi rend="italics">Odit populus
Romanus privaiam luxuriam, publicam magoificentiam
diligit.</hi><note><hi rend="italics">pro Muren.</hi> xxxvi. 76. <quote>The Roman people hates
private luxury, but loves public magnificence.</quote> <hi rend="italics">Cp.</hi> &sect; 65.</note> The same is true of the figure by which
words of similar termination, but of different
meaning are placed at the end of corresponding
clauses, as in <hi rend="italics">ut quod in tempore mali fuit, nihil obsit,
quod in causa boni fruit, prosit.</hi><note><hi rend="italics">pro Cluent.</hi> xxix. 80. <quote>So that what was unfortunate in
the occasion may prove no obstacle, while what was fortunate in the case may prove a positive advantage.</quote></note><milestone unit="section" n="83"/> Nor is the contrasted
phrase always placed immediately after that to
which it is opposed, as it is in the following
instance: <hi rend="italics">est igitur haec, indices, non scripta,
sed nala lex:</hi><note><hi rend="italics">pro Mil.</hi> iv. 10. <quote>This law then, gentlemen, was not
written, but born. It is a law which we have not learned,
received from others or read, but which we have derived,
absorbed and copied from nature itself.</quote></note> but, as Cicero<note>See IX. i. 34.</note> says, we may have
correspondence between subsequent particulars and
others previously mentioned, as in the passage which
immediately follows that just quoted: <hi rend="italics">quam non
didicimus, accepimus, leginmus, verum ex natura ipsa
arrptluimus, hauusimus, epressimus.</hi><milestone unit="section" n="84"/> Again the

<pb id="p.497"/>

contrast is not always expressed antithetically, as is
shown by the following passage from Rutilius:
<hi rend="italics">nobis primis dii immortales fruges dedelunt, nos, quod
soli accepimus, in omnes terras distribuimus.</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Ruatil.</hi> ii. 16. <quote>To us first of men the immortal gods
gave corn, while we have distributed that which we alone

known as <foreign lang="greek">a)ntimetabolh/</foreign> by which words are repeated
in different cases, tenses, moods, etc., as for instance
when we say, <hi rend="italics">non ut edam, vivo, sed ut vivam, edo</hi> (I do
not live to eat, but eat to live). There is an instance of this in Cicero,<note><hi rend="italics">pro Cluent.</hi> ii. 5. <quote>That though there is no prejudice,
guilt is punished, and if there is no guilt, prejudice is laid
aside.</quote></note> where he has managed,
while changing the case, to secure similarity of termination: <hi rend="italics">ut et sine inridia culpa plectatur et sine culpa
invidia ponatur.</hi><milestone unit="section" n="86"/> Again the clauses may end with
the same word, as when Cicero says of Sextus
Roscius: <hi rend="italics">etenim cum artifex eiusmodi est ut solus videatur dignus qui in scena spectetur, turn vir eiusmodi est ut
solus dignus esse videatur qui eo non accedat.</hi><note><hi rend="italics">pro Quintio</hi> xxv. 78. <quote><hi rend="italics">For</hi> while he is an artist of such
talent as to seem the only actor on the stage worth looking
at, he is also a man of such character as to seem the only
man worthy of being exempted from appearing on the
stage.</quote></note> There
is also a special elegance which may be secured by
placing names in antithesis, as in the following instance, <hi rend="italics">Si consul Antonius, Brutus hostis; si conservator
rei publicae Brutus, hostis Antonius.</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Phil.</hi> iv. iii. 8. "If Antony is consul, Brutus is an
enemy: if Brutus is the saviour of the state, Antony is an
enemy.</note></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="87"/>I have already said more than was necessary on the
subject <hi rend="italics">of figures.</hi> But there will still be some who
think that the following (which they call <foreign lang="greek">a)nqupofora\</foreign>
is a <hi rend="italics">figure: Incredibile est, quod dico, sed verum:</hi><note><quote>What I say is incredible, but true.</quote> <foreign lang="greek">a)nqupofora\</foreign>=

<pb id="p.499"/>

<foreign lang="greek">a)/fodos.</foreign><milestone unit="section" n="88"/> There are some <hi rend="italics">figures of speech</hi> which differ
little from <hi rend="italics">figures of thought,</hi> as for example that of
hesitation. For when we hesitate over a thing, it
belongs to the former class, whereas when we hesitate over a word, it must be assigned to the latter,
as for instance if we say, <quote>I do not know whether to
call this wickedness or folly.</quote><note><hi rend="italics">Auct. ad Hrem.</hi> IV. xxix. 40.</note><milestone unit="section" n="89"/> The same consideration applies to correction. For correction emends,
where hesitation expresses a doubt. Some have
even held that it applies to personification as well;
they think, for example, that <hi rend="italics">Avarice is the mother of
cruelly,</hi> Sallust's O <hi rend="italics">Romulus of Arpinum</hi> in his speech
against Cicero, and the <hi rend="italics">Thriasian Oedipus</hi><note>An allusion to some inhabitant of the Athenian village
of Thria.</note> of Menander are <hi rend="italics">figures of speech.</hi> All these points have
been discussed in full detail by those who have not
given this subject merely incidental treatment as a
portion of a larger theme, but have devoted whole
books to the discussion of the topic: I allude to
writers such as Caecilius, Dionysius, Rutilius, Cornificius, Visellius and not a few others, although there
are living authors who will be no less famous than
they.<milestone unit="section" n="90"/> Now though I am ready to admit that more
<hi rend="italics">figures of speech</hi> may perhaps be discovered by certain
writers, I cannot agree that such figures are better
than those which have been laid down by high
authorities. Above all I would point out that
Cicero has included a number of figures in the third
book of the <hi rend="italics">de Oratore,</hi><note>See IX. i. 26.</note> which in his later work, the
Orator,<note>See IX. i. 37.</note> he has omitted, thereby seeming to indicate
that he condemned them. Some of these are <hi rend="italics">figures
of thought</hi> rather than <hi rend="italics">of speech,</hi> such as meiosis, the
introduction of the unexpected, imagery, answering
our own questions, digression, permission,<note>See IX. ii. 25.</note> arguments drawn from opposites (for I suppose that by

<pb id="p.501"/>

<hi rend="italics">contrarium</hi><note>See IX. i. 33. <hi rend="italics">sqq.</hi> If <hi rend="italics">contrarium</hi> is what Quintilian
supposes, its sense must be approximate to that given above.
Cp. <hi rend="italics">Auct. ad Herenn.</hi> iv. 25. <hi rend="italics">contrarium est quod ex diversis

is possible that Cicero meant <hi rend="italics">antithesis.</hi></note> he means what is elsewhere styled
<foreign lang="greek">e)nantio/ths</foreign>), and proof borrowed from an opponent.
There are some again which are not figures at all,<milestone unit="section" n="91"/>
such as arrangement, distinction by headings, and
circumscription, whether this latter term be intended
to signify the concise expression of thought or
definition, which is actually regarded by Cornificius
and Rutilius as a <hi rend="italics">figure of speech.</hi> With regard to
the elegant transposition of words, that is, <hi rend="italics">hyperbaton,</hi> which Caecilius also thinks is a <hi rend="italics">figure,</hi> I have
included it among <hi rend="italics">tropes.</hi> As for <hi rend="italics">mutation</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Immutatio</hi> in Cicero (IX. i. 35) seems to mean <hi rend="italics">metonymy</hi>
or <foreign lang="greek">u(pallagh/</foreign> (see <hi rend="italics">Orator,</hi> xxvii. 92): The <foreign lang="greek">a)lloi/wsis</foreign> of Rutilius
(i. 2) is however <quote><hi rend="italics">differentiation.</hi></quote></note><milestone unit="section" n="92"/> of the
kind which Rutilius calls <foreign lang="greek">a)lloi/wsis</foreign> its function is to
point out the differences between men, things and
deeds: if it is used on an extended scale, it is not a
<hi rend="italics">figure,</hi> if on a narrower scale, it is mere <hi rend="italics">antithesis,</hi> while
if it is intended to mean <hi rend="italics">hypallage,</hi> enough has already
been said on the subject.<note>VIII. 6. 23.</note><milestone unit="section" n="93"/> Again what sort of a
figure is this <hi rend="italics">addition of a reason, for what is advanced,</hi>
which Rutilius calls <foreign lang="greek">ai)tiologi/a</foreign>?<note>ii. 19.</note> It may also be
doubted whether the <hi rend="italics">assignment of a reason for each
distinct statement,</hi> with which Rutilius<note>Opening of Book I.</note> opens his discussion of figures, is really a figure.<milestone unit="section" n="94"/> He calls it
<foreign lang="greek">prosapo/dosis</foreign> and states<note>The subj. <hi rend="italics">servetur</hi> seems to indicate indirect speech.</note> that strictly it applies to a
number of propositions, since the reason is either
attached to each proposition separately, as in the
following passage from Gaius Antonius:<note>Elected consul with Cicero for 63 B.C.</note> <quote>But I do
not fear him as an accuser, for I am innocent; I do
not dread him as a rival candidate, for I am
Antonius; I do not expect to see him consul, for he
is Cicero</quote>;<milestone unit="section" n="95"/> or, after two or three propositions have
been stated, the reasons for them may be given continuously in the same order, as for example in the

<pb id="p.503"/>

words that Brutus uses of Gnaeus Pompeius: <quote>For
it is better to rule no man than to be the slave to
any man: since one may live with honour without
ruling, whereas life is no life for the slave.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="96"/> But a
number of reasons may also be assigned for one statement, as in the lines of Virgil:<note><hi rend="italics">Georg.</hi> i. 86. Rhoades' translation.</note>

<quote rend="blockquote">
<quote><l>Whether that earth there from some hidden<lb/>

<l>And fattening food derives, or that the tire</l>
<l>Bakes every blemish out, etc.</l>
<l>Or that the heat unlocks new passages. . . .</l>
<l>Or that it hardens more, etc.</l></quote></quote>

As to what Cicero means by <hi rend="italics">reference,</hi><milestone unit="section" n="97"/> I am in the
dark: if he means <foreign lang="greek">a)na/klasis</foreign><note>VIII. vi 23.</note> or <foreign lang="greek">e)pa/nodos</foreign><note>IX. iii. 35.</note> or <foreign lang="greek">a)ntimetabolh/,</foreign><note>IX. iii. 85.</note> I have already discussed them. But whatever its meaning may be, he does not mention it in
the Orator any more than the other terms I have
just mentioned. The only figure of speech mentioned
in that work, which I should prefer to regard as a
figure of thought owing to its emotional character,
is <hi rend="italics">exclamation.</hi> I agree with him about all the rest.
To these Caecilius adds <hi rend="italics">periphrasis,</hi><milestone unit="section" n="98"/> of which I have
already spoken,5 while Cornificius<note>VIII. vi. 59.

For interpretations of all these terms except <hi rend="italics">occultatio,</hi>
see <hi rend="italics">Auct. ad Herenn.</hi> iv. 15, 16, 17, 19, 23, 26, 28, 30,
<hi rend="italics">subjcitio</hi> is the suggesting of an argument that might be used
by an opponent; <hi rend="italics">articulus</hi> a clause consisting of one word.
<hi rend="italics">interpretation</hi> the explanation of one word by subsequent use

reasoning, suggestion, transition, concealment, and
further, sentence, clause, isolated words, interpretation and conclusion. Of these the first (down to
and including concealment) are <hi rend="italics">figures of thought,</hi>
while the remainder are not <hi rend="italics">figures</hi> at all.<milestone unit="section" n="99"/> Rutilius
also in addition to the figures found in other
authors adds, <foreign lang="greek">paromologi/a</foreign><note>The advancement of some stronger argument after the
concession of some other point to our adversary.</note> <foreign lang="greek">a)nagkai=on</foreign><note>See IX. ii. 106.</note> <foreign lang="greek">h)qopoii+/a</foreign><note>See IX. ii. 58.</note>

I will pass by those authors who set no limit to
their craze for inventing technical terms and even
include among <hi rend="italics">figures</hi> what really comes under the
head of arguments.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="100"/>With regard to genuine <hi rend="italics">figures,</hi> I would briefly
add that, while, suitably placed, they are a real
ornament to style, they become perfectly fatuous
when sought after overmuch. There are some
who pay no consideration to the weight of their
matter or the force of their thoughts and think
themselves supreme artists, if only they succeed in
forcing even the emptiest of words into <hi rend="italics">figurative</hi>
form, with the result that they are never tired of
stringing <hi rend="italics">figures</hi> together, despite the fact that it
is as ridiculous to hunt for <hi rend="italics">figures</hi> without reference
to the matter as it is to discuss dress and gesture
without reference to the body.<milestone unit="section" n="101"/> But even perfectly
correct <hi rend="italics">figures</hi> must not be packed too closely together.
Changes of facial expression and glances of the eyes
are most effective in pleading, but if the orator never
ceases to distort his face with affected grimaces or to
wag his head and roll his eyes, he becomes a laughing-stock. So too oratory possesses a natural mien,
which while it is far from demanding a stolid and
immovable rigidity should as far as possible restrict
itself to the expression with which it is endowed by
nature.<milestone unit="section" n="102"/> But it is of the first importance that we
should know what are the requirements of time,
place and character on each occasion of speaking.
For the majority of these figures aim at delighting the
hearer. But when terror, hatred and pity are the

<pb id="p.507"/>

weapons called for in the fray, who will endure the
orator who expresses his anger, his sorrow or his
entreaties in neat antitheses, balanced cadences and
exact correspondences? Too much care for our words
under such circumstances weakens the impression of
emotional sincerity, and wherever the orator displays
his art unveiled, the hearer says, <quote>The truth is not
in him.</quote></p>
<p>IV. I should not venture to speak of artistic
structure<note><hi rend="italics">Composite</hi> in its widest sense means <quote>artistic structure.</quote>
But in much of what follows it virtually = <quote>rhythm.</quote></note> after what Cicero has said upon the subject (for there is I think no topic to which he has
devoted such elaborate discussion) but for the fact
that his own contemporaries ventured to traverse his
theories on this subject even in letters which they
addressed to him, while a number of later writers
have left on record numerous observations on the
same topic.<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Accordingly on a large number of
questions I shall be found in agreement with Cicero
and shall deal more briefly with those points which
admit of no dispute, while there will be certain
subjects on which I shall express a certain amount
of disagreement. For, though I intend to make my
own views clear, I shall leave my readers free to
hold their own opinion.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>I am well aware that there are certain writers
who would absolutely bar all study of artistic structure and contend that language as it chances to
present itself in the rough is more natural and even
more manly. If by this they mean that only that
is natural which originated with nature and has
never received any subsequent cultivation, there is
an end to the whole art of oratory.<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For the first
men did not speak with the care demanded by that
art nor in accordance with the rules that it lays

<pb id="p.509"/>

down. They knew nothing of introducing their
case by means of an exordium, of instructing the
jury by a statement of facts, of proving by argument
or of arousing the emotions. They lacked all these
qualifications as completely as they lacked all knowledge of the theory of artistic structure. But if
they were to be forbidden all progress in this
respect, they ought equally to have been forbidden
to exchange their huts for houses, their cloaks of
skin for civilised raiment and their mountains and
forests for cities.<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> What art was ever born fullgrown? What does not ripen with cultivation?
Why do we train the vine? Why dig it? We clear
the fields of brambles, and they too are natural products of the soil. We tame animals, and yet they
are born wild. No, that which is most natural is
that which nature permits to be done to the greatest
perfection.<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> How can a style which lacks orderly
structure be stronger than one that is welded together
and artistically arranged? It must not be regarded
as the fault of the study of structure that the employment of feet consisting of short syllables such as
characterise the Sotadean and Galliambic metres
and certain prose rhythms closely resembling them in
wildness, weakens the force of our matter.<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Just as
river-currents are more violent when they run along a
sloping bed, that presents no obstacles to check their
course, than when their waters are broken and baffled
by rocks that obstruct the channel, so a style which
flows in a continuous stream with all the full development of its force is better than one which is rough
and broken. Why then should it be thought that
polish is inevitably prejudicial to vigour, when the
truth is that nothing can attain its full strength

<pb id="p.511"/>

without the assistance of art, and that art is always
productive of beauty?<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Is it not the fact that grace
always goes with the highest skill in throwing the
spear, and that the truer the archer's aim, the more
comely is his attitude? Again in fencing and all
the contests of the wrestling school, what one of all
the tricks of attack and defence is there, that does
not require movements and firmness of foot such as
can only be acquired by art?<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Consequently in my
opinion artistic structure gives force and direction
to our thoughts just as the throwing-thong and the
bowstring do to the spear and the arrow. And
for this reason all the best scholars are convinced
that the study of structure is of the utmost value,
not merely for charming the ear, but for stirring
the soul.<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> For in the first place nothing can penetrate to the emotions that stumbles at the portals of
the ear, and secondly man is naturally attracted by
harmonious sounds. Otherwise it would not be the
case that musical instruments, in spite of the fact
that their sounds are inarticulate, still succeed in
exciting a variety of different emotions in the hearer.
<milestone unit="section" n="11"/>In the sacred games different methods are employed
to excite and calm the soul, different melodies are
required for the war-song and the entreaty sung by
the suppliant on bended knee, while the war-note
of the trumpet that leads the army forth to battle
has no resemblance to the call that sounds the
retreat.<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> It was the undoubted custom of the Pythagoreans, when they woke from slumber, to rouse
their souls with the music of the lyre, that they
might be more alert for action, and before they
retired to rest, to soothe their minds by melodies
from the same instrument, in order that all

<pb id="p.513"/>

restlessness of thought might be lulled to orderly repose.
<milestone unit="section" n="13"/>But if there is such secret power in rhythm and
melody alone, this power is found at its strongest in
eloquence, and, however important the selection
of words for the expression of our thoughts, the
structural art which welds them together in the
body of a period or rounds them off at the close,
has at least an equal claim to importance. For
there are some things which, despite triviality of
thought and mediocrity of language, may achieve
distinction in virtue of this excellence alone.<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> In
fact, if we break up and disarrange any sentence
that may have struck us as vigorous, charming or
elegant, we shall find that all its force, attraction
and grace have disappeared. Cicero in his <hi rend="italics">Orator</hi>
breaks up some of his own utterances in this way:
<quote><hi rend="italics">Neque me divitiae movent, quibus omnes Africanos et
Laelios multi venalicii mercatoresque superarunt.</hi> Change
the order but a little so that it will run <hi rend="italics">multi superarunt mercatores venaliciique,</hi></quote><note><hi rend="italics">Or.</hi> 70, 232. <quote>Nor do riches move me, in which many a
merchant and slave-dealer has surpassed all such great men
as Africanus and Laelius.</quote></note> and so on. Disarrange
these periods in such a manner, and you will find
that the shafts you have hurled are broken or wide
of the mark.<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Cicero also corrects passages in the
speeches of Gracchus where the structure appears to
him to be harsh. For Cicero this is becoming enough,
but we may content ourselves with testing our own
power of welding together in artistic form the disconnected words and phrases which present themselves
to us. For why should we seek elsewhere for
examples of faults which we may all of us find in
our own work? One point, however, it is enough
simply to notice&mdash;that the more beautiful in thought
and language the sentence which you deprive of
such structural cohesion, the more hideous will

<pb id="p.515"/>

be the effect upon the style, for the very brilliance
of the words at once exposes the carelessness of
their arrangement.<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Accordingly, although I admit
that artistic structure, at any rate in perfection,
was the last accomplishment to be attained by
oratory, I still hold that even primitive orators
regarded it as one of the objects of their study, as
far at least as the rudeness of their attainments
permitted. For even Cicero for all his greatness
will never persuade me that Lysias, Herodotus and
Thucydides were careless in this respect.<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> They
may not perhaps have pursued the same ideals as
Demosthenes and Plato, and even these latter
differed in their methods. For it would never have
done to spoil the fine and delicate texture of Lysias
by the introduction of richer rhythms, since he
would thus have lost all that surpassing grace which
he derives from his simple and unaffected tone,
while he would also have sacrificed the impression
of sincerity which he now creates. For it must be
remembered that he wrote his speeches for others
to deliver, so that it was right that they should
suggest a lack of form and artistic structure: indeed
his success in producing this effect actually shows his
mastery of structure.<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> Again history, which should
move with speed and impetuosity, would have been
ill-suited by the halts imposed by the rounding off
of the period, by the pauses for breath inevitable
in oratory, and the elaborate methods of opening
sentences and bringing them to a close. It is however true that in the speeches inserted by historians
we may note something in the way of balanced
cadences and antitheses. As regards Herodotus,
while his flow, in my opinion, is always gentle, his

<pb id="p.517"/>

dialect has such a sweetness of its own that it even
seems to contain a certain rhythmical power hidden
within itself.<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> However I shall speak of the different
ideals a little later: my immediate task is to teach
the student elementary rules which are essential if
correctness of structure is to be attained.</p>
<p>There are then in the first place two kinds of
style: the one is closely welded and woven together,
while the other is of a looser texture such as is
found in dialogues and letters, except when they
deal with some subject above their natural level,
such as philosophy, politics or the like.<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> In saying
this, I do not mean to deny that even this looser
texture has its own peculiar rhythms which are perhaps the most difficult of all to analyse. For
dialogues and letters do not demand continual
<hi rend="italics">hiatus</hi> between vowels or absence of rhythm, but on
the other hand they have not the flow or the compactness of other styles, nor does one word lead up
so inexorably to another, the structural cohesion
being loose rather than non-existent.<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> Again in
legal cases of minor importance a similar simplicity
will be found to be most becoming, a simplicity,
that is to say, that does not dispense with rhythm
altogether, but uses rhythms of a different kind,
conceals them and employs a certain secrecy in their
construction.
<milestone unit="section" n="22"/>But the more closely welded style is composed of
three elements: the <hi rend="italics">comma,</hi> or as we call it <hi rend="italics">incisum,</hi>
the <hi rend="italics">colon,</hi> or in Latin <hi rend="italics">menbrum,</hi> and the <hi rend="italics">period,</hi><note>See &sect; 122; <hi rend="italics">comma, colon, period,</hi> now applied to stops,
originally referred to varying lengths of clauses or sentences.</note>
which Roman writers call <hi rend="italics">ambitus, circumductum, continuatio</hi> or <hi rend="italics">conclusio.</hi> Further, in all artistic structure
there are three necessary qualities, <hi rend="italics">order, connexion</hi>
and <hi rend="italics">rhythm.</hi></p>

<pb id="p.519"/>

<p>Of these we will first discuss <hi rend="italics">order,</hi><milestone unit="section" n="23"/> which must be
considered in connexion with words taken both
singly and in conjunction. Words taken singly are
known as <hi rend="italics">asyndeta</hi> (unconnected). In dealing with
them we must take care that our style does not
diminish in force through the fact that a weaker
word is made to follow a stronger: as, for example,
if after calling a man a despoiler of temples we were
to speak of him as a thief, or after styling him a
highwayman were to dub him an insolent fellow.
For sentences should rise and grow in force: of this
an excellent example is provided by Cicero,<note><hi rend="italics">Phil.</hi> II. xxv. 63.</note> where
he says, <quote>You, with that throat, those lungs, that
strength, that would do credit to a prizefighter, in
every limb of your body</quote>; for there each phrase is
followed by one stronger than the last, whereas, if
he had begun by referring to his whole body, he
could scarcely have gone on to speak of his lungs
and throat without an anticlimax. There is also
another species of order which may be entitled
natural, as for example when we speak of <quote>men and
women,</quote> <quote>day and night,</quote> <quote>rising and setting,</quote> in
preference to the reverse order.<milestone unit="section" n="24"/> In some cases a
change in the order will make a word superfluous:
for example, we write <hi rend="italics">fratres gemini</hi> rather than
<hi rend="italics">gemini fratres</hi> (twin-brothers), since if <hi rend="italics">gemini</hi> came
first, there would be no necessity to add <hi rend="italics">fratres.</hi> The
rule which some have sought to enforce that nouns
should precede verbs, and verbs adverbs, while
epithets and pronouns should follow their substantives, is a mere extravagance, since the reverse
order is often adopted with excellent effect.<milestone unit="section" n="25"/> Another
piece of extravagant pedantry is to insist that the
first place should always be occupied by what is first

<pb id="p.521"/>

in order of time: such an order is no doubt often the
best, but merely because previous events are often the
most important and should consequently be placed
before matters of more trivial import.<milestone unit="section" n="26"/> If the demands
of artistic structure permit, it is far best to end the
sentence with a verb: for it is in verbs that the
real strength of language resides. But if it results
in harshness of sound, this principle must give way
before the demands of rhythm, as is frequently the
case in the best authors of Rome and Greece. Of
course, in every case where a verb does not end the
sentence, we shall have an <hi rend="italics">hyperbaton,</hi><note>See VIII. vi. 62 sqq.</note> but <hi rend="italics">hyperbaton</hi>
is an admitted <hi rend="italics">trope</hi> or <hi rend="italics">figure,</hi> and therefore is to be
regarded as an adornment.<milestone unit="section" n="27"/> For words are not cut
to suit metrical feet, and are therefore transferred
from place to place to form the most suitable combinations, just as in the case of unhewn stones their
very irregularity is the means of suggesting what
other stones they will best fit and what will supply
them with the surest resting-place. On the other
hand, the happiest effects of language are produced
when it is found possible to employ the natural
order, apt connexion and appropriate rhythm.<milestone unit="section" n="28"/> Some
transpositions are too long, as I have pointed out in
previous books,<note>Only, apparently, in VIII. ii. 14.</note> while at times they involve faulty
structure, although some writers actually aim at this
vicious type of transposition, in order to create an
appearance of freedom and license, as in the following phrases from Maecenas, <hi rend="italics">sole et aurora rubent
plurima</hi>;<note><quote>They grow red in the sunlight and the fullness of
dawn.</quote> The meaning is uncertain, <hi rend="italics">plurima</hi> might be neut.

with his structure while dealing with a sad theme.
It is, however,<milestone unit="section" n="29"/> not infrequently possible to give
special significance to a word by placing it at the
close of the sentence and thereby stamping and
impressing it on the mind of the hearer, whereas if
it were placed in the middle of the sentence, it
would remain unnoticed, escape the attention and be
obscured by its surroundings; the following passage
from Cicero will illustrate what I mean: <hi rend="italics">ut tibi
necesse esset in conspectu populi Romani vomere postridie.</hi><milestone unit="section" n="30"/><note><hi rend="italics">Phil.</hi> II. xxv. 63. <quote>That you were compelled to vomit
the next day in the presence of the Roman people.</quote></note> Transfer the last word to some other position
and the effect will be decreased. For the whole
passage is made to converge to a point at the end;
the disgraceful circumstance of his being forced to
vomit has been mentioned and the audience expect
nothing more, when the orator adds yet a further
revolting feature of the case, namely that he was
still unable to retain his food the day after the
carouse.<milestone unit="section" n="31"/> Domitius Afer was in the habit of transferring words at the cadence of the sentence solely
for the purpose of harshening his rhythm, more
especially in his <hi rend="italics">exordia,</hi> as, for example, in his
defence of Cloatilla, where he says <hi rend="italics">gratias again
continuo,</hi><note><quote>I will thank you at once.</quote></note> and in his defence of Laelia, where he
says, <hi rend="italics">eis utrisque apud te iudicem periclitatur Laelia.</hi><note><quote>Owing to both of these circumstances Laelia runs the
risk of betng condemned with you for judge.</quote></note>
To such an extent did he avoid the voluptuous
effect of soft and delicate rhythm, that he actually
interposed obstacles to break the natural harmonies
of his language.<milestone unit="section" n="32"/> There is a further drawback resulting from the faulty arrangement of words, with
which we are all familiar, namely, that it leads to
ambiguity. The above remarks will, I think, suffice
as a brief summary of the points which require
notice in connexion with order. If the order is

<pb id="p.525"/>

faulty, our language will be deservedly liable to the
charge of lacking artistic construction, however
compact and rhythmical it may be.</p>
<p>The next point for consideration is connexion,
that is to say connexion between words, <hi rend="italics">commata,
cola</hi> and periods.<note>See &sect; 22</note> For all these have merits and
defects which turn on the way in which they are
linked together.<milestone unit="section" n="33"/> I will follow the natural order
and will begin by pointing out that there are some
blemishes so obvious that even the uneducated
regard them as worthy of censure; I refer to occasions when two consecutive words form some
unseemly expression by the coalescence of the
last syllable of the first word and the first of the
second.<note><hi rend="italics">cp.</hi> VIII. 45.</note> Again, there are occasions when vowels
clash. When this happens, the language is broken
by gaps and interstices and seems to labour. The
most unpleasing effects of sound will be produced
by the juxtaposition of the same long vowels, while
the worst <hi rend="italics">hiatus</hi> occurs between vowels which are
pronounced hollow- or open-mouthed.<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> A, O, U.</note><milestone unit="section" n="34"/> <hi rend="italics">E</hi> has a
flatter, i a narrower sound, and consequently such
blemishes are less noticeable where they are concerned. It is a less serious fault to place short
vowels after long, a statement which applies even
more strongly to placing short vowels before long.
But the least unsatisfactory combination is that of
two short vowels. And in all conjunctions of vowels,
the resulting sound will be proportionately soft or
harsh according as they resemble or differ from each
other in the method of utterance.<milestone unit="section" n="35"/> On the other
hand, <hi rend="italics">hiatus</hi> is not to be regarded as so very terrible
a crime: in fact I do not know which is the worse
fault in this connexion, carelessness or a pedantic

<pb id="p.527"/>

solicitude for correctness. For anxiety on this score
is bound to check the flow of our language and to
divert us from more important considerations.
Therefore while it is a sign of carelessness to admit
<hi rend="italics">hiatus</hi> here, there and everywhere, it is a symptom
of grovelling timidity to be continually in terror of
it, and there is good reason for the view that all the
followers of Isocrates and more especially Theopompus
pay accessive attention to the avoidance of this
detect.<milestone unit="section" n="36"/> On the other hand Demosthenes and Cicero
show a sense of proportion in the way in which they
face the problem. For the coalescence of two letters,
known as <foreign lang="greek">sunaloifh/,</foreign> may make our language run
more smoothly than if every word closed with its
own vowel, while sometimes <hi rend="italics">hiatus</hi> may even prove
becoming and create an impression of grandeur, as
in the following case, <hi rend="italics">pulchra oratione ista iacta te.</hi><note><quote>Boast yourself of that fine speech of yours.</quote></note>
For syllables which are naturally long and rich in
sound gain something from the time which intervenes between two vowels, as though there were a
perceptible pause.<milestone unit="section" n="37"/> I cannot do better than quote
the words of Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">Or.</hi> xxiii. 77.</note> on this subject. <hi rend="italics">Hiatus,</hi> he
says, <hi rend="italics">and the meeting of vowels produce a certain
softness of effect, such as to suggest a not unpleasing
carelessness on the part of the orator, as though he were
more anxious about his matter than his words.</hi></p>
<p>But consonants also are liable to conflict at the
juncture of words, more especially those letters
which are comparatively harsh in sound; as for
instance when the final <hi rend="italics">s</hi> of one word clashes with
<hi rend="italics">x</hi> at the opening of the next. Still more unpleasing
is the hissing sound produced by the collision between
a pair of these consonants, as in the phrase <hi rend="italics">ars
studiorum.</hi><milestone unit="section" n="38"/> This was the reason why Servius, as he

<pb id="p.529"/>

himself has observed, dropped the final s, whenever
the next word began with a consonant, a practice
for which Luranius takes him to task, while Messala
defends him. For he thinks that Lucilius<note>From the Fourth Book of the Satires. Servius and
Luranius cannot be identified.</note> did not
pronounce the final <hi rend="italics">s</hi> in phrases such as, <hi rend="italics">Aeserninus
fuit</hi> and <hi rend="italics">dignus locoque,</hi> while Cicero in his <hi rend="italics">Orator</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Or. xlviii.</hi> 161.</note>
records that this was the practice with many of the
ancients.<milestone unit="section" n="39"/> Hence we get forms such as <hi rend="italics">belligerare</hi> and
<hi rend="italics">pomeridiem,</hi> to which the <hi rend="italics">diee hanc</hi><note><hi rend="italics">i.e. for belligerares, postmeridiem</hi> and <hi rend="italics">diem hanc.</hi></note> of Cato the Censor,
where the final <hi rend="italics">m</hi> is softened into an <hi rend="italics">e,</hi> presents an
analogy. Unlearned readers are apt to alter such
forms when they come across them in old books, and
in their desire to decry the ignorance of the scribes
convict themselves of the same fault.<milestone unit="section" n="40"/> On the other
hand, whenever this same letter <hi rend="italics">m</hi> comes at the end
of a word and is brought into contact with the opening vowel of the next word in such a manner as to
render coalescence possible, it is, although written,
so faintly pronounced (<hi rend="italics">e.g.</hi> in phrases such as <hi rend="italics">nultum
ille</hi> and <hi rend="italics">quantum erat</hi>) that it may almost be regarded
as producing the sound of a new letter.<note><quote>A very probable account is that -m was reduced
through the lips not being closed to pronounce it. If, instead
of closing the lips all that were done were to drop the uvula,
a nasal sound would be given to the following initial vowel,
so that <hi rend="italics">fine onerat</hi> would be pronounced <hi rend="italics">finewonerat</hi> with a
nasalized o.</quote> Lindsay, <hi rend="italics">Lat. Langu.</hi> p. 62. It is this sound
which Quintilian describes as almost the sound of a new
letter.</note> For it is not
elided, but merely obscured, and may be considered
as a symbol occurring between two vowels simply
to prevent their coalescence.<milestone unit="section" n="41"/> Care must also be
taken that the last syllables of one word are not
identical with the opening syllables of the next. In
case any of my readers should wonder that I think
it worth while to lay down such a rule, I may point
out that Cicero makes such a slip in his Letters, in

<pb id="p.531"/>

the sentence <hi rend="italics">res mihi invisae visae sunt, Brute,</hi><note>The letter is lost. <quote>The situation seemed hateful to
me, Brutus.</quote></note> and
in the following line of verse,</p>

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>Ofortunatam natam me consule Romam.</l></quote> <bibl> See XI. i. 24. <note><quote>O happy Rome, born in my consulship.</quote></note></bibl></cit></quote>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="42"/>Again it is a blemish to have too many monosyllables in succession, since the inevitable result is
that, owing to the frequency of the pauses, the
rhythm degenerates into a series of jerks. For the
same reason we must avoid placing a number of
short verbs and nouns in succession; the converse
also is true as regards long syllables, since their
accumulation makes our rhythm drag. It is a fault
of the same class to end a number of successive
sentences with similar cadences, terminations and
inflexions.<milestone unit="section" n="43"/> It is likewise inartistic to accumulate
long series of verbs, nouns or other parts of speech,
since even merits produce tedium unless they have
the saving grace of variety.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="44"/>The principles by which the connexion of words
is guided are not sufficient in the case of <hi rend="italics">commata</hi> and
<hi rend="italics">cola,</hi> though even here beginnings and ends should
harmonise; but our structural effect will very largely
depend on the relative order of these two types of
clause. For in the following instance<note><hi rend="italics">Phil. Il.</hi> xxv. 63. <quote>By his vomiting he filled his lap and
the whole judgement seat with fragments of undigested food.</quote></note> <hi rend="italics">vomens frustis
esculentis gremium suum el totum tribunal implevit</hi> [the
order is satisfactory, since the fact of his having filled
the whole judgement seat with his vomiting is the
more important of the two]. On the other hand
(for I shall repeat the same illustrations for different
purposes to make them more familiar) in the following
passage,<note><hi rend="italics">pro Arch.</hi> viii. 19. <quote>Rocks and solitude answer to the
human voice and wild beasts are often pacified and brought
to a halt by the influence of music.</quote></note> <hi rend="italics">saxa alque solitudines voci respondent, bestiae</hi>

<pb id="p.533"/>

<hi rend="italics">saepe immanes cantu flectuntur atque consistunt,</hi> the
gradation would be improved, if it were reversed:
for it is a greater miracle to move rocks than wild
beasts: but the claims of structural grace have
carried the day. However, let us pass to the
consideration of <hi rend="italics">rhythm.</hi></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="46"/>All combination, arrangement and connexion of
words involves either rhythms (which we call <hi rend="italics">numeri</hi>),
or metres, that is, a certain measure. Now though
both rhythm and metre consist of feet, they differ in
more than one respect.<milestone unit="section" n="46"/> For in the first place rhythm
consists of certain lengths of time, while metre is
determined by the order in which these lengths are
arranged. Consequently the one seems to be concerned with quantity and the other with quality.
Rhythm may depend on equal balance,<milestone unit="section" n="47"/> as in the case
of <hi rend="italics">dactylic</hi> rhythm, where one long syllable balances
two short, (there are it is true other feet of which
this statement is equally true, but the title of
dactylic has been currently applied to all,<note>For purely rhythmical purposes the term dactyl is
arbitrarily used by the rhetoricians to include anapaests as
well. See below.</note> while even
boys are well aware that a long syllable is equivalent
to two beats and a short to one) or it may consist of
feet in which one portion is half as long again as the
other, as is the case with <hi rend="italics">paeanic</hi> rhythm (a <hi rend="italics">paean</hi>
being composed of one long followed by three shorts,
three shorts followed by one long or with any other
arrangement preserving the proportion of three beats
to two) or finally one part of the foot may be twice
the length of the other, as in the case of the <hi rend="italics">iambus,</hi>
which is composed of a short followed by a long, or
of the <hi rend="italics">choreus</hi> consisting of a long followed by a
short.<milestone unit="section" n="48"/> These feet are also employed by metre, but
with this difference, that in rhythm it does not matter
whether the two shorts of the <hi rend="italics">dactyl</hi> precede or

<pb id="p.535"/>

follow the long; for rhythm merely takes into
account the measurement of the time, that is to say,
it insists on the time taken from its rise to its fall
being the same. The measure of verse on the other
hand is quite different; the <hi rend="italics">anapaest</hi> (u u _) or <hi rend="italics">spondee</hi>
(_ _) cannot be substituted at will for the <hi rend="italics">dactyl,</hi> nor
is it a matter of indifference whether the <hi rend="italics">paean</hi>
begins or ends with short syllables.<milestone unit="section" n="49"/> Further, the
laws of metre not merely refuse the substitution of
one foot for another, but will not even admit the
arbitrary substitution of any <hi rend="italics">dactyl</hi> or <hi rend="italics">spondee</hi> for any
other <hi rend="italics">dactyl</hi> or <hi rend="italics">spondee.</hi> For example, in the line

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>Panditur snterea domus omnipotentis Olympi</l></quote> <bibl><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> x. 1. <note><quote>Meanwhile Olympus' halls omnipotent / Are
wide unbarred.</quote></note></bibl></cit></quote>

the alteration of the order of the <hi rend="italics">dactyls</hi> would
destroy the verse.<milestone unit="section" n="50"/> There are also the following
differences, that rhythm has unlimited space over
which it may range, whereas the spaces of metre are
confined, and that, whereas metre has certain definite
cadences, rhythm may run on as it commenced until
it reaches the point of <foreign lang="greek">metabolh/,</foreign> or transition to
another type of rhythm: further, metre is concerned
with words alone, while rhythm extends also to the
motion of the body.<milestone unit="section" n="51"/> Again rhythm more readily
admits of <hi rend="italics">rests</hi><note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> in the musical sense.</note> although they are found in metre as
well. Greater license is, however, admitted when
the time is measured by the beat of the feet or
fingers,<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> in musio.</note> and the intervals are distinguished by
certain symbols indicating the number of shorts
contained within a given space: hence we speak of
four or five time (<foreign lang="greek">tetra/shmoi,</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">penta/shmoi</foreign>) and others
longer still, the Greek <foreign lang="greek">shmei=on</foreign> indicating a single beat.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="52"/>In prose the rhythm should be more definite and

<pb id="p.537"/>

obvious to all. Consequently, it depends on feet,
by which I mean metrical feet, which occur in
oratory to such an extent that we often let slip
verses of every kind without being conscious of the
fact, while everything written in prose can be shown
by analysis to consist of short lines of verse of certain
kinds or sections of the same.<milestone unit="section" n="53"/> For example, I have
come across tiresome grammarians who attempted to
force prose into definite metres, as though it were a
species of lyric poetry. Cicero,<note>See <hi rend="italics">Or.</hi> xx. 67, <hi rend="italics">sqq.</hi></note> indeed, frequently
asserts that the whole art of prose-structure consists
in rhythm and is consequently censured by some
critics on the ground that he would fetter our
style by the laws of rhythm.<milestone unit="section" n="54"/> For these <hi rend="italics">numeri,</hi>
as he himself expressly asserts, are identical with
rhythm, and he is followed in this by Virgil, who
writes,

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>Numeros memini, si verba tenerem</l></quote> <bibl><hi rend="italics">Ecl.</hi> ix. 45. <note><quote>I have the numbers, could I but find the
words.</quote> In this case the nearest translation of <hi rend="italics">numeri</hi> would
be <quote>tune.</quote> But, strictly speaking, it refers to the rhythm
of the tune.</note></bibl></cit></quote>

and Horace, who says,

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>Numerisquefertur</l>
<l>Lege solutis.</l></quote> <bibl><hi rend="italics">Odes.</hi> IV. ii. 11. <note><quote>And sweeps along in numbers free
from laws.</quote></note></bibl></cit></quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="55"/>Among others they attack Cicero's<note><hi rend="italics">Or.</hi> lxx. 234.</note> statement that
the <hi rend="italics">thunderbolts of Demosthenes would not have such
force but for the rhythm with which they are whirled and
sped upon their way.</hi> If by <hi rend="italics">rhythmis contorta</hi> he really
means what his critics assert, I do not agree with
him. For rhythms have, as I have said, no fixed
limit or variety of structure, but run on with the

<pb id="p.539"/>

same rise and fall till they reach their end, and the
style of oratory will not stoop to be measured by
the beat of the foot or the fingers.<milestone unit="section" n="56"/> This fact is
clearly understood by Cicero, who frequently shows
that the sense in which he desires that prose should
be rhythmical is rather that it should not lack rhythm,
a deficiency which would stamp the author as a man
of no taste or refinement, than that it should be tied
by definite rhythmical laws, like poetry; just as,
although we may not wish certain persons to be professional gymnasts, we still do not wish them to be
absolutely ignorant of the art of gynmastics.<milestone unit="section" n="57"/> But the
rounding of the period to an appropriate close which
is produced by the combination of feet requires some
name; and what name is there more suitable than
rhythm, that is to say, the rhythm of oratory, just as
the <hi rend="italics">enthymeme</hi><note>See v. xiv. 24.</note> is the syllogism of oratory? For my
own part, to avoid incurring the calumny, from which
even Cicero was not free, I ask my reader, whenever I
speak of the rhythm of artistic structure (as I have
done on every occasion), to understand that I refer
to the rhythm of oratory, not of verse.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="58"/>It is the task of collocation to link together the
words which have been selected, approved and handed
over to its custody. For even harsh connexions are
better than those which are absolutely valueless.
None the less I should allow the orator to select
certain words for their euphony, provided always that
their force and meaning are the same as those of
the alternative words. He may also be permitted
to add words, provided they are not superfluous, and
to omit them, provided they are not essential to the
sense, while he may employ figures to alter case and
number, since such variety is attractive in itself,

<pb id="p.541"/>

quite apart from the fact that it is frequently adopted
for the sake of the rhythm.<milestone unit="section" n="59"/> Again if reason
demand one form and usage another, the claims of
rhythm will decide our choice between the two,
<hi rend="italics">e.g.</hi> between <hi rend="italics">vitavisse</hi> and <hi rend="italics">vitasse</hi> or between <hi rend="italics">deprehendere</hi> and <hi rend="italics">deprendere.</hi> Further I do not object to
the coalescence of syllables or anything that does no
injury either to sense or style.<milestone unit="section" n="60"/> The most important
task, however, is to know what word is best fitted to
any given place. And the most accomplished artist
will be the man who does not arrange his words
solely with a view to rhythmic effect.</p>
<p>On the other hand the management of feet is far
more difficult in prose than in verse, first because
there are but few feet in a single line of verse which
is far shorter than the lengthy periods of prose;
secondly because each line of verse is always uniform
and its movement is determined by a single definite
scheme, whereas the structure of prose must be
varied if it is to avoid giving offence by its monotony
and standing convicted of affectation.<milestone unit="section" n="61"/> Rhythm
pervades the whole body of prose through all its
extent. For we cannot speak without employing the
long and short syllables of which feet are composed.
Its presence is, however, most necessary and most
apparent at the conclusion of the period, firstly
because every group of connected thoughts has its
natural limit and demands a reasonable interval to
divide it from the commencement of what is to
follow: secondly because the ear, after following the
unbroken flow of the voice and being carried along
down the stream of oratory, finds its best opportunity
of forming a sound judgement on what it has heard,
when the rush of words comes to a halt and gives it

<pb id="p.543"/>

time for consideration.<milestone unit="section" n="62"/> Consequently all harshness
and abruptness must be avoided at this point, where
the mind takes breath and recovers its energy. It
is there that style has its citadel, it is this point that
excites the eager expectation of the audience, it is
from this that the declaimer wins all his glory.
Next to the conclusion of the period, it is the
beginning which claims the most care: for the
audience have their attention fixed on this as well.
<milestone unit="section" n="63"/>But the opening of the sentence presents less difficulty, since it is independent and is not the slave of
what has preceded. It merely takes what has preceded as a starting point, whereas the conclusion
coheres with what has preceded, and however carefully constructed, its elegance will be wasted, if the
path which leads up to it be interrupted. Hence it
is that although the rhythmical structure adopted by
Demosthenes in the passage <foreign lang="greek">toi=s feoi=s eu)/xomai pa=si kai\
pa/sais;</foreign><note><hi rend="italics">De Cor.</hi> I. <quote>I pray to all gods and goddesses.</quote></note> and again in another passage (approved by
all, I think, except Brutus) <foreign lang="greek">ka)/n mh/pw ba/llh| mhde\
toceu/h|,</foreign><note><hi rend="italics">Phil.</hi> iii. 17. <quote>Even though he neither shoots at me nor
strikes me as yet.</quote></note><milestone unit="section" n="64"/> is regarded as severely correct, Cicero is
criticised for passages such as <hi rend="italics">familiaris coeperat esse
balneatori</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Pro Cael.</hi> xxvi. 62. <quote>He had hegnn to be intimate with
the bathkeeper.</quote></note> and for the not less unpleasing <hi rend="italics">archipiratae.</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Verr.</hi> <milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>xxvii. 70.</note>
For although <hi rend="italics">balneatori</hi> and <hi rend="italics">archipiratae</hi> give exactly
the same cadence as <foreign lang="greek">pa=si kai\ pa/sais</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">mhde\ toceu/h|</foreign>
the former are more severely correct.<milestone unit="section" n="65"/> There is also
something in the fact that in the passages from
Cicero two feet are contained in one word, a
practice which even in verse produces an unduly
effeminate effect, and that not merely when the line
ends with a five-syllable word as in <hi rend="italics">fortissima
Tyndaridarum</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Hor. Sat.</hi> I. i. 100.</note>
 but also in four-syllable endings such

<pb id="p.545"/>

as <hi rend="italics">Appnnino,</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Pers.</hi> i. 95.</note> <hi rend="italics">armamentis</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Ov. Met.</hi> xi. 456.</note> <hi rend="italics">and Oreione.</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> iii. 517.</note><milestone unit="section" n="66"/> Consequently
we must also avoid ending our periods with words
containing too many syllables.
With regard to the middle portions of our periods
we must take care not merely that they possess
internal cohesion, but also that the rhythm is neither
sluggish nor long, and above all that we do not fall
into the now fashionable fault of placing a number
of short syllables together with the result that we
produce an effect not unlike the sound of a child's
rattle.<milestone unit="section" n="67"/> For while the beginnings and conclusions of
periods, where the sense begins or ends, are the most
important, it is none the less the fact that the middle
portion may involve some special efforts which
necessitate slight pauses. Remember that the feet
of a runner, even though they do not linger where
they fall, still leave a footprint. Consequently not
only must <hi rend="italics">commata</hi> and <hi rend="italics">cola</hi> begin and end becomingly, but even in parts which are absolutely
continuous without a breathing space, there must be
such almost imperceptible pauses.<milestone unit="section" n="68"/> Who, for example,
can doubt that there is but one thought in the following passage and that it should be pronounced without
a halt for breath? <hi rend="italics">Animadverti, idlices, omnem accusatoris oralionem in duas divisan esse parties</hi><note><hi rend="italics">pro Cluent.</hi> i. 1. <quote>I note, gentlemen, that the speech
for the prosecution falls sharply into two divisions.</quote></note> Still the
groups formed by the first two words, the next three,
and then again by the next two and three, have each
their own special rhythms and cause a slight check
in our breathing: at least such is the opinion of
specialists in rhythm.<milestone unit="section" n="69"/> And just in proportion as
these small segments of the period are grave or
vigorous, slow or rapid, languid or the reverse, so
will the periods which they go to form be severe or
luxuriant, compact or loose.<milestone unit="section" n="70"/> Again, the conclusions

<pb id="p.547"/>

of clauses sometimes seem to halt or hang, if they
are regarded apart from their context, but are usually
caught up and supported by what follows, so that
what seemed a faulty cadence is corrected by the
continuation. <hi rend="italics">Non vult populus Romanus obsoletis
criminibus accusari Verrem</hi> would be harsh in rhythm,
if the sentence ended there; but when it is continued
with what follows, <hi rend="italics">nova postulat, inaudita desiderat,</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Verr.</hi> v. xliv. 117. <quote>The Roman people does not wish
Verres to be accused of obsolete crimes: no, it is new and
Unheard of crimes that it demands and desires.</quote></note>
although the words are separate in meaning, the
rhythmical effect is preserved.<milestone unit="section" n="71"/> <hi rend="italics">Ut adeas, tantum
dabis</hi> would be a bad conclusion, for it forms the last
portion of an iambic trimeter: but it is followed by
<hi rend="italics">ut cibum vestitumque introferre liceat, tantum:</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Verr.</hi> V. xliv. 118. <quote>To see him, you will pay so much,
and so much to bring in food and clothing. No one refused.</quote></note> the
rhythm is still abrupt but is strengthened and supported by the last phrase of all, <hi rend="italics">nemo recusabat.</hi></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="72"/>The appearance of a complete verse in prose has
a most uncouth effect, but even a portion of a verse
is ugly, especially if the last half of a verse occurs in
the cadence of a period or the first half at the beginning. The reverse order may on the other hand
often be positively pleasing, since at times the first
half of a verse will make an excellent conclusion,
provided that it does not cover more than a few
syllables.<milestone unit="section" n="73"/> This is especially the case with the
<hi rend="italics">senarnis</hi> or <hi rend="italics">octonarius.</hi><note>senarius= iambic trimeter. octonarius here = trochaic
tetrameter, <hi rend="italics">not</hi> iambic tetrameter.</note> <hi rend="italics">In Aliica fuisse</hi> is the opening of a <hi rend="italics">senarius</hi> and closes the first clause of the <hi rend="italics">pro

too familiar as a conclusion, is the beginning of an
<hi rend="italics">ocionarius.</hi> Similar effects are to be found in Demosthenes, as for example <foreign lang="greek">pa=si kai\ pa/sais</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">pa=sin u(mi=n</foreign>
and throughout almost the whole exordium of that
speech.<note><hi rend="italics">De Cor.</hi> I.</note> The ends of verses are also excellently

<hi rend="italics">iudices,</hi><note><hi rend="italics">pro Mil.</hi> i. Both quotations give the end of an iambic trimeter.</note> for example and <hi rend="italics">animadverti, iudices.</hi><note><hi rend="italics">pro cluent.</hi> i. 1. Both quotations give the end of an iambic trimeter.</note> But
the opening feet of a verse are not suited to the
opening phrases of prose: Livy provides an example
of this in his preface, which begins with the first
half of a <hi rend="italics">hexameter, 'Facturusne operae premium sim:'</hi>
for these are the words as he wrote them, and they
are better so than as they have been corrected.<note>MSS. of Livy read <hi rend="italics">sim operate pretium:</hi> there is evidence
to show that this may be due to corruption rather than to
correction such as Quintilian describes.</note>
Again,<milestone unit="section" n="75"/> the cadence of a verse is not suitable to the
cadence of a period: compare the phrase of Cicero,
<hi rend="italics">Quo me vertam, nescio,</hi><note><hi rend="italics">pro Lig.</hi> i. 1, <hi rend="italics">pro Cluent.</hi> i. 4.</note> which is the end of a <hi rend="italics">trimeter.</hi>
It matters not whether we speak of a <hi rend="italics">trimeter</hi> or of
a <hi rend="italics">senarius,</hi> since the line has six feet and three beats.
The end of a <hi rend="italics">hexameter</hi> forms a yet worse conclusion;
compare the following passage from the letters of
Brutus: <hi rend="italics">neque illi malunt halbere tutores aut defensores,
quoniam causam sciunt placuiisse Catoni.</hi><note><quote>They ask for no guardians or defenders since they
know that the cause has won the approval of Cato.</quote></note><milestone unit="section" n="76"/> Iambic endings
are less noticeable, because that metre is near akin
to prose. Consequently such lines often slip from
us unawares: they are specially common in Brutus
as a result of his passion for severity of style; they
are not infrequent in Asinius, and are sometimes
even found in Cicero, as for example at the very
beginning of his speech against Lucius Piso: <hi rend="italics">Pro di
immortales, qui hic nunc illuxit dies?</hi><note>An iambic trimeter. <quote>Immortal gods, what day is this
has dawned?</quote></note><milestone unit="section" n="77"/> Equal care must
however be taken to avoid any phrase of a definitely
metrical character, such as the following passage
from Sallust: <hi rend="italics">Falso queritur de natura sua.</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Jug.</hi> I. <quote>The human race complains of its own nature
without reason.</quote> Last five feet of iambic trimeter!</note>For
although the language of prose is bound by certain
laws, it should appear to be free. None the less
Plato, despite the care which he devotes to his
rhythm, has not succeeded in avoiding this fault at

<pb id="p.551"/>

the very opening of the Timaeus,<note>The phrase is <foreign lang="greek">ei(=s, duo/, trei=s, o( de\ te/tartos h(mw=n, w)= fi/le ei(=s, duo/, trei=s</foreign> give the opening of a hexameter, <foreign lang="greek">o( de\ dh\ te/tartos h(mw=n</foreign> the Anacreontic, <foreign lang="greek">duo/ . . . fi/le</foreign> the Iambic trimeter and <foreign lang="greek">ei(=s . . . dh\</foreign> the <foreign lang="greek">penqhmimere/s.</foreign></note><milestone unit="section" n="78"/> where we are met
at the very outset with the opening of a <hi rend="italics">hexameter,</hi>
which is followed by a <hi rend="italics">colon</hi> which can be scanned as
an Anacreontic, or if you like, as a trimeter, while it
is also possible to form what the Greeks call a
<foreign lang="greek">penqhmimere\s</foreign> (that is a portion of the hexameter
composed of two feet and a part of a third): and all
these instances occur within the space of three lines.
Again Thucydides has allowed to slip from his pen
a phrase of the most effeminate rhythm in <foreign lang="greek">u(pe\r h(/misu *ka=res e)fa/nhsan</foreign><note>I, 8. Quintilian probably treats this as Sotadean or
reminiscent of Sotadean rhythm.</note></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="79"/>But, having stated that all prose rhythm consists
of feet, I must say something on these as well.
Different names are given to these feet, and it is
necessary to determine what we shall call each of
them. For my part I propose to follow Cicero<note><hi rend="italics">Or.</hi> ch. lxiv. 7.</note>
(for he himself followed the most eminent Greek
authorities), with this exception, that in my opinion
a foot is never more than three syllables long,
whereas Cicero includes the <hi rend="italics">paean</hi><note>For <hi rend="italics">paean</hi> see &sect; 96. The two varieties with which Quintilian is concerned are&ndash; u u u and u u u &ndash;.</note> and the <hi rend="italics">dochmiac</hi>
(u &ndash; &ndash; u &ndash;), of which the former has four and the
latter as many as five syllables.<milestone unit="section" n="80"/> He does not, however, conceal the fact that some regard these as
rhythms rather than feet: and they are right in so
doing, since whatever is longer than three syllables
involves more than one foot. Since then there are
four feet which consist of two syllables, and eight
composed of three, I shall call them by the following
names: two long syllables make a <hi rend="italics">spondee;</hi> the
<hi rend="italics">pyrrhic</hi> or <hi rend="italics">pariambus,</hi> as some call it, is composed
of two shorts; the <hi rend="italics">iambus</hi> of a short followed by
a long; its opposite, that is a long followed by a
short, is a <hi rend="italics">choreus,</hi> for I prefer that term to the
name of <hi rend="italics">trochee</hi> which is given it by others.<milestone unit="section" n="81"/> Of

<pb id="p.553"/>

trisyllabic feet the <hi rend="italics">dactyl</hi> consists of a long followed
by two shorts, while its opposite, which has the
same time-length, is called an <hi rend="italics">anapaest.</hi> A short
between two longs makes an <hi rend="italics">amphimacer,</hi> although
it is more often called a <hi rend="italics">cretic,</hi> while a long between
two shorts produces its opposite, the <hi rend="italics">amphibruachys.</hi>
Two long syllables following a short make a <hi rend="italics">bacchius,</hi><milestone unit="section" n="82"/>
whereas, if the long syllables come first the foot is
called a <hi rend="italics">palimbacchius.</hi> Three shorts make a <hi rend="italics">trochee,</hi>
although those who give that name to the <hi rend="italics">choreus</hi>
call it a <hi rend="italics">tribrach:</hi> three longs make a <hi rend="italics">molossus.</hi><milestone unit="section" n="83"/> Every
one of these feet is employed in prose, but those
which take a greater time to utter and derive a
certain stability from the length of their syllables
produce a weightier style, short syllables being best
adapted for a nimble and rapid style. Both types
are useful in their proper place: for weight and
slowness are rightly condemned in passages where
speed is required, as are jerkiness and excessive
speed in passages which call for weight.<milestone unit="section" n="84"/> It may
also be important to remark that there are degrees
of length in long syllables and of shortness in short.
Consequently, although syllables may be thought
never to involve more than two time-beats or less
than one, and although for that reason in metre all
shorts and all longs are regarded as equal to other
shorts and longs, they none the less possess some
undefinable and secret quality, which makes some
seem longer and others shorter than the normal.
Verse, on the other hand, has its own peculiar
features, and consequently some syllables may be
either long or short.<milestone unit="section" n="85"/> Indeed, since strict law
allows a vowel to be long or short, as the case may
be, when it stands alone, no less than when one or

<pb id="p.555"/>

more consonants precede it, there can be no doubt,
when it comes to the measuring of feet, that a short
syllable, followed by another which is either long
or short, but is preceded by two consonants, is
lengthened, as for example in the phrase <hi rend="italics">agrestem
tenui musam.</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Ecl.</hi> i. 2. But Virgil wrote <hi rend="italics">silvestrem.</hi></note><milestone unit="section" n="86"/> For both a and <hi rend="italics">gres</hi> are short, but
the latter lengthens the former, thereby transferring
to it something of its own time-length. But how
can it do this, unless it possesses greater length
than is the portion of the shortest syllables, to
which it would itself belong if the consonants <hi rend="italics">st</hi>
were removed? As it is, it lends one time-length
to the preceding syllable, and subtracts one from
that which follows.<note>This theory involves the allotment of a time-value to
consonants: <hi rend="italics">gres</hi> gives the time-value of <hi rend="italics">gr</hi> to <hi rend="italics">a,</hi> and itself
borrows an equivalent time-value from <hi rend="italics">st.</hi> This view is
more explicitly expressed by the fifth-century grammarian
Pompeius (112. 26k), who allots the value of half a time-length to each consonant. Therefore to &abreve; (= one time-length)
are added the two half time-lengths represented by <hi rend="italics">gr</hi> (see
Lindsay, <hi rend="italics">Lat. Language,</hi> p. 129).</note> Thus two syllables which are
naturally short have their time-value doubled by
position.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="87"/>I am, however, surprised that scholars of the
highest learning should have held the view that some
feet should be specially selected and others condemned for the purposes of prose, as if there were
any foot which must not inevitably be found in
prose. Ephorus may express a preference for the
<hi rend="italics">paean</hi> (which was discovered by Thrasymachus and
approved by Aristotle) and for the <hi rend="italics">dactyl</hi> also, on
the ground that both these feet provide a happy
mixture of long and short; and may avoid the
<hi rend="italics">spondee</hi> and the <hi rend="italics">trochee,</hi><milestone unit="section" n="88"/> condemning the one as too
slow and the other as too rapid; Aristotle<note><hi rend="italics">Rhet.</hi> iii. 8.</note> may
regard the <hi rend="italics">heroic</hi> foot, which is another name for
the <hi rend="italics">dactyl,</hi> as too dignified and the <hi rend="italics">iambus</hi> as too
commonplace, and may damn the <hi rend="italics">trochee as</hi> too

<pb id="p.557"/>

hasty and dub it the <hi rend="italics">cancan;</hi> Theodectes and Theophrastus may agree with him, and a later critic,
Dionysius of Halicarnassus, may adopt a similar
view;<milestone unit="section" n="89"/> but for all they say, these feet will force
themselves upon them against their will, and it will
not always be possible for them to employ the <hi rend="italics">dactyl</hi>
or their beloved <hi rend="italics">paean,</hi> which they select for special
praise because it so rarely forms part of a verse rhythm. It is not, however, the words which cause
some feet to be of more common occurrence than
others; for the words cannot be increased or
diminished in bulk, nor yet can they, like the notes
in music, be made short or long at will; everything
depends on transposition and arrangement.<milestone unit="section" n="90"/> For a
large proportion of feet are formed by the connexion
or separation of words, which is the reason why
several different verses can be made out of the same
words: for example, I remember that a poet of no
small distinction writing the following line:

<quote rend="blockquote"><l>Astra tenet caelum, mare classes, area messem,</l> <note><quote>The heaven holds the stars, the sea the fleets, and the
threshing-floor the harvest.</quote> <hi rend="italics">messem area, classes mare,
caelum tenet astra</hi> is identical in scansion with the Sotadean
which follows, save that it opens with a <hi rend="italics">spondee</hi> instead of an
<hi rend="italics">anapaest.</hi></note></quote>

a line which, if the order of the words be reversed,
becomes a Sotadean; again, the following Sotadean,
if reversed, reads as as an <hi rend="italics">iambic trimeter:</hi>

<quote rend="blockquote"><l>caput exeruit mobile pinus repelita.</l><note>The sense is uncertain. It appears to refer to a pine
beam or trunk floating half-submerged. <quote>The pine-beam
caught afresh put forth its nimble head.</quote></note></quote>

Feet therefore should be mixed,<milestone unit="section" n="91"/> while care must be
taken that the majority are of a pleasing character,
and that the inferior feet are lost in the surrounding
crowd of their superior kindred. The nature of
letters and syllables cannot be changed, but their
adaptability to each other is a consideration of no
small importance. Long syllables, as I have said,

<pb id="p.559"/>

carry the greater dignity and weight, while short
syllables create an impression of speed: if the latter
are intermixed with a few long syllables, their gait
will be a run, but a gallop if they are continuous.
<milestone unit="section" n="92"/>When a short syllable is followed by a long the effect
is one of vigorous ascent, while a long followed by a
short produces a gentler impression and suggests
descent. It is therefore best to begin with long
syllables, though at times it may be correct to begin
with short, as in the phrase <hi rend="italics">novum crimen:</hi><note><hi rend="italics">pro Lig.</hi> i. 1.</note> a gentler
effect is created, if we commence with two shorts,
as in the phrase <hi rend="italics">animadverti iudices:</hi> but this opening, which comes from the <hi rend="italics">pro Cluentio,</hi> is perfectly
correct, since that speech begins with something
similar to partition, which requires speed.<note><hi rend="italics">pro Cluent.</hi> i. 1. The speech begins: <quote>I note, gentlemen of the jury, that the whole speech of the accuser falls
into two parts, of which one,</quote> etc. It is this which is
described as <quote>similar to partition.</quote> <hi rend="italics">lenius a dabaas</hi> Capperonnier for <hi rend="italics">levibus</hi> (AG).</note><milestone unit="section" n="93"/> Similarly
the conclusion of a sentence is stronger when long
syllables preponderate, but it may also be formed
of short syllables, although the quantity of the final
syllable is regarded as indifferent. I am aware that
a concluding short syllable is usually regarded as
equivalent to a long, because the time-length which
it lacks appears to be supplied from that which
follows. But when I consult my own ears I find
that it makes a great difference whether the final
syllable is really long or only treated as the equivalent of a long. For there is not the same fullness
of rhythm in <hi rend="italics">diccre incipieniem timere</hi><note><hi rend="italics"> pro Mil.</hi> i. 1. <quote>To show fear when beginning to speak.</quote></note> as there is in
<hi rend="italics">ausus est confiteri.</hi><note><hi rend="italics">pro Lig.</hi> i. 1.</note><milestone unit="section" n="94"/> But if it makes no difference
whether the final syllable be long or short, the concluding feet in these two instances must be identical:
and yet somehow or other one gives the impression
of sitting down and the other of a simple halt.
This fact has led some critics to allow three timebeats for a final long syllable, adding the extra

<pb id="p.561"/>

time-length which a short syllable derives from its
position at the end of a sentence to the long syllable
as well. And it not merely makes a difference with
what foot a sentence ends, but the penultimate
foot is also of importance.<milestone unit="section" n="95"/> It is not, however,
necessary to go back further than three feet, and
only that if the feet contain less than three syllables,
for we must avoid the exactitude of verse: on the
other hand, we must not go back less than two:
otherwise we shall be dealing with a foot and not
with rhythm. But in this connexion the <hi rend="italics">dichoreus</hi>
may be regarded as one foot, if indeed a foot consisting of two <hi rend="italics">chorei</hi> can be considered as a single foot.
<milestone unit="section" n="96"/>The same is true of the <hi rend="italics">paean</hi> composed of the
<hi rend="italics">choreus</hi> and a <hi rend="italics">pyrrhic,</hi> a foot which is regarded as
specially suitable to the beginning of a sentence, or
of the other <hi rend="italics">paean,</hi> formed of three shorts followed
by a long, to which the conclusion is specially
dedicated. It is of these two forms that writers on
rhythm generally speak. Some, however, call all
feet containing three short syllables and a long by
the name of <hi rend="italics">paean,</hi> irrespective of the position of
the long syllable, and merely taking into account the
total number of time-lengths that it contains.<milestone unit="section" n="97"/> The
<hi rend="italics">dochmiac,</hi> again, which consists of a <hi rend="italics">bacchius</hi> and an
<hi rend="italics">iambus,</hi> or of an <hi rend="italics">iambus</hi> and a <hi rend="italics">cretic,</hi> forms a solid and
severe conclusion. The <hi rend="italics">spondee,</hi> so frequently employed in this position by Demosthenes, is used with
varying effect. It is most impressive when preceded
by a <hi rend="italics">cretic,</hi> as in the following instance: <hi rend="italics">De qua ego
nihil dicam, nisi depellendi criminis causa.</hi><note><hi rend="italics">pro Cael.</hi> xiii. 31. <quote>Concerning which I will say nothing
except for the purpose of refuting the charge.</quote></note> Again there
is a point, of the importance of which I spoke above,
namely that it makes a considerable difference
whether two feet are contained in a single word

<pb id="p.563"/>

or whether they are both detached. Thus <hi rend="italics">criminis
causa</hi> makes a strong and <hi rend="italics">archipiratae</hi><note>See &sect; 64.</note> a weak ending, while tile weakness is still further increased if
the first foot be a <hi rend="italics">tribrach,</hi> as for instance in words
like <hi rend="italics">facilitates</hi> or <hi rend="italics">temeritates.</hi><milestone unit="section" n="98"/> For the mere fact that
words are separated from each other involves an
imperceptible length of time: for instance, the
<hi rend="italics">spondee</hi> forming the middle foot of a <hi rend="italics">pentameter</hi> must
consist of the last syllable of one word and the first
of another, otherwise the verse is no verse at all.
It is permissible, though less satisfactory, for the
<hi rend="italics">spondee</hi> to be preceded by an <hi rend="italics">anapaest:</hi> e.g. <hi rend="italics">muliere
non solum nobili, verum etiami nota.</hi><note><hi rend="italics">pro Cael.</hi> xiii. 31. <quote>A woman, not only of noble birth,
but even notorious.</quote></note><milestone unit="section" n="99"/> Andit may also, in
addition to the <hi rend="italics">anapaest</hi> and <hi rend="italics">cretic,</hi> be preceded by
the <hi rend="italics">iambus,</hi> which is a syllable less in length than
both of them, thus making one short syllable precede three long. But it is also perfectly correct to
place a <hi rend="italics">spondee</hi> before an <hi rend="italics">iambus,</hi> as in <hi rend="italics">armis fui,</hi> or
it may be preceded by a <hi rend="italics">bacchius</hi> instead of a <hi rend="italics">spondee,</hi>
e.g. <hi rend="italics">in armis fui,</hi><note><hi rend="italics">pro Lig.</hi> iii. 9. <quote>I was in arms.</quote></note> thereby making the last foot a
<hi rend="italics">dochmiac.</hi><milestone unit="section" n="100"/> From this it follows that the <hi rend="italics">molossus</hi> also
is adapted for use in the conclusion provided that it
be preceded by a short syllable, though it does not
matter to what foot the latter belongs: e.g. <hi rend="italics">illud
scimus, ubicunque sunt, esse pro nobis.</hi><milestone unit="section" n="101"/> The effect of
the <hi rend="italics">spondee</hi> is less weighty, if it be preceded by a
<hi rend="italics">palimbacchius</hi> and <hi rend="italics">pyrrhic,</hi> as in <hi rend="italics">iudicii Iuniani.</hi><note>The text is clearly corrupt as it stands, since the first
syllable of <hi rend="italics">Iuniani</hi> is long. Further, if <hi rend="italics">iudici</hi> be read with
the best texts of Cicero, there is no <hi rend="italics">pyrrhic</hi> (u u) in the
phrase, which is identical in rhythm with <hi rend="italics">ausus est confiteri,</hi>
praised just above. If <hi rend="italics">iudicii</hi> is read the final <hi rend="italics">spondee</hi> might
be said to be preceded by a <hi rend="italics">pyrrhic</hi> and a <hi rend="italics">palimbacchius</hi> (i. e.
<hi rend="italics">iud/&#x012D;c&#x012D;/&imacr; I&umacr;n&#x012D;/&amacr;n&imacr;</hi>).  The fact that the termination of both
words is the same would account for the disappearance of
one of them. The corruption may easily lie deeper still.
But as the words quoted come from an actual speech of
Cicero, the error is not likely to lie in the quotation, <hi rend="italics">pro
Cluent.</hi> i. 1.</note> Still
worse is the rhythm when the <hi rend="italics">spondee</hi> is preceded
by a <hi rend="italics">paean,</hi> as in <hi rend="italics">Brute, dubitavi,</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Or.</hi> i. I. <quote>I hesitated, Brutus.</quote></note> although this
phrase may, if we prefer, be regarded as consisting

<pb id="p.565"/>

of a <hi rend="italics">dactyl</hi> and a <hi rend="italics">bacchius.</hi> As a rule, endings composed of two <hi rend="italics">spondees,</hi> a termination which causes
comment even in a verse, are to be deprecated,
unless the phrase is composed of three separate
members, as in <hi rend="italics">cur de perfiigis nostris copias comparat
is contra nos?</hi><note><quote>Why does he collect forces against us from our
deserters?</quote> L. Crassus quoted in <hi rend="italics">Or.</hi> lxvi. 223.</note> where we have a word of two syllables
preceded and followed by a monosyllable.<milestone unit="section" n="102"/> Even the
<hi rend="italics">dactyl</hi> ought not to precede a final <hi rend="italics">spondee,</hi> since we
condemn verse-endings at the period's close. The
<hi rend="italics">bacchius</hi> is employed at the conclusion, sometimes in
conjunction with itself as in <hi rend="italics">venenum timerss</hi><note><hi rend="italics">pro Cael.</hi> xiv. 33. <quote>That you should fear poison.</quote></note> while it
is also effective when a <hi rend="italics">choreus</hi> and <hi rend="italics">spondee</hi> are placed
before it as in <hi rend="italics">ut venenum timeres.</hi> Its opposite, the
<hi rend="italics">palimbacchius,</hi> is also employed as a conclusion (unless, of course, we insist that the last syllable of a
sentence is always long), and is best preceded by a
<hi rend="italics">molossus,</hi> as in <hi rend="italics">civis Romanus</hi> sum,<note><hi rend="italics">Verr.</hi> v. lxii. 162.</note> or by a <hi rend="italics">bacchius,</hi> as
in <hi rend="italics">quod hie potest, nos possemus.</hi><note><hi rend="italics">pro Lig.</hi> iv. 10.</note><milestone unit="section" n="103"/> It would, however,
be truer to say that in such cases the conclusion consists of a <hi rend="italics">choreus</hi> preceded by a <hi rend="italics">spondee,</hi> for the rhythm
is concentrated in <hi rend="italics">nos possemus</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Romanus sum.</hi> The
<hi rend="italics">dichoreus,</hi> which is the repetition of one and the same
foot, may also form the conclusion, and was much
beloved by the Asiatic school: Cicero illustrates it by
<hi rend="italics">Patris dictum sapiens temeritasfilii comprobavit.</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Orat.</hi> Ixiii. 214. <quote>The wise temerity of the son confirmed
the statement of the father.</quote></note><milestone unit="section" n="104"/> The
<hi rend="italics">choreus</hi> may also be preceded by a <hi rend="italics">pyrrhic,</hi> as in <hi rend="italics">omnes
prope cives virtute, gloria, digitiate superabat.</hi><note><hi rend="italics">pro Cael.</hi> xiv. 34. <quote>He surpassed almost all other citizens
in virtue, glory and honour.</quote></note> The
<hi rend="italics">dactyl</hi> also may come at the close, unless indeed it be
held that, when it forms the final foot, it is transformed
into a <hi rend="italics">cretic:</hi> e.g. <hi rend="italics">muliercula nixus in litore.</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Verr.</hi> v. xxxiii. 86. <quote>Leaning on a worthless woman on
the shore.</quote></note> The
effect will be good if it is preceded by a <hi rend="italics">cretic</hi> or an
<hi rend="italics">iambus,</hi> but unsatisfactory if it is preceded by a

<pb id="p.567"/>

<hi rend="italics">spondee,</hi> and worse still if by a <hi rend="italics">choreus.<milestone unit="section" n="105"/> The amphibrachys</hi> may close the cadence, as in Q. <hi rend="italics">Ligarium in
Africa fuisse,</hi><note><hi rend="italics">pro Lig. i. 1.</hi></note> although in that case some will prefer
to call it a <hi rend="italics">bacchius.</hi> The <hi rend="italics">trochee</hi><note>It must be remembered that for Quintilian a <hi rend="italics">trochee</hi> is
<hi rend="italics">the same</hi> as a <hi rend="italics">tribrach</hi> (u u u). See &sect; 82.</note> is one of the less
good endings, if any final syllable is to be regarded
as short, as it undoubtedly must be. Otherwise
how can we end with the <hi rend="italics">dichoreus,</hi> so dear to many
orators? Of course, if it be insisted that the final
syllable is long, the <hi rend="italics">trochee</hi> becomes an <hi rend="italics">anapaest.</hi><milestone unit="section" n="106"/> If
preceded by a long syllable, the <hi rend="italics">trochee</hi> becomes a
<hi rend="italics">paean,</hi> as is the case with phrases such as <hi rend="italics">sipotero,</hi> or
<hi rend="italics">dirit hoc Cicero,</hi> or <hi rend="italics">obstat invidia.</hi> But this form of
<hi rend="italics">paean</hi> is specially allotted to the beginnings of
sentences. The <hi rend="italics">pyrrhic</hi> may close a sentence if
preceded by a <hi rend="italics">choreus,</hi> thereby forming a <hi rend="italics">paean.</hi><note>As he has in the preceding clause stated that this form
of <hi rend="italics">paean</hi> is regarded as specially adapted to the opening of
a sentence, it cannot be supposed that he commends this
employment of the <hi rend="italics">pyrrhic.</hi> He mentions it only to illustrate
another method of forming the <hi rend="italics">paean</hi> (e.g. <hi rend="italics">multa bene</hi>) by two
words, the first a <hi rend="italics">chores,</hi> the second a <hi rend="italics">pyrrhic.</hi> His view
about the employment of this form of <hi rend="italics">paean</hi> is that it is
sometimes used at the end, but that such a position is not
advisable.</note>
But all these feet which end in short syllables will
lack the stability required for the cadence, and
should as a rule only be employed in cases where
speed is required and there is no marked pause at
the ends of the sentences.<milestone unit="section" n="107"/> The <hi rend="italics">cretic</hi> is excellent,
both at the beginning (e.g. <hi rend="italics">quod precatus a diis immortalibus sum</hi><note><hi rend="italics">pro Muren.</hi> i. 1.</note>) and at the close (e.g. <hi rend="italics">in conspeclu
populi Romani vomere postridie</hi>).<note><hi rend="italics">Phil.</hi> II. xxv. 63.</note> The last example
makes it clear what a good effect is produced when
it is preceded by an <hi rend="italics">anapaest</hi> or by that form of <hi rend="italics">paean</hi>
which is regarded as best suited to the end of a
sentence. But the <hi rend="italics">cretic</hi> may be preceded by a
<hi rend="italics">cretic,</hi> as in <hi rend="italics">servare quam plurinos.</hi><note><hi rend="italics">pro Lig.</hi> xii. 38.</note> It is better thus
than when it is preceded by a <hi rend="italics">chores,</hi> as in <hi rend="italics">quis non
turpe duceret?</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Phil.</hi> II. xxv. 63.</note> assuming that we treat the final short
syllable as long. However, for the sake of argument,
let us substitute <hi rend="italics">duceres</hi> for <hi rend="italics">duceret.</hi><milestone unit="section" n="108"/> Here, however,

<pb id="p.569"/>

we get the <hi rend="italics">rest</hi> of which I spoke:<note>&sect;51.</note> for we make a
short pause between the last word and the last
but one, thus slightly lengthening the final syllable
of <hi rend="italics">turpe;</hi> otherwise <hi rend="italics">quis non turpe duceret?</hi> will
give us a jerky rhythm resembling the end of
an <hi rend="italics">iambic trimeter. So,</hi> too, if you pronounce <hi rend="italics">ore
excipere liceret</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Verr.</hi> v. xlv. 118. The licentious metre is Sotadean.</note> without a pause, you will reproduce
the rhythm of a licentious metre, whereas if triply
punctuated and thus provided with what are practically three separate beginnings, the phrase is full of
dignity.<milestone unit="section" n="109"/> In specifying the feet above-mentioned, I
do not mean to lay it down as an absolute law that
no others can be used, but merely wish to indicate
the usual practice and the principles that are best
suited for present needs. I may add that two consecutive <hi rend="italics">anapaests</hi> should be avoided, since they form
the conclusion of a <hi rend="italics">pentameter</hi> or reproduce the rhythm
of the <hi rend="italics">anapaestic</hi> metre, as in the passage, <hi rend="italics">nam ubi
libido dominatur, innocentiae leve praesidinun est,</hi><note>Crassus in Cic. <hi rend="italics">Or.</hi> lxv. 219. <quote>For where lust holds
sway, there is but small protection for innocence.</quote></note> where
elision makes the last two syllables sound as one.
<milestone unit="section" n="110"/>The <hi rend="italics">anapaest</hi> should preferably be preceded by a
<hi rend="italics">spondee</hi> or a <hi rend="italics">bacchius,</hi> as, for instance, if you alter the
order of words in the passage just quoted to <hi rend="italics">leve
innocentiae praesidium est.</hi> Personally, although I
know that in this I am in disagreement with great
writers, I am not attracted by the <hi rend="italics">paean</hi> consisting
of three shorts followed by a long: for it is no more
than an <hi rend="italics">anapaest</hi> with the addition of another short
syllable (e.g. <hi rend="italics">facilitas, agilitas</hi>). Why it should have
been so popular, I cannot see, unless it be that those
who gave it their approval were students of the
language of common life rather than of oratory.
It is preferably preceded by short syllables,<milestone unit="section" n="111"/> such
as are provided by the <hi rend="italics">pyrrhic</hi> or the <hi rend="italics">choreus</hi> (e.g.

<pb id="p.571"/>

<hi rend="italics">mea facilitas, nostra facilitas);</hi> on the other hand, if
it be preceded by a <hi rend="italics">spondee,</hi> we have the conclusion
of an <hi rend="italics">iambic trimeter,</hi> as indeed we have in the <hi rend="italics">paean</hi>
considered alone. The opposite form of <hi rend="italics">paean is</hi>
deservedly commended as an opening: for the first
syllable gives it stability and the next three speed.
None the less I think that there are other feet
which are better suited for this purpose than even
this <hi rend="italics">paean.</hi></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="112"/>My purpose in discussing this topic at length is
not to lead the orator to enfeeble his style by
pedantic measurement of feet and weighing of
syllables: for oratory should possess a vigorous
flow, and such solicitude is worthy only of a
wretched pedant, absorbed in trivial detail:<milestone unit="section" n="113"/> since
the man who exhausts himself by such painful diligence will have no time for more important considerations; for he will disregard the weight of his
subject matter, despise true beauty of style and, as
Lucilius says, will construct a <hi rend="italics">tesselated pavement of
phrases nicely dovetailed together in intricate patterns.</hi><note>In <hi rend="italics">Or.</hi> xliv. 149, the lines are actually quoted <quote>quam
lepide lexeis compostae Ut tesserulae oinnes arte pavimnento
atque emblemate verniculato.</quote> <quote>How neatly his phrases
are put together, like a cunningly tesselated pavement with
intricate inlay.</quote></note>
The inevitable result will be that his passions will
cool and his energy be wasted, just as our dandies
destroy their horses' capacity for speed by training
them to shorten their paces.<milestone unit="section" n="114"/> Prose-structure, of
course, existed before rhythms were discovered in
it, just as poetry was originally the outcome of a
natural impulse and was created by the instinctive
feeling of the ear for quantity and the observation of
time and rhythm, while the discovery of feet came
later. Consequently assiduous practice in writing will
be sufficient to enable us to produce similar rhythmical
effects when speaking extempore.<milestone unit="section" n="115"/> Further it is not so
important for us to consider the actual feet as the

<pb id="p.573"/>

general rhythmical effect of the period, just as the
poet in writing a verse considers the metre as a
whole, and does not concentrate his attention on the
six or five individual feet that constitute the verse.
For poetry originated before the laws which govern
it, a fact which explains Ennius' statement<note>Enn. <hi rend="italics">Ann.</hi> 213.</note> that
<hi rend="italics">Fauns and prophets sang.</hi><milestone unit="section" n="116"/> Therefore rhythmical
structure will hold the same place in prose that is
held by versification in poetry.</p>
<p>The best judge as to rhythm is the ear, which
appreciates fullness of rhythm or feels the lack of it,
is offended by harshness, soothed by smooth and
excited by impetuous movement, and approves
stability, while it detects limping measures and
rejects those that are excessive and extravagant.
It is for this reason that those who have received a
thorough training understand the theory of artistic
structure, while even the untrained derive pleasure
from it.<milestone unit="section" n="117"/> There are some points, it is true, which are
beyond the power of art to inculcate. For example
if the case, tense or mood with which we have
begun, produces a harsh rhythm, it must be changed.
But is it possible to lay down any definite rule as to
what the change of case, tense or mood should be?
It is often possible to help out the rhythm when it
is in difficulties by introducing variety through the
agency of a <hi rend="italics">figure.</hi> But what is this <hi rend="italics">figure</hi> to be?
<hi rend="italics">A figure of speech</hi> or a <hi rend="italics">figure of thought?</hi> Can we
give any general ruling on the subject? In such
cases opportunism is our only salvation, and we must
be guided by consideration of the special circumstances.<milestone unit="section" n="118"/> Further with regard to the time-lengths,
which are of such importance where rhythm is concerned, what standard is there by which they can be

<pb id="p.575"/>

regulated save that of the ear? Why do some
sentences produce a full rhythmical effect, although
the words which they contain are few, whereas others
containing a greater number are abrupt and short in
rhythm? Why again in periods do we get an
impression of incompleteness, despite the fact that
the sense is complete?<milestone unit="section" n="119"/> Consider the following
example: <hi rend="italics">neminem vestrum ignorare arbitror, iudices,
hunc per hosce dies sermonem vulgi atque hanc opinionem
populi Romani fiisse.</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Verr.</hi> I. i. 1. <quote>I think that none of you, gentlemen, are
igroraint that during these days such has been the talk of the
common folk and such the opinion of the Roman people.</quote></note> Why is <hi rend="italics">hosce</hi> preferable to <hi rend="italics">hos,</hi>
although the latter presents no harshness? I am
not sure that I can give the reason, but none the
less I feel that <hi rend="italics">hosce</hi> is better. Why is it not enough
to say <hi rend="italics">sermonem vulgifuisse,</hi> which would have satisfied
the bare demands of rhythm? I cannot tell, and yet
my ear tells me that the rhythm would have lacked
fullness without the reduplication of the phrase.<milestone unit="section" n="120"/> The
answer is that in such cases we must rely on feeling.
It is possible to have an inadequate understanding of
what it is precisely that makes for severity or charm,
but yet to produce the required effect better by
taking nature for our guide in place of art: none
the less there will always be some principle of art
underlying the promptings of nature.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="121"/>It is, however, the special duty of the orator to
realise when to employ the different kinds of
rhythm. There are two points which call for
consideration if he is to do this with success. The
one is concerned with feet, the other with the
general rhythm of the period which is produced
by their combination. I will deal with the latter
first. We speak of <hi rend="italics">commata, cola</hi> and periods.<milestone unit="section" n="122"/>
<hi rend="italics">A comma,</hi> in my opinion, may be defined as the
expression of a thought lacking rhythmical

<pb id="p.577"/>

completeness; on the other hand, most writers regard it
merely as a portion of the <hi rend="italics">colon.</hi> As an example I
may cite the following from Cicero: <hi rend="italics">Domus tibi
deerat? at habebas: pecunia superabat? at egebas.</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Or.</hi> lxvii. 223. See IX. ii. 15.</note>
But a <hi rend="italics">comma</hi> may also consist of a single word, as in
the following instance where <hi rend="italics">diximnus</hi> is a <hi rend="italics">comma:
Diximus, testes dare volumus.</hi><milestone unit="section" n="123"/> A <hi rend="italics">colon,</hi> on the other
hand, is the expression of a thought which is
rhythmically complete, but is meaningless if detached from the whole body of the sentence. For
example O <hi rend="italics">callidos homines</hi><note>From the lost <hi rend="italics">pro Cornelio.</hi> <quote>O the cunning of those
men! O what careful forethought! I ask you did one of us
fail to note that such would be your action?</quote></note> is complete in itself, but
is useless if removed from the rest of the sentence,
as the hand, foot or head if separated from the
body. He goes on, O <hi rend="italics">rein excogitatam.</hi> At what
point do the members begin to form a body? Only
when the conclusion is added: <hi rend="italics">quem, quaeso, nostrum
fefellit, id vos ita esse facturos?</hi> a sentence which Cicero
regards as unusually concise. Thus as a rule <hi rend="italics">commata</hi>
and <hi rend="italics">cola</hi> are fragmentary and require a conclusion.
<milestone unit="section" n="124"/>The period is given a number of different names by
Cicero,<note><hi rend="italics"> Orat.</hi> lxi. 204.</note> who calls it <hi rend="italics">ambitus, circuitus, comprehensio,
continuatio and circumscriptio.</hi> It has two forms. The
one is simple, and consists of one thought expressed
in a number of words, duly rounded to a close. The
other consists of <hi rend="italics">commata</hi> and <hi rend="italics">cola,</hi> comprising a
number of different thoughts: for example, <hi rend="italics">aderat
ianitor carceris, carnriex praetoris</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Verr.</hi> v. xlv. 118. <quote>There stood the jailer, the praetor's
executioner.</quote></note> and the rest.<milestone unit="section" n="125"/> The
period must have at least two <hi rend="italics">cola.</hi> The average
number would appear to be <hi rend="italics">four,</hi> but it often contains
even more. According to Cicero,<note><hi rend="italics">Or.</hi> lxvi. 222. Cicero says <hi rend="italics">hexcameters,</hi> not <hi rend="italics">senarii.</hi></note> its length should
be restricted to the equivalent of four <hi rend="italics">senarii</hi> or to
the compass of a single breath. It is further essential
that it should complete the thought which it expresses. It must be clear and intelligible and must

<pb id="p.579"/>

not be too long to be carried in the memory. A
<hi rend="italics">colon,</hi> if too long, makes the sentence drag, while on
the other hand, if it be too short it gives an impression
of instability.<milestone unit="section" n="126"/> Wherever it is essential to speak with
force, energy and pugnacity, we shall make free use
of <hi rend="italics">commata</hi> and <hi rend="italics">cola,</hi> since this is most effective, and
our rhythmical structure must be so closely conformed to our matter, that violent themes should be
expressed in violent rhythms to enable the audience
to share the horror felt by the speaker.<milestone unit="section" n="127"/> On the
other hand we shall employ <hi rend="italics">cola</hi> by preference when
narrating facts, or relax the texture of our periods
by considerable pauses and looser connexions, always
excepting those passages in which narration is
designed for decorative effect and not merely for
the instruction of the audience, as for example the
passage in the Verrines where Cicero<note>Verr. IV. xlviii. 106.</note> tells the story
of the Rape of Proserpine: for in such cases a smooth
and flowing texture is required.<milestone unit="section" n="128"/> The full periodic
style is well adapted to the <hi rend="italics">exordium</hi> of important
cases, where the theme requires the orator to express
anxiety, admiration or pity: the same is true of
<hi rend="italics">commonplaces</hi> and all kinds of <hi rend="italics">amplification.</hi> But it
should be severe when we are prosecuting and
expansive in panegyric. It is also most effective in
the <hi rend="italics">peroration.</hi><milestone unit="section" n="129"/> But we must only employ this form
of rhythmical structure in its full development, when
the judge has not merely got a grasp of the matter,
but has been charmed by our style, surrendered
himself to the pleader and is ready to be led whither
we will, by the delight which he experiences.
History does not so much demand full, rounded
rhythms as a certain continuity of motion and connexion of style. For all its <hi rend="italics">cola</hi> are closely linked

<pb id="p.581"/>

together, while the fluidity of its style gives it great
variety of movement; we may compare its motion
to that of men, who link hands to steady their steps,
and lend each other mutual support.<milestone unit="section" n="130"/> The <hi rend="italics">demonstrative</hi> type of oratory requires freer and more
expansive rhythms, while <hi rend="italics">forensic</hi> and <hi rend="italics">deliberative</hi>
oratory will vary the arrangement of their words in
conformity with the variety of their themes.
I must now turn to discuss the first of the two
points which I mentioned above.<note>Sect. 121.</note> No one will deny
that some portions of our speech require a gentle
flow of language, while others demand speed,
sublimity, pugnacity, ornateness or simplicity, as
the case may be,<milestone unit="section" n="131"/> or that long syllables are best
adapted to express dignity, sublimity and ornateness.
That is to say, while the gentler form of utterance
requires length of vowel sounds, sublime and ornate
language demands sonority as well. On the other
hand, passages of an opposite character, such as those
in which we argue, distinguish, jest or use language
approximating to colloquial speech, are better served
by short syllables.<milestone unit="section" n="132"/> Consequently in the <hi rend="italics">exordium</hi>
we shall vary our structure to suit the thought.
For I cannot agree with Celsus, when he would
impose a single stereotyped form upon the <hi rend="italics">exordium</hi>
and asserts that the best example of the structure
required for this purpose is to be found in Asinius:
e. <hi rend="italics">g., si, Caesar, ex omnibus mortalibus, qui sunt ac
fuerunt, posset huic causae disceptator legi, non quisquam
te potius optandus nobis fuit.</hi><note><quote>If, Caesar, one man of all that are or have ever been could
be chosen to try this case, there is none whom we could
have preferred to you.</quote></note><milestone unit="section" n="133"/> I do not for a moment
deny that the structure of this passage is excellent,
but I refuse to admit that the form of rhythmical
structure which it exemplifies should be forced on all
<hi rend="italics">exordia.</hi> For there are various ways in which the

<pb id="p.583"/>

judge's mind may be prepared for what is to come:
at times we appeal for pity, at others take up a
modest attitude, while we may assume an air of
energy or dignity, flatter our audience, attempt to
alter their opinions and exhort them to give us their
best attention, according as the situation may demand.
And as all these methods are different by nature, so
each requires a different rhythmical treatment. Did
Cicero employ similar rhythms in his <hi rend="italics">exordia</hi> to the
<hi rend="italics">pro Milone,</hi> the <hi rend="italics">pro Cluentio</hi> and the <hi rend="italics">pro Ligario?</hi>
<milestone unit="section" n="134"/>The <hi rend="italics">statement of fact</hi> as a rule requires slower and
what I may be allowed to call more modest feet;
and the different kinds of feet should, as far as
possible, be intermixed. For while the style of this
portion of our speech is generally marked by restraint
of language, there are occasions when it is called
upon to soar to greater heights, although on the
other hand its aim will at all times be to instruct the
audience and impress the facts upon their minds, a
task which must not be carried out in a hurry. Indeed
my personal opinion is that the <hi rend="italics">statement of fact</hi>
should be composed of long <hi rend="italics">cola</hi> and short <hi rend="italics">periods.</hi>
Arguments,<milestone unit="section" n="135"/> inasmuch as they are characterised by
energy and speed, will employ the feet best adapted
to these qualities. They will not however acquire
rapidity at the expense of force by employing
<hi rend="italics">trochees,</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Trochee</hi> (u u u).</note> but will rather make use of those feet which
consist of a mixture of long and short syllables,
though the long should not outnumber the short.
Lofty passages,<milestone unit="section" n="136"/> which employ long and sonorous
vowels, are specially well served by the amplitude of
the <hi rend="italics">dactyl</hi> and the <hi rend="italics">paean,</hi> feet which, although they
contain a majority of short syllables, are yet not
deficient in time-length. On the other hand, where

<pb id="p.585"/>

violence is required, the requisite energy will be
best secured by the employment of the <hi rend="italics">iambus,</hi> not
merely because that foot contains but two syllables,
with the result that its beat is more frequent, making
it unsuited to gentle language, but also because every
foot gives the effect of an ascent, as they climb and
swell from short to long, a fact which renders them
superior to the <hi rend="italics">choreus,</hi> which sinks from long to
short.<milestone unit="section" n="137"/> Subdued passages, such as occur in the
<hi rend="italics">peroration,</hi> also require slow syllables, which must,
however, be less sonorous.</p>
<p>Celsus insists that there is a special form of rhythmical structure which produces a particularly stately
effect: I do not know to what he refers and, if I did,
should not teach it, since it must inevitably be slow
and flat, that is to say unless this quality is derived
from the words and thoughts expressed. If it is to
be sought for its own sake, independent of such
considerations, I cannot sufficiently condemn it.
But, to bring this discussion to a close,<milestone unit="section" n="138"/> I would
remark that our rhythm must be designed to suit
our delivery. Is not our tone subdued as a rule in
the <hi rend="italics">exordium,</hi> except of course in cases of accusation
where we have to rouse the judge or fill him with
indignation, full and clear in the <hi rend="italics">statement of</hi> fact,
in argument impetuous and rapid not merely in our
language, but in our motions as well, expansive and
fluent in <hi rend="italics">commonplaces</hi> and descriptions and, as a rule,
submissive and downcast in the <hi rend="italics">peroration?</hi><milestone unit="section" n="139"/> But the
motions of the body also have their own appropriate
rhythms, while the musical theory of rhythm determines the value of metrical feet no less for dancing
than for tunes. Again, do we not adapt our voice
and gesture to the nature of the themes on which

<pb id="p.587"/>

we are speaking? There is, therefore, all the less
reason for wonder that the same is true of the feet
employed in prose, since it is natural that what is
sublime should have a stately stride, that what is
gentle should seem to be led along, that what
is violent should seem to run and what is tender to
flow.<milestone unit="section" n="140"/> Consequently, where necessary, we must
borrow the pompous effect produced by the <hi rend="italics">spondees</hi>
and <hi rend="italics">iambi</hi> which compose the greater portion of the
rhythms of tragedy, as in the line,

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>En, impero Argis, sceptra mi liquit Pelops.</l></quote> <bibl> From an unknown tragedian. <note><quote>Lo, I am lord at Argos,
where to me I Pelops the sceptre left.</quote></note></bibl></cit></quote>

But the comic senarius, styled <hi rend="italics">trochaic,</hi> contains a
number of <hi rend="italics">pyrrhics</hi> and <hi rend="italics">trochees,</hi> which others call
<hi rend="italics">tribrachs,</hi> but loses in dignity what it gains in speed,<milestone unit="section" n="141"/>
as for example in the line,

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>quid igiturfaciam? non earn, ne nunc quidem?</l></quote> <bibl><hi rend="italics">Ter. Eun.</hi> I. i. 1. <note><quote>What shall I do then? Not go even
now?</quote></note> The <hi rend="italics">pyrrhic</hi> never forms a separate foot, but does
form part of the <hi rend="italics">anapaest, tribrach</hi> and <hi rend="italics">dactyl</hi> and it is in this
connexion that it is mentioned by Quintilian.</bibl></cit></quote>

Violent and abusive language, on the other hand,
even in verse, as I have said, employs the <hi rend="italics">iambic</hi> for
its attack: <hi rend="italics">e.g.,</hi>

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>Quis hoc potest videre, quis potest pati,</l>
<l>nisi impudicus et vorax et aleo?</l></quote> <bibl> Cat. xxix. 1. <note><quote>Who save a lecherous gambling glutton
can endure to gaze on such a sight as this</quote></note></bibl></cit></quote>

As a general rule, however,<milestone unit="section" n="142"/> if the choice were forced
upon me, I should prefer my rhythm to be harsh and
violent rather than nerveless and effeminate, as it is
in so many writers, more especially in our own day,
when it trips along in wanton measures that suggest
the accompaniment of castanets. Nor will any
rhythm ever be so admirable that it ought to be

<pb id="p.589"/>

continued with the same recurrence of feet.<milestone unit="section" n="143"/> For we
shall really be indulging in a species of versification
if we seek to lay down one law for all varieties of
speech: further, to do so would lay us open to the
charge of the most obvious affectation, a fault of
which we should avoid even the smallest suspicion,
while we should also weary and cloy our audience by
the resulting monotony; the sweeter the rhythm,
the sooner the orator who is detected in a studied
adherence to its employment, will cease to carry
conviction or to stir the passions and emotions. The
judge will refuse to believe him or to allow him to
excite his compassion or his anger, if he thinks that
he has leisure for this species of refinement.<milestone unit="section" n="144"/> It will
therefore be desirable from time to time that in
certain passages the rhythm should be deliberately
dissolved: this is a task of no small difficulty, if the
appearance of effort is to be avoided. In so doing
we must not come to the assistance of the rhythm
by introducing <hi rend="italics">bhyperhata</hi><note>Transpositions. See VII. vi. 62.</note> of extravagant length, for
fear that we should betray the purpose of our action:
and we should certainly never in our search for
smoothness abandon for another any word that is
apt and appropriate to our theme.<milestone unit="section" n="145"/> As a matter of
fact no word will be so intractable as to baffle all our
attempts to find it a suitable position; but it must
be remembered that when we avoid such words, we
do so not to enhance the charm of our rhythm, but
to evade a difficulty. I am not, however, surprised
that Latin writers have paid more attention to
rhythmical structure than the Athenians, since Latin
words possess less correctness and charm.<milestone unit="section" n="146"/> Nor again
do I account it a fault in Cicero that, in this respect,
he diverged to some extent from the practice of

<pb id="p.591"/>

Demosthenes. However, my final book will explain
the nature of the difference between our language
and that of Greece.</p>
<p>But I must bring this book to a conclusion without
more delay, since it has already exceeded the limits
designed for it. To sum up then, artistic structure
must be decorous, pleasing and varied.<milestone unit="section" n="147"/> It consists
of three parts, order, connexion and rhythm. The
method of its achievement lies in addition, subtraction
and alteration of words. Its practice will depend
upon the nature of our theme. The care which it
demands is great, but, still, less than that demanded
by expression and thought. Above all it is necessary
to conceal the care expended upon it so that our
rhythms may seem to possess a spontaneous flow, not
to have been the result of elaborate search or
compulsion.</p>
